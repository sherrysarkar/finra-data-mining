United  National  Insurance\r                    TORRUELLA,  Chief  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\nCompany  (\"United   National\")  brought   this  suit   seeking  a\r\n\ndeclaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Penuche's,\r\n\nInc.  (\"Penuche's\"), and its  president, Todd Tousley,  in a tort\r\n\naction brought by a Penuche's Ale House patron, Thomas Burke.  At\r\n\nPenuche's, Burke  was involved  in an  altercation which  Tousley\r\n\nattempted to break up.  In so doing, Tousley caused Burke to fall\r\n\nbackward,  injuring his spine.   Among other  contentions, United\r\n\nNational  claims that under New  Hampshire law it  has no duty to\r\n\nindemnify Penuche's or Tousley for  this claim because its multi-\r\n\nperil  insurance  policy  contains an  exclusion  for  any claims\r\n\n\"arising out  of an  assault and/or battery.\"   We  reject United\r\n\nNational's arguments  and affirm  the district  court's award  of\r\n\nsummary  judgment to  Penuche's  and  Tousley, but  we  do so  on\r\n\ndifferent grounds than decided by that court.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          The facts in this case  are essentially undisputed.  On\r\n\nOctober  4, 1995, Burke was in Penuche's  Ale House in Keene, New\r\n\nHampshire.  An altercation ensued between two men, and Burke left\r\n\nhis table to attempt to calm them down.  Afterwards, as he turned\r\n\nhis back to return to  his table, he was  attacked by one of  the\r\n\nmen with a barrage  of punches to the side and  back of his head.\r\n\nAs  he  turned  around  to  face his  assailant,  he  observed  a\r\n\nPenuche's employee, Tousley, coming toward him to stop the fight.\r\n\nTousley grabbed Burke  in a \"bear  hug,\" pinning his arms  to his\r\n\nsides  in  an apparent  attempt  to  immobilize him  and  prevent\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nfurther fighting.   Tousley's momentum, however, caused  Burke to\r\n\nfall backwards,  striking various obstructions  as he fell.   The\r\n\nfall left Burke with a severe spinal cord injury.\r\n\n          Burke sued  Tousley and  Penuche's in  a New  Hampshire\r\n\ncourt,  alleging  that  his  injuries  resulted   from  Tousley's\r\n\nnegligence in carelessly intercepting and restraining him.  Burke\r\n\nfurther   claimed  that  Penuche's  is  liable  under  respondeat\r                                                                           \r\n\nsuperior,  and \"actively  negligent\" insofar  as  slippery and/or\r                  \r\n\ncluttered  premises proximately caused  his injuries.   After the\r\n\ncommencement of  the state  court action,  Tousley and  Penuche's\r\n\ndemanded that  United National  provide coverage  and defense  of\r\n\nBurke's claims under a multi-peril insurance policy held by \"Todd\r\n\nTousley DBA  Penuche's  Ale House.\"   United  National agreed  to\r\n\nprovide a  defense subject to  a reservation of  rights, claiming\r\n\nthat  an exclusion  in its  policy relieves  it of  any indemnity\r\n\nobligation.   It  subsequently  sued  Penuche's  and  Tousley  in\r\n\nfederal  district court under diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1332, seeking a declaratory judgment to this effect.\r\n\n          Penuche's policy requires United National to defend and\r\n\nindemnify it  against claims  asserting bodily  injury caused  by\r\n\n\"occurrence[s] . . . arising out of the ownership, maintenance or\r\n\nuse of  the  insured premises.\"   United  National contends  that\r\n\n\"exclusions\" take  away coverage  that would  otherwise apply  to\r\n\nthis case under this broad \"coverage\" provision.\r\n\n          One of the policy provisions excludes coverage for:\r\n\n          claims  arising  out  of  an  assault  and/or\r\n          battery,   whether  caused   by  or   at  the\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          instigation of,  or at  the direction of,  or\r\n          omission   by,   the  Insured,   and/or   his\r\n          employees.  \r\n\nThis is  the \"assault  and battery\" exclusion  at issue.   United\r\n\nNational  also requests  a limited  declaration  that insofar  as\r\n\nBurke's claims arise out  of Penuche's negligent sale or  service\r\n\nof  alcoholic beverages,  coverage  is  precluded  by  a  \"liquor\r\n\nliability\" exclusion.\r\n\n          The  district   court  found  that   neither  exclusion\r\n\nprecluded coverage for  the underlying suit.   The court  awarded\r\n\nsummary  judgment  for  Penuche's and  Tousley,  ordering  United\r\n\nNational to  defend and indemnify  the claims.   United  National\r\n\nappeals this award,  asking for declaratory judgments  under both\r\n\nexclusions and  further  arguing that  it was  premature for  the\r\n\ndistrict court to order it to indemnify the underlying claims, as\r\n\nopposed to merely ordering a defense of those claims.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          We review de  novo a district court's  grant of summary\r                                      \r\n\njudgment.  Pine  Tree Medical Associates  v. Secretary of  Health\r                                                                           \r\n\nand Human  Services,    F.3d   , 1997 WL  563587 at *2, (1st Cir.\r                             \r\n\n1997).\r\n\nI.  The Assault and Battery Exclusion\r          I.  The Assault and Battery Exclusion\r\n\n          United  National  claims   that  coverage  for  Burke's\r\n\ninjuries is excluded because they  \"arose out of\" two assault and\r\n\nbatteries:  first Burke was attacked by another Penuche's patron;\r\n\nand  then he  was manhandled  by Tousley,  who was  attempting to\r\n\nbreak up the  fighting.  United National argues  that the assault\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nand battery exclusion  applies if the claims arose  out of either\r\n\nor both of these incidents.\r\n\n          A.  The Fight\r                    A.  The Fight\r\n\n          It is not disputed that  Burke was battered by  another\r\n\npatron of Penuche's on October 4, 1995.  However, the assault and\r\n\nbattery exclusion is only  implicated by this fight  if batteries\r\n\nby customers were a type of battery excluded by the contract, and\r\n\nif Burke's injuries could fairly  be said to \"arise out of\"  this\r\n\npatron's attack. \r\n\n          The policy excludes  \"claims arising out of  an assault\r\n\nand/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at\r                                 \r\n\nthe  direction  of, or  omission  by,  the  Insured,  and/or  his\r\n\nemployees.\" (emphasis added).  Tousley claims that this exclusion\r\n\nis inapplicable to  any claims arising out of  the patrons' fight\r\n\nbecause its terms  only exclude coverage  for assaults caused  by\r\n\nacts or  omissions of employees.   In other words,  Tousley reads\r\n\nthe examples following the word  \"whether\" as an exhaustive list.\r\n\nHe argues that,  at the very least, this  provision is ambiguous,\r\n\nand that under New Hampshire  law this ambiguity must be resolved\r\n\nagainst United National.   See Hoepp v. State Farm  Ins. Co., 697\r                                                                      \r\n\nA.2d 943, 945 (N.H. 1997).  These arguments fail.\r\n\n          An insurance  policy's language  \"must be accorded  its\r\n\nnatural and ordinary meaning.\"  Coakley v. Maine Bonding and Cas.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  618 A.2d  777, 781  (N.H.  1992) (quoting  Trombly v.  Blue\r                                                                           \r\n\nCross/Blue Shield,  423 A.2d  980, 984 (N.H.  1980)).   Tousley's\r                           \r\n\nposition either  reads the  word \"whether\"  out of  the exclusion\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncompletely, or  gives it  a meaning identical  to the  word \"if.\"\r\n\nThis interpretation runs against the commonly accepted meaning of\r\n\nthe  word \"whether\"  in this context.   If  one hears,  \"the post\r\n\noffice will deliver your mail, whether it is raining or snowing,\"\r\n\none will  not take this  to mean that  mail is only  delivered in\r\n\ninclement weather.   Similarly, where this policy  lists specific\r\n\ntypes  of  excluded   assaults  and  batteries  after   the  word\r\n\n\"whether,\" it does  not follow that other  assaults and batteries\r\n\nare  not excluded.    Our  interpretation  of this  exclusion  is\r\n\nconsistent with the  only other court that we have  found to have\r\n\naddressed this  question.  In  United Nat'l Ins. Co.  v. Horning,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLtd., 882 F. Supp. 310  (W.D.N.Y. 1995), United National sought a\r              \r\n\ndeclaratory judgment  under an  identical exclusion  in a  liquor\r\n\nliability policy.   Horning involved an action brought  by a rape\r                                     \r\n\nvictim  against  a  drinking  establishment  and  bartenders  for\r\n\nserving  her attacker  even though  he  was under  the influence.\r\n\nRejecting a reading of the clause identical to that proposed here\r\n\nby   Tousley,  the  district  court  held  that  \"[t]he  specific\r\n\ninstances  identified  in the  clause  are  simply not  meant  to\r\n\nprovide an  exhaustive list of  the conduct  contemplated by  the\r\n\nexclusion.\"  Id. at 314.  We agree.\r                          \r\n\n          Furthermore,  if   Burke  is   trying  to  hold   these\r\n\ndefendants liable  for the actions  of a customer, his  theory of\r\n\nliability  must  necessarily follow  from an  act or  omission of\r\n\nPenuche's or its employees.  See, e.g., United Nat'l Ins.  Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nWaterfront New York Realty Corp.,  994 F.2d 105, 109-110 (2d Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n1993) citing  United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. The Tunnel, Inc., 988 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n351, 354 (2d Cir. 1993) (identical assault and  battery exclusion\r\n\ncannot be read to exclude only more \"direct\" acts or omissions of\r\n\nemployees as opposed to more \"remote acts  of negligence\" leading\r\n\nto assaults  and batteries).  Therefore, the exclusion applies to\r\n\nthe fight in this case, and the district court erred in  adopting\r\n\nPenuche's limited interpretation of this clause.\r\n\n          Even  if the  policy  exclusion  covers  this  type  of\r\n\nbattery, however, the  exclusion only precludes recovery  in this\r\n\ncase if  Burke's injuries also can be said  to \"arise out of\" the\r\n\nfight.  Under New Hampshire law, \"arising out of\" is a very broad\r\n\nterm  meaning  \"originating from  or  growing out  of  or flowing\r\n\nfrom.\"  Winnacunnet Coop. Sch.  Dist. v.

See Cannon v. Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., 639 A.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n270, 271  (N.H. 1994); Akerley  v. Hartford Ins.

While\r\n\nthis  argument  has  some  plausibility,  we  hold  that  Burke's\r\n\ninjuries cannot  be said  to \"arise out  of\" the  initial attack.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nThe  spinal injury  occurred when  Tousley's \"bear  hug\" and  his\r\n\nmomentum from  hurrying over  to stop the  fight caused  Burke to\r\n\nfall backward,  into a  table and  onto the  floor.   All of  the\r\n\ndamages in this tort action  stem from a discrete intervening act\r\n\nof alleged negligence, and this claim cannot be said to arise out\r\n\nof earlier actions.  Tousley had a completely different objective\r\n\nfrom  the brawling patron, and Burke's eventual injuries were not\r\n\ncaused by the blows he  received in the fight.  See  Winnacunnet,\r                                                                          \r\n\n84 F.3d at 38 (observing  that assault and battery exclusions are\r\n\nintended to preclude coverage of  claims where such excluded acts\r\n\nimmediately cause  the injury).   This is not  a case in  which a\r                     \r\n\nbartender or  bouncer joined sides  in a donnybrook.   The injury\r\n\ncaused by the employee in this case arose entirely out of his own\r\n\nactions.\r\n\n          The district  court's conclusion  that the assault  and\r\n\nbattery exclusion  is inapplicable  to the fight  is affirmed  on\r\n\nthese alternate  grounds.

The \"Bear Hug\"\r\n\n          Having  disposed  of  United National's  argument  that\r\n\nBurke's  fight  precludes  coverage,  the  applicability  of  the\r\n\nassault and battery exclusion hinges on whether Tousley's attempt\r\n\nto  break up  the fight  itself constituted  a \"battery.\"   Since\r\n\nthere is no definition of \"battery\" in the policy, we look to the\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncommon law definition of the  term.  According to the Restatement\r\n\n(Second) of Torts, an actor is liable to another for battery if:\r\n\n            (a) he acts intending  to cause a harmful\r\n            or offensive  contact with the  person of\r\n            the  other  or  a  third  person,  or  an\r\n            imminent apprehension of  such a contact,\r\n            and\r\n            (b) a harmful contact  with the person of\r\n            the other directly or indirectly results.\r\n\nRestatement  (Second) of  Torts    13  (1977).   As both  parties\r\n\nacknowledge in their  briefs, the disputed issue  here is whether\r\n\nTousley had the requisite intent to cause an \"offensive\"  contact\r\n\nwith Burke.1\r\n\n          United National refers this Court to section 19  of the\r\n\nRestatement (Second),  which  provides that  \"bodily  contact  is\r\n\noffensive if it offends a  reasonable person's sense of  personal\r\n\ndignity.\"  It argues  that Tousley's protective \"bear hug\"  would\r\n\noffend  a reasonable  person's sense  of dignity.   We  find this\r\n\nargument unpersuasive.\r\n\n          Burke testified at his deposition that, from the moment\r\n\nhe saw Tousley  about to  grab him, he  understood Tousley to  be\r\n\nacting in a  peacekeeping role.  No reasonable  person would feel\r\n\ntheir personal dignity offended by a bartender trying  to prevent\r\n\nfighting in his establishment.  This would be a different case if\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   To  commit an  \"assault\"  under the  Restatement (Second)  of\r\nTorts, the actor must intend to cause an imminent apprehension in\r\nanother  person of  harmful or  offensive  contact.   Restatement\r\n(Second)  of Torts    21 (1977).  Because,  under the common law,\r\nthe  intent element of  \"battery\" subsumes the  intent element of\r\n\"assault,\" and because  neither party argues that  Tousley's bear\r\nhug constituted  an \"assault\"  rather than  a \"battery,\"  it will\r\nsuffice to inquire whether Tousley committed a battery.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nTousley had hit  or pushed Burke, however, it  is undisputed that\r\n\nTousley was merely attempting to keep Burke out of harm's way.\r\n\n          Professor  Prosser   offered  a   helpful  example   to\r\n\ndistinguish between the intentional battery and negligence:  \r\n\n            If  an automobile driver  runs down a man\r\n            in the street before him, with the desire\r\n            to hit him, or with the belief that he is\r\n            certain to  do so,  it is  an intentional\r\n            battery;  but if he has no such desire or\r\n            belief, but  merely acts  unreasonably in\r\n            failing to  guard against a risk which he\r\n            should appreciate, it is negligence.\r\n\nProsser, Law of Torts, section 31 at 145 (4th ed. 1971).  In this\r\n\ncase,  Tousley's actions  were  negligent  at  most,  and  United\r\n\nNational's \"offending dignity\" argument is unavailing.   \r\n\nII.  The Liquor Liability Exclusion\r          II.  The Liquor Liability Exclusion\r\n\n          United National also seeks a declaratory judgment that,\r\n\nto  the extent that Burke's claims arise out of Penuche's sale or\r\n\nservice  of alcoholic  beverages,  coverage  is  precluded  by  a\r\n\n\"liquor liability\"  exclusion.   This exclusion  bars claims  for\r\n\n\"bodily injury or  property damages for which the  insured or his\r\n\nindemnitee may be held liable .  . . as a person or  organization\r\n\nengaged in  the business of manufacturing,  distributing, selling\r\n\nor serving alcoholic  beverages.\"  However, in his  Memorandum in\r\n\nSupport of Motion  for Summary Judgment, Burke  admitted \"[t]here\r\n\nis no allegation  or evidence that Tousley or  Penuche's would be\r\n\nliable  for bodily  injury by  reason  of the  'violation of  any\r\n\nstatute,  ordinance  or  regulation' pertaining  to  the  sale of\r\n\nalcohol.\"   In  the face  of this  concession,  United National's\r\n\nrequest for a declaration on its \"liquor  liability\" exclusion is\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nsuperfluous.     Under  no  reasonable  construction  of  Burke's\r\n\ncomplaint  is Penuche's  being  sued  for negligently  furnishing\r\n\nalcoholic beverages.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nIII.  The Court Order to Indemnify the Insured\r          III.  The Court Order to Indemnify the Insured\r\n\n          Finally,  United  National  argues  that  even  if  the\r\n\nexclusions  do not  apply to  Burke's tort  claims,  the district\r\n\ncourt  acted prematurely  when  it  ordered  United  National  to\r\n\nindemnify the  insured before  a trial.    The insurance  company\r\n\nargues  that  \"[i]t  is  currently  unknown  precisely  what  the\r\n\nevidence will be concerning the encounter,\" and that it was error\r\n\nto \"assume that  the evidence will be as it has been presented in\r\n\ndiscovery.\"   This argument lacks  any support in  law.  The  New\r\n\nHampshire Supreme  Court, as  a matter  of course,  affirms court\r\n\norders to  indemnify that  are issued before  trial.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nTrefethen  v. New  Hampshire Ins.  Group, 645  A.2d 72,  75 (N.H.\r                                                  \r\n\n1994)  (affirming declaratory judgment  that insurer had  duty to\r\n\ndefend  and  indemnify  claims); White  Mountain  Constr.  Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTransamerica Ins. Co., 631 A.2d 907, 910 (N.H. 1993) (same).  \r                               \r\n\n          If Burke prevails at trial, and we have determined that\r\n\nno exclusions in the policy  apply, United National simply cannot\r\n\navoid its obligation.  Federal courts cannot limit their  rulings\r\n\nin  anticipation of potential  surprise revelations during trial.\r\n\nIf,  in fact,  some  heretofore unanticipated  development during\r\n\ntrial negates the rationale of this or any judgment, the affected\r\n\nparty may  file a Motion  for Relief  From Judgment  or Order  in\r\n\naccordance  with  Rule  60(b)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil\r\n\nProcedure.  However, we will  not refrain from affirming an order\r\n\nawarding indemnification for insurance claims on summary judgment\r\n\nwhereallavailablefactsandlawindicatethatsuchanorderisappropriate.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n          For  the reasons  stated herein,  the  district court's\r\n\naward  for  summary  judgment  and  order  for  the  defense  and\r\n\nindemnification of Thomas Burke's claims is affirmed. \r                                                              \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n",

(\"Penuche's\"), and its president, Todd Tousley, in a tort action brought by a Penuche's Ale House patron, Thomas Burke.  At Penuche's, Burke was involved in an altercation which Tousley attempted to break up.  In so doing, Tousley caused Burke to fall backward, injuring his spine.  Among other contentions, United National claims that under New Hampshire law it has no duty to indemnify Penuche's or Tousley for this claim because its multi-peril insurance policy contains an exclusion for any claims \"arising out of an assault and/or battery.\"   We reject United National's arguments and affirm the district court's award of summary judgment to Penuche's and Tousley, but we do so on different grounds than decided by that court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in this case are essentially undisputed.  On October 4, 1995, Burke was in Penuche's Ale House in Keene, New Hampshire.  An altercation ensued between two men, and Burke left his table to attempt to calm them down.  Afterwards, as he turned his back to return to his table, he was attacked by one of the men with a barrage of punches to the side and back of his head.  As he turned around to face his assailant, he observed a Penuche's employee, Tousley, coming toward him to stop the fight.  Tousley grabbed Burke in a \"bear hug,\" pinning his arms to his sides in an apparent attempt to immobilize him and prevent further fighting.  Tousley's momentum, however, caused Burke to fall backwards, striking various obstructions as he fell.  The fall left Burke with a severe spinal cord injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke sued Tousley and Penuche's in a New Hampshire court, alleging that his injuries resulted from Tousley's negligence in carelessly intercepting and restraining him.  Burke further claimed that Penuche's is liable under respondeat superior, and \"actively negligent\" insofar as slippery and/or cluttered premises proximately caused his injuries.  After the commencement of the state court action, Tousley and Penuche's demanded that United National provide coverage and defense of Burke's claims under a multi-peril insurance policy held by \"Todd Tousley DBA Penuche's Ale House.\"   United National agreed to provide a defense subject to a reservation of rights, claiming that an exclusion in its policy relieves it of any indemnity obligation.  It subsequently sued Penuche's and Tousley in federal district court under diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, seeking a declaratory judgment to this effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Penuche's policy requires United National to defend and indemnify it against claims asserting bodily injury caused by \"occurrence[s] ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the insured premises.\"   United National contends that \"exclusions\" take away coverage that would otherwise apply to this case under this broad \"coverage\" provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the policy provisions excludes coverage for:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>claims arising out of an assault and/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of, or omission by, the Insured, and/or his employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the \"assault and battery\" exclusion at issue.  United National also requests a limited declaration that insofar as Burke's claims arise out of Penuche's negligent sale or service of alcoholic beverages, coverage is precluded by a \"liquor liability\" exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that neither exclusion precluded coverage for the underlying suit.  The court awarded summary judgment for Penuche's and Tousley, ordering United National to defend and indemnify the claims.  United National appeals this award, asking for declaratory judgments under both exclusions and further arguing that it was premature for the district court to order it to indemnify the underlying claims, as opposed to merely ordering a defense of those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment.  Pine Tree Medical Associates v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 127 F.3d 118, 120-21 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. The Assault and Battery Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National claims that coverage for Burke's injuries is excluded because they \"arose out of\" two assault and batteries:  first Burke was attacked by another Penuche's patron;  and then he was manhandled by Tousley, who was attempting to break up the fighting.  United National argues that the assault and battery exclusion applies if the claims arose out of either or both of these incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Fight</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not disputed that Burke was battered by another patron of Penuche's on October 4, 1995.  However, the assault and battery exclusion is only implicated by this fight if batteries by customers were a type of battery excluded by the contract, and if Burke's injuries could fairly be said to \"arise out of\" this patron's attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy excludes \"claims arising out of an assault and/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of, or omission by, the Insured, and/or his employees.\"  (emphasis added).  Tousley claims that this exclusion is inapplicable to any claims arising out of the patrons' fight because its terms only exclude coverage for assaults caused by acts or omissions of employees.  In other words, Tousley reads the examples following the word \"whether\" as an exhaustive list.  He argues that, at the very least, this provision is ambiguous, and that under New Hampshire law this ambiguity must be resolved against United National.  See Hoepp v. State Farm Ins. Co., 697 A.2d 943, 945 (N.H.1997).  These arguments fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An insurance policy's language \"must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning.\"  Coakley v. Maine Bonding and Cas. Co., 136 N.H. 402, 618 A.2d 777, 781 (1992) (quoting Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 120 N.H. 764, 423 A.2d 980, 984 (1980)).  Tousley's position either reads the word \"whether\" out of the exclusion completely, or gives it a meaning identical to the word \"if.\"   This interpretation runs against the commonly accepted meaning of the word \"whether\" in this context.  If one hears, \"the post office will deliver your mail, whether it is raining or snowing,\" one will not take this to mean that mail is only delivered in inclement weather.  Similarly, where this policy lists specific types of excluded assaults and batteries after the word \"whether,\" it does not follow that other assaults and batteries are not excluded.  Our interpretation of this exclusion is consistent with the only other court that we have found to have addressed this question.  In United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Horning, Ltd., 882 F.Supp. 310 (W.D.N.Y.1995), United National sought a declaratory judgment under an identical exclusion in a liquor liability policy.  Horning involved an action brought by a rape victim against a drinking establishment and bartenders for serving her attacker even though he was under the influence.  Rejecting a reading of the clause identical to that proposed here by Tousley, the district court held that \"[t]he specific instances identified in the clause are simply not meant to provide an exhaustive list of the conduct contemplated by the exclusion.\"  Id. at 314.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, if Burke is trying to hold these defendants liable for the actions of a customer, his theory of liability must necessarily follow from an act or omission of Penuche's or its employees.  See, e.g., United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Waterfront New York Realty Corp., 994 F.2d 105, 109-110 (2d Cir.1993) citing United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. The Tunnel, Inc., 988 F.2d 351, 354 (2d Cir.1993) (identical assault and battery exclusion cannot be read to exclude only more \"direct\" acts or omissions of employees as opposed to more \"remote acts of negligence\" leading to assaults and batteries).  Therefore, the exclusion applies to the fight in this case, and the district court erred in adopting Penuche's limited interpretation of this clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the policy exclusion covers this type of battery, however, the exclusion only precludes recovery in this case if Burke's injuries also can be said to \"arise out of\" the fight.  Under New Hampshire law, \"arising out of\" is a very broad term meaning \"originating from or growing out of or flowing from.\"  Winnacunnet Coop.  Sch. Dist. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 84 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.1996) (citing Merrimack Sch. Dist. v. National Sch. Bus Serv., Inc., 140 N.H. 9, 661 A.2d 1197, 1199 (1995) (quoting Carter v. Bergeron, 102 N.H. 464, 160 A.2d 348, 353 (1960))).  While the concept of \"arising out of\" is broader than proximate causation, it is not so broad as to encompass a \"tenuous\" connection.  See Cannon v. Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., 138 N.H. 365, 639 A.2d 270, 271 (1994);  Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, 136 N.H. 433, 616 A.2d 511, 515 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National argues that Burke's injuries arose out of the altercation with the other patron insofar as that altercation necessitated Tousley's doomed intervention.  While this argument has some plausibility, we hold that Burke's injuries cannot be said to \"arise out of\" the initial attack.  The spinal injury occurred when Tousley's \"bear hug\" and his momentum from hurrying over to stop the fight caused Burke to fall backward, into a table and onto the floor.  All of the damages in this tort action stem from a discrete intervening act of alleged negligence, and this claim cannot be said to arise out of earlier actions.  Tousley had a completely different objective from the brawling patron, and Burke's eventual injuries were not caused by the blows he received in the fight.  See Winnacunnet, 84 F.3d at 38 (observing that assault and battery exclusions are intended to preclude coverage of claims where such excluded acts immediately cause the injury).  This is not a case in which a bartender or bouncer joined sides in a donnybrook.  The injury caused by the employee in this case arose entirely out of his own actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion that the assault and battery exclusion is inapplicable to the fight is affirmed on these alternate grounds.  See Frillz, Inc. v. Lader, 104 F.3d 515, 516 (1st Cir.1997) (reviewing court is not bound by the rationale of the lower court on summary judgment, but may affirm \"on any alternative ground made manifest by the record\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The \"Bear Hug\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of United National's argument that Burke's fight precludes coverage, the applicability of the assault and battery exclusion hinges on whether Tousley's attempt to break up the fight itself constituted a \"battery.\"   Since there is no definition of \"battery\" in the policy, we look to the common law definition of the term.  According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, an actor is liable to another for battery if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or a third person, or an imminent apprehension of such a contact, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(b) a harmful contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 13 (1977).  As both parties acknowledge in their briefs, the disputed issue here is whether Tousley had the requisite intent to cause an \"offensive\" contact with Burke.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National refers this Court to section 19 of the Restatement (Second), which provides that \"bodily contact is offensive if it offends a reasonable person's sense of personal dignity.\"   It argues that Tousley's protective \"bear hug\" would offend a reasonable person's sense of dignity.  We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke testified at his deposition that, from the moment he saw Tousley about to grab him, he understood Tousley to be acting in a peacekeeping role.  No reasonable person would feel their personal dignity offended by a bartender trying to prevent fighting in his establishment.

The Liquor Liability Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National also seeks a declaratory judgment that, to the extent that Burke's claims arise out of Penuche's sale or service of alcoholic beverages, coverage is precluded by a \"liquor liability\" exclusion.  This exclusion bars claims for \"bodily injury or property damages for which the insured or his indemnitee may be held liable ... as a person or organization engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing, selling or serving alcoholic beverages.\"   However, in his Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Burke admitted \"[t]here is no allegation or evidence that Tousley or Penuche's would be liable for bodily injury by reason of the 'violation of any statute, ordinance or regulation' pertaining to the sale of alcohol.\"   In the face of this concession, United National's request for a declaration on its \"liquor liability\" exclusion is superfluous.  Under no reasonable construction of Burke's complaint is Penuche's being sued for negligently furnishing alcoholic beverages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Court Order to Indemnify the Insured</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, United National argues that even if the exclusions do not apply to Burke's tort claims, the district court acted prematurely when it ordered United National to indemnify the insured before a trial.  The insurance company argues that \"[i]t is currently unknown precisely what the evidence will be concerning the encounter,\" and that it was error to \"assume that the evidence will be as it has been presented in discovery.\"   This argument lacks any support in law.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court, as a matter of course, affirms court orders to indemnify that are issued before trial.  See, e.g., Trefethen v. New Hampshire Ins. Group, 138 N.H. 710, 645 A.2d 72, 75 (1994) (affirming declaratory judgment that insurer had duty to defend and indemnify claims);  White Mountain Constr.  Co. v. Transamerica Ins.

Federal courts cannot limit their rulings in anticipation of potential surprise revelations during trial.  If, in fact, some heretofore unanticipated development during trial negates the rationale of this or any judgment, the affected party may file a Motion for Relief From Judgment or Order in accordance with Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  However, we will not refrain from affirming an order awarding indemnification for insurance claims on summary judgment where all available facts and law indicate that such an order is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, the district court's award for summary judgment and order for the defense and indemnification of Thomas Burke's claims is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To commit an \"assault\" under the Restatement (Second) of Torts, the actor must intend to cause an imminent apprehension in another person of harmful or offensive contact.

(\"Penuche's\"), and its president, Todd Tousley, in a tort action brought by a Penuche's Ale House patron, Thomas Burke.  At Penuche's, Burke was involved in an altercation which Tousley attempted to break up.  In so doing, Tousley caused Burke to fall backward, injuring his spine.  Among other contentions, United National claims that under New Hampshire law it has no duty to indemnify Penuche's or Tousley for this claim because its multi-peril insurance policy contains an exclusion for any claims \"arising out of an assault and/or battery.\"   We reject United National's arguments and affirm the district court's award of summary judgment to Penuche's and Tousley, but we do so on different grounds than decided by that court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in this case are essentially undisputed.  On October 4, 1995, Burke was in Penuche's Ale House in Keene, New Hampshire.  An altercation ensued between two men, and Burke left his table to attempt to calm them down.  Afterwards, as he turned his back to return to his table, he was attacked by one of the men with a barrage of punches to the side and back of his head.  As he turned around to face his assailant, he observed a Penuche's employee, Tousley, coming toward him to stop the fight.  Tousley grabbed Burke in a \"bear hug,\" pinning his arms to his sides in an apparent attempt to immobilize him and prevent further fighting.  Tousley's momentum, however, caused Burke to fall backwards, striking various obstructions as he fell.  The fall left Burke with a severe spinal cord injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke sued Tousley and Penuche's in a New Hampshire court, alleging that his injuries resulted from Tousley's negligence in carelessly intercepting and restraining him.  Burke further claimed that Penuche's is liable under respondeat superior, and \"actively negligent\" insofar as slippery and/or cluttered premises proximately caused his injuries.  After the commencement of the state court action, Tousley and Penuche's demanded that United National provide coverage and defense of Burke's claims under a multi-peril insurance policy held by \"Todd Tousley DBA Penuche's Ale House.\"   United National agreed to provide a defense subject to a reservation of rights, claiming that an exclusion in its policy relieves it of any indemnity obligation.  It subsequently sued Penuche's and Tousley in federal district court under diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, seeking a declaratory judgment to this effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Penuche's policy requires United National to defend and indemnify it against claims asserting bodily injury caused by \"occurrence[s] ... arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the insured premises.\"   United National contends that \"exclusions\" take away coverage that would otherwise apply to this case under this broad \"coverage\" provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the policy provisions excludes coverage for:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>claims arising out of an assault and/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of, or omission by, the Insured, and/or his employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the \"assault and battery\" exclusion at issue.

The court awarded summary judgment for Penuche's and Tousley, ordering United National to defend and indemnify the claims.  United National appeals this award, asking for declaratory judgments under both exclusions and further arguing that it was premature for the district court to order it to indemnify the underlying claims, as opposed to merely ordering a defense of those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment.

The Assault and Battery Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National claims that coverage for Burke's injuries is excluded because they \"arose out of\" two assault and batteries:  first Burke was attacked by another Penuche's patron;  and then he was manhandled by Tousley, who was attempting to break up the fighting.  United National argues that the assault and battery exclusion applies if the claims arose out of either or both of these incidents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Fight</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not disputed that Burke was battered by another patron of Penuche's on October 4, 1995.  However, the assault and battery exclusion is only implicated by this fight if batteries by customers were a type of battery excluded by the contract, and if Burke's injuries could fairly be said to \"arise out of\" this patron's attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy excludes \"claims arising out of an assault and/or battery, whether caused by or at the instigation of, or at the direction of, or omission by, the Insured, and/or his employees.\"  (emphasis added).  Tousley claims that this exclusion is inapplicable to any claims arising out of the patrons' fight because its terms only exclude coverage for assaults caused by acts or omissions of employees.  In other words, Tousley reads the examples following the word \"whether\" as an exhaustive list.  He argues that, at the very least, this provision is ambiguous, and that under New Hampshire law this ambiguity must be resolved against United National.  See Hoepp v. State Farm Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></span>, 945 (N.H.1997).

Tousley's position either reads the word \"whether\" out of the exclusion completely, or gives it a meaning identical to the word \"if.\"   This interpretation runs against the commonly accepted meaning of the word \"whether\" in this context.  If one hears, \"the post office will deliver your mail, whether it is raining or snowing,\" one will not take this to mean that mail is only delivered in inclement weather.  Similarly, where this policy lists specific types of excluded assaults and batteries after the word \"whether,\" it does not follow that other assaults and batteries are not excluded.  Our interpretation of this exclusion is consistent with the only other court that we have found to have addressed this question.  In United Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Horning, Ltd., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span> (W.D.N.Y.1995), United National sought a declaratory judgment under an identical exclusion in a liquor liability policy.  Horning involved an action brought by a rape victim against a drinking establishment and bartenders for serving her attacker even though he was under the influence.  Rejecting a reading of the clause identical to that proposed here by Tousley, the district court held that \"[t]he specific instances identified in the clause are simply not meant to provide an exhaustive list of the conduct contemplated by the exclusion.\"  Id. at 314.

While the concept of \"arising out of\" is broader than proximate causation, it is not so broad as to encompass a \"tenuous\" connection.  See Cannon v.

While this argument has some plausibility, we hold that Burke's injuries cannot be said to \"arise out of\" the initial attack.  The spinal injury occurred when Tousley's \"bear hug\" and his momentum from hurrying over to stop the fight caused Burke to fall backward, into a table and onto the floor.  All of the damages in this tort action stem from a discrete intervening act of alleged negligence, and this claim cannot be said to arise out of earlier actions.  Tousley had a completely different objective from the brawling patron, and Burke's eventual injuries were not caused by the blows he received in the fight.  See Winnacunnet, 84 F.3d at 38 (observing that assault and battery exclusions are intended to preclude coverage of claims where such excluded acts immediately cause the injury).  This is not a case in which a bartender or bouncer joined sides in a donnybrook.  The injury caused by the employee in this case arose entirely out of his own actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion that the assault and battery exclusion is inapplicable to the fight is affirmed on these alternate grounds.

The \"Bear Hug\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of United National's argument that Burke's fight precludes coverage, the applicability of the assault and battery exclusion hinges on whether Tousley's attempt to break up the fight itself constituted a \"battery.\"   Since there is no definition of \"battery\" in the policy, we look to the common law definition of the term.  According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, an actor is liable to another for battery if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or a third person, or an imminent apprehension of such a contact, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(b) a harmful contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 13 (1977).  As both parties acknowledge in their briefs, the disputed issue here is whether Tousley had the requisite intent to cause an \"offensive\" contact with Burke.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National refers this Court to section 19 of the Restatement (Second), which provides that \"bodily contact is offensive if it offends a reasonable person's sense of personal dignity.\"   It argues that Tousley's protective \"bear hug\" would offend a reasonable person's sense of dignity.  We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burke testified at his deposition that, from the moment he saw Tousley about to grab him, he understood Tousley to be acting in a peacekeeping role.  No reasonable person would feel their personal dignity offended by a bartender trying to prevent fighting in his establishment.  This would be a different case if Tousley had hit or pushed Burke, however, it is undisputed that Tousley was merely attempting to keep Burke out of harm's way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Professor Prosser offered a helpful example to distinguish between the intentional battery and negligence:If an automobile driver runs down a man in the street before him, with the desire to hit him, or with the belief that he is certain to do so, it is an intentional battery;  but if he has no such desire or belief, but merely acts unreasonably in failing to guard against a risk which he should appreciate, it is negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prosser, Law of Torts, section 31 at 145 (4th ed.1971).  In this case, Tousley's actions were negligent at most, and United National's \"offending dignity\" argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Liquor Liability Exclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United National also seeks a declaratory judgment that, to the extent that Burke's claims arise out of Penuche's sale or service of alcoholic beverages, coverage is precluded by a \"liquor liability\" exclusion.  This exclusion bars claims for \"bodily injury or property damages for which the insured or his indemnitee may be held liable ... as a person or organization engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing, selling or serving alcoholic beverages.\"   However, in his Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Burke admitted \"[t]here is no allegation or evidence that Tousley or Penuche's would be liable for bodily injury by reason of the 'violation of any statute, ordinance or regulation' pertaining to the sale of alcohol.\"   In the face of this concession, United National's request for a declaration on its \"liquor liability\" exclusion is superfluous.  Under no reasonable construction of Burke's complaint is Penuche's being sued for negligently furnishing alcoholic beverages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Court Order to Indemnify the Insured</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, United National argues that even if the exclusions do not apply to Burke's tort claims, the district court acted prematurely when it ordered United National to indemnify the insured before a trial.  The insurance company argues that \"[i]t is currently unknown precisely what the evidence will be concerning the encounter,\" and that it was error to \"assume that the evidence will be as it has been presented in discovery.\"   This argument lacks any support in law.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court, as a matter of course, affirms court orders to indemnify that are issued before trial.  See, e.g., Trefethen v. New Hampshire Ins.

Federal courts cannot limit their rulings in anticipation of potential surprise revelations during trial.  If, in fact, some heretofore unanticipated development during trial negates the rationale of this or any judgment, the affected party may file a Motion for Relief From Judgment or Order in accordance with Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  However, we will not refrain from affirming an order awarding indemnification for insurance claims on summary judgment where all available facts and law indicate that such an order is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, the district court's award for summary judgment and order for the defense and indemnification of Thomas Burke's claims is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To commit an \"assault\" under the Restatement (Second) of Torts, the actor must intend to cause an imminent apprehension in another person of harmful or offensive contact.
