During  the  course  of a\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\n  nationwide restructuring of  the United States Department  of\r\n\n  Health and Human  Services (HHS) in 1996,  the Administration\r\n\n  for  Children  and  Families  reorganized  its  ten  regional\r\n\n  offices  into five major  \"hub\" offices and  adjunct offices.\r\n\n  Although  Boston has been  affectionately referred to  as the\r\n\n  \"Hub of  the Universe,\" the  Boston field office lost  out to\r\n\n  larger urban centers and was not designated a hub office.  As\r\n\n  a result, the Boston office  was directed to shrink its size,\r\n\n  and  did so  by reorganizing  from  two levels  of managerial\r\n\n  employees  to  one,  accomplishing  this  by  eliminating its\r\n\n  middle management positions. Five middle management employees\r\n\n  in  the  Boston  office  were  given  the  option  of  either\r\n\n  accepting  a demotion or  laterally transferring to  the same\r\n\n  positions at locations other than Boston.  \r\n\n            Three of these  employees, Vincent DeNovellis, Paul\r\n\n  Kelley, and Laurentina Janey-Burrell, sued HHS for violations\r\n\n  of Section 704 of Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\r\n\n  42  U.S.C.   2000e-3(a), the Age Discrimination in Employment\r\n\n  Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.    621-34, and the Civil Service Reform\r\n\n  Act  of  1978 (CSRA),  Pub.  L.  No.  95-454, 92  Stat.  1111\r\n\n  (codified as amended in various sections of 5 U.S.C.), saying\r\n\n  that  the  proposed  reassignments  constituted  illegal  age\r\n\n  discrimination by  forcing  them to  retire prematurely,  and\r\n\n  that  HHS  violated  the  CSRA by  failing  to  follow proper\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n  procedures  for  a  reduction-in-force.    Janey-Burrell  and\r\n\n  DeNovellis  also  said that  the reassignment  decisions were\r\n\n  made in retaliation for prior EEO claims they had filed which\r\n\n  alleged racial discrimination by their supervisor.  \r\n\n            The plaintiffs have chosen as their battlefield the\r\n\n  equitable plains  of preliminary injunctive relief, and there\r\n\n  they falter.  All three lost in their applications before the\r\n\n  district court for issuance  of preliminary injunctions under\r\n\n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).   Although Janey-Burrell obtained from\r\n\n  a different  district  court judge,  under  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.\r\n\n  62(c), a stay pending appeal of the denial of the preliminary\r\n\n  injunction, which the parties have treated as freezing Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell  into  her  pre-reassignment  position  pending  this\r\n\n  appeal,  that stay is  not the subject of  this appeal -- nor\r                                                                   -\r\n\n  could it be by its own terms.  This appeal is from the denial\r\n\n  of the preliminary injunctions under  Fed. R. Civ. P.  60(b).\r\n\n  In the interim, DeNovellis and Kelley have retired.    \r\n\n            We affirm.  The claims of DeNovellis and Kelley for\r\n\n  preliminary injunctive relief  are now moot because  of their\r\n\n  retirement.  As for Janey-Burrell, the district court did not\r\n\n  abuse its discretion in denying the injunction.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n            We  describe the facts as to Janey-Burrell; we need\r\n\n  not  discuss DeNovellis and  Kelley because their  claims are\r\n\n  moot.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n            In  1993,   Vice  President  Gore   instituted  the\r\n\n  National Performance Review, which attempted  to make federal\r\n\n  agencies  more cost-efficient and  responsive to  the public.\r\n\n  Many HHS agencies  have since undergone extensive  review and\r\n\n  reorganization, including the Administration for Children and\r\n\n  Families (ACF),  which administers  over sixty federal  human\r\n\n  service  programs, including Head  Start and Aid  to Families\r\n\n  with Dependent  Children.  In  1994, HHS initiated a  plan to\r\n\n  streamline  the ACF  bureaucracy by  reducing  the number  of\r\n\n  administrative  centers from ten regional offices to five hub\r\n\n  offices.   The  five  regional offices  not  selected as  hub\r\n\n  offices,  including  Boston,   were  directed  to   eliminate\r\n\n  management  positions and reorganize  so they would  have one\r\n\n  level of  management instead  of the extant  two levels.   In\r\n\n  October  1994,  the  Boston  office  implemented  a  plan  to\r\n\n  reorganize  into five  goal-driven work-groups  in accordance\r\n\n  with the five goals of the ACF reorganization plan.  The five\r\n\n  goal  leaders  and  the  Deputy  Regional  Administrator  now\r\n\n  comprise  the sole management level at the Boston ACF office.\r\n\n  The five goal  leaders and the Deputy  Regional Administrator\r\n\n  are all over forty years of age.\r\n\n            Plaintiff Janey-Burrell was  a mid-level manager at\r\n\n  ACF  at the  GS-14 level  prior  to the  reorganization.   In\r\n\n  November  1993,  Janey-Burrell  had  filed  an EEO  complaint\r\n\n  against her supervisor, Regional Administrator Hugh Galligan,\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n  and the  Assistant Regional Administrator,  Richard Stirling,\r\n\n  alleging  race and  gender discrimination.    In April  1994,\r\n\n  Regional Administrator Hugh Galligan reassigned Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  from her position of record to a temporary assignment without\r\n\n  specific duties.  In July 1994, Janey-Burrell filed  a second\r\n\n  EEO   complaint  against  Galligan  when  he  placed  her  on\r\n\n  temporary  assignment,  alleging  that  this  action  was  in\r\n\n  retaliation  for having  filed her  first EEO complaint.   In\r\n\n  October 1994, when the Boston regional office implemented its\r\n\n  reorganization plan,  Janey-Burrell was  not chosen  to be  a\r\n\n  goal leader.   Along  with the  other mid-level  managers not\r\n\n  selected  to be  goal leaders, Janey-Burrell  was permanently\r\n\n  placed  on  temporary   assignment  pending  reassignment  to\r\n\n  another permanent position within  the agency.  Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  was assigned  to the  Office of  Regional Director Philip  W.\r\n\n  Johnston,  where  she  served  as the  Department's  Violence\r\n\n  Prevention and Community Based Program Coordinator.  \r\n\n            During  1995 and  1996, in  order  to continue  the\r\n\n  streamlining  process, the Boston office sought volunteers to\r\n\n  relocate to other offices around the country.  Four employees\r\n\n  volunteered to  relocate, but  Janey-Burrell did  not.   This\r\n\n  left  five  GS-14  mid-level managers  remaining  within  the\r\n\n  Boston office who had not been chosen to be goal leaders  and\r\n\n  whose positions were being eliminated by  the reorganization.\r\n\n  In  June  1996,  Diann Dawson,  the  ACF  Regional Operations\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n  Director, decided to impose \"directed reassignments\" on those\r\n\n  five  remaining GS-14  mid-level  managers, including  Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell,  to equivalent positions  in the hub  offices around\r\n\n  the country.  \r\n\n            On June 11, 1996, Dawson wrote a letter to the five\r\n\n  middle-managers in which she  proposed their reassignment  to\r\n\n  different  locations.     Dawson's  letter  to  Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  proposed that  Janey-Burrell fill a vacancy in the ACF office\r\n\n  in San Francisco.  The others were asked to fill vacancies in\r\n\n  Chicago, Dallas,  New York,  and Atlanta.   Dawson  requested\r\n\n  that Janey-Burrell  and the  others respond  to the  proposed\r\n\n  reassignments within fifteen  days of receipt of  the letter.\r\n\n  Janey-Burrell responded by letter on  June 24, 1996, in which\r\n\n  she rejected the reassignment.  Among her reasons was that it\r\n\n  would  be harder  for her  to pursue  her EEO  claims against\r\n\n  Galligan were she in San Francisco instead of Boston.\r\n\n            On July  9, 1996,  Janey-Burrell received  Dawson's\r\n\n  response.    Dawson  said  she  had  received Janey-Burrell's\r\n\n  letter  and  had  considered  Janey-Burrell's  objections  to\r\n\n  reassignment.  Dawson  wrote she had nevertheless  decided to\r\n\n  reassign Janey-Burrell to San  Francisco effective August 18,\r\n\n  1996.\r\n\n            On August 13,  1996, Janey-Burrell was offered  the\r\n\n  option of staying in Boston.  Before this date, one mid-level\r\n\n  manager had enquired  as to whether she could  stay in Boston\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n  if  she took a downgrade to a non-supervisory GS-13 position.\r\n\n  This request was  granted and Galligan, unsolicited,  wrote a\r\n\n  letter to Janey-Burrell notifying her that this had happened.\r\n\n  He concluded, \"If  you are interested in doing  the same, let\r\n\n  me  know.\"    For Janey-Burrell,  this  downgrade  would have\r\n\n  allowed  her to  stay  in Boston  in  a GS-13  position at  a\r\n\n  $13,000 reduction in annual pay.   On August 16, 1996, Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell filed a complaint  with the district court seeking  a\r\n\n  temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief\r\n\n  to prevent her  reassignment.  Chief Judge Tauro  granted the\r\n\n  temporary restraining order.\r\n\n            On   September   30,  1996,   Judge   Saris  denied\r\n\n  plaintiff's   application  for   a  preliminary   injunction.\r\n\n  Plaintiff  filed a  notice of  appeal and  a motion  for stay\r\n\n  pending  appeal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c).  On November 22,\r\n\n  1996, the motion was heard by Judge Gertner, to whom the case\r\n\n  had been transferred,  who granted the stay  pending appeal.1\r\n\n  Janey-Burrell has remained in her GS-14 supervisory  position\r\n\n  since  that time, even though ACF has otherwise completed its\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  1.  The dissent  argues that  Judge Gertner's  ruling was  in\r\n  effect  a  reconsideration  of Judge  Saris's  denial  of the\r\n  injunction under Fed R. Civ. P. 60(b).  But Judge Gertner did\r\n  not purport  to grant relief under Rule 60(b); she explicitly\r\n  stated that she was granting  relief pending the appeal under\r\n  Rule  62(c).   A  new  district court  judge  in  a case  may\r\n  reconsider a prior denial of  a preliminary injunction.  If a\r\n  court wishes to  reconsider an earlier ruling under  the Rule\r\n  60(b) power,  however, it should  be explicit about it.   The\r\n  new district court  judge here explicitly did  not reconsider\r\n  the prior ruling.\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n  reorganization.  The defendants have informed this court that\r\n\n  the choice of  going to San Francisco or  remaining in Boston\r\n\n  as a GS-13 employee is still open to her. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n            Janey-Burrell's  claim   fails  for  a   number  of\r\n\n  reasons.     As  the  district   court  found,  she  has  not\r\n\n  demonstrated  irreparable  injury  and, save  for  her  civil\r\n\n  service  claims (as  to  which  she  has  not  exhausted  her\r\n\n  administrative   remedies),   she    has   not   demonstrated\r\n\n  probability of  success on  the merits. We  do not  reach the\r\n\n  other criteria for injunctive relief.  \r\n\n  A.  Preliminary Injunction Standard\r                                               \r\n\n            We  repeat and apply here the familiar standard for\r\n\n  issuance  of preliminary injunctive relief.  A district court\r\n\n  must weigh four factors:   (1) the likelihood of the movant's\r\n\n  success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm\r\n\n  to the  movant; (3)  a balancing  of  the relevant  equities,\r\n\n  i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant  if the injunction issues\r\n\n  as  contrasted with  the hardship  to  the movant  if interim\r\n\n  relief is withheld; and (4) the effect on the public interest\r\n\n  of  a grant  or denial  of  the injunction.    See Gately  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n  Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1224  (1st Cir. 1993).  The party\r                         \r\n\n  appealing a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction bears\r\n\n  the heavy burden of showing that the district court committed\r\n\n  a mistake of law or abused its discretion.  See id. at 1225.\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n            This case implicates two  related standards for the\r\n\n  issuance of injunctive  relief in employment law  cases.  The\r\n\n  first  standard  governs  issuance  of  injunctive relief  on\r\n\n  claims  by  federal  government  employees  that  their civil\r\n\n  service rights  have been violated.   This  is controlled  by\r\n\n  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S.  61 (1974), which requires a very\r                             \r\n\n  strong showing of irreparable injury.

We  agree that  there  is  a  strong  legislative  policy\r\n  prohibiting  discrimination based on  age and other forbidden\r\n  factors.   The prohibiting  of retaliation against  those who\r\n  bring discrimination claims,  while not primarily vindicating\r\n  such   anti-discrimination   policies,    is   important   in\r\n  effectuating them.   See Tanca v. Nordberg, 98  F.3d 680 (1st\r                                                      \r\n  Cir. 1996)  (mixed motive provisions  of Civil Rights  Act of\r\n  1991, which apply to  discrimination claims, do not  apply to\r\n  retaliation claims).   The issue  here is  not whether  these\r\n  policies are important,  they plainly are, but the  extent to\r\n  which  they alter  the rules  as to  issuance  of preliminary\r\n  injunctive relief where the full  array of remedies to combat\r\n  age discrimination and  retaliation is available  after trial\r\n  on the merits.  \r\n      In  this circuit,  the rules  governing  the issuance  of\r\n  injunctive relief are not altered because the plaintiff makes\r\n  a discrimination claim.   Such plaintiffs must  still satisfy\r\n  the  traditional test in  order to obtain  injunctive relief.\r\n  See Equal Employment  Opportunity Comm'n v. Astra  USA, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n  94 F.3d  738 (1st  Cir. 1996).   In  Astra, the  question was\r                                                      \r\n  whether the  EEOC was required  to meet the  traditional test\r\n  for injunctive relief or whether  it needed only satisfy  the\r\n  criteria  established  in    706(f)(2)  of  Title  VII, which\r\n  authorized the agency to seek injunctive relief in the public\r\n  interest.   We flatly  rejected the  views of  other circuits\r\n  that the traditional test could be relaxed in that situation,\r\n  holding  that even the EEOC was  required to show irreparable\r\n  harm and the inadequacy of  legal remedies in order to obtain\r\n  a preliminary  injunction.   See Astra, 94  F.3d at  743; see\r                                                                         \r\n  also Cohen v.

In contrast, here, we are\r                             \r\n\n  faced with the question of whether the  district court abused\r\n\n  its discretion in refusing to grant injunctive relief against\r                                      \r\n\n  the government -- a much easier question.\r\n\n            In  this case involving  both civil  service claims\r\n\n  and  discrimination claims,  the  question may  arise whether\r\n\n  Sampson or Gately presents the proper standard for a district\r                             \r\n\n  court to apply.3  We need not consider this question until it\r\n\n  is  squarely  before  us.

Gately squarely holds that  Sampson's heightened standard\r                                                   \r\n  is not limited to probationary employees, see id. at 1232-33,\r                                                             \r\n  as the dissent would have.\r\n\n                               -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n  loss  of $13,000  if she  stays  in Boston;  she will  suffer\r\n\n  emotional distress;  there will  be a  loss of  prestige; her\r\n\n  ability to work with counsel on pursuit of her claims will be\r\n\n  impaired if  she is  in San  Francisco;  and the  lack of  an\r\n\n  injunction will  have a chilling  effect on others  who would\r\n\n  understand  this  job action  to  be in  retaliation  for her\r\n\n  complaints   of  discrimination.    Neither  in  sum  nor  in\r\n\n  individual  parts  do  these factors  amount  to  irreparable\r\n\n  injury on the facts of this case.\r\n\n            We start with  the obvious.  It  is Janey-Burrell's\r\n\n  choice whether she  accepts the transfer to  San Francisco or\r\n\n  whether she remains in  Boston at a  reduced salary.  If  she\r\n\n  accepts the transfer,  there is no diminution in  pay or loss\r\n\n  of status.    If she  stays  in  Boston, she  will  suffer  a\r\n\n  diminution  in pay,  but will  recover  all of  that pay  and\r\n\n  perhaps other  damages if she  prevails on the merits.   Even\r\n\n  under  traditional Rule  65 standards,  a  temporary loss  of\r\n\n  income   which  may  be  recovered  later  does  not  usually\r\n\n  constitute  irreparable injury.  See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 89-\r                                                        \r\n\n  92; Gately, 2 F.3d at 1232.  \r                      \r\n\n            In  addition,   while  Janey-Burrell   may  recover\r\n\n  compensation for her emotional distress claim if she prevails\r\n\n  on   the  merits,   the   fact  that   an  employee   may  be\r\n\n  psychologically  troubled by an  adverse job action  does not\r\n\n  usually constitute  irreparable injury  warranting injunctive\r\n\n                               -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n  relief.   See Soldevila v. Secretary of Agriculture, 512 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n  427, 430 (1st Cir. 1975).  Janey-Burrell's assertion that she\r\n\n  will  suffer  a  loss  of  status,  even  if  true,  is  also\r\n\n  insufficient to show irreparable injury, as HHS has given her\r\n\n  a  perfectly plausible explanation as to  the reasons for the\r\n\n  job action.  This case, where a plausible explanation for the\r\n\n  job loss is given, is considerably weaker than Sampson, where\r                                                                  \r\n\n  no explanation was  given and the harm to  reputation from an\r\n\n  unexplained discharge was  not enough  to create  irreparable\r\n\n  injury. \r\n\n            We  are  left  with  the  arguments  about chilling\r\n\n  effect  and  interference  with  the  ability  to  work  with\r\n\n  counsel.  The breadth of  these arguments proves too much and\r\n\n  has little  attraction.  A  chilling effect  argument may  be\r\n\n  made in  every case  alleging retaliation.  It cannot be  the\r\n\n  rule that  irreparable injury  may be  established simply  by\r\n\n  bringing a  retaliation claim  and then  saying that  interim\r\n\n  relief  is necessary to prevent others from being intimidated\r\n\n  from  contributing to  the plaintiff's  case  or from  filing\r\n\n  their own claims.  Here, Janey-Burrell did not offer one whit\r\n\n  of evidence as to any chilling  effect nor did she argue  the\r\n\n  point in her  motions for preliminary injunction  or for stay\r\n\n  pending appeal.4  Rather, the chilling effect issue was first\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  4.  We do not reach the question of whether Janey-Burrell has\r\n  waived this argument in light of our disposition. \r\n\n                               -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n  raised sua  sponte  by the  second  district court  judge  in\r\n\n  issuing  the stay  pending appeal.    Plaintiff is  basically\r\n\n  arguing for a per se rule that a conclusory assertion made by\r\n\n  the  plaintiff for  the  first time  in  appellate briefs  is\r\n\n  sufficient  to  establish  a chilling  effect  and  to obtain\r\n\n  injunctive relief.  We reject that notion and the notion that\r\n\n  plaintiff need adduce no evidence on this point.\r\n\n            This  is not  to say  that a retaliation  claim may\r\n\n  never give rise to a  showing of irreparable injury, but only\r\n\n  that it  is a  highly fact  specific inquiry.

She subsequently\r\n  brought  suit for  retaliatory firing.    The district  court\r\n  granted a preliminary injunction and required the employer to\r\n  reinstate the plaintiff during the litigation in part because\r\n  of concern  about the  potential chilling  effect that  might\r\n  otherwise  occur.   See  id.  at  1124.   The  Third  Circuit\r                                        \r\n  reversed.  The court said that plaintiff had failed to adduce\r\n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n  any event, the chilling effect argument made by Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  goes  primarily  to  the  effect on  third  parties,  not  to\r\n\n  plaintiff's own  injury.  In  this case, that argument  as to\r\n\n  the effect  on third  parties must be  viewed in  the context\r\n\n  that  the federal  government  will  be  deeply  affected  by\r\n\n  judicial  interference  with  its efforts  to  streamline its\r\n\n  operations,  particularly   where  the  streamlining   is  in\r\n\n  response to  pressure from  voters to  do so.   There  are no\r\n\n  facts  here to  support anything  other  than a  hypothetical\r\n\n  chilling effect, and that is plainly inadequate.  Considering\r\n\n  the  arguments before  Judge  Saris, we  can  say with  great\r\n\n  confidence that she did not abuse her discretion in  refusing\r\n\n  to grant interim equitable relief.\r\n\n            As to the  effect of a transfer  on Janey-Burrell's\r\n\n  ability to work with counsel, every case involving a transfer\r\n\n  to  another  location  involves  this effect.    There  is no\r\n\n  irreparable  injury on this factor alone; many litigants have\r\n\n  counsel in other  locations and  the Federal  Rules of  Civil\r\n\n  Procedure  were designed  to permit discovery  throughout the\r\n\n  land.   More  importantly, it  is  Janey-Burrell's choice  to\r\n\n  accept the  transfer or  stay  in Boston.   If  Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  chooses not  to accept the  transfer, she will be  located in\r\n\n  Boston with her counsel.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  any  evidence that  a chilling  effect might  occur  and that\r\n  consequently there was no irreparable harm.

Only  the third\r\n\n  theory  warrants  much discussion.    As  to  the  first  two\r\n\n  theories, Judge Saris has appropriately noted: \r\n\n            [T]he  evidence  demonstrates   that  two\r\n            employees  over  sixty   were  reassigned\r\n            while  two  over sixty  were  retained as\r\n            group  leaders.     The  Deputy  Regional\r\n            Administrator is  a sixty-four  year old.\r\n            One   forty-something   year    old   was\r\n            reassigned, while  another was  retained.\r\n            A  fifty-eight  year old  was  reassigned\r\n            while a fifty-two year  old was retained.\r\n            These  statistics  are  not  adequate  to\r\n            support    an    inference    that    the\r\n            reassignment   decision   was   based  on\r\n            discriminatory age-based criterion.\r\n\n  DeNovellis  v.

Even so, in  Sampson, the Supreme\r                                                            \r\n  Court stated  that the  avoidance  of the  disruption of  the\r\n  civil service administrative process was a significant factor\r\n  against issuing  injunctive relief in  cases involving  civil\r\n  service claims.   See Sampson,  415 U.S. at 83-84;  see also,\r                                                                        \r\n  Bush v.

Janey-\r                         \r\n\n  Burrell offers little evidence of such a causal relationship.\r\n\n  Mere conjecture and unsupported allegations will not suffice.\r\n\n  Rather,  she must demonstrate the existence of specific facts\r\n\n  that  would enable a finding that explanatory reasons offered\r\n\n  by the government for her proposed transfer were mere pretext\r\n\n  for  its true  motive of  retaliation against  her.   See St.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Mary's  Honor Ctr.  v.

If plaintiff wins  on her retaliation claim, she  will be\r\n  compensated  and  her   attorneys  will  receive   reasonable\r\n  attorney's fees.   Congress has chosen the  route of awarding\r\n  attorneys   fees   to   successful   plaintiffs   to   dispel\r\n  disincentives to the bringing of meritorious suits.\r\n\n  8.  Janey-Burrell  claims  she  was subject  to  two  acts of\r\n  retaliation, the first coming when Galligan detailed her to a\r\n  temporary  assignment in April  1994, the second  coming when\r\n  she   was  given  the  choice  between  transferring  to  San\r\n  Francisco or staying  in Boston.  Judge Saris  focused on the\r\n  first act  of  claimed retaliation  and  appropriately  found\r\n  Janey-Burrell  had not shown a probability of success because\r\n\n                               -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n            On the same date  that Janey-Burrell was reassigned\r\n\n  to San Francisco, the four other middle managers on temporary\r\n\n  assignment were also  reassigned to other  cities.  Each  was\r\n\n  given  the  same  choice  of  accepting  reassignment  or  of\r\n\n  accepting a downgrade.  Three  of the five had not previously\r\n\n  filed any discrimination complaint.9  Even if the evidence is\r\n\n  read to suggest a degree of personal animosity between Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell and  Galligan, that  animus did not  cause her  to be\r\n\n  treated  any  differently  than  her similarly  situated  co-\r\n\n  workers.  Further,  personal animosity may have  many origins\r\n\n  other  than a  desire to  retaliate.   The decision  made was\r\n\n  categorical, not individual.10   All five GS-14  managers not\r\n\n  selected to  be a  goal leader had  been placed  on temporary\r\n\n  assignment in October  1994.  All five were  given the choice\r\n\n  of being reassigned to an equal position in another city or a\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  she was  ultimately assigned  to a  significant position,  as\r\n  Violence Prevention and Community  Based Program Coordinator,\r\n  in the office of former regional director Philip W. Johnston.\r\n\n  9.  DeNovellis filed a  claim of discrimination which  he has\r\n  lost  on the merits.  See DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298\r                                                           \r\n  (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\n  10.  Galligan  made  recommendations  as  to   who  would  be\r\n  selected  to  be  a  goal  leader  in  the  reorganized  ACF.\r\n  Galligan's affidavit states that he made  the recommendations\r\n  without regard to age, race, or ethnicity, and without regard\r\n  to whether any of the candidates had filed EEO claims against\r\n  him.   The record  shows that  the five  selected to  be goal\r\n  leaders are all  over forty years of age,  include both women\r\n  and  men,  and  both African-Americans  and  whites.   Janey-\r\n  Burrell  offers no  evidence  suggesting  that  Galligan  was\r\n  motivated by discriminatory  animus or a desire  to retaliate\r\n  in making these recommendations.\r\n\n                               -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n  demotion  while staying  in Boston  in June  1996.   All were\r\n\n  given the opportunity to respond to the proposed reassignment\r\n\n  as  well.   Those  responses  were reviewed  by  the Regional\r\n\n  Director, not Galligan, and she, not Galligan, made the final\r\n\n  decision   to  reassign  (even  assuming  Galligan  had  some\r\n\n  influence).  The Regional Director was also uninvolved in the\r\n\n  prior claims  of discrimination.  Under  these circumstances,\r\n\n  proof of  causation is  insufficient to  show probability  of\r\n\n  success, as is required for preliminary injunctive relief.\r\n\n                                III\r                                          III\r\n\n            After   losing   their  motions   for   preliminary\r\n\n  injunction, DeNovellis  and Kelley  chose to  retire.   Their\r\n\n  claims for preliminary  injunctive relief are moot.

I  disagree with  the majority  on both  issues and\r\n\ntherefore respectfully dissent.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n            Before discussing the application of the  irreparable\r\n\ninjury  requirement  to  Janey-Burrell,  I  must  first  note  my\r\n\ndisagreement  with the standard the majority applies in assessing\r\n\nwhether  a preliminary  injunction  should be  granted in  a case\r\n\nasserting discrimination under  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\r\n\nof  1964 (Title  VII),  42  U.S.C.    2000e,  and  under the  Age\r\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.    621-34.\r\n\n            I  believe a government employee in such cases should\r\n\nbe held to the  same standard as a private sector  employee under\r\n\nlike circumstances.   The standard that should be  applied to all\r\n\nemployees  -- whether  they work  for the  government or  for the\r\n\nprivate sector  -- is  the \"familiar  [four-factor] standard  for\r\n\nissuance of preliminary injunctive relief\":  irreparable  injury,\r\n\nlikelihood of success  on the merits, balancing the equities, and\r\n\nthe public interest.  See ante at 9.\r                                        \r\n\n            There  is  no  reason  to  treat  the  government  as\r\n\nemployer any differently than a private employer when it comes to\r\n\ndiscrimination  under Title VII  or the ADEA.   Discrimination by\r\n\ngovernmental employers is  at least as serious  as discrimination\r\n\n                               -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nby  non-governmental employers.

The \"familiar [four-factor] standard,\" ante at 9,\r                                                                     \r\n\nwithout any additional  hurdle, would apply to the ordinary case,\r\n\npresumably  including a  discrimination  case against  a  private\r\n\nsector employer.  \r\n\n            The majority would  apply a second standard  in cases\r\n\ninvolving  government employees  asserting  only \"civil  service\"\r\n\nclaims under the Civil  Service Reform Act  of 1978, Pub. L.  No.\r\n\n95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in various sections of\r\n\n5  U.S.C.) (CSRA).   Such employees would  be required  to make a\r\n\n\"genuinely extraordinary\"  showing of irreparable  injury, as set\r\n\nforth in Sampson  v. Murray, 415  U.S. 61, 92  n.68 (1974).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nante at 10.  I agree with the majority's analysis to this point.1\r              \r\n\n            In between the foregoing  two standards, the majority\r\n\nwould  apply  a  third,  intermediate  standard  in the  case  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1.  I believe,  however, that  Sampson's heightened  standard and\r                                                \r\nthe policies it  relies on are applicable only  in the context of\r\nprobationary government employees.   In cases of non-probationary\r                      \r\nemployees,  I would apply  nothing more than \"the familiar [four-\r\nfactor] standard for issuance of  preliminary injunctive relief,\"\r\nante  at  9, the  same  as  we  would apply  to  non-governmental\r              \r\nemployees.   Other  courts have  held  that Sampson's  heightened\r                                                             \r\nstandard of irreparable  injury applies only to  the probationary\r\nemployee \"type of case.\"  See  Oglala Sioux Tribe v.

For instance, the\r\n            Court stated that the plaintiff's showing\r\n            \"falls  far short of  the type  of injury\r\n            which  is  a necessary  predicate  to the\r\n            issuance  of  a temporary  injunction  in\r                                                               \r\n            this type of case.\"  And, in the footnote\r                                       \r\n            immediately following  this holding,  the\r\n            Court  stated that  \"[u]se  of a  court's\r\n            injunctive power . .  . , when  discharge\r\n            of  probationary employees  is an  issue,\r\n            should  be  reserved for  [the  genuinely\r\n            extraordinary] situation.\"\r\n\nGately,  2 F.3d at  1233   (quoting Sampson,  415 U.S.  at 91-92)\r                                                     \r\n(emphasis and alterations  in Gately).

Perhaps some difficulty in this area of  the law is caused by\r\nthe dual meaning of the term \"civil service.\"  It is important to\r\ndistinguish between a government employee raising a civil service\r\nclaim under  the CSRA, as was the case  in Sampson v. Murray, 415\r                                                                      \r\nU.S. 61  (1974), and  a  so-called \"civil  service\" employee  who\r\nraises  a discrimination  claim against  a  governmental employer\r\nunder Title VII or the ADEA, as Janey-Burrell has.\r\n\n3.  It is worth  noting that this \"wide latitude\"  was offered as\r\nthe  rationale  for  the  \"genuinely  extraordinary\"  irreparable\r\ninjury showing that was required in pure CSRA cases.  See ante at\r                                                                        \r\n10.    It  is  anomalous  that  it   reappears  as  part  of  the\r\nintermediate Gately standard.\r                             \r\n\n4.  In  addition,  Gately  would  appear  to  require  government\r                                   \r\nemployees attempting to establish irreparable harm also to \"point\r\nto factors sufficient to  overcome 'the traditional unwillingness\r\nof courts of equity to enforce contracts for personal services.'\"\r\nGately, 2 F.3d at 1234 (quoting Sampson,  415 U.S. at 83).  I  do\r                                                 \r\nnot think  the quotation  should apply  in a discrimination  case\r\nsuch as Gately was and the present case is.\r                        \r\n\n                               -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nthat, in the absence of an en banc panel, we are bound by a prior\r                                            \r\n\nprecedent.  Nevertheless, Gately took that language from Sampson,\r                                                                          \r\n\na case which involved only a CSRA claim (and only  a probationary\r                                    \r\n\nemployee).  Neither  the Supreme Court in Sampson  nor this court\r                                                           \r\n\nin Gately discussed any  rationale for applying such language  in\r                   \r\n\nthe context of a pure discrimination  case, especially when Title\r\n\nVII  contains no indication  that government employers  should be\r\n\nafforded any special  \"latitude\" when it comes  to enforcement of\r\n\nthe Act.   See Douglas  v. Hampton, 512  F.2d 976, 981  (D.C.Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1975)  (\"Congress clearly intended  to give public  employees the\r\n\nsame substantive  rights and  remedies that  had previously  been\r\n\nprovided for employees in the private sector.\"); Martinez v.

Perhaps\r\nthe quoted principle would be applicable in the context of a CSRA\r\ncivil service procedural  claim such as the one  before the Court\r\nin  Sampson; the  \"civil service\"  claim may  be analogous  to an\r                     \r\naction against a private employer  in which the employee seeks to\r\nenforce  the  employer's procedural  rules.   But  at  least with\r\nrespect  to  a Title  VII or  ADEA cause  of action,  a plaintiff\r\nseeking   a  preliminary  injunction  on  the  basis  of  alleged\r\ndiscrimination  is not  seeking  \"to  enforce  [a]  contract  for\r                                \r\npersonal services.\"   She is seeking to enforce  her rights under\r\nTitle VII or the  ADEA not to be  discriminated against based  on\r\ninvidious  stereotyping.   Such rights  were  created by  federal\r\nstatutes,  which supersede  any contracts for  personal services.\r\nBecause  Janey-Burrell  is  seeking  to   vindicate  her  federal\r\nstatutory rights --  not to enforce her employment  contract -- I\r\ndo  not believe Gately's  \"contract for personal  services\" gloss\r                                \r\napplies in a discrimination case such as the present one.\r\n\n                               -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n            I think it fundamentally unfair  that a person who is\r\n\ndiscriminated against by her or his employer should face a higher\r\n\nhurdle  when seeking  to maintain  the status  quo  pending trial\r\n\nbecause of  the mere  fortuity that  the discriminating  employer\r\n\nhappens  to be the government.   To put it  another way, I do not\r\n\nbelieve the government as employer should be given more favorable\r\n\ntreatment when it  comes to discrimination claims than  a private\r\n\nsector  employer.   I  emphasize  that  Title  VII and  the  ADEA\r\n\nvindicate more important governmental  policy interests than mere\r\n\nCSRA  \"'procedural safeguards  in  effectuating the  discharge.'\"\r\n\nGately, 2 F.3d at 1234 (quoting Sampson, 415 U.S. at 91).

I\r\n\nwould not treat the governmental employer any more leniently than\r\n\nthe  non-governmental,  as  the  majority  does,  by  applying  a\r\n\nstricter   standard  to   government   employees  than   to  non-\r\n\ngovernmental  employees when  they seek a  preliminary injunction\r\n\nbased  on  alleged  discrimination.

The majority would  apply a different \"traditional test\"\r\nto injunctions sought by government employees than it would apply\r\nto  injunctions sought  by  non-governmental  employees:    if  a\r\ngovernment  employee  claims discrimination,  the  majority would\r\nsubject  her injunction motion  to Gately's additional  hurdle of\r                                                   \r\novercoming   the  \"wide   latitude   traditionally  granted   the\r\ngovernment in dispatching its own internal affairs.\"  Ante at 12.\r                                                                    \r\nSurely the majority  cannot rely on Astra to  support its special\r                                                   \r\nstandard  for  government  employees.

I\r                                                \r\n\ndisagree with this conclusion as  well.  In particular, I believe\r\n\nthat Janey-Burrell  has demonstrated  irreparable injury  through\r\n\nher allegation that the  Secretary's alleged retaliation  against\r\n\nher could well  intimidate potential witnesses to  her underlying\r\n\ndiscrimination claims.  If potential witnesses fear that they too\r\n\nwill  be  retaliated  against  if  they  testify  to  the alleged\r\n\ndiscrimination against Janey-Burrell, then those witnesses may be\r\n\n\"chilled\" in their willingness to testify candidly in relation to\r\n\nher  claims.    This chilling  effect  could  leave Janey-Burrell\r\n\nunable to prove her case either at the administrative level or in\r\n\ndistrict court.   Even if  her discrimination claims  have merit,\r\n\nshe could well be unable to win any remedy for it.\r\n\n            The majority concludes that Judge Saris did not abuse\r\n\nher discretion in finding no irreparable injury.  In limiting its\r\n\n                               -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nanalysis to Judge  Saris's ruling, the majority  ignores the fact\r\n\nthat,  upon reconsideration,  the  district  court (Gertner,  J.)\r\n\nconsidered both irreparable  injury and likelihood of  success on\r\n\nthe merits of the relevant retaliation claim, and determined that\r\n\nJaney-Burrell was entitled to  a stay pending appeal.  It  can be\r\n\ncogently argued that Judge Gertner's decision, not Judge Saris's,\r\n\nconstituted  the district  court's final word  on Janey-Burrell's\r\n\nmotion  for a preliminary  injunction.  Although  Judge Gertner's\r\n\nmemorandum opinion addresses  the plaintiffs' motions for  a stay\r\n\npending  appeal, it  recognized that,  \"[i]n effect,  . . .  this\r\n\ncourt  is being  asked  to  reconsider  Judge  Saris'  thoughtful\r\n\nanalysis.\"  \r\n\n            The  district   court  has  \"plenary   authority\"  to\r\n\nreconsider its own  rulings if it  believes it has erred,  and to\r\n\ngrant a motion it had previously denied.

The majority  opinion  alludes  to  these\r                             \r\n\ndecisions,  but does  not make  it clear  whether and  under what\r\n\ncircumstances  it  believes   such  a  chilling  effect   may  be\r\n\nsufficient  to satisfy the  irreparable injury requirement  for a\r\n\npreliminary injunction in circumstances such as these.\r\n\n            In   minimizing   Janey-Burrell's   chilling   effect\r\n\nargument,  the majority notes that \"Congress has chosen the route\r\n\nof awarding  attorneys fees  to successful  plaintiffs to  dispel\r\n\ndisincentives to the bringing of  meritorious suits.\"  Ante at 17\r                                                                     \r\n\nn.7.  But  attorneys fees only dispel disincentives  based on the\r\n\nhigh cost of litigation; attorneys  fees do nothing to dispel the\r\n\ndisincentive of  an  employer's retaliatory  vendetta  which  can\r\n\nintimidate potential  witnesses and thereby  prevent a  plaintiff\r\n\nfrom adequately prosecuting even a meritorious claim.\r\n\n            In  this  case,   Janey-Burrell  has  articulated   a\r\n\nsufficient  expectation that  she will  suffer  the same  type of\r\n\nirreparable harm  described by the  Second Circuit in Holt:   the\r                                                                    \r\n\ndeterrence of other employees from testifying on behalf of Janey-\r\n\nBurrell (or from  protecting their own rights).

It is true that the monetary\r                                      \r\n\naspect of such a demotion can  be remedied after trial if  Janey-\r                                                                   \r\n\nBurrell prevails.   But  the chilling effect  of the  demotion on\r\n\nwitnesses cannot be  remedied so easily.  The  chilling effect on\r\n\nwitnesses  is not dependent  on whether the  retaliation comes in\r\n\nthe  form  of an  involuntary  transfer  to  San Francisco  or  a\r\n\ndemotion to a GS-13-grade non-supervisory job in Boston.  Indeed,\r\n\nmany  potential witnesses and complainants might be deterred more\r\n\nby  the threat  that their  speaking  out could  result in  their\r\n\ndemotion in pay and status than by the threat of  a transfer to a\r\n\ndistant city.  If Janey-Burrell loses her underlying case because\r\n\nno witnesses  are willing to  come forward and testify,  then she\r\n\nwill never be  remedied for her monetary losses  arising from the\r\n\nallegedly retaliatory demotion.  \r\n\n            I  share  the  majority's   concern  that  not  every\r\n\nplaintiff who alleges retaliation by her employer should be  able\r\n\nto  obtain  a  preliminary injunction  merely  by  asserting that\r\n\nwitnesses might conceivably be \"intimidated from contributing  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8.  It should be noted that HHS offered Janey-Burrell this Boston\r\noption only on the eve of the hearing on plaintiffs' motion for a\r\ntemporary restraining order.   The Boston option  was not offered\r\nat  the  same time  (June  11) that  HHS  ordered Janey-Burrell's\r\ntransfer to  California, but on  August 13, more than  two months\r\nlater.    This was  six  days before  the  effective date  of her\r\ntransfer (two days before DeNovellis's) and more than three weeks\r\nafter  DeNovellis filed a  Formal (Stage 2)  Grievance protesting\r\nhis transfer out of state.\r\n\n                               -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nthe plaintiff's case\" out of  fear of retaliation.9  See  ante at\r                                                                        \r\n\n14.  On the other hand, we should be at least as vigilant against\r\n\nthe risk that a plaintiff whose claim has merit will nevertheless\r\n\nbe  unable  to  prove  her  claim because  she  cannot  meet  the\r\n\nmajority's  standard  for  demonstrating  with  specificity  that\r\n\nmaterial witnesses who  might have otherwise testified  to actual\r\n\ndiscrimination  by the  employer against  the  plaintiff are  now\r\n\nafraid to testify  based on the employer's  allegedly retaliatory\r\n\ntransfer of the plaintiff to an office  3,000 miles away.  I find\r\n\nit highly  unlikely that a  witness who is intimidated  enough to\r\n\nrefuse  to  testify   on  the  underlying  discrimination   would\r\n\nnevertheless  be willing to jeopardize  her own career by signing\r\n\nan  affidavit attesting  that she  is reluctant  to tell  all she\r\n\nknows   because  of  the   chilling  effect  of   the  employer's\r\n\nretaliation against the initial plaintiff.\r\n\n            Wishing    to    be   neither    overinclusive    nor\r\n\nunderinclusive, I  would conduct an individualized  assessment of\r\n\nall relevant factors.  In the circumstances of this case, I would\r\n\ngive  Janey-Burrell  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  regarding  the\r\n\nadequacy of her showing that  she would be irreparably injured by\r\n\nthe  chilling  effect  of  her  employer's  alleged  retaliation.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9.  The majority asserts that Janey-Burrell \"is basically arguing\r\nfor  a per  se  rule  that a  conclusory  assertion made  by  the\r\nplaintiff for the first time in appellate briefs is sufficient to\r\nestablish a  chilling effect  and to  obtain injunctive  relief.\"\r\nAnte at 14.  The fact is, however, Judge Gertner, who was sitting\r              \r\nas the  district court in this case  at the time, expressly found\r\nsuch a chilling  effect.  As  I note below,  I would affirm  this\r\nfinding based on an individualized assessment of the facts before\r\nthe district court, not based on a per se rule.\r\n\n                               -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nJaney-Burrell  is a  non-probationary  employee with  twenty-five\r\n\nyears of exemplary  service in the Boston office.   Shortly after\r\n\nshe filed complaints of discrimination, her supervisor personally\r\n\ninterjected  himself  in the  implementation  of  adverse actions\r\n\nagainst her in a manner that is highly unusual for someone of his\r\n\nrank.   See  infra at  45-46.   Importantly,  the injunction  she\r                            \r\n\nsought  would simply  maintain  the  status  quo  pendente  lite,\r\n\nwithout  causing any  serious  harm  to  her  employer's  overall\r\n\nreorganization or operations.   See Wetzel  v. Edwards, 635  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n283, 286  (4th Cir. 1980)  (Because the purpose of  a preliminary\r\n\ninjunction is to preserve the status quo until the  rights of the\r\n\nparties can be adjudicated, the courts have distinguished between\r\n\na motion for preliminary injunctive relief to maintain the status\r\n\nquo  and   one  to  provide  mandatory  relief.).    Given  these\r\n\ncircumstances, I would hold that Janey-Burrell has demonstrated a\r\n\n\"cognizable threat\" of irreparable harm, Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 19, and should have been granted a restraining order.\r\n\n            This  result is not  inconsistent with the  result in\r\n\nGately.   There, we  found such  irreparable harm  in plaintiffs'\r                \r\n\nallegations   that  went  beyond   \"temporary  loss  of   pay  or\r\n\nreputational injury.\"  2 F.3d at 1233-34 (citations omitted).  We\r\n\nemphasized the fact that the Gately plaintiffs were \"arguing that\r                                             \r\n\ntheir statutorily-based  civil rights  [would] be  violated,\" and\r\n\nnot merely  \"claiming that  they [were]  'entitled to  additional\r\n\nprocedural safeguards in effectuating the discharge.'\"  Gately, 2\r                                                                        \r\n\nF.3d at 1234  (quoting Sampson, 415 U.S. at 91)).

Gately, 2 F.3d at 1233-34.\r                                          \r\n\n            Similarly, Janey-Burrell's case involves claims under\r\n\nfederal  civil  rights   statutes  in  addition  to   her  merely\r\n\nprocedural  claims, and  those civil  rights  statutes grant  the\r\n\ncourt the authority to reinstate  illegally discharged employees.\r\n\nMoreover, Janey-Burrell has adequately  asserted irreparable harm\r\n\nthat goes beyond mere loss of pay or reputational injury, thereby\r\n\nsatisfying three of the four Gately distinguishing factors.\r                                             \r\n\n            It is true  that Janey-Burrell has not  exhausted her\r\n\nadministrative remedies  and thus  has not satisfied  one of  the\r\n\nGately factors.  Nevertheless, she is distinguishable from Jeanne\r                \r\n\nMurray,   the  plaintiff  in   Sampson  v.  Murray,   in  another\r                                                            \r\n\nfundamental  respect, not listed  among the four  Gately factors.\r                                                                  \r\n\nMs. Murray  was a  probationary employee who  had worked  for the\r\n\ngovernment  for a  mere four  months.   She sought  an injunction\r\n\nprecluding her dismissal from her  job during the pendency of the\r\n\nlitigation,  which could  have lasted  (and did last)  for years.\r\n\nEquitable considerations  surely cast  her in  a different  light\r\n\nthan Janey-Burrell,  who had  worked for HHS  in Boston  for more\r\n\n                               -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\nthan twenty-five years before the agency proposed to transfer her\r\n\nacross the country.  \r\n\n            This  difference is  amplified when  we consider  the\r\n\npurpose of a preliminary injunction:  \"to preserve the status quo\r\n\nuntil  the  rights  of  the  parties  can  be  fairly  and  fully\r\n\ninvestigated and determined.\"  Wetzel, 635 F.2d at 286 (quotation\r                                               \r\n\nomitted); Omega  Importing Corp.  v.

When Janey-Burrell sought a\r                  \r\n\npreliminary injunction  precluding her involuntary  transfer, she\r\n\nmerely  sought  to  preserve  the  status  quo,  even though  her\r\n\nadministrative charge had not yet  been resolved.  Ms. Murray, in\r\n\ncontrast, would have required the  Court to strain the meaning of\r\n\nthe \"status  quo\" beyond recognition  if the Court  had permitted\r\n\nher to bootstrap her four-month tenure into several years' court-\r\n\nordered employment.  The irreparable injury to Murray's employer,\r\n\nif the Court had affirmed the restraining order in Sampson, would\r                                                                    \r\n\nhave outweighed the irreparable injury Murray would suffer if the\r\n\nrestrainer were denied.  In  short, Janey-Burrell is more akin to\r\n\nthe  Gately  plaintiffs,  who  were  entitled  to  an  injunction\r                                             \r\n\nmaintaining  the status quo pendente  lite, than to the plaintiff\r\n\nin Sampson who was not so entitled.\r                    \r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n            Finally, I  disagree with  the majority's  conclusion\r\n\nthat  Janey-Burrell failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success\r\n\non  the merits  of her  retaliation claim.   Janey-Burrell  filed\r\n\n                               -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nthree  EEO   complaints,  two   of  which   involved  claims   of\r\n\nretaliation.   Her second EEO  complaint alleged  that, in  April\r\n\n1994, she was assigned to a temporary \"detail\" in retaliation for\r\n\nher  having  filed  her  first  complaint  of   race  and  gender\r\n\ndiscrimination.    Her  third  EEO  complaint  alleged  that  her\r\n\ninvoluntary   transfer  from  Boston  to  San  Francisco  was  in\r\n\nretaliation for her having filed her first two complaints.\r\n\n            Although   the   present   motion   for   preliminary\r\n\ninjunction  relates to the latter complaint, Judge Saris analyzed\r\n\nJaney-Burrell's likelihood of success on her retaliation claim by\r\n\nconsidering only the first such claim (the temporary \"detail\").10\r\n\nJudge  Saris's entire analysis  of the merits  of Janey-Burrell's\r\n\nretaliation claims is the following:  \"Janey-Burrell was detailed\r\n\nto  a position  of great  significance  in the  community in  the\r\n\noffice  of  the  former regional  director,  Philip  W. Johnston.\r\n\nJohnston  stated  in  his affidavit  that  Galligan  proposed the\r\n\ndetail in response to Johnston's  request for someone with Janey-\r\n\nBurrell's  significant  expertise.    That   hardly  sounds  like\r\n\nretaliation.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10.  Judge  Saris did  find  that  Janey-Burrell  was  likely  to\r\nsucceed  on  the  merits of  her  CSRA  claim.   The  court held,\r\nhowever, that, because the  CSRA cause of action  asserted merely\r\nprocedural flaws in the process by which her involuntary transfer\r\ncame  about, Janey-Burrell had  failed to satisfy  the heightened\r\nshowing  required to meet  the irreparable injury  requirement to\r\njustify  a preliminary  injunction in  that  type of  case.   See\r                                                                           \r\nSampson v.

Janey-\r\n\nBurrell  seeks   a  preliminary   injunction  against   her  1996\r\n\ninvoluntary  transfer  to  San Francisco;  she  claims  that that\r                                                                           \r\n\ntransfer,  after almost  twenty-five years  of service at  HHS in\r\n\nBoston, was retaliatory.   The motion presently before  the court\r\n\nhas nothing to do  with the 1994 temporary detail.  Judge Saris's\r\n\nopinion erred  as  a matter  of  law by  failing to  analyze  the\r\n\nlikelihood that Janey-Burrell will succeed on the merits of  this\r\n\nlast retaliation claim.\r\n\n            Applying  our  precedents  to  Janey-Burrell's  third\r\n\ncomplaint (her  second retaliation  claim) leads  me to  disagree\r\n\nwith the majority and to conclude that Janey-Burrell is likely to\r                                                                 \r\n\nsucceed  on  the merits.    To establish  a  prima facie  case of\r\n\nretaliation,  Janey-Burrell  had  to  demonstrate  that  (1)  she\r\n\nengaged  in protected conduct;  (2) she suffered  from an adverse\r\n\nemployment  decision; and  (3)  the  protected  conduct  and  the\r\n\nadverse action were  causally connected.

The  ADEA and\r                       \r\n\nTitle  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 analogously protect an\r\n\nindividual  who has  filed  an  EEO  complaint  from  retaliation\r\n\ntherefor.

It was not until three months  after Janey-Burrell had filed\r                                                   \r\nher  second  EEO  complaint  --  alleging  that  the removal  and\r\ntemporary  detail  to  an  unclassified position  with  undefined\r\nduties were retaliatory -- that former Regional Director Johnston\r\nrequested that  Galligan assign someone  like her to  his special\r\nproject, and Janey-Burrell was so detailed.\r\n\n                               -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n\nhave  to be correct or successful.

But in many cases such as this one, the\r                           \r\n\ncausal connection must  be shown through  indirect means such  as\r\n\ninferences  and  circumstantial  evidence because  \"[t]here  will\r\n\nseldom  be eyewitness  testimony  as  to  the  employer's  mental\r\n\nprocesses.\"  See Aikens, 460 U.S. at 716.  Such indirect evidence\r                                 \r\n\nmay be sufficient to demonstrate the requisite causal connection.\r\n\nId.\r             \r\n\n            The majority finds Janey-Burrell's proof of causation\r\n\nto be insufficient  to show probability of success.   I disagree.\r\n\nI find  the evidence and  inferences here -- among  other things,\r\n\nfacts  set forth in  Janey-Burrell's affidavit and  undisputed by\r\n\nthe government  -- to  be sufficiently persuasive.   Within  five\r\n\nmonths of her  filing her first EEO complaint  alleging race- and\r\n\ngender-based discrimination  on the  part of  Hugh Galligan,  the\r\n\nRegional Administrator  of ACF  for Region  I,   Galligan removed\r\n\nJaney-Burrell from her supervisory position and detailed her to a\r\n\ntemporary undefined position.  Significantly, on Friday, April 8,\r\n\n1994,  Galligan  personally  delivered  a  memorandum  to  Janey-\r\n\nBurrell,  announcing   the  removal  and  detail   effective  the\r\n\nfollowing  Monday.    Galligan instructed  her  to  move all  her\r\n\nbelongings  by  that Monday,  April  11.    When Monday  arrived,\r\n\nGalligan personally appeared at Janey-Burrell's office  door with\r\n\n                               -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\na hand-cart and began to  move her belongings.  Needless  to say,\r\n\nthis kind  of personal involvement  was unusual  behavior for  an\r\n\nofficial  of Galligan's  rank.   It  reeks of  retaliation.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMesnick v. General Elec.

Title  VII .  . .  is\r\n\nindirect proof of a causal  connection between the firing and the\r\n\nactivity because it is strongly suggestive of retaliation.\").\r\n\n            Galligan's intense personal interest in Janey-Burrell\r\n\nwas highlighted again  in June 1996, when he personally delivered\r\n\nto her the letter containing  her reassignment to San  Francisco.\r\n\nGalligan told  her \"It's  bad  news.   You're not  going to  like\r\n\nthis.\"\r\n\n            As its legitimate  non-discriminatory explanation for\r\n\nits  actions, the government  asserts that its  personnel actions\r\n\nregarding Janey-Burrell were  related to a reorganization  of its\r\n\noffices,  intended to  streamline  the agency  and  make it  more\r\n\nefficient.  The government, of course, is entitled  to reorganize\r\n\nits offices,  and efficiency is  certainly a laudable goal.   But\r\n\nthe government may not use its reorganization/improved-efficiency\r\n\nrationale  as  a   pretext  to  mask  actual   discrimination  or\r\n\nretaliation; the mere  incantation of the mantra  of \"efficiency\"\r\n\nis not  a  talisman insulating  an  employer from  liability  for\r\n\ninvidious  discrimination.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\n411 U.S.  792, 804 (1973).  As discussed supra, Galligan, who was\r                                                        \r\n\nthe object of Janey-Burrell's EEO  charges, was a major player in\r\n\nthe  decision concerning how the department would be reorganized,\r\n\nwhich jobs were to be eliminated  and which were to be  retained,\r\n\nand who was to  be assigned to which location.12   And Galligan's\r\n\npersonal involvement in the mechanics of Janey-Burrell's physical\r\n\nrelocation   bespeaks  an   emotional  involvement   beyond  mere\r\n\nobjective  efficiency.   It is  a fair  inference, not  seriously\r\n\nrebutted  by the  government,  that  Galligan's animosity  toward\r\n\nJaney-Burrell  was causally  connected to  her  having filed  EEO\r\n\ncharges  against him,  and  that his  decisions  to reassign  and\r\n\ntransfer her  were retaliatory.   See Mesnick,  950 F.2d  at 828;\r                                                       \r\n\nOliver, 846 F.2d at 110.  This is especially true in light of the\r                \r\n\nletters  in the  record  from  a wide  variety  of community  and\r\n\ngovernmental leaders attesting  to the quality and  importance of\r\n\nJaney-Burrell's work in Boston neighborhoods.\r\n\n            Moreover, \"'[d]epartures  from the  normal procedural\r\n\nsequence'\"  are  among  the  factors  a  court  may  consider  in\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12.  The  majority emphasizes the fact that  Galligan was not the\r\nfinal decision-maker,  that ACF  Director of  Regional Operations\r\nDiann Dawson could  have overridden his selections and Ms. Dawson\r\nhad no retaliatory  animus.  Ante at 18-19.  This argument is not\r                                           \r\npersuasive.    The  government does  not  seriously  dispute that\r\nGalligan's  recommendations to Ms. Dawson carried great weight in\r\ndetermining  which employees  should be  retained in  supervisory\r\npositions in Boston and which five should be transferred to other\r\nregions.    Ms.  Dawson  had   only  been  in  her  position  for\r\napproximately one month and was  located in Washington, D.C.  She\r\nhad  little reason to quarrel with Galligan's decisions, as might\r\nhave been the case  if she in fact knew  that Galligan's decision\r\nto  put  Janey-Burrell  on  the transfer  list  rather  than  the\r\nretention list might have been motivated by retaliation. \r\n\n                               -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\nassessing discriminatory motive.

Janey-\r                                       \r\n\nBurrell argues that the Department refused to follow the CSRA and\r\n\nits own regulations pertaining to RIFs and to her reassignment to\r\n\na position in a different commuting area.  To the extent that her\r\n\nprocedural  claims prove to be true, such deviations from regular\r\n\nprocedure  would constitute  further  circumstantial evidence  of\r\n\ndiscriminatory motivation.\r\n\n            To counter this inference,  the government notes that\r\n\nthere  were ten  similarly  situated  managers  in  the  Regional\r\n\nOffice,  and only five of  them were given directed reassignments\r\n\nout  of the  area;  the  other five  were  retained in  permanent\r\n\npositions in  the Boston Region.  Moreover,  only two of the five\r\n\ntransferees had filed  prior EEO  complaints.   These numbers  do\r\n\nnothing to negate the claim  of retaliation.  The government does\r\n\nnot  address the  more relevant  (though  still not  dispositive)\r\n\nquestion  of whether  anyone  who  had  previously filed  an  EEO\r\n\ncomplaint ended up with one of the permanent  positions.  I note,\r\n\nmoreover, that  the majority states:   \"[t]he  decision made  was\r\n\ncategorical,  not  individual.    All  five  GS-14  managers  not\r                                                                           \r\n\nselected to be a goal leader . . . were given the choice of being\r                                      \r\n\nreassigned to  an equal  position in another  city or  a demotion\r\n\nwhile staying  in Boston.\"   Ante  at 19  (emphasis added).   The\r                                           \r\n\nmajority ignores  the critical  fact that  the Secretary,  acting\r\n\nprimarily through Galligan,  made a conscious choice  as to which\r\n\n                               -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n\nfive employees  would retain  their rank  and location  and which\r\n\nfive would suffer  an adverse action (i.e., a  choice between two\r\n\nadverse actions).  I think  the record contains facts giving rise\r\n\nto a fair inference that retaliation was the reason Janey-Burrell\r\n\nwas one of the five selected  for a transfer.  I would  conclude,\r\n\ntherefore,  that Janey-Burrell has  made a sufficient  showing of\r\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of her claim of retaliation.\r\n\n                                IV\r                                          IV\r\n\n            In sum,  I believe  Janey-Burrell has  demonstrated a\r\n\nlikelihood of success on the  merits of her retaliation claim and\r\n\nirreparable injury as to that claim.  As noted, there is a strong\r\n\n\"public  interest   in  preventing   employment  discrimination,\"\r\n\nGeneral Tel.  Co. v.

As  for balancing the equities, Janey-Burrell, after\r\n\ntwenty-five  years of  exemplary service  to  the Boston  office,\r\n\nsimply  asks to  maintain  the  status quo  pendente  lite.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWetzel, 635 F.2d  at 286.  She  asks this not merely  because the\r                \r\n\nproposed  transfer  would  cause her  own  dislocation,  but also\r\n\nbecause she  is the  legal guardian  for her asthmatic  grandson,\r\n\nwhose natural  mother lives  in Boston, and  the transfer  to San\r\n\nFrancisco  would  create  serious  obstacles  in  Janey-Burrell's\r\n\neffort to reunite her grandson with his mother.  In contrast, the\r\n\ninjury to the government would  be minimal if the injunction were\r\n\ngranted:   HHS would  simply be  ordered to  do what  it has  the\r\n\n                               -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\ndiscretion to do and retain Janey-Burrell at her pay and grade in\r\n\nthe Boston office until the  merits of her claims are determined.\r\n\nNeither the agency nor the government at large would be forced to\r\n\nderail the  entire government  reorganization/improved-efficiency\r\n\nprocess   in  its   tracks,  a   specter   that  the   government\r\n\ndisingenuously conjured up in opposing the motion for preliminary\r\n\ninjunction.    The  government's  inconvenience  can  in  no  way\r\n\noutweigh the  potential harm to  Janey-Burrell and to  the public\r\n\ninterest.  \r\n\n            In  evaluating  an   application  for  a  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction,  \"[t]he heart  of  the matter  is  whether 'the  harm\r\n\ncaused   plaintiff  without  the  injunction,  in  light  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  likelihood  of  eventual  success  on  the   merits,\r\n\noutweighs  the  harm  the  injunction  will  cause  defendants.'\"\r\n\nUnited Steelworkers  of America v.

Because this balance weighs decidedly\r\n\nin favor of  Janey-Burrell, I would hold that  the district court\r\n\nabused  its discretion in failing to grant Janey-Burrell's motion\r\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.\r\n\n            The majority opinion makes it extremely difficult for\r\n\ngovernment employees  to preserve  the status  quo pendente  lite\r\n\nthrough a preliminary injunction, more difficult than it would be\r\n\nfor their non-governmental  counterparts who file  discrimination\r\n\nclaims joined with CSRA claims.  The majority opinion permits the\r\n\ngovernment to reap the benefits of its alleged discrimination for\r\n\nlong periods of  time, and imposes  a very  high hurdle before  a\r\n\n                               -51-\r                                          51\r\r\n\ncourt can provide an effective remedy to civil servants who, like\r\n\nJaney-Burrell, have devoted decades of service to the government.\r\n\nI respectfully dissent.\r\n\n                               -52-\r                                          52\r\r\n",

During  the  course  of a\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\n  nationwide restructuring of  the United States Department  of\r\n\n  Health and Human  Services (HHS) in 1996,  the Administration\r\n\n  for  Children  and  Families  reorganized  its  ten  regional\r\n\n  offices  into five major  \"hub\" offices and  adjunct offices.\r\n\n  Although  Boston has been  affectionately referred to  as the\r\n\n  \"Hub of  the Universe,\" the  Boston field office lost  out to\r\n\n  larger urban centers and was not designated a hub office.  As\r\n\n  a result, the Boston office  was directed to shrink its size,\r\n\n  and  did so  by reorganizing  from  two levels  of managerial\r\n\n  employees  to  one,  accomplishing  this  by  eliminating its\r\n\n  middle management positions. Five middle management employees\r\n\n  in  the  Boston  office  were  given  the  option  of  either\r\n\n  accepting  a demotion or  laterally transferring to  the same\r\n\n  positions at locations other than Boston.  \r\n\n            Three of these  employees, Vincent DeNovellis, Paul\r\n\n  Kelley, and Laurentina Janey-Burrell, sued HHS for violations\r\n\n  of Section 704 of Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\r\n\n  42  U.S.C.   2000e-3(a), the Age Discrimination in Employment\r\n\n  Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.    621-34, and the Civil Service Reform\r\n\n  Act  of  1978 (CSRA),  Pub.  L.  No.  95-454, 92  Stat.  1111\r\n\n  (codified as amended in various sections of 5 U.S.C.), saying\r\n\n  that  the  proposed  reassignments  constituted  illegal  age\r\n\n  discrimination by  forcing  them to  retire prematurely,  and\r\n\n  that  HHS  violated  the  CSRA by  failing  to  follow proper\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n  procedures  for  a  reduction-in-force.    Janey-Burrell  and\r\n\n  DeNovellis  also  said that  the reassignment  decisions were\r\n\n  made in retaliation for prior EEO claims they had filed which\r\n\n  alleged racial discrimination by their supervisor.  \r\n\n            The plaintiffs have chosen as their battlefield the\r\n\n  equitable plains  of preliminary injunctive relief, and there\r\n\n  they falter.  All three lost in their applications before the\r\n\n  district court for issuance  of preliminary injunctions under\r\n\n  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).   Although Janey-Burrell obtained from\r\n\n  a different  district  court judge,  under  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.\r\n\n  62(c), a stay pending appeal of the denial of the preliminary\r\n\n  injunction, which the parties have treated as freezing Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell  into  her  pre-reassignment  position  pending  this\r\n\n  appeal,  that stay is  not the subject of  this appeal -- nor\r                                                                   -\r\n\n  could it be by its own terms.  This appeal is from the denial\r\n\n  of the preliminary injunctions under  Fed. R. Civ. P.  60(b).\r\n\n  In the interim, DeNovellis and Kelley have retired.    \r\n\n            We affirm.  The claims of DeNovellis and Kelley for\r\n\n  preliminary injunctive relief  are now moot because  of their\r\n\n  retirement.  As for Janey-Burrell, the district court did not\r\n\n  abuse its discretion in denying the injunction.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n            We  describe the facts as to Janey-Burrell; we need\r\n\n  not  discuss DeNovellis and  Kelley because their  claims are\r\n\n  moot.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n            In  1993,   Vice  President  Gore   instituted  the\r\n\n  National Performance Review, which attempted  to make federal\r\n\n  agencies  more cost-efficient and  responsive to  the public.\r\n\n  Many HHS agencies  have since undergone extensive  review and\r\n\n  reorganization, including the Administration for Children and\r\n\n  Families (ACF),  which administers  over sixty federal  human\r\n\n  service  programs, including Head  Start and Aid  to Families\r\n\n  with Dependent  Children.  In  1994, HHS initiated a  plan to\r\n\n  streamline  the ACF  bureaucracy by  reducing  the number  of\r\n\n  administrative  centers from ten regional offices to five hub\r\n\n  offices.   The  five  regional offices  not  selected as  hub\r\n\n  offices,  including  Boston,   were  directed  to   eliminate\r\n\n  management  positions and reorganize  so they would  have one\r\n\n  level of  management instead  of the extant  two levels.   In\r\n\n  October  1994,  the  Boston  office  implemented  a  plan  to\r\n\n  reorganize  into five  goal-driven work-groups  in accordance\r\n\n  with the five goals of the ACF reorganization plan.  The five\r\n\n  goal  leaders  and  the  Deputy  Regional  Administrator  now\r\n\n  comprise  the sole management level at the Boston ACF office.\r\n\n  The five goal  leaders and the Deputy  Regional Administrator\r\n\n  are all over forty years of age.\r\n\n            Plaintiff Janey-Burrell was  a mid-level manager at\r\n\n  ACF  at the  GS-14 level  prior  to the  reorganization.   In\r\n\n  November  1993,  Janey-Burrell  had  filed  an EEO  complaint\r\n\n  against her supervisor, Regional Administrator Hugh Galligan,\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n  and the  Assistant Regional Administrator,  Richard Stirling,\r\n\n  alleging  race and  gender discrimination.    In April  1994,\r\n\n  Regional Administrator Hugh Galligan reassigned Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  from her position of record to a temporary assignment without\r\n\n  specific duties.  In July 1994, Janey-Burrell filed  a second\r\n\n  EEO   complaint  against  Galligan  when  he  placed  her  on\r\n\n  temporary  assignment,  alleging  that  this  action  was  in\r\n\n  retaliation  for having  filed her  first EEO complaint.   In\r\n\n  October 1994, when the Boston regional office implemented its\r\n\n  reorganization plan,  Janey-Burrell was  not chosen  to be  a\r\n\n  goal leader.   Along  with the  other mid-level  managers not\r\n\n  selected  to be  goal leaders, Janey-Burrell  was permanently\r\n\n  placed  on  temporary   assignment  pending  reassignment  to\r\n\n  another permanent position within  the agency.  Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  was assigned  to the  Office of  Regional Director Philip  W.\r\n\n  Johnston,  where  she  served  as the  Department's  Violence\r\n\n  Prevention and Community Based Program Coordinator.  \r\n\n            During  1995 and  1996, in  order  to continue  the\r\n\n  streamlining  process, the Boston office sought volunteers to\r\n\n  relocate to other offices around the country.  Four employees\r\n\n  volunteered to  relocate, but  Janey-Burrell did  not.   This\r\n\n  left  five  GS-14  mid-level managers  remaining  within  the\r\n\n  Boston office who had not been chosen to be goal leaders  and\r\n\n  whose positions were being eliminated by  the reorganization.\r\n\n  In  June  1996,  Diann Dawson,  the  ACF  Regional Operations\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n  Director, decided to impose \"directed reassignments\" on those\r\n\n  five  remaining GS-14  mid-level  managers, including  Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell,  to equivalent positions  in the hub  offices around\r\n\n  the country.  \r\n\n            On June 11, 1996, Dawson wrote a letter to the five\r\n\n  middle-managers in which she  proposed their reassignment  to\r\n\n  different  locations.     Dawson's  letter  to  Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  proposed that  Janey-Burrell fill a vacancy in the ACF office\r\n\n  in San Francisco.  The others were asked to fill vacancies in\r\n\n  Chicago, Dallas,  New York,  and Atlanta.   Dawson  requested\r\n\n  that Janey-Burrell  and the  others respond  to the  proposed\r\n\n  reassignments within fifteen  days of receipt of  the letter.\r\n\n  Janey-Burrell responded by letter on  June 24, 1996, in which\r\n\n  she rejected the reassignment.  Among her reasons was that it\r\n\n  would  be harder  for her  to pursue  her EEO  claims against\r\n\n  Galligan were she in San Francisco instead of Boston.\r\n\n            On July  9, 1996,  Janey-Burrell received  Dawson's\r\n\n  response.    Dawson  said  she  had  received Janey-Burrell's\r\n\n  letter  and  had  considered  Janey-Burrell's  objections  to\r\n\n  reassignment.  Dawson  wrote she had nevertheless  decided to\r\n\n  reassign Janey-Burrell to San  Francisco effective August 18,\r\n\n  1996.\r\n\n            On August 13,  1996, Janey-Burrell was offered  the\r\n\n  option of staying in Boston.  Before this date, one mid-level\r\n\n  manager had enquired  as to whether she could  stay in Boston\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n  if  she took a downgrade to a non-supervisory GS-13 position.\r\n\n  This request was  granted and Galligan, unsolicited,  wrote a\r\n\n  letter to Janey-Burrell notifying her that this had happened.\r\n\n  He concluded, \"If  you are interested in doing  the same, let\r\n\n  me  know.\"    For Janey-Burrell,  this  downgrade  would have\r\n\n  allowed  her to  stay  in Boston  in  a GS-13  position at  a\r\n\n  $13,000 reduction in annual pay.   On August 16, 1996, Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell filed a complaint  with the district court seeking  a\r\n\n  temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief\r\n\n  to prevent her  reassignment.  Chief Judge Tauro  granted the\r\n\n  temporary restraining order.\r\n\n            On   September   30,  1996,   Judge   Saris  denied\r\n\n  plaintiff's   application  for   a  preliminary   injunction.\r\n\n  Plaintiff  filed a  notice of  appeal and  a motion  for stay\r\n\n  pending  appeal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c).  On November 22,\r\n\n  1996, the motion was heard by Judge Gertner, to whom the case\r\n\n  had been transferred,  who granted the stay  pending appeal.1\r\n\n  Janey-Burrell has remained in her GS-14 supervisory  position\r\n\n  since  that time, even though ACF has otherwise completed its\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  1.  The dissent  argues that  Judge Gertner's  ruling was  in\r\n  effect  a  reconsideration  of Judge  Saris's  denial  of the\r\n  injunction under Fed R. Civ. P. 60(b).  But Judge Gertner did\r\n  not purport  to grant relief under Rule 60(b); she explicitly\r\n  stated that she was granting  relief pending the appeal under\r\n  Rule  62(c).   A  new  district court  judge  in  a case  may\r\n  reconsider a prior denial of  a preliminary injunction.  If a\r\n  court wishes to  reconsider an earlier ruling under  the Rule\r\n  60(b) power,  however, it should  be explicit about it.   The\r\n  new district court  judge here explicitly did  not reconsider\r\n  the prior ruling.\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n  reorganization.  The defendants have informed this court that\r\n\n  the choice of  going to San Francisco or  remaining in Boston\r\n\n  as a GS-13 employee is still open to her. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n            Janey-Burrell's  claim   fails  for  a   number  of\r\n\n  reasons.     As  the  district   court  found,  she  has  not\r\n\n  demonstrated  irreparable  injury  and, save  for  her  civil\r\n\n  service  claims (as  to  which  she  has  not  exhausted  her\r\n\n  administrative   remedies),   she    has   not   demonstrated\r\n\n  probability of  success on  the merits. We  do not  reach the\r\n\n  other criteria for injunctive relief.  \r\n\n  A.  Preliminary Injunction Standard\r                                               \r\n\n            We  repeat and apply here the familiar standard for\r\n\n  issuance  of preliminary injunctive relief.  A district court\r\n\n  must weigh four factors:   (1) the likelihood of the movant's\r\n\n  success on the merits; (2) the potential for irreparable harm\r\n\n  to the  movant; (3)  a balancing  of  the relevant  equities,\r\n\n  i.e., the hardship to the nonmovant  if the injunction issues\r\n\n  as  contrasted with  the hardship  to  the movant  if interim\r\n\n  relief is withheld; and (4) the effect on the public interest\r\n\n  of  a grant  or denial  of  the injunction.    See Gately  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n  Massachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628597\"><a href=\"/opinion/628597/62-fair-emplpraccas-1033-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42508-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1224  (1st Cir. 1993).  The party\r                         \r\n\n  appealing a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction bears\r\n\n  the heavy burden of showing that the district court committed\r\n\n  a mistake of law or abused its discretion.

We  agree that  there  is  a  strong  legislative  policy\r\n  prohibiting  discrimination based on  age and other forbidden\r\n  factors.   The prohibiting  of retaliation against  those who\r\n  bring discrimination claims,  while not primarily vindicating\r\n  such   anti-discrimination   policies,    is   important   in\r\n  effectuating them.

Neither  in  sum  nor  in\r\n\n  individual  parts  do  these factors  amount  to  irreparable\r\n\n  injury on the facts of this case.\r\n\n            We start with  the obvious.  It  is Janey-Burrell's\r\n\n  choice whether she  accepts the transfer to  San Francisco or\r\n\n  whether she remains in  Boston at a  reduced salary.  If  she\r\n\n  accepts the transfer,  there is no diminution in  pay or loss\r\n\n  of status.    If she  stays  in  Boston, she  will  suffer  a\r\n\n  diminution  in pay,  but will  recover  all of  that pay  and\r\n\n  perhaps other  damages if she  prevails on the merits.   Even\r\n\n  under  traditional Rule  65 standards,  a  temporary loss  of\r\n\n  income   which  may  be  recovered  later  does  not  usually\r\n\n  constitute  irreparable injury.  See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 89-\r                                                        \r\n\n  92; Gately, 2 F.3d at 1232.  \r                      \r\n\n            In  addition,   while  Janey-Burrell   may  recover\r\n\n  compensation for her emotional distress claim if she prevails\r\n\n  on   the  merits,   the   fact  that   an  employee   may  be\r\n\n  psychologically  troubled by an  adverse job action  does not\r\n\n  usually constitute  irreparable injury  warranting injunctive\r\n\n                               -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n  relief.

Janey-Burrell's assertion that she\r\n\n  will  suffer  a  loss  of  status,  even  if  true,  is  also\r\n\n  insufficient to show irreparable injury, as HHS has given her\r\n\n  a  perfectly plausible explanation as to  the reasons for the\r\n\n  job action.  This case, where a plausible explanation for the\r\n\n  job loss is given, is considerably weaker than Sampson, where\r                                                                  \r\n\n  no explanation was  given and the harm to  reputation from an\r\n\n  unexplained discharge was  not enough  to create  irreparable\r\n\n  injury. \r\n\n            We  are  left  with  the  arguments  about chilling\r\n\n  effect  and  interference  with  the  ability  to  work  with\r\n\n  counsel.  The breadth of  these arguments proves too much and\r\n\n  has little  attraction.  A  chilling effect  argument may  be\r\n\n  made in  every case  alleging retaliation.  It cannot be  the\r\n\n  rule that  irreparable injury  may be  established simply  by\r\n\n  bringing a  retaliation claim  and then  saying that  interim\r\n\n  relief  is necessary to prevent others from being intimidated\r\n\n  from  contributing to  the plaintiff's  case  or from  filing\r\n\n  their own claims.  Here, Janey-Burrell did not offer one whit\r\n\n  of evidence as to any chilling  effect nor did she argue  the\r\n\n  point in her  motions for preliminary injunction  or for stay\r\n\n  pending appeal.4  Rather, the chilling effect issue was first\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  4.  We do not reach the question of whether Janey-Burrell has\r\n  waived this argument in light of our disposition. \r\n\n                               -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n  raised sua  sponte  by the  second  district court  judge  in\r\n\n  issuing  the stay  pending appeal.    Plaintiff is  basically\r\n\n  arguing for a per se rule that a conclusory assertion made by\r\n\n  the  plaintiff for  the  first time  in  appellate briefs  is\r\n\n  sufficient  to  establish  a chilling  effect  and  to obtain\r\n\n  injunctive relief.  We reject that notion and the notion that\r\n\n  plaintiff need adduce no evidence on this point.\r\n\n            This  is not  to say  that a retaliation  claim may\r\n\n  never give rise to a  showing of irreparable injury, but only\r\n\n  that it  is a  highly fact  specific inquiry.

She subsequently\r\n  brought  suit for  retaliatory firing.    The district  court\r\n  granted a preliminary injunction and required the employer to\r\n  reinstate the plaintiff during the litigation in part because\r\n  of concern  about the  potential chilling  effect that  might\r\n  otherwise  occur.   See  id.  at  1124.   The  Third  Circuit\r                                        \r\n  reversed.  The court said that plaintiff had failed to adduce\r\n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n  any event, the chilling effect argument made by Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  goes  primarily  to  the  effect on  third  parties,  not  to\r\n\n  plaintiff's own  injury.  In  this case, that argument  as to\r\n\n  the effect  on third  parties must be  viewed in  the context\r\n\n  that  the federal  government  will  be  deeply  affected  by\r\n\n  judicial  interference  with  its efforts  to  streamline its\r\n\n  operations,  particularly   where  the  streamlining   is  in\r\n\n  response to  pressure from  voters to  do so.   There  are no\r\n\n  facts  here to  support anything  other  than a  hypothetical\r\n\n  chilling effect, and that is plainly inadequate.  Considering\r\n\n  the  arguments before  Judge  Saris, we  can  say with  great\r\n\n  confidence that she did not abuse her discretion in  refusing\r\n\n  to grant interim equitable relief.\r\n\n            As to the  effect of a transfer  on Janey-Burrell's\r\n\n  ability to work with counsel, every case involving a transfer\r\n\n  to  another  location  involves  this effect.    There  is no\r\n\n  irreparable  injury on this factor alone; many litigants have\r\n\n  counsel in other  locations and  the Federal  Rules of  Civil\r\n\n  Procedure  were designed  to permit discovery  throughout the\r\n\n  land.   More  importantly, it  is  Janey-Burrell's choice  to\r\n\n  accept the  transfer or  stay  in Boston.   If  Janey-Burrell\r\n\n  chooses not  to accept the  transfer, she will be  located in\r\n\n  Boston with her counsel.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  any  evidence that  a chilling  effect might  occur  and that\r\n  consequently there was no irreparable harm.

Probability of Success\r                                      \r\n\n            Janey-Burrell has three claims under the ADEA:  the\r\n\n  transfers  would   effect  an   impermissible  discriminatory\r\n\n  impact; she suffered disparate treatment; and the decision to\r\n\n  transfer her  was motivated by  retaliation.  Only  the third\r\n\n  theory  warrants  much discussion.    As  to  the  first  two\r\n\n  theories, Judge Saris has appropriately noted: \r\n\n            [T]he  evidence  demonstrates   that  two\r\n            employees  over  sixty   were  reassigned\r\n            while  two  over sixty  were  retained as\r\n            group  leaders.     The  Deputy  Regional\r\n            Administrator is  a sixty-four  year old.\r\n            One   forty-something   year    old   was\r\n            reassigned, while  another was  retained.\r\n            A  fifty-eight  year old  was  reassigned\r\n            while a fifty-two year  old was retained.\r\n            These  statistics  are  not  adequate  to\r\n            support    an    inference    that    the\r\n            reassignment   decision   was   based  on\r\n            discriminatory age-based criterion.\r\n\n  DeNovellis  v. Shalala,  No. 96-11655-PBS  at  8-9 (D.

We note the civil service process may work to plaintiff's\r\n  favor   in  that  she  may  have  an  administrative  remedy.\r\n  Notably, Judge Saris found Janey-Burrell had a probability of\r\n  success on her CSRA claim.  Even so, in  Sampson, the Supreme\r                                                            \r\n  Court stated  that the  avoidance  of the  disruption of  the\r\n  civil service administrative process was a significant factor\r\n  against issuing  injunctive relief in  cases involving  civil\r\n  service claims.

If plaintiff wins  on her retaliation claim, she  will be\r\n  compensated  and  her   attorneys  will  receive   reasonable\r\n  attorney's fees.   Congress has chosen the  route of awarding\r\n  attorneys   fees   to   successful   plaintiffs   to   dispel\r\n  disincentives to the bringing of meritorious suits.\r\n\n  8.  Janey-Burrell  claims  she  was subject  to  two  acts of\r\n  retaliation, the first coming when Galligan detailed her to a\r\n  temporary  assignment in April  1994, the second  coming when\r\n  she   was  given  the  choice  between  transferring  to  San\r\n  Francisco or staying  in Boston.  Judge Saris  focused on the\r\n  first act  of  claimed retaliation  and  appropriately  found\r\n  Janey-Burrell  had not shown a probability of success because\r\n\n                               -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n            On the same date  that Janey-Burrell was reassigned\r\n\n  to San Francisco, the four other middle managers on temporary\r\n\n  assignment were also  reassigned to other  cities.  Each  was\r\n\n  given  the  same  choice  of  accepting  reassignment  or  of\r\n\n  accepting a downgrade.  Three  of the five had not previously\r\n\n  filed any discrimination complaint.9  Even if the evidence is\r\n\n  read to suggest a degree of personal animosity between Janey-\r\n\n  Burrell and  Galligan, that  animus did not  cause her  to be\r\n\n  treated  any  differently  than  her similarly  situated  co-\r\n\n  workers.  Further,  personal animosity may have  many origins\r\n\n  other  than a  desire to  retaliate.   The decision  made was\r\n\n  categorical, not individual.10   All five GS-14  managers not\r\n\n  selected to  be a  goal leader had  been placed  on temporary\r\n\n  assignment in October  1994.  All five were  given the choice\r\n\n  of being reassigned to an equal position in another city or a\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  she was  ultimately assigned  to a  significant position,  as\r\n  Violence Prevention and Community  Based Program Coordinator,\r\n  in the office of former regional director Philip W. Johnston.\r\n\n  9.  DeNovellis filed a  claim of discrimination which  he has\r\n  lost  on the merits.  See DeNovellis v.

Galligan  made  recommendations  as  to   who  would  be\r\n  selected  to  be  a  goal  leader  in  the  reorganized  ACF.\r\n  Galligan's affidavit states that he made  the recommendations\r\n  without regard to age, race, or ethnicity, and without regard\r\n  to whether any of the candidates had filed EEO claims against\r\n  him.   The record  shows that  the five  selected to  be goal\r\n  leaders are all  over forty years of age,  include both women\r\n  and  men,  and  both African-Americans  and  whites.   Janey-\r\n  Burrell  offers no  evidence  suggesting  that  Galligan  was\r\n  motivated by discriminatory  animus or a desire  to retaliate\r\n  in making these recommendations.\r\n\n                               -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n  demotion  while staying  in Boston  in June  1996.   All were\r\n\n  given the opportunity to respond to the proposed reassignment\r\n\n  as  well.   Those  responses  were reviewed  by  the Regional\r\n\n  Director, not Galligan, and she, not Galligan, made the final\r\n\n  decision   to  reassign  (even  assuming  Galligan  had  some\r\n\n  influence).  The Regional Director was also uninvolved in the\r\n\n  prior claims  of discrimination.  Under  these circumstances,\r\n\n  proof of  causation is  insufficient to  show probability  of\r\n\n  success, as is required for preliminary injunctive relief.\r\n\n                                III\r                                          III\r\n\n            After   losing   their  motions   for   preliminary\r\n\n  injunction, DeNovellis  and Kelley  chose to  retire.

Gately relied heavily on Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83, 91-92, and\r                                               \r\nprobationary  employees constituted the  \"type of case\"  to which\r\nSampson applied.   \r                 \r\n\n            One need  look no further  than the same page  of the\r\nGately opinion cited by the majority.  As we noted in Gately, the\r                                                                      \r\nCourt in Sampson \r                          \r\n\n            repeatedly  referred  to  the  fact-bound\r\n            nature of its holding.  For instance, the\r\n            Court stated that the plaintiff's showing\r\n            \"falls  far short of  the type  of injury\r\n            which  is  a necessary  predicate  to the\r\n            issuance  of  a temporary  injunction  in\r                                                               \r\n            this type of case.\"  And, in the footnote\r                                       \r\n            immediately following  this holding,  the\r\n            Court  stated that  \"[u]se  of a  court's\r\n            injunctive power . .  . , when  discharge\r\n            of  probationary employees  is an  issue,\r\n            should  be  reserved for  [the  genuinely\r\n            extraordinary] situation.\"\r\n\nGately,  2 F.3d at  1233   (quoting Sampson,  415 U.S.  at 91-92)\r                                                     \r\n(emphasis and alterations  in Gately).  Thus, the  \"type of case\"\r                                              \r\nto which Sampson's  heightened standard applies is  the discharge\r                          \r\nof  a probationary  employee who  has raised  only civil  service\r\nclaims.\r\n\n                               -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n\"discrimination claims brought by  government employees where  no\r\n\ncivil service claim  is involved.\"2  Ante at 10.

Perhaps some difficulty in this area of  the law is caused by\r\nthe dual meaning of the term \"civil service.\"  It is important to\r\ndistinguish between a government employee raising a civil service\r\nclaim under  the CSRA, as was the case  in Sampson v. Murray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108962\"><a href=\"/opinion/108962/sampson-v-murray/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span>\r                                                                      \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1974), and  a  so-called \"civil  service\" employee  who\r\nraises  a discrimination  claim against  a  governmental employer\r\nunder Title VII or the ADEA, as Janey-Burrell has.\r\n\n3.  It is worth  noting that this \"wide latitude\"  was offered as\r\nthe  rationale  for  the  \"genuinely  extraordinary\"  irreparable\r\ninjury showing that was required in pure CSRA cases.  See ante at\r                                                                        \r\n10.    It  is  anomalous  that  it   reappears  as  part  of  the\r\nintermediate Gately standard.\r                             \r\n\n4.  In  addition,  Gately  would  appear  to  require  government\r                                   \r\nemployees attempting to establish irreparable harm also to \"point\r\nto factors sufficient to  overcome 'the traditional unwillingness\r\nof courts of equity to enforce contracts for personal services.'\"\r\nGately, 2 F.3d at 1234 (quoting Sampson,  415 U.S. at 83).  I  do\r                                                 \r\nnot think  the quotation  should apply  in a discrimination  case\r\nsuch as Gately was and the present case is.\r                        \r\n\n                               -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nthat, in the absence of an en banc panel, we are bound by a prior\r                                            \r\n\nprecedent.  Nevertheless, Gately took that language from Sampson,\r                                                                          \r\n\na case which involved only a CSRA claim (and only  a probationary\r                                    \r\n\nemployee).  Neither  the Supreme Court in Sampson  nor this court\r                                                           \r\n\nin Gately discussed any  rationale for applying such language  in\r                   \r\n\nthe context of a pure discrimination  case, especially when Title\r\n\nVII  contains no indication  that government employers  should be\r\n\nafforded any special  \"latitude\" when it comes  to enforcement of\r\n\nthe Act.

Perhaps\r\nthe quoted principle would be applicable in the context of a CSRA\r\ncivil service procedural  claim such as the one  before the Court\r\nin  Sampson; the  \"civil service\"  claim may  be analogous  to an\r                     \r\naction against a private employer  in which the employee seeks to\r\nenforce  the  employer's procedural  rules.   But  at  least with\r\nrespect  to  a Title  VII or  ADEA cause  of action,  a plaintiff\r\nseeking   a  preliminary  injunction  on  the  basis  of  alleged\r\ndiscrimination  is not  seeking  \"to  enforce  [a]  contract  for\r                                \r\npersonal services.\"   She is seeking to enforce  her rights under\r\nTitle VII or the  ADEA not to be  discriminated against based  on\r\ninvidious  stereotyping.   Such rights  were  created by  federal\r\nstatutes,  which supersede  any contracts for  personal services.\r\nBecause  Janey-Burrell  is  seeking  to   vindicate  her  federal\r\nstatutory rights --  not to enforce her employment  contract -- I\r\ndo  not believe Gately's  \"contract for personal  services\" gloss\r                                \r\napplies in a discrimination case such as the present one.\r\n\n                               -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n            I think it fundamentally unfair  that a person who is\r\n\ndiscriminated against by her or his employer should face a higher\r\n\nhurdle  when seeking  to maintain  the status  quo  pending trial\r\n\nbecause of  the mere  fortuity that  the discriminating  employer\r\n\nhappens  to be the government.   To put it  another way, I do not\r\n\nbelieve the government as employer should be given more favorable\r\n\ntreatment when it  comes to discrimination claims than  a private\r\n\nsector  employer.

I\r\n\nwould not treat the governmental employer any more leniently than\r\n\nthe  non-governmental,  as  the  majority  does,  by  applying  a\r\n\nstricter   standard  to   government   employees  than   to  non-\r\n\ngovernmental  employees when  they seek a  preliminary injunction\r\n\nbased  on  alleged  discrimination.

I cannot  imagine why\r                              \r\n\nthe majority leaves open the possibility that the \"extraordinary\"\r\n\nSampson standard would ever be applied to a discrimination claim,\r                                     \r\n\nregardless of whether it was joined to an additional CSRA claim.\r\n\n            The anomalous  nature  of  this  possibility  becomes\r\n\napparent when we  consider an example.  If a  plaintiff alleges a\r\n\nsingle Title VII (or ADEA)  claim alone, the majority would apply\r\n\nthe  intermediate  Gately  standard  of  irreparable   injury  in\r                                   \r\n\n                               -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\ndeciding her motion  for a preliminary injunction.

See Aikens, 460 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n716; General  Tel. Co., 446  U.S. at 326.   Under  the majority's\r                                \r\n\ntest, the Gately \"wide  latitude\" test should be applied,  rather\r                          \r\n\nthan the traditional four-factor test that  is applied to private\r\n\nsector employees.   Ante at 12.   That latitude should  not carry\r                                  \r\n\nany extra  weight --  should not be  permitted to ratchet  up the\r\n\n                               -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nstandard to the \"extraordinary\" Sampson test -- merely because an\r                                                 \r\n\nadditional violation  (of the CSRA)  is added  to the  employee's\r\n\ncomplaint.    \r\n\n            In short, the analysis should not change depending on\r\n\nwhether a  discrimination claim stands  alone or is joined  to an\r\n\nadditional (CSRA) claim.   I would not reward  the government for\r\n\nviolating  a  second  federal  law  (the  CSRA)  in  addition  to\r\n\nviolating Title VII or the ADEA.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n            The majority  concludes that Janey-Burrell  failed to\r\n\ndemonstrate  irreparable  injury,  whether  Sampson's  heightened\r                                                             \r\n\nstandard  or  the intermediate  Gately  standard is  applied.   I\r                                                \r\n\ndisagree with this conclusion as  well.  In particular, I believe\r\n\nthat Janey-Burrell  has demonstrated  irreparable injury  through\r\n\nher allegation that the  Secretary's alleged retaliation  against\r\n\nher could well  intimidate potential witnesses to  her underlying\r\n\ndiscrimination claims.  If potential witnesses fear that they too\r\n\nwill  be  retaliated  against  if  they  testify  to  the alleged\r\n\ndiscrimination against Janey-Burrell, then those witnesses may be\r\n\n\"chilled\" in their willingness to testify candidly in relation to\r\n\nher  claims.    This chilling  effect  could  leave Janey-Burrell\r\n\nunable to prove her case either at the administrative level or in\r\n\ndistrict court.   Even if  her discrimination claims  have merit,\r\n\nshe could well be unable to win any remedy for it.\r\n\n            The majority concludes that Judge Saris did not abuse\r\n\nher discretion in finding no irreparable injury.  In limiting its\r\n\n                               -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nanalysis to Judge  Saris's ruling, the majority  ignores the fact\r\n\nthat,  upon reconsideration,  the  district  court (Gertner,  J.)\r\n\nconsidered both irreparable  injury and likelihood of  success on\r\n\nthe merits of the relevant retaliation claim, and determined that\r\n\nJaney-Burrell was entitled to  a stay pending appeal.  It  can be\r\n\ncogently argued that Judge Gertner's decision, not Judge Saris's,\r\n\nconstituted  the district  court's final word  on Janey-Burrell's\r\n\nmotion  for a preliminary  injunction.  Although  Judge Gertner's\r\n\nmemorandum opinion addresses  the plaintiffs' motions for  a stay\r\n\npending  appeal, it  recognized that,  \"[i]n effect,  . . .  this\r\n\ncourt  is being  asked  to  reconsider  Judge  Saris'  thoughtful\r\n\nanalysis.\"  \r\n\n            The  district   court  has  \"plenary   authority\"  to\r\n\nreconsider its own  rulings if it  believes it has erred,  and to\r\n\ngrant a motion it had previously denied.

But  attorneys fees only dispel disincentives  based on the\r\n\nhigh cost of litigation; attorneys  fees do nothing to dispel the\r\n\ndisincentive of  an  employer's retaliatory  vendetta  which  can\r\n\nintimidate potential  witnesses and thereby  prevent a  plaintiff\r\n\nfrom adequately prosecuting even a meritorious claim.\r\n\n            In  this  case,   Janey-Burrell  has  articulated   a\r\n\nsufficient  expectation that  she will  suffer  the same  type of\r\n\nirreparable harm  described by the  Second Circuit in Holt:   the\r                                                                    \r\n\ndeterrence of other employees from testifying on behalf of Janey-\r\n\nBurrell (or from  protecting their own rights).

It is true that the monetary\r                                      \r\n\naspect of such a demotion can  be remedied after trial if  Janey-\r                                                                   \r\n\nBurrell prevails.   But  the chilling effect  of the  demotion on\r\n\nwitnesses cannot be  remedied so easily.  The  chilling effect on\r\n\nwitnesses  is not dependent  on whether the  retaliation comes in\r\n\nthe  form  of an  involuntary  transfer  to  San Francisco  or  a\r\n\ndemotion to a GS-13-grade non-supervisory job in Boston.  Indeed,\r\n\nmany  potential witnesses and complainants might be deterred more\r\n\nby  the threat  that their  speaking  out could  result in  their\r\n\ndemotion in pay and status than by the threat of  a transfer to a\r\n\ndistant city.  If Janey-Burrell loses her underlying case because\r\n\nno witnesses  are willing to  come forward and testify,  then she\r\n\nwill never be  remedied for her monetary losses  arising from the\r\n\nallegedly retaliatory demotion.  \r\n\n            I  share  the  majority's   concern  that  not  every\r\n\nplaintiff who alleges retaliation by her employer should be  able\r\n\nto  obtain  a  preliminary injunction  merely  by  asserting that\r\n\nwitnesses might conceivably be \"intimidated from contributing  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8.  It should be noted that HHS offered Janey-Burrell this Boston\r\noption only on the eve of the hearing on plaintiffs' motion for a\r\ntemporary restraining order.   The Boston option  was not offered\r\nat  the  same time  (June  11) that  HHS  ordered Janey-Burrell's\r\ntransfer to  California, but on  August 13, more than  two months\r\nlater.    This was  six  days before  the  effective date  of her\r\ntransfer (two days before DeNovellis's) and more than three weeks\r\nafter  DeNovellis filed a  Formal (Stage 2)  Grievance protesting\r\nhis transfer out of state.\r\n\n                               -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nthe plaintiff's case\" out of  fear of retaliation.9  See  ante at\r                                                                        \r\n\n14.  On the other hand, we should be at least as vigilant against\r\n\nthe risk that a plaintiff whose claim has merit will nevertheless\r\n\nbe  unable  to  prove  her  claim because  she  cannot  meet  the\r\n\nmajority's  standard  for  demonstrating  with  specificity  that\r\n\nmaterial witnesses who  might have otherwise testified  to actual\r\n\ndiscrimination  by the  employer against  the  plaintiff are  now\r\n\nafraid to testify  based on the employer's  allegedly retaliatory\r\n\ntransfer of the plaintiff to an office  3,000 miles away.  I find\r\n\nit highly  unlikely that a  witness who is intimidated  enough to\r\n\nrefuse  to  testify   on  the  underlying  discrimination   would\r\n\nnevertheless  be willing to jeopardize  her own career by signing\r\n\nan  affidavit attesting  that she  is reluctant  to tell  all she\r\n\nknows   because  of  the   chilling  effect  of   the  employer's\r\n\nretaliation against the initial plaintiff.\r\n\n            Wishing    to    be   neither    overinclusive    nor\r\n\nunderinclusive, I  would conduct an individualized  assessment of\r\n\nall relevant factors.  In the circumstances of this case, I would\r\n\ngive  Janey-Burrell  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  regarding  the\r\n\nadequacy of her showing that  she would be irreparably injured by\r\n\nthe  chilling  effect  of  her  employer's  alleged  retaliation.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9.  The majority asserts that Janey-Burrell \"is basically arguing\r\nfor  a per  se  rule  that a  conclusory  assertion made  by  the\r\nplaintiff for the first time in appellate briefs is sufficient to\r\nestablish a  chilling effect  and to  obtain injunctive  relief.\"\r\nAnte at 14.  The fact is, however, Judge Gertner, who was sitting\r              \r\nas the  district court in this case  at the time, expressly found\r\nsuch a chilling  effect.  As  I note below,  I would affirm  this\r\nfinding based on an individualized assessment of the facts before\r\nthe district court, not based on a per se rule.\r\n\n                               -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nJaney-Burrell  is a  non-probationary  employee with  twenty-five\r\n\nyears of exemplary  service in the Boston office.

She sought  an injunction\r\n\nprecluding her dismissal from her  job during the pendency of the\r\n\nlitigation,  which could  have lasted  (and did last)  for years.\r\n\nEquitable considerations  surely cast  her in  a different  light\r\n\nthan Janey-Burrell,  who had  worked for HHS  in Boston  for more\r\n\n                               -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\nthan twenty-five years before the agency proposed to transfer her\r\n\nacross the country.  \r\n\n            This  difference is  amplified when  we consider  the\r\n\npurpose of a preliminary injunction:  \"to preserve the status quo\r\n\nuntil  the  rights  of  the  parties  can  be  fairly  and  fully\r\n\ninvestigated and determined.\"  Wetzel, 635 F.2d at 286 (quotation\r                                               \r\n\nomitted); Omega  Importing Corp.  v.

When Janey-Burrell sought a\r                  \r\n\npreliminary injunction  precluding her involuntary  transfer, she\r\n\nmerely  sought  to  preserve  the  status  quo,  even though  her\r\n\nadministrative charge had not yet  been resolved.  Ms. Murray, in\r\n\ncontrast, would have required the  Court to strain the meaning of\r\n\nthe \"status  quo\" beyond recognition  if the Court  had permitted\r\n\nher to bootstrap her four-month tenure into several years' court-\r\n\nordered employment.  The irreparable injury to Murray's employer,\r\n\nif the Court had affirmed the restraining order in Sampson, would\r                                                                    \r\n\nhave outweighed the irreparable injury Murray would suffer if the\r\n\nrestrainer were denied.

Her second EEO  complaint alleged  that, in  April\r\n\n1994, she was assigned to a temporary \"detail\" in retaliation for\r\n\nher  having  filed  her  first  complaint  of   race  and  gender\r\n\ndiscrimination.    Her  third  EEO  complaint  alleged  that  her\r\n\ninvoluntary   transfer  from  Boston  to  San  Francisco  was  in\r\n\nretaliation for her having filed her first two complaints.\r\n\n            Although   the   present   motion   for   preliminary\r\n\ninjunction  relates to the latter complaint, Judge Saris analyzed\r\n\nJaney-Burrell's likelihood of success on her retaliation claim by\r\n\nconsidering only the first such claim (the temporary \"detail\").10\r\n\nJudge  Saris's entire analysis  of the merits  of Janey-Burrell's\r\n\nretaliation claims is the following:  \"Janey-Burrell was detailed\r\n\nto  a position  of great  significance  in the  community in  the\r\n\noffice  of  the  former regional  director,  Philip  W. Johnston.\r\n\nJohnston  stated  in  his affidavit  that  Galligan  proposed the\r\n\ndetail in response to Johnston's  request for someone with Janey-\r\n\nBurrell's  significant  expertise.    That   hardly  sounds  like\r\n\nretaliation.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10.  Judge  Saris did  find  that  Janey-Burrell  was  likely  to\r\nsucceed  on  the  merits of  her  CSRA  claim.   The  court held,\r\nhowever, that, because the  CSRA cause of action  asserted merely\r\nprocedural flaws in the process by which her involuntary transfer\r\ncame  about, Janey-Burrell had  failed to satisfy  the heightened\r\nshowing  required to meet  the irreparable injury  requirement to\r\njustify  a preliminary  injunction in  that  type of  case.

Janey-\r\n\nBurrell  seeks   a  preliminary   injunction  against   her  1996\r\n\ninvoluntary  transfer  to  San Francisco;  she  claims  that that\r                                                                           \r\n\ntransfer,  after almost  twenty-five years  of service at  HHS in\r\n\nBoston, was retaliatory.   The motion presently before  the court\r\n\nhas nothing to do  with the 1994 temporary detail.  Judge Saris's\r\n\nopinion erred  as  a matter  of  law by  failing to  analyze  the\r\n\nlikelihood that Janey-Burrell will succeed on the merits of  this\r\n\nlast retaliation claim.\r\n\n            Applying  our  precedents  to  Janey-Burrell's  third\r\n\ncomplaint (her  second retaliation  claim) leads  me to  disagree\r\n\nwith the majority and to conclude that Janey-Burrell is likely to\r                                                                 \r\n\nsucceed  on  the merits.    To establish  a  prima facie  case of\r\n\nretaliation,  Janey-Burrell  had  to  demonstrate  that  (1)  she\r\n\nengaged  in protected conduct;  (2) she suffered  from an adverse\r\n\nemployment  decision; and  (3)  the  protected  conduct  and  the\r\n\nadverse action were  causally connected.

When Monday  arrived,\r\n\nGalligan personally appeared at Janey-Burrell's office  door with\r\n\n                               -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\na hand-cart and began to  move her belongings.  Needless  to say,\r\n\nthis kind  of personal involvement  was unusual  behavior for  an\r\n\nofficial  of Galligan's  rank.   It  reeks of  retaliation.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMesnick v. General Elec.

You're not  going to  like\r\n\nthis.\"\r\n\n            As its legitimate  non-discriminatory explanation for\r\n\nits  actions, the government  asserts that its  personnel actions\r\n\nregarding Janey-Burrell were  related to a reorganization  of its\r\n\noffices,  intended to  streamline  the agency  and  make it  more\r\n\nefficient.  The government, of course, is entitled  to reorganize\r\n\nits offices,  and efficiency is  certainly a laudable goal.   But\r\n\nthe government may not use its reorganization/improved-efficiency\r\n\nrationale  as  a   pretext  to  mask  actual   discrimination  or\r\n\nretaliation; the mere  incantation of the mantra  of \"efficiency\"\r\n\nis not  a  talisman insulating  an  employer from  liability  for\r\n\ninvidious  discrimination.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

As discussed supra, Galligan, who was\r                                                        \r\n\nthe object of Janey-Burrell's EEO  charges, was a major player in\r\n\nthe  decision concerning how the department would be reorganized,\r\n\nwhich jobs were to be eliminated  and which were to be  retained,\r\n\nand who was to  be assigned to which location.12   And Galligan's\r\n\npersonal involvement in the mechanics of Janey-Burrell's physical\r\n\nrelocation   bespeaks  an   emotional  involvement   beyond  mere\r\n\nobjective  efficiency.   It is  a fair  inference, not  seriously\r\n\nrebutted  by the  government,  that  Galligan's animosity  toward\r\n\nJaney-Burrell  was causally  connected to  her  having filed  EEO\r\n\ncharges  against him,  and  that his  decisions  to reassign  and\r\n\ntransfer her  were retaliatory.   See Mesnick,  950 F.2d  at 828;\r                                                       \r\n\nOliver, 846 F.2d at 110.  This is especially true in light of the\r                \r\n\nletters  in the  record  from  a wide  variety  of community  and\r\n\ngovernmental leaders attesting  to the quality and  importance of\r\n\nJaney-Burrell's work in Boston neighborhoods.\r\n\n            Moreover, \"'[d]epartures  from the  normal procedural\r\n\nsequence'\"  are  among  the  factors  a  court  may  consider  in\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12.  The  majority emphasizes the fact that  Galligan was not the\r\nfinal decision-maker,  that ACF  Director of  Regional Operations\r\nDiann Dawson could  have overridden his selections and Ms. Dawson\r\nhad no retaliatory  animus.  Ante at 18-19.  This argument is not\r                                           \r\npersuasive.    The  government does  not  seriously  dispute that\r\nGalligan's  recommendations to Ms. Dawson carried great weight in\r\ndetermining  which employees  should be  retained in  supervisory\r\npositions in Boston and which five should be transferred to other\r\nregions.    Ms.  Dawson  had   only  been  in  her  position  for\r\napproximately one month and was  located in Washington, D.C.  She\r\nhad  little reason to quarrel with Galligan's decisions, as might\r\nhave been the case  if she in fact knew  that Galligan's decision\r\nto  put  Janey-Burrell  on  the transfer  list  rather  than  the\r\nretention list might have been motivated by retaliation. \r\n\n                               -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\nassessing discriminatory motive.  See Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch.\r                                                                           \r\n\nBd., 117 S.  Ct. 1491, 1503 (1997) (quoting  Arlington Heights v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMetropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (1977)).  Janey-\r                                       \r\n\nBurrell argues that the Department refused to follow the CSRA and\r\n\nits own regulations pertaining to RIFs and to her reassignment to\r\n\na position in a different commuting area.  To the extent that her\r\n\nprocedural  claims prove to be true, such deviations from regular\r\n\nprocedure  would constitute  further  circumstantial evidence  of\r\n\ndiscriminatory motivation.\r\n\n            To counter this inference,  the government notes that\r\n\nthere  were ten  similarly  situated  managers  in  the  Regional\r\n\nOffice,  and only five of  them were given directed reassignments\r\n\nout  of the  area;  the  other five  were  retained in  permanent\r\n\npositions in  the Boston Region.  Moreover,  only two of the five\r\n\ntransferees had filed  prior EEO  complaints.   These numbers  do\r\n\nnothing to negate the claim  of retaliation.  The government does\r\n\nnot  address the  more relevant  (though  still not  dispositive)\r\n\nquestion  of whether  anyone  who  had  previously filed  an  EEO\r\n\ncomplaint ended up with one of the permanent  positions.  I note,\r\n\nmoreover, that  the majority states:   \"[t]he  decision made  was\r\n\ncategorical,  not  individual.    All  five  GS-14  managers  not\r                                                                           \r\n\nselected to be a goal leader . . . were given the choice of being\r                                      \r\n\nreassigned to  an equal  position in another  city or  a demotion\r\n\nwhile staying  in Boston.\"   Ante  at 19  (emphasis added).   The\r                                           \r\n\nmajority ignores  the critical  fact that  the Secretary,  acting\r\n\nprimarily through Galligan,  made a conscious choice  as to which\r\n\n                               -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n\nfive employees  would retain  their rank  and location  and which\r\n\nfive would suffer  an adverse action (i.e., a  choice between two\r\n\nadverse actions).  I think  the record contains facts giving rise\r\n\nto a fair inference that retaliation was the reason Janey-Burrell\r\n\nwas one of the five selected  for a transfer.  I would  conclude,\r\n\ntherefore,  that Janey-Burrell has  made a sufficient  showing of\r\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits of her claim of retaliation.\r\n\n                                IV\r                                          IV\r\n\n            In sum,  I believe  Janey-Burrell has  demonstrated a\r\n\nlikelihood of success on the  merits of her retaliation claim and\r\n\nirreparable injury as to that claim.  As noted, there is a strong\r\n\n\"public  interest   in  preventing   employment  discrimination,\"\r\n\nGeneral Tel.  Co. v. EEOC, 446  U.S. at 326, and  particularly in\r                                   \r\n\nassuring the  integrity of the enforcement process by nipping any\r\n\nretaliation in  the bud,  see Lawn, 805  F.2d at 1405;  Holt, 708\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 91.  As  for balancing the equities, Janey-Burrell, after\r\n\ntwenty-five  years of  exemplary service  to  the Boston  office,\r\n\nsimply  asks to  maintain  the  status quo  pendente  lite.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWetzel, 635 F.2d  at 286.  She  asks this not merely  because the\r                \r\n\nproposed  transfer  would  cause her  own  dislocation,  but also\r\n\nbecause she  is the  legal guardian  for her asthmatic  grandson,\r\n\nwhose natural  mother lives  in Boston, and  the transfer  to San\r\n\nFrancisco  would  create  serious  obstacles  in  Janey-Burrell's\r\n\neffort to reunite her grandson with his mother.  In contrast, the\r\n\ninjury to the government would  be minimal if the injunction were\r\n\ngranted:   HHS would  simply be  ordered to  do what  it has  the\r\n\n                               -50-\r                                          50\r\r\n\ndiscretion to do and retain Janey-Burrell at her pay and grade in\r\n\nthe Boston office until the  merits of her claims are determined.\r\n\nNeither the agency nor the government at large would be forced to\r\n\nderail the  entire government  reorganization/improved-efficiency\r\n\nprocess   in  its   tracks,  a   specter   that  the   government\r\n\ndisingenuously conjured up in opposing the motion for preliminary\r\n\ninjunction.    The  government's  inconvenience  can  in  no  way\r\n\noutweigh the  potential harm to  Janey-Burrell and to  the public\r\n\ninterest.  \r\n\n            In  evaluating  an   application  for  a  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction,  \"[t]he heart  of  the matter  is  whether 'the  harm\r\n\ncaused   plaintiff  without  the  injunction,  in  light  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  likelihood  of  eventual  success  on  the   merits,\r\n\noutweighs  the  harm  the  injunction  will  cause  defendants.'\"\r\n\nUnited Steelworkers  of America v.

Because this balance weighs decidedly\r\n\nin favor of  Janey-Burrell, I would hold that  the district court\r\n\nabused  its discretion in failing to grant Janey-Burrell's motion\r\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.\r\n\n            The majority opinion makes it extremely difficult for\r\n\ngovernment employees  to preserve  the status  quo pendente  lite\r\n\nthrough a preliminary injunction, more difficult than it would be\r\n\nfor their non-governmental  counterparts who file  discrimination\r\n\nclaims joined with CSRA claims.
