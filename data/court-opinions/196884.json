A jury  agreed\r\n\nthat AASTAR  had unlawfully infringed on  STAR's service mark\r\n\nunder both  federal and  Massachusetts law.   Nonetheless, it\r\n\nawarded no damages  on the infringement  claims.  Based  upon\r\n\nthe finding of infringement, the jury also returned a verdict\r\n\nin favor of STAR on the unfair practices claim, Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\nch. 93A    2 and 11.\r\n\n          Following  trial,  the  court permanently  enjoined\r\n\nAASTAR from  any future reference  to itself as  \"AASTAR\" and\r\n\nordered  certain additional  remedial  action.   Pursuant  to\r\n\nMass. Gen.  L. ch. 93A   11,  the court also awarded  fees to\r\n\nSTAR's attorneys.  Shortly thereafter, the court found AASTAR\r\n\nto  be in  civil contempt  for violating  the  injunction and\r\n\nawarded attorneys' fees and costs  to STAR stemming from  the\r\n\ncontempt proceedings.\r\n\n          Both  parties  appeal.   AASTAR  contends  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law,  denying its request for  a trial continuance,\r\n\nholding  AASTAR  in civil  contempt  and  awarding attorneys'\r\n\nfees.   STAR appeals the  court's reduction in  the requested\r\n\namount of  attorneys' fees.  Addressing  these contentions in\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nturn (providing  facts as necessary), we  affirm the district\r\n\ncourt in all respects.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n       Denial of Motion for Judgment As a Matter of Law\r                   Denial of Motion for Judgment As a Matter of Law\r                                                                   \r\n\nA.  Standard of Review\r                                  \r\n\n          AASTAR argues that STAR  failed to produce evidence\r\n\nsufficient  to  establish  service mark  infringement1  by  a\r\n\npreponderance  of the  evidence and,  thus, the  court should\r\n\nhave  granted  its motion  for judgment  as  a matter  of law\r\n\npursuant  to Fed.  R. Civ. P.  50(a) &amp;  (b).2   We review the\r\n\ncourt's denial of the  Rule 50 motion de novo,  examining the\r                                                         \r\n\nevidence in the light most  favorable to the nonmovant, STAR.\r\n\nGolden Rule Ins.

Atallah, 45 F.3d 512, 516  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1995).  \"[W]e may not  consider the credibility of witnesses,\r\n\nresolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the\r\n\nevidence.\"  Wagenmann v.

Reversal  of the  denial of the  motion is  warranted\r\n\n\"only if  the facts  and inferences  'point  so strongly  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Although the  parties and the district  court referred to\r\nthis  case as a \"trademark\" infringement case, it is really a\r\ndispute  over a \"service  mark.\"  The  difference between the\r\ntwo,  however, is not relevant  to our discussion, see Boston\r                                                                         \r\nAthletic Ass'n v.

See id.\r                                                  \r\n\n2.  For  the  first time  on  appeal, AASTAR  requests  a new\r\ntrial.  Because it  did not timely request this  relief below\r\nas  Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(b) requires, AASTAR may not now obtain\r\nthis relief.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\noverwhelmingly in favor of the movant' that a reasonable jury\r\n\ncould  not  have  reached  a  verdict  against  that  party.\"\r\n\nAtallah, 45  F.3d at 516  (quoting Acevedo-Diaz v.  Aponte, 1\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 1993)).  Thus, we present  the facts in\r\n\nthe light most favorable to STAR as the jury could have found\r\n\nthem.\r\n\nB.  Facts\r                     \r\n\n          STAR is in the business  of \"mortgage originating\";\r\n\nit receives information from individuals seeking  real estate\r\n\nmortgage loans, completes applications with that information,\r\n\nand then searches  the secondary market for a  lender willing\r\n\nto offer the  mortgage sought.  STAR  has operated throughout\r\n\nMassachusetts since its incorporation in 1993.\r\n\n          In January  1994, STAR registered its  service mark\r\n\n(which  it had used since the time of its incorporation) with\r\n\nthe Massachusetts  Secretary of  State.   At that time,  STAR\r\n\nalso  applied   for,  and  eventually   received,  a  federal\r\n\nregistration of the  mark.   The mark consisted  of the  word\r\n\n\"STAR\" in bold, capital letters with a five-point star symbol\r\n\nin  the  upper  portion  of  the  letter  \"R\"  and  the  word\r\n\n\"MORTGAGE\"  in  smaller  capital  letters  beneath  the  word\r\n\n\"STAR.\"\r\n\n          STAR used the mark  in all of its advertising.   It\r\n\nspent  about   $2,000  per  month  (of   its  $5,000  monthly\r\n\nadvertising budget) for  advertisements in the  Suburban Real\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nEstate News  (\"The Suburban\"), a free  publication about real\r                                       \r\n\nestate issued  in  several regional  editions  (e.g.,  north,\r                                                                \r\n\nwest,  south)  and   distributed  throughout   Massachusetts.\r\n\nSTAR's advertisements in The Suburban typically touted, inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia, access to various mortgage programs, favorable interest\r                \r\n\nrates, low closing costs, timely credit approval and low down\r\n\npayments.\r\n\n          In May  1994,  AASTAR commenced  offering  mortgage\r\n\noriginating  services in  the  Massachusetts area.   It  also\r\n\nplaced  advertisements  in  The  Suburban  that,  like STAR's\r                                                     \r\n\nadvertisements,  promised  a  variety  of  mortgage programs,\r\n\nfavorable  interest  rates,  low  closing  costs  and  timely\r\n\napprovals.   These advertisements  typically would  include a\r\n\n\"closing cost  certificate\" to be clipped  out, entitling the\r\n\nbearer to a $500.00 credit toward closing costs.\r\n\n          AASTAR's advertisements contained the business name\r\n\n\"AASTAR MORTGAGE CORP.\" in bold, capital letters.   Its first\r\n\nadvertisement  in  The Suburban  depicted  a five-point  star\r                                           \r\n\nsymbol superimposed over the  first \"A\" in \"AASTAR.\"   At one\r\n\ntime, AASTAR's  business cards also depicted  the star symbol\r\n\nin that same letter,  but eventually the symbol was  moved to\r\n\nthe third and last \"A\" in \"AASTAR.\"  \r\n\n          STAR's  president,  Jay  Austin,  noticed  AASTAR's\r\n\nadvertisement in a May 1994 edition of The Suburban.  He then\r                                                               \r\n\nwrote various letters to AASTAR's officers, informing them of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhis  registered  mark,  requesting  them  to  cease  business\r\n\noperations  under the \"AASTAR\" name and advising them to take\r\n\nvarious remedial actions.  AASTAR did not respond.\r\n\n          Actual   customers   confused   the  two   mortgage\r\n\noriginating companies.  In November 1995, a STAR customer who\r\n\nhad  already completed  an application  walked into  the STAR\r\n\noffice with a copy of The Suburban and asked why  she was not\r                                              \r\n\noffered the  rate advertised.  Austin  explained that AASTAR,\r\n\nnot  STAR, was advertising that rate.  On another occasion, a\r\n\ncustomer who had completed an application at STAR returned to\r\n\nits office with  AASTAR's closing-cost coupon  and, believing\r\n\nthe advertisement was for STAR's services, asked for the $500\r\n\ncredit.  On yet a different occasion in July 1994, a customer\r\n\nhad almost  completed an  application when she  presented the\r\n\nSTAR loan  originator with AASTAR's  $500 coupon.   The  loan\r\n\noriginator explained  that the customer had  confused the two\r\n\ncompanies, and  after conferring with  a supervisor, credited\r\n\nthe customer the $500.\r\n\n          Potential   customers   also   confused   the   two\r\n\ncompanies.  Austin  would call individuals who had  placed an\r\n\ninitial call  to STAR to  inquire into its  services; several\r\n\ntimes  during  these follow-up  calls,  the  individual would\r\n\nindicate  that   he  or   she  had  \"already\"   completed  an\r\n\napplication with STAR.  When the person's name did not appear\r\n\nin  STAR's records, Austin would call again to inquire if the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nperson was \"sure\" the application was with STAR; the response\r\n\nwould  be affirmative.  Austin  would then inquire  if it was\r\n\nwith  \"AASTAR\" or  \"STAR\";  at this  point  the person  would\r\n\nindicate, \"oh, it was AASTAR.\"\r\n\nC.  Discussion\r                          \r\n\n          The purpose of trademark laws is to prevent the use\r\n\nof  the same  or similar  marks  in a  way that  confuses the\r\n\npublic about  the  actual source  of  the goods  or  service.\r\n\nDeCosta  v. Viacom Int'l, Inc.,  981 F.2d 602,  605 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1992), cert. denied,  509 U.S. 923  (1993).  Confusion  about\r                               \r\n\nsource  exists when a buyer is likely to purchase one product\r\n\nin  the belief she was buying another and is thus potentially\r\n\nprevented from obtaining the product she actually wants.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n          To prevail  in an action for  trademark (or service\r\n\nmark) infringement, the plaintiff must establish: \"1) that he\r\n\nuses,  and thereby 'owns,' a  mark, 2) that  the defendant is\r\n\nusing   that  same  or  a  similar  mark,  and  3)  that  the\r\n\ndefendant's  use is  likely  to confuse  the public,  thereby\r\n\nharming the plaintiff.\"  Id. at 605.  The harm  caused by the\r                                        \r\n\nconfusion  may be attributable  the defendant's appropriation\r\n\nof  the  plaintiff's  goodwill   (perhaps  leading  to  sales\r\n\ndiversion),  or the  reduction in  the value  of the  mark by\r\n\nvirtue  of   the  association  of  the   plaintiff  with  the\r\n\ndefendant's own  \"bad\" name (so-called  \"reverse confusion\").\r\n\nSee id. at 608.\r                   \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          AASTAR  contends  that  STAR  has failed  to  prove\r\n\n\"likelihood   of  confusion,\"  an   essential  element  of  a\r\n\ntrademark  infringement claim  under  both Massachusetts  and\r\n\nfederal  law.

Similarity of the marks\r                                                 \r\n\n          A jury  plainly could infer from  the evidence that\r\n\nthe   designations  \"STAR  MORTGAGE\"  and  \"AASTAR  MORTGAGE\"\r\n\n(including  the star symbols)  were sufficiently similar such\r\n\nthat  prospective  purchasers  might  be  confused  about the\r\n\nsource of the  services desired.  While AASTAR emphasizes the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ndissimilarity    of   some   individual   features   of   the\r\n\ndesignations, a  jury could  supportably find that  the total\r\n\neffect of the two -- including similarity in pronunciation --\r\n\nwas to create a probability of confusion.\r\n\n          2.  Similarity of the services\r                                                    \r\n\n          AASTAR admits that both companies  offered the same\r\n\nservices.    Thus,  this  factor  indisputably   indicates  a\r\n\nlikelihood of confusion.\r\n\n          3., 4.,  5.    Relationship  between  the  parties'\r                                                                         \r\n\nadvertising, the parties' channels  of trade, and the classes\r                                                                         \r\n\nof prospective purchasers.3\r                                     \r\n\n          The parties  both advertised in The  Suburban, thus\r                                                                   \r\n\nproviding evidence of overlap in their advertising strategies\r\n\nand targets.   AASTAR attempts to  minimize this evidence  by\r\n\npointing  to the  undisputed evidence  that it  advertised in\r\n\nmany publications  in which  STAR did  not;  it asserts  that\r\n\nthus,  the  parties \"did  not  compete\"  in those  particular\r\n\nadvertising channels.   This  argument, however,  is premised\r\n\nupon the  unsupportable assumption  that because some  of the\r\n\nadvertising  channels differed, distinct classes of consumers\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We  often analyze  these three  factors together,  and we\r\nfind it appropriate to do so here.

Equitechnology,  Inc.,  68 F.3d  542,  546 n.5  (1st  Cir.\r                                    \r\n1995).\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nwere  reached and  the relevant  consuming public  would view\r\n\nmortgage-originating  advertisements in only  one source, and\r\n\nhence, would not be confused.\r\n\n          The evidence, however, supports a finding that STAR\r\n\nand  AASTAR   targeted  the   same  classes  of   prospective\r\n\npurchasers in the same  geographical areas, regardless of the\r\n\nparticular  advertising  channels employed.    This evidence,\r\n\ncombined with the fact that both companies  advertised in the\r\n\nsame publication,  would allow  a jury  to  view these  three\r\n\nfactors  (channels  of  advertising,  trade,  and  classes of\r\n\npurchasers) in STAR's favor.\r\n\n          AASTAR additionally argues  that the trial evidence\r\n\nestablished that mortgage-shoppers  are highly  sophisticated\r\n\nand  exercise great care in choosing a mortgage (often a one-\r\n\ntime  purchase)  and thus,  the  likelihood  of confusion  is\r\n\nminimal.   While this argument  is not without  force, a jury\r\n\ncould find that this  evidence did not overwhelm the  bulk of\r\n\nother evidence suggestive of confusion.\r\n\n          6.  Actual Confusion\r                                          \r\n\n          AASTAR  concedes that STAR  presented evidence that\r\n\nthe companies'  names actually  confused consumers  about the\r\n\nsource of the services sought.  AASTAR challenges the  weight\r\n\nof this evidence,  however, arguing that it  was presented by\r\n\n\"biased\" STAR employees.  AASTAR also complains that  most of\r\n\nthe  purportedly  confused  customers  were  not  identified.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nThese  arguments,  however, properly  belong before  the fact\r\n\nfinder;  our  review  of  the  record  reveals  that  a  jury\r\n\nreasonably could have credited the testimony regarding actual\r\n\nconfusion in favor of STAR.4\r\n\n          7.  Intent\r                                \r\n\n          AASTAR makes  much of the  fact that  there was  no\r\n\nevidence that it  adopted its business  name in \"bad  faith,\"\r\n\ni.e.,  with the intent  to take advantage  of STAR's goodwill\r                \r\n\nand  promotion efforts.    Evidence of  bad intent,  however,\r\n\nwhile potentially  probative of likelihood  of confusion,  is\r\n\nsimply   not  required  in  a  trademark  infringement  case;\r\n\nmoreover, \"a finding of good faith is no answer if likelihood\r\n\nof  confusion  is  otherwise  established.\"    President  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nTrustees of Colby College v. Colby College-New Hampshire, 508\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 804, 811-12 (1st Cir. 1975).\r\n\n          8.  Strength of the Mark\r                                              \r\n\n          AASTAR  contends  that  there  was  little evidence\r\n\nregarding the  strength of STAR's  service mark and  that the\r\n\nevidence that was  presented showed that  the mark was  weak.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  AASTAR   also   resurrects    its   frustrations    about\r\ndifficulties  it experienced  in discovery  of witnesses  and\r\ndocuments  needed by it to attack the weight of the testimony\r\nabout confusion.  While we agree with the district court that\r\nSTAR  was  less than  forthcoming  in  meeting its  discovery\r\nobligations, the court  adequately addressed  the problem  by\r\nprecluding  STAR  from  presenting certain  witnesses  and by\r\nproviding   an  adverse   inference  instruction   about  one\r\ncustomer.    In the  end,  AASTAR's  discovery arguments  are\r\nirrelevant to  the  weight a  jury  could give  the  evidence\r\nbefore it (on proper instructions).\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nIn assessing a mark's  strength, the trier of  fact considers\r\n\nevidence of  the length of time  the mark has  been used, its\r\n\nrenown  in  the  plaintiff's   field  of  business,  and  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  actions   to   promote   the   mark.      Equine\r                                                                         \r\n\nTechnologies, Inc. v.

The  relevant evidence presented  here was\r\n\nthat STAR's mark  was in use in the  relevant market area for\r\n\nover  two years at the time of  trial, and that STAR expended\r\n\nseveral thousand dollars per month in advertising.\r\n\n          Even  assuming that this evidence constitutes small\r\n\nsupport  for this factor (and, in fact, STAR admitted at oral\r\n\nargument  before  this  court  that the  mark  was  not  very\r\n\nstrong),  \"the strength  of  the mark  is  but one  of  eight\r\n\nfactors  to  be considered  in  analyzing  the likelihood  of\r\n\nconfusion  issue\"  and sufficient  evidence of  other factors\r\n\nwill  sustain a finding of  likelihood of confusion.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n546.\r\n\n          In conclusion, we cannot say that a reasonable jury\r\n\ncould  not have  reached  a verdict  for  STAR based  upon  a\r\n\nconsideration  of  all   of  the  factors.    A   jury  could\r\n\nsupportably  find  that  the  marks and  services  were  very\r\n\nsimilar, the targeted consumers were the same, and there  was\r\n\nactual confusion as  to the source of  the mortgage services.\r\n\nA  jury also could have  given little relative  weight to the\r\n\nless-supported factors  of intent  and strength of  the mark.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nWhile  the  evidence supporting  a substantial  likelihood of\r\n\nconfusion may  not have  been overwhelming, it  was adequate;\r\n\nthe court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law, and we will not disturb the jury's verdict.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                 Denial of Trial Continuance\r                             Denial of Trial Continuance\r                                                        \r\n\n          AASTAR   contends   that  the   court   abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion  in refusing to  grant its motion  to continue the\r\n\ntrial.   On the  first day  of trial,  AASTAR filed  a motion\r\n\nentitled  \"DEFENDANT'S MOTION  TO CONTINUE  TRIAL OR,  IN THE\r\n\nALTERNATIVE, MOTION IN LIMINE.\"  In that motion, AASTAR urged\r\n\nthat  a  continuance was  warranted  because  STAR failed  to\r\n\nproduce a witness for deposition despite the court's order to\r\n\ndo  so,  and  because  STAR  was  effectively  \"stonewalling\"\r\n\ndiscovery.\r\n\n          AASTAR's  continuance  motion  also  requested  the\r\n\nalternative  relief of  preclusion  of testimony  by  certain\r\n\nwitnesses and  preclusion of testimony by  Austin relating to\r\n\ncertain previously  unproduced documents.   The record  shows\r\n\nthat the court granted the \"alternative relief\" -- the motion\r\n\nin limine -- and  that indeed, the witnesses in  question did\r\n\nnot testify.\r\n\n          AASTAR  now complains that  Austin was  \"allowed to\r\n\ntestify  unrestricted\" and  attempts to  assign error  to the\r\n\ncourt's refusal to grant the continuance.  We are unpersuaded\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nfor  two reasons.    First, having  received the  alternative\r\n\nrelief  it requested,  AASTAR  cannot now  complain that  the\r\n\ncourt did  not grant the  continuance.  Second,  while Austin\r\n\nwas allowed to testify about various documents that may  have\r\n\nfallen  within the  in limine  order, the  record reveals  no\r\n\nobjection by AASTAR on  this basis during Austin's testimony.\r\n\nOn the  contrary, in  response to  the trial judge's  careful\r\n\ninquiries, AASTAR indicated that it had no  objection to most\r\n\nof the documents introduced through Austin.5\r\n\n          In sum, we find  AASTAR's contention that the court\r\n\nerred  in denying its request  for a trial  continuance to be\r\n\nwithout merit.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                  The Civil Contempt Finding\r                              The Civil Contempt Finding\r                                                        \r\n\n          After the jury returned its verdict on November 30,\r\n\n1995,  the  district  court  issued  a permanent  injunction,\r\n\nreflected in the following exchange:\r\n\n               THE  COURT:   In view of  the jury's\r\n          verdict,  the  defendant Aastar  Mortgage\r\n          Corporation,   its   agents,    servants,\r\n          employees, and all  other persons  acting\r\n          in   concert    therewith,   are   hereby\r\n          permanently  enjoined from  continuing to\r\n          do business  under the name and  style of\r\n          Aastar Mortgage Corporation with  two A's\r\n          before   the   style,   Aastar   Mortgage\r\n          Corporation with one  A before the style,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.

MURRAY  [Counsel  for  AASTAR]:\r\n          Your Honor,  may I be heard  on one other\r\n          thing?\r\n          . . . .\r\n          There  are  presently  several loans  and\r\n          consumers about to close within  the next\r\n          week   where   the  paperwork   has  been\r\n          submitted  on HUD  forms and  things like\r\n          that.  In light  of the fact that there's\r\n          no  damage that's been found that relates\r\n          to the  plaintiffs in this  case relative\r\n          to the  use of that name, the defendants,\r\n          in  order  to  provide  no  harm  to  the\r\n          consumer, would like to  be able to close\r\n          those loans with  the understanding  that\r\n          there  would be  no  publication  and  no\r\n          advertising relative to --\r\n\n               THE COURT:  Any  forms that are  out\r\n          of Aastar's office, either now before HUD\r\n          or any lending  institution, they are not\r\n          in my requirement of use of best efforts,\r\n          they do  not have to recall  any consumer\r\n          forms.   No  more forms  go out  with the\r\n          word  Aastar  starting  now.     Tomorrow\r\n          morning  no form,  no paper  goes  out of\r\n          that  office  using  Aastar,   single  or\r\n          double A's,  using the star or  using the\r\n          word S T A R.\r\n               That's the order of the Court.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          About  one  week   after  the  injunction   issued,\r\n\nemployees  at AASTAR sent  name-change facsimiles  to several\r\n\nmortgage lenders.  These  notices displayed the \"AASTAR\" logo\r\n\n(containing  a star symbol in  the third \"A\")  in large, bold\r\n\nletters at the top of the page, and thereafter stated, \"WE'VE\r\n\nCHANGED  OUR NAME;  WE  ARE NOW  KNOWN  AS: AACTION  MORTGAGE\r\n\nCORP.; PLEASE CORRECT YOUR RECORDS.\" STAR's           counsel\r\n\nimmediately notified AASTAR's counsel about  the notices, and\r\n\nAASTAR ceased using them.  Over one month later, after it had\r\n\nmoved  and argued  for  attorneys' fees  from the  underlying\r\n\naction,  STAR filed a motion for civil contempt stemming from\r\n\nthe   use  of  the  facsimiles.    The  court  then  held  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing on that motion.\r\n\n          At the  hearing, employees of AASTAR  (now AACTION)\r\n\nadmitted  to  transmitting the  facsimiles,  but  professed a\r\n\nbelief that such  notices were in compliance with the court's\r\n\norder,  as  modified.   Specifically,  they  stated that  the\r\n\nnotices were sent only to lenders with loans in progress, and\r\n\nexplained that \"their interpretation\"  of the injunction  was\r\n\nthat  the court only  ordered them to \"do  the best that they\r\n\ncould\" with respect to pending  loans.  One witness indicated\r\n\nthat  he  thought he  could \"go  a  little further\"  than the\r\n\ncourt's injunction by informing  lenders (that, he said, were\r\n\nprocessing loans that were \"out of AASTAR's control\")  of the\r\n\nname  change with the facsimiles.  When queried by the court,\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nhowever,  all  of   the  witnesses  acknowledged  that   they\r\n\nunderstood the court's order  -- specifically, \"no paper goes\r\n\nout of that office using Aastar\" -- and that the notices fell\r\n\nwithin that language.\r\n\n          In explaining  its ruling on the  motion, the court\r\n\nacknowledged AASTAR's substantial efforts  to comply with the\r\n\ninjunction,  but stated  that the  wording of  the  order was\r\n\nclear and  unambiguous  and that  if there  were any  doubts,\r\n\nclarification or modification from the court should have been\r\n\nsought.   The  court  found that  AASTAR,  \"in an  effort  to\r\n\npreserve  the   goodwill  to   which  [it]  had   no  right,\"\r\n\ndeliberately disobeyed the order.   Having found a \"clear and\r\n\nundoubted  disobedience,\"  the  court held  AASTAR  in  civil\r\n\ncontempt, and ordered it  to pay attorneys' fees to  STAR (in\r\n\nthe amount of $750) as well as costs associated with bringing\r\n\nthe contempt proceeding.\r\n\n          On appeal, AASTAR contends that the civil  contempt\r\n\nfinding was \"unfair\" because the injunction was overly broad,\r\n\nambiguous, and impossible to comply with.  We disagree.  As a\r\n\npreliminary  matter,  we  note  that nothing  in  the  record\r\n\nindicates  that  AASTAR  objected   to  the  breadth  of  the\r\n\ninjunction,  or complained  of  impossibility  of  compliance\r\n\neither  before,  during  or  after  the contempt  proceeding.\r\n\nAASTAR  raises these issues for  the first time  on appeal in\r\n\nits  effort to avoid the  contempt citation, and  it does not\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nargue  that  it  continues   to  suffer  from  the  purported\r\n\noverbreadth.  Thus, we will discuss the issues of the breadth\r\n\nand  ability to  comply only  insofar as  they relate  to the\r\n\ncivil contempt adjudication.\r\n\n          Next,  we agree  with the  district court  that the\r\n\ninjunctive  order was  not  ambiguous.   See  11A Charles  A.\r                                                        \r\n\nWright et  al., Federal Practice and  Procedure   2960 (1995)\r                                                           \r\n\n(explaining that,  in  civil-contempt proceeding,  the  court\r\n\nmust find that  the order  was clear and  unambiguous).   The\r\n\ncourt  ordered  AASTAR to  cease all  use  of the  trade name\r\n\n\"AASTAR\" or  its  star logo,  to  refrain from  referring  to\r\n\nitself as  \"formerly Aastar  Mortgage,\" and  to use  its best\r\n\nefforts to  recall or cancel advertising  with the infringing\r\n\nmark.   In response to  AASTAR's inquiry about  pending loans\r\n\nand already-submitted paperwork, the court explained that any\r\n\nsuch paperwork  was not  within its  requirement to use  best\r                                                                         \r\n\nefforts to recall.  The court completed  its injunctive order\r                             \r\n\nwith the  following unequivocal  language: \"No more  forms go\r\n\nout with the word  Aastar starting now.  Tomorrow  morning no\r\n\nform, no paper goes out  of that office using Aastar.\"   That\r\n\ndirective was clear.\r\n\n          Based on  the evidence, we conclude  that the court\r\n\nsupportably found that AASTAR deliberately  and unjustifiably\r\n\ndisobeyed the injunction.  AASTAR's employees testified  that\r\n\nthey  did not intend to violate the injunction, and that they\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ntransmitted the  facsimiles in  the belief that  that conduct\r\n\nwas  in  compliance with  the  order.    Such assertions  are\r\n\nunavailing, however,  because good  faith, or the  absence of\r\n\nwillfulness, does not relieve a party from civil contempt  in\r\n\nthe face of a clear order.  McComb v.

Here,  however,  even\r                             \r\n\nassuming the  injunction was overbroad, AASTAR  has not shown\r\n\nhow its  particular conduct  stems from the  impossibility of\r\n\ncompliance  with the  order.   Rather,  the evidence  plainly\r\n\nshows that  AASTAR's employees voluntarily  chose to transmit\r\n\nthe offending facsimiles.\r\n\n          As  the district  court  correctly  admonished,  if\r\n\nAASTAR was confused about the scope of the order or felt that\r\n\nit  was unable to comply,  it should have  sought relief from\r\n\nthe court.   See McComb,  336 U.S.  at 192 (stating  that \"if\r                                   \r\n\nthere were extenuating circumstances or if the decree was too\r\n\nburdensome in  operation . .  .

Instead of\r\n\nseeking  help or  information from  either  the court  or its\r\n\nattorney,  AASTAR's employees  \"undertook  to make  their own\r\n\ndetermination of what the decree meant\" and thereby \"acted at\r\n\ntheir peril.\"  Id.\r                              \r\n\n          For  the  above  reasons, we  uphold  the  district\r\n\ncourt's adjudication of civil contempt.\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                    Attorneys' Fees Award\r                                Attorneys' Fees Award\r                                                     \r\n\n          The district court awarded attorneys' fees to  STAR\r\n\nbecause  of the  jury's verdict  on the  Massachusetts unfair\r\n\npractices claim.

AASTAR\r                                  \r\n\nargues that  the court erred by awarding  attorneys' fees for\r\n\ntwo reasons:  (1) the  court erroneously instructed  the jury\r\n\nthat, even if  it found no  actual damages, it  must award  a\r\n\nminimum  statutory  damage  of  $25.00, and  (2)  because  no\r\n\ndamages were \"actually\" found, recovery of attorneys' fees is\r\n\nprecluded.   STAR contends that the court erred awarding less\r\n\nthan the amount it requested.\r\n\nA.

Section  11 provides, in\r\n\npart:\r\n\n          If   the  court   finds  in   any  action\r\n          commenced hereunder, that there  has been\r\n          a  violation  of   [ch.  93A    2],   the\r\n          petitioner  shall,  in addition  to other\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          relief provided for  by this section  and\r                                                          \r\n          irrespective    of    the    amount    in\r\n          controversy,   be    awarded   reasonable\r\n          attorneys'  fees  and  costs incurred  in\r\n          said action.\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L.  ch.  93A,    11  (emphasis added).    Another\r\n\nprovision in that section states:\r\n\n          [The complainant], if he has not suffered\r\n          any loss of money or property, may obtain\r\n          . . .  an injunction if  it can be  shown\r\n          that   the  .   .  .  unfair   method  of\r\n          competition, act or practice may have the\r\n          effect of causing such  loss of money  or\r\n          property.\r\n\nId.\r               \r\n\n          The  court  instructed the  jury  that a  statutory\r\n\nminimum of  $25 must be  awarded if it  finds that  an unfair\r\n\npractice has occurred under  Sections 2 and 11 of  Mass. Gen.\r\n\nL.  ch. 93A.6  Accordingly,  the jury awarded  $25 in damages\r\n\non  that  claim,  even  though  it  awarded  nothing  on  the\r\n\ninfringement claims.  AASTAR contends that because the jury's\r\n\nverdict indicates that STAR had  not been harmed by  AASTAR's\r\n\nconduct,  attorneys'  fees  are  precluded  under  state  law\r\n\nprecedent.  We disagree.\r\n\n          We note first that  because AASTAR failed to object\r\n\nto the  \"statutory damages\"  instruction, our review  of that\r\n\nissue,  if it  were  necessary  for  our decision,  would  be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  There does not, in fact, appear to be a minimum statutory\r\ndamages provision in the statutes at issue in this case.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\nMass. Gen.

Putting aside that issue for now, we find\r\n\neven  assuming that the jury  had not awarded  any damages on\r\n\nthe unfair  practices claim,  attorneys' fees still  would be\r\n\nwarranted in light of the grant of injunctive relief.\r\n\n          Section 11 provides that  a prevailing claimant  is\r\n\nentitled  to attorneys'  fees  \"in addition  to other  relief\r\n\nprovided  for by this section  and irrespective of the amount\r\n\nin  controversy.\"  Mass. Gen. L. ch.  93A,   11.  The Supreme\r\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted that language\r\n\nto  mean that \"relief solely  in the form  of attorneys' fees\r\n\nmay not be had\" but rather,  \"a plaintiff must be entitled to\r\n\nrelief in  some other respect  in order to be  entitled to an\r\n\naward  of attorneys'  fees.\"   Jet Line,  537 N.E.2d  at 115.\r                                                   \r\n\nAccordingly,  courts have  awarded attorneys'  fees not  only\r\n\nwhen  damages were  awarded,  but also  where,  as here,  the\r\n\nprevailing  plaintiff received injunctive  relief only.

The court\r\n\nalso  opined that even  though the conduct  of STAR's counsel\r\n\nwas  not \"unethical,\"  it was  \"less than  what the  Court is\r\n\nentitled to obtain  from the  attorneys who  practice at  its\r\n\nbar.\"    The  court  concluded  that  counsel's  deficiencies\r\n\n\"stunted the time necessary for discussion of settlement\" and\r\n\nfound \"very questionable\" counsel's unavailability to discuss\r\n\nsettlement  at  all times  prior  to  trial, given  that  the\r\n\ndispute was essentially over damages.\r\n\n          Massachusetts  law  controls  the  attorneys'  fees\r\n\nquestion  here.

In\r                                             \r\n\nmaking this calculation, the court may consider a variety  of\r\n\nfactors,  including:    the  amount  of  time  expended,  the\r\n\ncomplexity of  the legal and  factual issues, the  quality of\r\n\nthe  attorneys'  services,  the  amount of  damages  and  the\r\n\nresults secured.

Larkin, 749  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n945, 950 (1st Cir. 1984).\r\n\n          STAR  first attacks  the court's  initial reduction\r\n\nfrom the requested $35,153.25 to $27,000.  STAR contends that\r\n\nthis reduction resulted from \"mathematical error\" because the\r\n\ncourt erroneously  assumed that counsel charged  $175/hr. for\r\n\nall  of his  work, when in  fact, most  of it  was charged at\r               \r\n\n$150/hr. (while the associate  attorney's work was charged at\r\n\nthe  rate of $125/hr.).  STAR asserts that because only 10.75\r\n\nhours  were  charged  at  $175/hr.,  the  court  should  have\r\n\ndeducted  only  about  $260  (representing   the  approximate\r\n\ndifference between 10.75 billed at $175/hr. and at $150/hr.),\r\n\nrather than the $8,153.25 that it did.\r\n\n          Upon  careful   review  of   the  record,   we  are\r\n\nunpersuaded  by  STAR's  assertion of  \"mathematical  error.\"\r\n\nSTAR's  position assumes  that the  court, when  declining to\r\n\naward  at the  $175/hr. rate  for trial  counsel, necessarily\r\n\nintended  instead to award for his work at the $150/hr. rate.\r\n\nWe find, however, that the numbers simply do not support this\r\n\nunderlying assumption.7\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  STAR's request for some $35,000  in fees, which the court\r\nfound excessive, reflected about 164  hours of work by  trial\r\ncounsel  (some  hours at  the  $150/hr. rate,  others  at the\r\n$175/hr.  rate), and  about  82 hours  of  work by  associate\r\ncounsel (at  a $125/hr. rate),  for a total  of approximately\r\n246 hours.  Simple  division of the awarded  amount ($27,000)\r\nby  the hours expended (246)  reveals that the  court did not\r\nfind  even a $150/hr. rate  reasonable for this  case, not to\r\nmention the $175/hr.  rate.  Thus,  STAR's argument that  the\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n          Moreover, when STAR  clearly laid out this  precise\r\n\nargument  to the  district court in  the form of  a motion to\r\n\namend  or make  additional  findings under  Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\r\n\n52(b), the  court considered and denied  the motion, stating:\r\n\n\"The findings are fully adequate under both state and federal\r\n\nlaw.\"  A fair conclusion from the record is that although the\r\n\ncourt found  that counsel  had in  fact expended the  claimed\r\n\namount  of time  on  the case,  the  simplicity of  the  case\r\n\nrendered  the fees  excessive and  warranted a  reduction for\r\n\nover-lawyering.     Thus,  we  affirm   the  court's  initial\r\n\nreduction from $35,000 to $27,000.\r\n\n          STAR  also contends  that  the court  erred in  its\r\n\nadditional  fees reduction,  from $27,000  to $18,000.   STAR\r\n\nargues that  the articulated  reasons for that  reduction are\r\n\ninsupportable as a  matter of law  and on the  facts of  this\r\n\ncase.   In  particular, STAR  asserts that  when  its counsel\r\n\ninformed  the court of  his planned  hunting trip,  the court\r\n\nstated that  it would \"respect\"  those plans.   STAR contends\r\n\nthat it was  error to  then \"punish\" counsel  for taking  his\r\n\nvacation and being unavailable  to handle any developments in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncourt erroneously  based  its award  on its  belief that  the\r\nhigher  rate  was  excessive  does not  support  its  implied\r\nconclusion that the court  must have found the $150/hr.  rate\r\nto  be reasonable.  Rather,  it appears that  the court found\r\nboth  rates excessive, and  adjusted the  amount accordingly.\r\nSTAR  has not  argued that  the court  erred in  its apparent\r\nfinding that even the $150/hr. rate was excessive or that the\r\ncourt otherwise erred in calculating the lodestar.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nthe  case.8  STAR argues that no reduction should result from\r\n\nits  deletion of a witness because it ultimately produced the\r\n\nwitness (albeit on  the last  day of trial)  and because  the\r\n\ncourt opined that the witness would not have given  testimony\r\n\nfavorable to AASTAR in  any event.  STAR argues  finally that\r\n\n\"stunting the time necessary for discussion of settlement\" is\r\n\nan  impermissible factor  to be  considered in  an attorneys'\r\n\nfees award.\r\n\n          The  district  court  reduced the  attorneys'  fees\r\n\naward from $27,000  to $18,000 because  it found that  STAR's\r\n\ncounsel  had   not  fulfilled   his   obligations  in   trial\r\n\npreparation,    negotiation    and    discovery.        These\r\n\nconsiderations, including \"the stunting of time necessary for\r\n\ndiscussion of settlement,\" plainly  reflect upon the \"quality\r\n\nof  work performed,\" one of  the factors to  be considered in\r\n\ncalculating  the fee award.   See Heller, 382  N.E.2d at 629.\r                                                    \r\n\nWe have  no difficulty finding that  an attorney's competence\r\n\nextends  to her  compliance  with obligations  to the  court,\r\n\nwhich  may  ultimately affect  the value  of services  to her\r\n\nclient.  Thus, the court did not err  in citing these reasons\r\n\nin determining the \"objective worth\" of counsel's services.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  We  find  most unpersuasive  STAR's  additional assertion\r\nthat, had  counsel not taken  his planned vacation,  he would\r\nhave \"necessarily\" spent more  time preparing the case which,\r\nin turn, would have resulted in additional attorneys' fees.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n          We also uphold  the district court's  determination\r\n\nthat the  facts of  this case  merit the reduction.9   As  to\r\n\nSTAR's assertion  that the court  first \"respected\" counsel's\r\n\nvacation plans but then  \"punished\" him for it, we  note that\r\n\nthe  court respected  counsel's  plans only  insofar as  they\r\n\naffected  the trial date; in no manner did the court indicate\r\n\nthat counsel was otherwise excused from his trial obligations\r\n\nwhile  he was on the hunt.   With regard to counsel's failure\r\n\nto  produce a witness, in  defiance of the  court's order, we\r\n\nthink that whether or  not the witness ultimately  would have\r\n\nhelped  AASTAR is  irrelevant to counsel's  initial discovery\r\n\nobligation.   Finally,  we reject  STAR's assertion  that the\r\n\ncourt penalized  counsel for  not settling the  case; rather,\r\n\nthe court  found that  counsel's deficiencies  in performance\r\n\nhindered  the  opportunity  for settlement,  thus  negatively\r                                      \r\n\nreflecting upon his services.   We cannot say that  the court\r\n\nabused its broad discretion in making these determinations.\r\n\n          Therefore,   we   affirm   the   district   court's\r\n\nattorneys' fees award in all respects.10\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  While STAR argues that the reasons for  the fee reduction\r\nwere  erroneous, it  does not  argue that  the degree  of the\r\nreduction was unreasonable.\r\n\n10.  The court ordered  AASTAR to  pay costs  \"in the  amount\r\nprayed for,\" which was $2,588.24, and AASTAR has  not opposed\r\nthe  amount of that request.   Thus, we  will not disturb the\r\ncosts award to STAR in the amount of $2,588.24.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  we affirm the fee award\r                                                           \r\n\nand judgment of the district court.\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n",

Shortly thereafter, the court found AASTAR\r\n\nto  be in  civil contempt  for violating  the  injunction and\r\n\nawarded attorneys' fees and costs  to STAR stemming from  the\r\n\ncontempt proceedings.\r\n\n          Both  parties  appeal.   AASTAR  contends  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law,  denying its request for  a trial continuance,\r\n\nholding  AASTAR  in civil  contempt  and  awarding attorneys'\r\n\nfees.   STAR appeals the  court's reduction in  the requested\r\n\namount of  attorneys' fees.

Thus, we present  the facts in\r\n\nthe light most favorable to STAR as the jury could have found\r\n\nthem.\r\n\nB.  Facts\r                     \r\n\n          STAR is in the business  of \"mortgage originating\";\r\n\nit receives information from individuals seeking  real estate\r\n\nmortgage loans, completes applications with that information,\r\n\nand then searches  the secondary market for a  lender willing\r\n\nto offer the  mortgage sought.  STAR  has operated throughout\r\n\nMassachusetts since its incorporation in 1993.\r\n\n          In January  1994, STAR registered its  service mark\r\n\n(which  it had used since the time of its incorporation) with\r\n\nthe Massachusetts  Secretary of  State.   At that time,  STAR\r\n\nalso  applied   for,  and  eventually   received,  a  federal\r\n\nregistration of the  mark.   The mark consisted  of the  word\r\n\n\"STAR\" in bold, capital letters with a five-point star symbol\r\n\nin  the  upper  portion  of  the  letter  \"R\"  and  the  word\r\n\n\"MORTGAGE\"  in  smaller  capital  letters  beneath  the  word\r\n\n\"STAR.\"\r\n\n          STAR used the mark  in all of its advertising.   It\r\n\nspent  about   $2,000  per  month  (of   its  $5,000  monthly\r\n\nadvertising budget) for  advertisements in the  Suburban Real\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nEstate News  (\"The Suburban\"), a free  publication about real\r                                       \r\n\nestate issued  in  several regional  editions  (e.g.,  north,\r                                                                \r\n\nwest,  south)  and   distributed  throughout   Massachusetts.\r\n\nSTAR's advertisements in The Suburban typically touted, inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia, access to various mortgage programs, favorable interest\r                \r\n\nrates, low closing costs, timely credit approval and low down\r\n\npayments.\r\n\n          In May  1994,  AASTAR commenced  offering  mortgage\r\n\noriginating  services in  the  Massachusetts area.   It  also\r\n\nplaced  advertisements  in  The  Suburban  that,  like STAR's\r                                                     \r\n\nadvertisements,  promised  a  variety  of  mortgage programs,\r\n\nfavorable  interest  rates,  low  closing  costs  and  timely\r\n\napprovals.   These advertisements  typically would  include a\r\n\n\"closing cost  certificate\" to be clipped  out, entitling the\r\n\nbearer to a $500.00 credit toward closing costs.\r\n\n          AASTAR's advertisements contained the business name\r\n\n\"AASTAR MORTGAGE CORP.\" in bold, capital letters.   Its first\r\n\nadvertisement  in  The Suburban  depicted  a five-point  star\r                                           \r\n\nsymbol superimposed over the  first \"A\" in \"AASTAR.\"   At one\r\n\ntime, AASTAR's  business cards also depicted  the star symbol\r\n\nin that same letter,  but eventually the symbol was  moved to\r\n\nthe third and last \"A\" in \"AASTAR.\"  \r\n\n          STAR's  president,  Jay  Austin,  noticed  AASTAR's\r\n\nadvertisement in a May 1994 edition of The Suburban.  He then\r                                                               \r\n\nwrote various letters to AASTAR's officers, informing them of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhis  registered  mark,  requesting  them  to  cease  business\r\n\noperations  under the \"AASTAR\" name and advising them to take\r\n\nvarious remedial actions.  AASTAR did not respond.\r\n\n          Actual   customers   confused   the  two   mortgage\r\n\noriginating companies.  In November 1995, a STAR customer who\r\n\nhad  already completed  an application  walked into  the STAR\r\n\noffice with a copy of The Suburban and asked why  she was not\r                                              \r\n\noffered the  rate advertised.  Austin  explained that AASTAR,\r\n\nnot  STAR, was advertising that rate.  On another occasion, a\r\n\ncustomer who had completed an application at STAR returned to\r\n\nits office with  AASTAR's closing-cost coupon  and, believing\r\n\nthe advertisement was for STAR's services, asked for the $500\r\n\ncredit.  On yet a different occasion in July 1994, a customer\r\n\nhad almost  completed an  application when she  presented the\r\n\nSTAR loan  originator with AASTAR's  $500 coupon.   The  loan\r\n\noriginator explained  that the customer had  confused the two\r\n\ncompanies, and  after conferring with  a supervisor, credited\r\n\nthe customer the $500.\r\n\n          Potential   customers   also   confused   the   two\r\n\ncompanies.  Austin  would call individuals who had  placed an\r\n\ninitial call  to STAR to  inquire into its  services; several\r\n\ntimes  during  these follow-up  calls,  the  individual would\r\n\nindicate  that   he  or   she  had  \"already\"   completed  an\r\n\napplication with STAR.  When the person's name did not appear\r\n\nin  STAR's records, Austin would call again to inquire if the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nperson was \"sure\" the application was with STAR; the response\r\n\nwould  be affirmative.  Austin  would then inquire  if it was\r\n\nwith  \"AASTAR\" or  \"STAR\";  at this  point  the person  would\r\n\nindicate, \"oh, it was AASTAR.\"\r\n\nC.  Discussion\r                          \r\n\n          The purpose of trademark laws is to prevent the use\r\n\nof  the same  or similar  marks  in a  way that  confuses the\r\n\npublic about  the  actual source  of  the goods  or  service.\r\n\nDeCosta  v.

AASTAR attacks the\r                              \r\n\nevidence as to each factor.\r\n\n          1.  Similarity of the marks\r                                                 \r\n\n          A jury  plainly could infer from  the evidence that\r\n\nthe   designations  \"STAR  MORTGAGE\"  and  \"AASTAR  MORTGAGE\"\r\n\n(including  the star symbols)  were sufficiently similar such\r\n\nthat  prospective  purchasers  might  be  confused  about the\r\n\nsource of the  services desired.

Relationship  between  the  parties'\r                                                                         \r\n\nadvertising, the parties' channels  of trade, and the classes\r                                                                         \r\n\nof prospective purchasers.3\r                                     \r\n\n          The parties  both advertised in The  Suburban, thus\r                                                                   \r\n\nproviding evidence of overlap in their advertising strategies\r\n\nand targets.   AASTAR attempts to  minimize this evidence  by\r\n\npointing  to the  undisputed evidence  that it  advertised in\r\n\nmany publications  in which  STAR did  not;  it asserts  that\r\n\nthus,  the  parties \"did  not  compete\"  in those  particular\r\n\nadvertising channels.

This evidence,\r\n\ncombined with the fact that both companies  advertised in the\r\n\nsame publication,  would allow  a jury  to  view these  three\r\n\nfactors  (channels  of  advertising,  trade,  and  classes of\r\n\npurchasers) in STAR's favor.\r\n\n          AASTAR additionally argues  that the trial evidence\r\n\nestablished that mortgage-shoppers  are highly  sophisticated\r\n\nand  exercise great care in choosing a mortgage (often a one-\r\n\ntime  purchase)  and thus,  the  likelihood  of confusion  is\r\n\nminimal.   While this argument  is not without  force, a jury\r\n\ncould find that this  evidence did not overwhelm the  bulk of\r\n\nother evidence suggestive of confusion.\r\n\n          6.  Actual Confusion\r                                          \r\n\n          AASTAR  concedes that STAR  presented evidence that\r\n\nthe companies'  names actually  confused consumers  about the\r\n\nsource of the services sought.  AASTAR challenges the  weight\r\n\nof this evidence,  however, arguing that it  was presented by\r\n\n\"biased\" STAR employees.  AASTAR also complains that  most of\r\n\nthe  purportedly  confused  customers  were  not  identified.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nThese  arguments,  however, properly  belong before  the fact\r\n\nfinder;  our  review  of  the  record  reveals  that  a  jury\r\n\nreasonably could have credited the testimony regarding actual\r\n\nconfusion in favor of STAR.4\r\n\n          7.  Intent\r                                \r\n\n          AASTAR makes  much of the  fact that  there was  no\r\n\nevidence that it  adopted its business  name in \"bad  faith,\"\r\n\ni.e.,  with the intent  to take advantage  of STAR's goodwill\r                \r\n\nand  promotion efforts.    Evidence of  bad intent,  however,\r\n\nwhile potentially  probative of likelihood  of confusion,  is\r\n\nsimply   not  required  in  a  trademark  infringement  case;\r\n\nmoreover, \"a finding of good faith is no answer if likelihood\r\n\nof  confusion  is  otherwise  established.\"    President  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nTrustees of Colby College v.

While we agree with the district court that\r\nSTAR  was  less than  forthcoming  in  meeting its  discovery\r\nobligations, the court  adequately addressed  the problem  by\r\nprecluding  STAR  from  presenting certain  witnesses  and by\r\nproviding   an  adverse   inference  instruction   about  one\r\ncustomer.    In the  end,  AASTAR's  discovery arguments  are\r\nirrelevant to  the  weight a  jury  could give  the  evidence\r\nbefore it (on proper instructions).\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nIn assessing a mark's  strength, the trier of  fact considers\r\n\nevidence of  the length of time  the mark has  been used, its\r\n\nrenown  in  the  plaintiff's   field  of  business,  and  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  actions   to   promote   the   mark.

The  relevant evidence presented  here was\r\n\nthat STAR's mark  was in use in the  relevant market area for\r\n\nover  two years at the time of  trial, and that STAR expended\r\n\nseveral thousand dollars per month in advertising.\r\n\n          Even  assuming that this evidence constitutes small\r\n\nsupport  for this factor (and, in fact, STAR admitted at oral\r\n\nargument  before  this  court  that the  mark  was  not  very\r\n\nstrong),  \"the strength  of  the mark  is  but one  of  eight\r\n\nfactors  to  be considered  in  analyzing  the likelihood  of\r\n\nconfusion  issue\"  and sufficient  evidence of  other factors\r\n\nwill  sustain a finding of  likelihood of confusion.

A   jury  could\r\n\nsupportably  find  that  the  marks and  services  were  very\r\n\nsimilar, the targeted consumers were the same, and there  was\r\n\nactual confusion as  to the source of  the mortgage services.\r\n\nA  jury also could have  given little relative  weight to the\r\n\nless-supported factors  of intent  and strength of  the mark.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nWhile  the  evidence supporting  a substantial  likelihood of\r\n\nconfusion may  not have  been overwhelming, it  was adequate;\r\n\nthe court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law, and we will not disturb the jury's verdict.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                 Denial of Trial Continuance\r                             Denial of Trial Continuance\r                                                        \r\n\n          AASTAR   contends   that  the   court   abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion  in refusing to  grant its motion  to continue the\r\n\ntrial.   On the  first day  of trial,  AASTAR filed  a motion\r\n\nentitled  \"DEFENDANT'S MOTION  TO CONTINUE  TRIAL OR,  IN THE\r\n\nALTERNATIVE, MOTION IN LIMINE.\"  In that motion, AASTAR urged\r\n\nthat  a  continuance was  warranted  because  STAR failed  to\r\n\nproduce a witness for deposition despite the court's order to\r\n\ndo  so,  and  because  STAR  was  effectively  \"stonewalling\"\r\n\ndiscovery.\r\n\n          AASTAR's  continuance  motion  also  requested  the\r\n\nalternative  relief of  preclusion  of testimony  by  certain\r\n\nwitnesses and  preclusion of testimony by  Austin relating to\r\n\ncertain previously  unproduced documents.   The record  shows\r\n\nthat the court granted the \"alternative relief\" -- the motion\r\n\nin limine -- and  that indeed, the witnesses in  question did\r\n\nnot testify.\r\n\n          AASTAR  now complains that  Austin was  \"allowed to\r\n\ntestify  unrestricted\" and  attempts to  assign error  to the\r\n\ncourt's refusal to grant the continuance.  We are unpersuaded\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nfor  two reasons.    First, having  received the  alternative\r\n\nrelief  it requested,  AASTAR  cannot now  complain that  the\r\n\ncourt did  not grant the  continuance.  Second,  while Austin\r\n\nwas allowed to testify about various documents that may  have\r\n\nfallen  within the  in limine  order, the  record reveals  no\r\n\nobjection by AASTAR on  this basis during Austin's testimony.\r\n\nOn the  contrary, in  response to  the trial judge's  careful\r\n\ninquiries, AASTAR indicated that it had no  objection to most\r\n\nof the documents introduced through Austin.5\r\n\n          In sum, we find  AASTAR's contention that the court\r\n\nerred  in denying its request  for a trial  continuance to be\r\n\nwithout merit.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                  The Civil Contempt Finding\r                              The Civil Contempt Finding\r                                                        \r\n\n          After the jury returned its verdict on November 30,\r\n\n1995,  the  district  court  issued  a permanent  injunction,\r\n\nreflected in the following exchange:\r\n\n               THE  COURT:   In view of  the jury's\r\n          verdict,  the  defendant Aastar  Mortgage\r\n          Corporation,   its   agents,    servants,\r\n          employees, and all  other persons  acting\r\n          in   concert    therewith,   are   hereby\r\n          permanently  enjoined from  continuing to\r\n          do business  under the name and  style of\r\n          Aastar Mortgage Corporation with  two A's\r\n          before   the   style,   Aastar   Mortgage\r\n          Corporation with one  A before the style,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.

MURRAY  [Counsel  for  AASTAR]:\r\n          Your Honor,  may I be heard  on one other\r\n          thing?\r\n          . . . .\r\n          There  are  presently  several loans  and\r\n          consumers about to close within  the next\r\n          week   where   the  paperwork   has  been\r\n          submitted  on HUD  forms and  things like\r\n          that.  In light  of the fact that there's\r\n          no  damage that's been found that relates\r\n          to the  plaintiffs in this  case relative\r\n          to the  use of that name, the defendants,\r\n          in  order  to  provide  no  harm  to  the\r\n          consumer, would like to  be able to close\r\n          those loans with  the understanding  that\r\n          there  would be  no  publication  and  no\r\n          advertising relative to --\r\n\n               THE COURT:  Any  forms that are  out\r\n          of Aastar's office, either now before HUD\r\n          or any lending  institution, they are not\r\n          in my requirement of use of best efforts,\r\n          they do  not have to recall  any consumer\r\n          forms.   No  more forms  go out  with the\r\n          word  Aastar  starting  now.     Tomorrow\r\n          morning  no form,  no paper  goes  out of\r\n          that  office  using  Aastar,   single  or\r\n          double A's,  using the star or  using the\r\n          word S T A R.\r\n               That's the order of the Court.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          About  one  week   after  the  injunction   issued,\r\n\nemployees  at AASTAR sent  name-change facsimiles  to several\r\n\nmortgage lenders.  These  notices displayed the \"AASTAR\" logo\r\n\n(containing  a star symbol in  the third \"A\")  in large, bold\r\n\nletters at the top of the page, and thereafter stated, \"WE'VE\r\n\nCHANGED  OUR NAME;  WE  ARE NOW  KNOWN  AS: AACTION  MORTGAGE\r\n\nCORP.; PLEASE CORRECT YOUR RECORDS.\" STAR's           counsel\r\n\nimmediately notified AASTAR's counsel about  the notices, and\r\n\nAASTAR ceased using them.  Over one month later, after it had\r\n\nmoved  and argued  for  attorneys' fees  from the  underlying\r\n\naction,  STAR filed a motion for civil contempt stemming from\r\n\nthe   use  of  the  facsimiles.    The  court  then  held  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing on that motion.\r\n\n          At the  hearing, employees of AASTAR  (now AACTION)\r\n\nadmitted  to  transmitting the  facsimiles,  but  professed a\r\n\nbelief that such  notices were in compliance with the court's\r\n\norder,  as  modified.   Specifically,  they  stated that  the\r\n\nnotices were sent only to lenders with loans in progress, and\r\n\nexplained that \"their interpretation\"  of the injunction  was\r\n\nthat  the court only  ordered them to \"do  the best that they\r\n\ncould\" with respect to pending  loans.  One witness indicated\r\n\nthat  he  thought he  could \"go  a  little further\"  than the\r\n\ncourt's injunction by informing  lenders (that, he said, were\r\n\nprocessing loans that were \"out of AASTAR's control\")  of the\r\n\nname  change with the facsimiles.  When queried by the court,\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nhowever,  all  of   the  witnesses  acknowledged  that   they\r\n\nunderstood the court's order  -- specifically, \"no paper goes\r\n\nout of that office using Aastar\" -- and that the notices fell\r\n\nwithin that language.\r\n\n          In explaining  its ruling on the  motion, the court\r\n\nacknowledged AASTAR's substantial efforts  to comply with the\r\n\ninjunction,  but stated  that the  wording of  the  order was\r\n\nclear and  unambiguous  and that  if there  were any  doubts,\r\n\nclarification or modification from the court should have been\r\n\nsought.   The  court  found that  AASTAR,  \"in an  effort  to\r\n\npreserve  the   goodwill  to   which  [it]  had   no  right,\"\r\n\ndeliberately disobeyed the order.   Having found a \"clear and\r\n\nundoubted  disobedience,\"  the  court held  AASTAR  in  civil\r\n\ncontempt, and ordered it  to pay attorneys' fees to  STAR (in\r\n\nthe amount of $750) as well as costs associated with bringing\r\n\nthe contempt proceeding.\r\n\n          On appeal, AASTAR contends that the civil  contempt\r\n\nfinding was \"unfair\" because the injunction was overly broad,\r\n\nambiguous, and impossible to comply with.  We disagree.  As a\r\n\npreliminary  matter,  we  note  that nothing  in  the  record\r\n\nindicates  that  AASTAR  objected   to  the  breadth  of  the\r\n\ninjunction,  or complained  of  impossibility  of  compliance\r\n\neither  before,  during  or  after  the contempt  proceeding.\r\n\nAASTAR  raises these issues for  the first time  on appeal in\r\n\nits  effort to avoid the  contempt citation, and  it does not\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nargue  that  it  continues   to  suffer  from  the  purported\r\n\noverbreadth.  Thus, we will discuss the issues of the breadth\r\n\nand  ability to  comply only  insofar as  they relate  to the\r\n\ncivil contempt adjudication.\r\n\n          Next,  we agree  with the  district court  that the\r\n\ninjunctive  order was  not  ambiguous.   See  11A Charles  A.\r                                                        \r\n\nWright et  al., Federal Practice and  Procedure   2960 (1995)\r                                                           \r\n\n(explaining that,  in  civil-contempt proceeding,  the  court\r\n\nmust find that  the order  was clear and  unambiguous).   The\r\n\ncourt  ordered  AASTAR to  cease all  use  of the  trade name\r\n\n\"AASTAR\" or  its  star logo,  to  refrain from  referring  to\r\n\nitself as  \"formerly Aastar  Mortgage,\" and  to use  its best\r\n\nefforts to  recall or cancel advertising  with the infringing\r\n\nmark.   In response to  AASTAR's inquiry about  pending loans\r\n\nand already-submitted paperwork, the court explained that any\r\n\nsuch paperwork  was not  within its  requirement to use  best\r                                                                         \r\n\nefforts to recall.  The court completed  its injunctive order\r                             \r\n\nwith the  following unequivocal  language: \"No more  forms go\r\n\nout with the word  Aastar starting now.  Tomorrow  morning no\r\n\nform, no paper goes out  of that office using Aastar.\"   That\r\n\ndirective was clear.\r\n\n          Based on  the evidence, we conclude  that the court\r\n\nsupportably found that AASTAR deliberately  and unjustifiably\r\n\ndisobeyed the injunction.  AASTAR's employees testified  that\r\n\nthey  did not intend to violate the injunction, and that they\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ntransmitted the  facsimiles in  the belief that  that conduct\r\n\nwas  in  compliance with  the  order.    Such assertions  are\r\n\nunavailing, however,  because good  faith, or the  absence of\r\n\nwillfulness, does not relieve a party from civil contempt  in\r\n\nthe face of a clear order.  McComb v.

See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 93A,    11.  AASTAR\r                                  \r\n\nargues that  the court erred by awarding  attorneys' fees for\r\n\ntwo reasons:  (1) the  court erroneously instructed  the jury\r\n\nthat, even if  it found no  actual damages, it  must award  a\r\n\nminimum  statutory  damage  of  $25.00, and  (2)  because  no\r\n\ndamages were \"actually\" found, recovery of attorneys' fees is\r\n\nprecluded.   STAR contends that the court erred awarding less\r\n\nthan the amount it requested.\r\n\nA.  Propriety of Attorneys' Fees Award\r                                                  \r\n\n          STAR prevailed on its  unfair practices claim under\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,    2 and 11.  Section  11 provides, in\r\n\npart:\r\n\n          If   the  court   finds  in   any  action\r\n          commenced hereunder, that there  has been\r\n          a  violation  of   [ch.  93A    2],   the\r\n          petitioner  shall,  in addition  to other\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          relief provided for  by this section  and\r                                                          \r\n          irrespective    of    the    amount    in\r\n          controversy,   be    awarded   reasonable\r\n          attorneys'  fees  and  costs incurred  in\r\n          said action.\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L.  ch.  93A,    11  (emphasis added).    Another\r\n\nprovision in that section states:\r\n\n          [The complainant], if he has not suffered\r\n          any loss of money or property, may obtain\r\n          . . .  an injunction if  it can be  shown\r\n          that   the  .   .  .  unfair   method  of\r\n          competition, act or practice may have the\r\n          effect of causing such  loss of money  or\r\n          property.\r\n\nId.\r               \r\n\n          The  court  instructed the  jury  that a  statutory\r\n\nminimum of  $25 must be  awarded if it  finds that  an unfair\r\n\npractice has occurred under  Sections 2 and 11 of  Mass. Gen.\r\n\nL.  ch. 93A.6  Accordingly,  the jury awarded  $25 in damages\r\n\non  that  claim,  even  though  it  awarded  nothing  on  the\r\n\ninfringement claims.  AASTAR contends that because the jury's\r\n\nverdict indicates that STAR had  not been harmed by  AASTAR's\r\n\nconduct,  attorneys'  fees  are  precluded  under  state  law\r\n\nprecedent.  We disagree.\r\n\n          We note first that  because AASTAR failed to object\r\n\nto the  \"statutory damages\"  instruction, our review  of that\r\n\nissue,  if it  were  necessary  for  our decision,  would  be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  There does not, in fact, appear to be a minimum statutory\r\ndamages provision in the statutes at issue in this case.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\nMass. Gen. L. ch.  93A   9(a) (providing, in some  cases, for\r\nminimum damages award of $25).\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nseriously limited.  Putting aside that issue for now, we find\r\n\neven  assuming that the jury  had not awarded  any damages on\r\n\nthe unfair  practices claim,  attorneys' fees still  would be\r\n\nwarranted in light of the grant of injunctive relief.\r\n\n          Section 11 provides that  a prevailing claimant  is\r\n\nentitled  to attorneys'  fees  \"in addition  to other  relief\r\n\nprovided  for by this section  and irrespective of the amount\r\n\nin  controversy.\"  Mass. Gen. L. ch.  93A,   11.  The Supreme\r\n\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted that language\r\n\nto  mean that \"relief solely  in the form  of attorneys' fees\r\n\nmay not be had\" but rather,  \"a plaintiff must be entitled to\r\n\nrelief in  some other respect  in order to be  entitled to an\r\n\naward  of attorneys'  fees.\"   Jet Line,  537 N.E.2d  at 115.\r                                                   \r\n\nAccordingly,  courts have  awarded attorneys'  fees not  only\r\n\nwhen  damages were  awarded,  but also  where,  as here,  the\r\n\nprevailing  plaintiff received injunctive  relief only.

STAR contends that\r\n\nthis reduction resulted from \"mathematical error\" because the\r\n\ncourt erroneously  assumed that counsel charged  $175/hr. for\r\n\nall  of his  work, when in  fact, most  of it  was charged at\r               \r\n\n$150/hr. (while the associate  attorney's work was charged at\r\n\nthe  rate of $125/hr.).  STAR asserts that because only 10.75\r\n\nhours  were  charged  at  $175/hr.,  the  court  should  have\r\n\ndeducted  only  about  $260  (representing   the  approximate\r\n\ndifference between 10.75 billed at $175/hr. and at $150/hr.),\r\n\nrather than the $8,153.25 that it did.\r\n\n          Upon  careful   review  of   the  record,   we  are\r\n\nunpersuaded  by  STAR's  assertion of  \"mathematical  error.\"\r\n\nSTAR's  position assumes  that the  court, when  declining to\r\n\naward  at the  $175/hr. rate  for trial  counsel, necessarily\r\n\nintended  instead to award for his work at the $150/hr. rate.\r\n\nWe find, however, that the numbers simply do not support this\r\n\nunderlying assumption.7\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  STAR's request for some $35,000  in fees, which the court\r\nfound excessive, reflected about 164  hours of work by  trial\r\ncounsel  (some  hours at  the  $150/hr. rate,  others  at the\r\n$175/hr.  rate), and  about  82 hours  of  work by  associate\r\ncounsel (at  a $125/hr. rate),  for a total  of approximately\r\n246 hours.  Simple  division of the awarded  amount ($27,000)\r\nby  the hours expended (246)  reveals that the  court did not\r\nfind  even a $150/hr. rate  reasonable for this  case, not to\r\nmention the $175/hr.  rate.  Thus,  STAR's argument that  the\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n          Moreover, when STAR  clearly laid out this  precise\r\n\nargument  to the  district court in  the form of  a motion to\r\n\namend  or make  additional  findings under  Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\r\n\n52(b), the  court considered and denied  the motion, stating:\r\n\n\"The findings are fully adequate under both state and federal\r\n\nlaw.\"  A fair conclusion from the record is that although the\r\n\ncourt found  that counsel  had in  fact expended the  claimed\r\n\namount  of time  on  the case,  the  simplicity of  the  case\r\n\nrendered  the fees  excessive and  warranted a  reduction for\r\n\nover-lawyering.     Thus,  we  affirm   the  court's  initial\r\n\nreduction from $35,000 to $27,000.\r\n\n          STAR  also contends  that  the court  erred in  its\r\n\nadditional  fees reduction,  from $27,000  to $18,000.   STAR\r\n\nargues that  the articulated  reasons for that  reduction are\r\n\ninsupportable as a  matter of law  and on the  facts of  this\r\n\ncase.   In  particular, STAR  asserts that  when  its counsel\r\n\ninformed  the court of  his planned  hunting trip,  the court\r\n\nstated that  it would \"respect\"  those plans.   STAR contends\r\n\nthat it was  error to  then \"punish\" counsel  for taking  his\r\n\nvacation and being unavailable  to handle any developments in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ncourt erroneously  based  its award  on its  belief that  the\r\nhigher  rate  was  excessive  does not  support  its  implied\r\nconclusion that the court  must have found the $150/hr.  rate\r\nto  be reasonable.  Rather,  it appears that  the court found\r\nboth  rates excessive, and  adjusted the  amount accordingly.\r\nSTAR  has not  argued that  the court  erred in  its apparent\r\nfinding that even the $150/hr. rate was excessive or that the\r\ncourt otherwise erred in calculating the lodestar.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nthe  case.8  STAR argues that no reduction should result from\r\n\nits  deletion of a witness because it ultimately produced the\r\n\nwitness (albeit on  the last  day of trial)  and because  the\r\n\ncourt opined that the witness would not have given  testimony\r\n\nfavorable to AASTAR in  any event.  STAR argues  finally that\r\n\n\"stunting the time necessary for discussion of settlement\" is\r\n\nan  impermissible factor  to be  considered in  an attorneys'\r\n\nfees award.\r\n\n          The  district  court  reduced the  attorneys'  fees\r\n\naward from $27,000  to $18,000 because  it found that  STAR's\r\n\ncounsel  had   not  fulfilled   his   obligations  in   trial\r\n\npreparation,    negotiation    and    discovery.        These\r\n\nconsiderations, including \"the stunting of time necessary for\r\n\ndiscussion of settlement,\" plainly  reflect upon the \"quality\r\n\nof  work performed,\" one of  the factors to  be considered in\r\n\ncalculating  the fee award.   See Heller, 382  N.E.2d at 629.\r                                                    \r\n\nWe have  no difficulty finding that  an attorney's competence\r\n\nextends  to her  compliance  with obligations  to the  court,\r\n\nwhich  may  ultimately affect  the value  of services  to her\r\n\nclient.  Thus, the court did not err  in citing these reasons\r\n\nin determining the \"objective worth\" of counsel's services.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  We  find  most unpersuasive  STAR's  additional assertion\r\nthat, had  counsel not taken  his planned vacation,  he would\r\nhave \"necessarily\" spent more  time preparing the case which,\r\nin turn, would have resulted in additional attorneys' fees.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n          We also uphold  the district court's  determination\r\n\nthat the  facts of  this case  merit the reduction.9   As  to\r\n\nSTAR's assertion  that the court  first \"respected\" counsel's\r\n\nvacation plans but then  \"punished\" him for it, we  note that\r\n\nthe  court respected  counsel's  plans only  insofar as  they\r\n\naffected  the trial date; in no manner did the court indicate\r\n\nthat counsel was otherwise excused from his trial obligations\r\n\nwhile  he was on the hunt.   With regard to counsel's failure\r\n\nto  produce a witness, in  defiance of the  court's order, we\r\n\nthink that whether or  not the witness ultimately  would have\r\n\nhelped  AASTAR is  irrelevant to counsel's  initial discovery\r\n\nobligation.   Finally,  we reject  STAR's assertion  that the\r\n\ncourt penalized  counsel for  not settling the  case; rather,\r\n\nthe court  found that  counsel's deficiencies  in performance\r\n\nhindered  the  opportunity  for settlement,  thus  negatively\r                                      \r\n\nreflecting upon his services.   We cannot say that  the court\r\n\nabused its broad discretion in making these determinations.\r\n\n          Therefore,   we   affirm   the   district   court's\r\n\nattorneys' fees award in all respects.10\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r                                            \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  While STAR argues that the reasons for  the fee reduction\r\nwere  erroneous, it  does not  argue that  the degree  of the\r\nreduction was unreasonable.\r\n\n10.  The court ordered  AASTAR to  pay costs  \"in the  amount\r\nprayed for,\" which was $2,588.24, and AASTAR has  not opposed\r\nthe  amount of that request.   Thus, we  will not disturb the\r\ncosts award to STAR in the amount of $2,588.24.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  we affirm the fee award\r                                                           \r\n\nand judgment of the district court.\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n</pre>",
