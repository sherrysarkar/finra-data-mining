Pedro Luis Ramirez-Rivera\n\n(\"Ramirez-Rivera\") appeals from a sentence imposed following the\n\nrevocation of a 4-year term of supervised release. Ramirez-Rivera\n\ncontends that the district court erred by taking into account his need\n\nfor intensive substance abuse and psychological treatment in a\n\nstructured environment when it sentenced him, after that revocation, to\n\na prison term of 24 months. Although he did not present the argument\n\nto the district court, he argues on appeal that this sentence must be\n\nvacated because, under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 994(k),\n\nfederal courts are precluded from sentencing such defendants to terms\n\nof imprisonment for purposes of rehabilitation or medical care. We\n\nfind the argument has been waived and affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                           I.   BACKGROUND\n\n          A jury convicted Ramirez-Rivera of conspiracy to possess and\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1) and of the use of a firearm in a drug\n\nrelated offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1). On June 4,\n\n1992, the district court sentenced Ramirez-Rivera to a prison term of\n\n130 months,1 as well as a 4-year period of supervised release. On\n\n\n     1     On a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, the\ndistrict court vacated his sentence for the firearm conviction under §\n924(c)(1), reducing his prison sentence to 70 months. This did not\naffect the term of supervised release.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fNovember 14, 1996, Ramirez-Rivera was released from prison. On August\n\n18, 1999, the district court revoked Ramirez-Rivera’s supervised\n\nrelease and committed him to the custody of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons\n\nfor a term of 24 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a)(2)(D) and\n\n3583(e)(3).\n\n          The facts leading to the revocation of the term of supervised\n\nrelease can be summarized as follows. After his release, in December\n\n1997 Ramirez-Rivera successfully completed an ambulatory drug program\n\nrequired by the probation office.      On March 8, 1999, however, he\n\nrefused to provide a urine specimen to his probation officer. When\n\ninterviewed by his probation officer, Ramirez-Rivera admitted that he\n\nhad used illegal narcotics. As a result of this admission, the U.S.\n\nProbation Office referred Ramirez-Rivera to the Hogar CREA Residential\n\nDetoxification Program, located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Hogar\n\nCREA admitted Ramirez-Rivera on March 9, 1999, but, due to his hostile\n\nattitude towards Hogar CREA’s staff, the probation office removed and\n\nreferred him to Hogar CREA La Quinta in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico.\n\n          Following a series of incidents involving Ramirez-Rivera’s\n\ninability to adjust to his new environment, coupled with his generally\n\nnegative attitude towards rehabilitation, the district court issued an\n\norder requiring Ramirez-Rivera to show cause why his supervision term\n\nshould not be revoked. On April 20, 1999, the district court held,\n\nover the government’s objection, that it would modify Ramirez-Rivera’s\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fconditions of supervised release. The district court ordered Ramirez-\n\nRivera to be placed in a community corrections center (CCC) for a\n\nperiod of 6 months and to pay the cost of his confinement as required\n\nby the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Furthermore, the district court ordered\n\nRamirez-Rivera to remain detained at Hogar CREA La Quinta until the\n\nBureau of Prisons referred him to the CCC.\n\n           On July 15, 1999, Ramirez-Rivera again failed to comply with\n\nthe terms of his modified supervised release. He admitted that he had\n\nbeen removed from the CCC because he had not complied with CCC\n\nregulations. Moreover, Ramirez-Rivera admitted that he had failed to\n\nreport, as instructed by his probation officer, on July 8 , July 15, and\n\nJuly 19, 1999.\n\n           As a result of these violations, on August 18, 1999, the\n\ndistrict court revoked the terms and conditions of supervised release\n\noriginally imposed on June 4, 1992. The district court ruled that\n\nRamirez-Rivera’s transgressions constituted a Grade C violation under\n\nthe provisions of § 7B1.1(a)(3) of the United States Sentencing\n\nCommission's policy statements. The district court further held that,\n\ngiven Ramirez-Rivera’s prior criminal history, § 7B1.4 of the\n\nSentencing Commission's policy statements called for a prison term\n\nranging from 3 to 9 months. Nonetheless, the district court determined\n\nthat Ramirez-Rivera’s need for an intensive substance abuse and\n\npsychological treatment in a structured environment justified a\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fsentence above the sentence range recommended by the Sentencing\n\nCommission's policy statement. The district court then sentenced\n\nRamirez-Rivera to a prison term of 24 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a)(2)(D) and 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).\n\n                          II.   DISCUSSION\n\n          The issues on appeal are whether Ramirez-Rivera has waived\n\nthe statutory argument, and if so, whether the district court abused\n\nits discretion when it considered Ramirez-Rivera’s drug rehabilitation\n\nneeds, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D) and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(e)(3), in imposing a sentence beyond the recommended range.\n\n          If defendant’s argument properly presented a question of\n\nstatutory interpretation, that would be reviewed de novo. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Koon, 518 U.S. 81, 100 (1996); United States v.\n\nO'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 294 (1st Cir. 1993). The government contends that\n\nRamirez-Rivera waived any issue of statutory interpretation2 when he\n\n\n     2     The question is whether the prohibition contained in 18\nU.S.C. § 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 994(k) -- namely, that imprisonment is\ninappropriate for the purpose of rehabilitating or promoting a\ndefendant’s medical needs -- bars district courts from considering a\ndefendant’s rehabilitation or medical needs when imposing a prison term\nupon the revocation of supervised release. There is a division of\nopinion on this issue. See United States v. Anderson, 15 F.3d 278, 282\n(2d Cir. 1994) (\"a court may consider an offender’s medical and\ncorrectional needs when requiring that offender to serve time in prison\nupon the revocation of supervised release\"); United States v. Brown,\n224 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Giddings,\n37 F.3d 1091, 1096-97 (5th Cir. 1994) (district court may consider\ndefendant’s need for rehabilitation when imposing a mandatory term of\nimprisonment following the revocation of supervised release); United\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\facknowledged, during the revocation hearing, that the district court\n\nwas acting within the scope of its sentencing discretion.3 We agree.\n\nIn United States v. Falú-González, 205 F.3d. 436 (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\napplied the \"raise or waive\" rule in a sentencing context:\n\n          'Issues not squarely raised in the district court\n          will not be entertained on appeal . . .. Judges\n          are not expected to be mindreaders. Consequently,\n          a litigant has an obligation to spell out his\n          arguments squarely and distinctly, or else\n          forever hold his peace.'\n\nId. at 440, quoting United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 554 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (citing cases).\n\n          In Falú-González, we made it clear that \"[t]he 'raise or\n\nwaive rule' is only relaxed in exceptional cases involving a gross\n\nmiscarriage of justice where the belated claim is 'so compelling as\n\nvirtually to insure appellant’s success.'\" Id., quoting Barnett, 989\n\nF.2d at 554 n.8 (citing cases). This is not an exceptional case.\n\nHere, Ramirez-Rivera’s counsel expressly recognized the district\n\ncourt’s sentencing discretion and merely asked for a reconsideration of\n\nthe incarceration period without advancing the reasons he now presses\n\n\n\nStates v. Jackson, 70 F.3d 874, 880 (6th Cir. 1995) (same); but see\nAnderson, 15 F.3d at 284-86 (Kearse, J., dissenting). We do not reach\nthe issue.\n     3    At the revocation hearing, Ramirez-Rivera’s counsel stated:\n\"I understand that the Court has, the power to do that [impose the 24-\nmonth sentence] under the circumstances, but I would request that the\nCourt reconsider the sentence of 24 months.\" (Appendix at 30).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbefore this court. Ramirez-Rivera's revocation sentence does not rise\n\nto the level of a gross miscarriage of justice. We see no reason,\n\ntherefore, to relax the \"raise or waive\" rule in this case.\n\n          Because questions of statutory interpretation have been\n\nwaived and we cannot say there was plain error, the only remaining\n\nissue is review of the sentence set by the district judge, which was in\n\nexcess of that recommended by Chapter 7 of the Guidelines. In O’Neil,\n\nwe joined six other circuits in recognizing that Chapter 7 policy\n\nstatements are advisory rather than mandatory. 11 F.3d at 302 n.11;\n\nsee United States Sentencing Commission, Federal Sentencing Guidelines\n\nManual, Ch. 7 Pt. A (Nov. 2000).       Where, following revocation of\n\nsupervised release, the district court sets a sentence that exceeds\n\nthat recommended in the Chapter 7 policy statements, the parties agree\n\nthat this court reviews for abuse of discretion. So we shall use that\n\nstandard here.4\n\n\n     4     The courts of appeal have not characterized the scope of\nreview on revocation sentences in an entirely consistent fashion,\nthough all agree upon a deferential standard of appellate review.\nSeveral circuits have expressly employed an \"abuse of discretion\"\nanalysis where district courts have imposed revocation sentences in\nexcess of the range recommended by Chapter 7. See, e.g., United States\nv. Brown, 224 F.3d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir. 2000); United States v.\nGeorge, 184 F.3d 1119, 1120 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Grimes,\n54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir. 1995). Other circuits have applied a\n\"plainly unreasonable\" standard of review. See, e.g., United States v.\nMcClanahan, 136 F.3d 1146, 1149 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"A defendant's\nrevocation sentence is subject to review under the 'plainly\nunreasonable' standard because 'no guideline establishes a mandatory\nrange of such a sentence.'\") (citation omitted); United States v.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          We see no abuse of discretion. The sentence was within the\n\nstatutory range, and Ramirez-Rivera has waived the only argument\n\nevidently available against the new sentence imposed upon revocation of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nJackson, 70 F.3d 874, 878 & n.3 (6th Cir. 1995); see also United States\nv. Pelensky, 129 F.3d 63, 69 (2d Cir. 1997) (A sentence imposed for\nviolation of supervised release will be affirmed provided that \"(1) the\ndistrict court considered the applicable policy statements; (2) the\nsentence is within the statutory maximum; and (3) the sentence is\nreasonable.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The practical import\nof this difference in language is not immediately evident. Since the\nparties in this case employ the language of \"abuse of discretion,\" and\nsince it would not appear to make any difference here in any event,\nthat is the standard we will rely on for this case.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Ramirez-Rivera contends that the district court erred by taking into account his need for intensive substance abuse and psychological treatment in a structured environment when it sentenced him, after that revocation, to a prison term of 24 months. Although he did not present the argument to the district court, he argues on appeal that this sentence must be vacated because, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(a) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(k), federal courts are precluded from sentencing such defendants to terms of imprisonment for purposes of rehabilitation or medical care. We find the argument has been waived and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury convicted Ramirez-Rivera of conspiracy to possess and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1) and of the use of a firearm in a drug related offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). On June 4, 1992, the district court sentenced Ramirez-Rivera to a prison term of 130 months,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> as well as a 4-year period of supervised release. On November 14, 1996, Ramirez-Rivera was released from prison. On August 18, 1999, the district court revoked Ramirez-Rivera's supervised release and committed him to the custody of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons for a term of 24 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3553(a)(2)(D) and 3583(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts leading to the revocation of the term of supervised release can be summarized as follows. After his release, in December 1997 Ramirez-Rivera successfully completed an ambulatory drug program required by the probation office. On March 8, 1999, however, he refused to provide a urine specimen to his probation officer. When interviewed by his probation officer, Ramirez-Rivera admitted that he had used illegal narcotics. As a result of this admission, the U.S. Probation Office referred Ramirez-Rivera to the Hogar CREA Residential Detoxification Program, located in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Hogar CREA admitted Ramirez-Rivera on March 9, 1999, but, due to his hostile attitude towards Hogar CREA's staff, the probation office removed and referred him to Hogar CREA La Quinta in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a series of incidents involving Ramirez-Rivera's inability to adjust to his new environment, coupled with his generally negative attitude towards rehabilitation, the district court issued an order requiring Ramirez-Rivera to show cause why his supervision term should not be revoked. On April 20, 1999, the district court held, over the government's objection, that it would modify Ramirez-Rivera's conditions of supervised release. The district court ordered Ramirez-Rivera to be placed in a community corrections center (CCC) for a period of 6 months and to pay the cost of his confinement as required by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Furthermore, the district court ordered Ramirez-Rivera to remain detained at Hogar CREA La Quinta until the Bureau of Prisons referred him to the CCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 15, 1999, Ramirez-Rivera again failed to comply with the terms of his modified supervised release. He admitted that he had been removed from the CCC because he had not complied with CCC regulations. Moreover, Ramirez-Rivera admitted that he had failed to report, as instructed by his probation officer, on July 8, July 15, and July 19, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of these violations, on August 18, 1999, the district court revoked the terms and conditions of supervised release originally imposed on June 4, 1992. The district court ruled that Ramirez-Rivera's transgressions constituted a Grade C violation under the provisions of &#167; 7B1.1(a)(3) of the United States Sentencing Commission's policy statements. The district court further held that, given Ramirez-Rivera's prior criminal history, &#167; 7B1.4 of the Sentencing Commission's policy statements called for a prison term ranging from 3 to 9 months. Nonetheless, the district court determined that Ramirez-Rivera's need for an intensive substance abuse and psychological treatment in a structured environment justified a sentence above the sentence range recommended by the Sentencing Commission's policy statement. The district court then sentenced Ramirez-Rivera to a prison term of 24 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2)(D) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues on appeal are whether Ramirez-Rivera has waived the statutory argument, and if so, whether the district court abused its discretion when it considered Ramirez-Rivera's drug rehabilitation needs, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2)(D) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3), in imposing a sentence beyond the recommended range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If defendant's argument properly presented a question of statutory interpretation, that would be reviewed de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Koon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 100 (1996); United States v. O'Neil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658542\"><a href=\"/opinion/658542/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 294 (1st Cir. 1993). The government contends that Ramirez-Rivera waived any issue of statutory interpretation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> when he acknowledged, during the revocation hearing, that the district court was acting within the scope of its sentencing discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We agree. In United States v. Falu-Gonzalez, 205 F.3d. 436 (1st Cir. 2000), we applied the \"raise or waive\" rule in a sentencing context:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Issues not squarely raised in the district court will not be entertained on appeal . . .. Judges are not expected to be mindreaders. Consequently, a litigant has an obligation to spell out his arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold his peace.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 440, quoting United States v. Barnett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603504\"><a href=\"/opinion/603504/united-states-v-michael-barnett-united-states-of-america-v-barry-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 554 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Falu-Gonzalez, we made it clear that \"[t]he 'raise or waive rule' is only relaxed in exceptional cases involving a gross miscarriage of justice where the belated claim is 'so compelling as virtually to insure appellant's success.'\" Id., quoting Barnett, 989 F.2d at 554 n.8 (citing cases). This is not an exceptional case. Here, Ramirez-Rivera's counsel expressly recognized the district court's sentencing discretion and merely asked for a reconsideration of the incarceration period without advancing the reasons he now presses before this court. Ramirez-Rivera's revocation sentence does not rise to the level of a gross miscarriage of justice. We see no reason, therefore, to relax the \"raise or waive\" rule in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because questions of statutory interpretation have been waived and we cannot say there was plain error, the only remaining issue is review of the sentence set by the district judge, which was in excess of that recommended by Chapter 7 of the Guidelines. In O'Neil, we joined six other circuits in recognizing that Chapter 7 policy statements are advisory rather than mandatory. 11 F.3d at 302 n.11; see United States Sentencing Commission, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, Ch. 7 Pt. A (Nov. 2000). Where, following revocation of supervised release, the district court sets a sentence that exceeds that recommended in the Chapter 7 policy statements, the parties agree that this court reviews for abuse of discretion. So we shall use that standard here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no abuse of discretion.
