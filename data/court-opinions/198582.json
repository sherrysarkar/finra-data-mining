Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Stephen Franklin Burrell on brief pro se.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Ariane D. Vuono,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 29, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  In this appeal, appellant Stephen\r\nFranklin Burrell, acting pro se after having been informed of\r\nand electing to waive his right to appellate counsel, claims\r\nthat the court erroneously sentenced him after he pled guilty\r\nto wire and mail fraud and the use of fictitious names and\r\naddresses in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1341-43.  Finding no\r\nmerit in his claims, we affirm for the following reasons.\r\n          1.  We need not consider the claim that the\r\nsentencing court should have applied U.S.S.G.  5G1.3(c) at\r\nsentencing.  Appellant asserted the same claim in his pro se\r\nobjections to the presentence report.  At sentencing, he\r\nessentially agreed to abandon his pro se claims and to pursue\r\ndefense counsel's objections instead.  Hence, he has waived his\r\nclaim.  See United States v. Newman, 148 F.3d 871, 878-79 (7th\r\nCir. 1998) (declining to review, as waived, a claim which the\r\nsentencing court had not considered at sentencing because\r\ndefendant had confirmed that there were no remaining contested\r\nissues) (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733\r\n(1993)); United States v. Gilcrist, 106 F.3d 297, 302 (9th Cir.\r\n1997) (declining to consider an argument made in the\r\ndefendant's pro se sentencing memorandum where the defendant\r\nhad agreed to proceeding in a different fashion at sentencing).\r\n          2.  The case law does not support the appellant's\r\nchallenges to the court's determination of offense level, which\r\nreflected an intended loss amount of $725,826.  First, U.S.S.G.\r\n 2X1.1(b)(1) did not apply, as the district court correctly\r\nconcluded.  See United States v. Carrington, 96 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (rejecting that provision's application to a\r\ndefendant who pled guilty to wire fraud), cert. denied, 520\r\nU.S. 1150 (1997); accord United States v. Blitz, 151 F.3d 1002,\r\n1011 (9th Cir.) (wire and mail fraud), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct.\r\n567 (1998).\r\n          Second, the court did not clearly err, let alone\r\nplainly err, in setting the intended loss amount at $725,826. \r\nAppellant mailed counterfeit checks totaling $725,826 to his\r\nintended victims, and he has not disputed that he intended to\r\ninflict the maximum possible loss on his victims.  In addition,\r\ntwo of his victims sent him gold coins without waiting for the\r\nchecks to clear, showing that his scheme had some prospect of\r\nsuccess.  See United States v. Rizzo, 121 F.3d 794, 802-03 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (affirming a loss figure based on the total amount\r\nof counterfeit checks which the defendant had attempted to\r\nnegotiate where the defendant had admitted intending to inflict\r\na loss in that amount and he had successfully cashed one of the\r\nfive checks); United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 429 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) (\"Where there is good evidence of actual intent and\r\nsome prospect of success, we do not think that a court needs to\r\nengage in more refined forecasts of just how successful the\r\nscheme was likely to be.\") (citation omitted).  \r\n          Finally, the Sentencing Commission had authority to\r\npromulgate the relevant conduct guideline, U.S.S.G.  1B1.3,\r\nsee United States v. Wong, 2 F.3d 927, 929-30 (9th Cir. 1993)\r\n(majority opinion), and the court did not plainly err under the\r\nConstitution in basing the loss amount on appellant's\r\nunindicted and unconvicted relevant conduct.  Appellant\r\nadmitted his relevant conduct in a letter he wrote to the court\r\nafter his arrest, and his sentence was within the applicable\r\nstatutory maximums.  See, e.g., United States v. Hillsman, 141\r\nF.3d 777, 780-81 (7th Cir. 1998) (concluding that the\r\nconsideration of relevant conduct did not violate the Fifth and\r\nSixth Amendments where the conduct was proven by a\r\npreponderance of the reliable evidence); United States v.\r\nSanders, 982 F.2d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam)\r\n(rejecting, where the sentence imposed was within the statutory\r\nmaximum, a claim that the use of uncharged relevant conduct in\r\ndeparting upward violated the right to a jury trial or to\r\n\"other procedural protections which would apply had defendant\r\nbeen indicted and tried\").\r\n          3.  The court did not clearly err in enhancing\r\nappellant's offense level for obstruction of justice.  First,\r\nthe falsehoods which appellant told the probation officer about\r\nhis military service and the related fabricated documents he\r\nprovided to probation were unquestionably material.  See\r\nUnited States v. Agoro, 996 F.2d 1288, 1292 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n(indicating that the materiality requirement encompasses false\r\nstatements designed to affect the court's exercise of its\r\ndiscretion in choosing the appropriate sentence within the\r\nguideline range); United States v. Thomas, 11 F.3d 1392, 1401\r\n(7th Cir. 1993) (holding that facts relating to discharge from\r\nmilitary service are material at sentencing); United States v.\r\nNeil, 903 F.2d 564, 566 (8th Cir. 1990) (noting that a\r\nsentencing court may weigh the defendant's military record in\r\ndeciding the sentence to be imposed within the applicable\r\nguideline range) (citation omitted).  \r\n          Second, we conclude that the court supportably found\r\nthat appellant's falsehoods were willfully made, although,\r\ngiven the appellant's failure to directly raise the issue at\r\nsentencing, the court did not make formal findings on that\r\npoint.  See United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199, 203 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (indicating that appellate review is possible where the\r\nappeals court can ascertain the district court's \"ultimate\r\nfinding\" and can find reasonable supporting evidence for it in\r\nthe record).  There was evidence tending to suggest that\r\nappellant knew that an exemplary military record might\r\ninfluence the court's sentencing decision.  He had extensive\r\nexperience with the criminal justice system, and he had\r\nsubmitted a \"defendant's presentence report\" to the probation\r\nofficer, using that report to convey his falsehoods and\r\nfabricated documents.  Moreover, in ruling on other sentencing\r\nissues, the district court had rejected defense arguments\r\ncontending that the appellant's lies were attributable to his\r\npersonality disorder and his desire to shield his wife from the\r\ntruth, and its action finds support in the record.  A\r\npsychological evaluation suggested that appellant's actions\r\nwere attributable to his personality disorder rather than to\r\nhis concern for his wife, but did not conclude that his\r\npersonality disorder rendered him unable to tell the truth.  At\r\nsentencing, appellant maintained that he had lived lawfully for\r\nnearly three years while on parole, which, he said, showed that\r\nhe was not \"some criminal that can't resist perpetrating a\r\ncrime.\"  Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the court\r\nclearly erred in concluding that the appellant had willfully\r\nobstructed justice.  See United States v. Greer, 158 F.3d 228,\r\n239 (5th Cir. 1998) (affirming an obstruction enhancement where\r\nan expert had testified that the defendant could control his\r\nbehavior despite his antisocial and borderline personality\r\ndisorders).\r\n          4.  The court did not clearly err in denying a\r\nreduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. \r\nAppellant, who relies on events showing his acceptance of\r\nresponsibility prior to the obstructive conduct evidencing a\r\nlack of genuine remorse, failed to show that his was an\r\nexceptional case warranting the reduction.  See United States\r\nv. Thomas, 97 F.3d 1499, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (noting that\r\nadmitting to the acts comprising a crime is not the same as\r\naccepting responsibility for the crime under the guidelines);\r\nsee also United States v. Hopper, 27 F.3d 378, 383 (9th Cir.\r\n1994) (\"Cases in which obstruction is not inconsistent with an\r\nacceptance of responsibility arise when a defendant, although\r\ninitially attempting to conceal the crime, eventually accepts\r\nresponsibility for the crime and abandons all attempts to\r\nobstruct justice.\").\r\n          5.  There is no record support for the claim that the\r\nappellant rendered substantial assistance to the government. \r\nIn addition, given the absence of critical fact allegations,\r\nthis court has no basis for reviewing the prosecution's failure\r\nto file a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G.  5K1.1. \r\nSee Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-86 (1993) (holding\r\nthat the government's failure to file a substantial assistance\r\nmotion might be subject to review if it were based on\r\nunconstitutional motives or were not rationally related to any\r\nlegitimate government end).\r\n          6.  The district court had no obligation to rule on\r\nappellant's various pro se objections.  At sentencing, the\r\nappellant waived them by acquiescing when the court stated that\r\nit did not intend to address any of his pro se objections. \r\nMoreover, given appellant's failure to waive his right to\r\ncounsel or to assert his right to self-representation, the\r\ncourt permissibly declined to address his pro se objections. \r\nSee United States v. Campbell, 61 F.3d 976, 981 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(stating that there is no constitutional right to hybrid\r\nrepresentation and ruling that the court had appropriately\r\nexercised its discretion to deny such representation when it\r\ndeclined to let the defendant cross-examine an expert witness),\r\ncert. denied, 517 U.S. 1161 (1996).\r\n          Affirmed.    \n",

Cir. 1996) (noting that\r\nadmitting to the acts comprising a crime is not the same as\r\naccepting responsibility for the crime under the guidelines);\r\nsee also United States v.

There is no record support for the claim that the\r\nappellant rendered substantial assistance to the government. \r\nIn addition, given the absence of critical fact allegations,\r\nthis court has no basis for reviewing the prosecution's failure\r\nto file a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G.  5K1.1. \r\nSee Wade v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185-86 (1993) (holding\r\nthat the government's failure to file a substantial assistance\r\nmotion might be subject to review if it were based on\r\nunconstitutional motives or were not rationally related to any\r\nlegitimate government end).\r\n          6.  The district court had no obligation to rule on\r\nappellant's various pro se objections.  At sentencing, the\r\nappellant waived them by acquiescing when the court stated that\r\nit did not intend to address any of his pro se objections. \r\nMoreover, given appellant's failure to waive his right to\r\ncounsel or to assert his right to self-representation, the\r\ncourt permissibly declined to address his pro se objections. \r\nSee United States v.
