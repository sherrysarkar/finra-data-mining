The Intervenors  allege that the settlement is\r\n\nnot fair, reasonable or adequate.\r\n\n              I.  Procedural and Factual History\r                          I.  Procedural and Factual History\r\n\n          Atlantic  is  the  general  partner  in  twenty-one\r\n\nlimited  partnerships,  each  of  which  was  established  to\r\n\npurchase and lease capital  equipment such as aircraft, ships\r\n\nand  construction machinery.   On  August 18,  1995, Atlantic\r\n\nmade essentially identical tender offers (\"the tender offer\")\r\n\nto the limited partners in each of the partnerships, offering\r\n\nto purchase up  to 45%  of the outstanding  units of  limited\r\n\npartnership interest  for a total price  of approximately $22\r\n\nmillion.  The  tender offer was to be  financed by an outside\r\n\nlender  with  a loan  secured in  part by  Atlantic's general\r\n\npartners'  personal  guarantees and  in  part  by a  security\r\n\ninterest in all the units tendered.\r\n\n          On   September  6,   1995,  City   Partnership  Co.\r\n\n(\"City\"),  a limited  partner in  three of  the partnerships,\r\n\nfiled  the class  action  suit below  on  behalf of  all  the\r\n\nlimited  partners  of  the  twenty-one  partnerships  against\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nAtlantic  alleging,  inter  alia,  that   Atlantic  had  made\r\n\nmaterial  misrepresentations  in  the   disclosure  statement\r\n\naccompanying the tender  offer, and that it  had breached its\r\n\nfiduciary duty  to the limited partners by  not arranging for\r\n\nthe  loan to be made to the partnerships and limited partners\r\n\ndirectly.\r\n\n          Because of the limited duration of the tender offer\r\n\nand  the possibility  that  the financing  would expire,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs obtained expedited discovery and began negotiating\r\n\nwith  Atlantic.     The  Intervenors   participated  in   the\r\n\nsettlement negotiations and had  access to all the discovery.\r\n\nWithin a  few weeks, the  plaintiffs and Atlantic  reached an\r\n\nagreement and filed a  Stipulation of Settlement on September\r\n\n27, 1995.\r\n\n          The  settlement  agreement  provided that  Atlantic\r\n\nwould limit  its  tender  offer to  35%  of  the  outstanding\r\n\nunits,1 would furnish significant additional  disclosures and\r\n\nwould increase the tender offer price by almost 7%, a maximum\r\n\npremium over the initial  offer of $1.5 million.   In return,\r\n\nCity  granted   Atlantic  a  broad  release   of  all  claims\r\n\npertaining to the tender  offer, actual and potential, direct\r\n\nand derivative.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  No more than 15% of the units of any one partnership were\r\nactually tendered.  City did not tender its units.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          On October  3, 1995,  notice of the  settlement was\r\n\nsent out  to all the class  members, a group  of over 31,000.\r\n\nThe Intervenors  moved to intervene  for the sole  purpose of\r\n\nobjecting to the settlement on the ground that it contained a\r\n\nrelease  of  the  partnerships' claims  against  Atlantic for\r\n\nappropriating  a  partnership  opportunity  for  itself  (the\r\n\n\"derivative  claims\").2    The  Intervenors  argue  that  the\r\n\nrelease of the derivative claims was obtained in exchange for\r\n\nlittle or no consideration.\r\n\n          Despite the Intervenors'  objections, the  district\r\n\ncourt  approved the  settlement, and the  Intervenors brought\r\n\nthis  appeal,  arguing  that  the settlement  was  not  fair,\r\n\nadequate or reasonable insofar as it approved the release of \r\n\nthe derivative claims.\r\n\n                       II.  Discussion\r                                   II.  Discussion\r\n\n          A  district  court  can  approve  a  class   action\r\n\nsettlement  only  if it  is  fair,  adequate and  reasonable.\r\n\nDurrett v. Housing Authority  of the City of  Providence, 896\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 600, 604 (1st Cir. 1990).  When sufficient discovery has\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  According  to   both  City  and   the  Intervenors,   the\r\npartnership units were worth far  more than the tender  offer\r\nprice.   Atlantic  thus had the  potential to  profit greatly\r\nfrom its  offer to buy the limited partners' units, depending\r\non the  number of units  actually tendered.   The Intervenors\r\nclaim  that  any such  profit really  belongs to  the limited\r\npartnerships themselves and wish  to pursue the partnerships'\r\nclaims  against Atlantic in  a derivative suit,  suing on the\r\npartnerships' behalf.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nbeen provided and the  parties have bargained at arms-length,\r\n\nthere  is  a presumption  in favor  of  the settlement.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Cannons  Engineering Corp.,  720 F.  Supp.\r                                                         \r\n\n1027,  1036  (D.

Bogan, 492 F.2d 375, 381 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1974).   Great deference is given to the trial court.  \"It is\r\n\nonly  when one side is so obviously correct in its assertions\r\n\nof  law and  fact that  it would  be clearly  unreasonable to\r\n\nrequire it  to compromise  to the  extent of  the settlement,\r\n\nthat  to  approve  the  settlement  would  be  an   abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.\"  Id.        Despite the  deferential standard of\r                             \r\n\nreview,  the Intervenors  argue that  we should  overturn the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  approval of  the  settlement because  City\r\n\nreleased claims which it  did not raise in its  complaint and\r\n\nbecause City was faced with a conflict of interest.  \r\n\n          The first argument is easily dispensed with.  It is\r\n\nwell-settled  that  \"in  order  to  achieve  a  comprehensive\r\n\nsettlement   that  would  prevent   relitigation  of  settled\r\n\nquestions at the core of  a class action, a court  may permit\r\n\nthe  release  of a  claim  based  on  the  identical  factual\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\npredicate as that underlying the claims  in the settled class\r\n\naction  even though the claim was not presented and might not\r\n\nhave been  presentable in the  class action.\"   TBK Partners,\r                                                                         \r\n\nLtd.  v.

All  of  these\r\n\nclaims stemmed  from problems with the tender offers and were\r\n\nreleasable by the class action settlement.\r\n\n          Intervenor's second argument,  alleging a  conflict\r\n\nof interest,  is potentially more troublesome.   The presence\r\n\nof  a  conflict  of  interest  would  render  the  settlement\r\n\nsuspect.  As the Ninth Circuit has written, \"If, however, the\r\n\nsettlement negotiations  are biased, or skewed  by a conflict\r\n\nof  interest,  we  cannot  presume that  the  attorneys  have\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nreached  a  fair  settlement.\"   In  re  Pacific  Enterprises\r                                                                         \r\n\nSecurities Litigation, 47 F.3d 373, 378 (9th Cir. 1995).  \r                                 \r\n\n          Other  courts have  recognized  a potential  for  a\r\n\nconflict  of  interest in  situations  somewhat analogous  to\r\n\nthis.  In Pacific Enterprises, for example, the Ninth Circuit\r                                         \r\n\nreviewed  a  district  court's  approval  of  a  simultaneous\r\n\nsettlement of both  a derivative class  action lawsuit and  a\r\n\nsecurities class  action lawsuit.   The court  questioned the\r\n\nwisdom of allowing one party to represent both derivative and\r\n\nsecurities  class  action  plaintiffs.   It  pointed  to  the\r\n\ncorporate officer defendants' incentive in such situations to\r\n\ntrade  a larger  securities settlement  for  lower derivative\r\n\nliability,  thereby sparing  themselves at  the corporation's\r\n\nexpense.  \r\n\n          The potential conflict problem here is not the same\r\n\nas that in  Pacific Enterprises.  If there was a conflict, it\r                                           \r\n\narose from a difference in interest between those unitholders\r\n\nwho would accept  Atlantic's newly-sweetened offer  and those\r\n\nwho would choose to stay on as limited partners.  The purpose\r\n\nof  the class  action was  to force  Atlantic to  improve its\r\n\ntender  offer by, inter alia,  raising its price.   Those who\r\n\naccepted the offer by selling their units benefited from  the\r\n\nenhanced price.    Those who  remained limited  partners--the\r\n\ntender  offer being limited to  35% of all  units--did not so\r\n\nbenefit  and  lost  out  on  whatever  rewards  a  successful\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nderivative suit might  have conferred  upon all  unitholders,\r\n\nthe possibility of a  derivative suit having been surrendered\r\n\nin the settlement.\r\n\n          It  follows that there may be    although we do not\r\n\ndecide, infra      a  conflict of interest  should one  party\r                         \r\n\nlike City represent both tender offer and derivative claims.3\r\n\nIf  such a party wished  to tender its  partnership units, it\r\n\nmight  have an incentive to offer to trade a lower derivative\r\n\nrecovery  for a higher offer  price because once  it sold its\r\n\nunits  it  would  no   longer  benefit  from  the  derivative\r\n\nrecovery.  Similarly, if such a party did not wish to tender,\r\n\nit would have an incentive to trade a lower offer price for a\r\n\nhigher derivative  recovery.  However, in order  for there to\r\n\nbe a meaningful conflict of interest in the representation of\r\n\nderivative and tender offer claims, there would first have to\r\n\nbe  derivative  claims of  substance.    In  this  case,  the\r\n\ndistrict court approved the settlement only after considering\r\n\narguments over whether or  not the derivative claims had  any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The question  of whether  this situation would  present a\r\nconflict of  interest is not an  easy one.  If,  for example,\r\nthe  limited partners had tendered  more than the  35% of the\r\nunits that  Atlantic had  agreed to  buy, the  owners' shares\r\nwould have  been purchased  on a pro  rata basis.   Since  no\r\npartner  would  then be  able to  sell  all her  shares, some\r\nincentive to preserve the  retained shares' value by pursuing\r\nthe  derivative claims  might well  remain.   Because of  the\r\npotentially ad  hoc nature of the  conflict determination, we\r\nprefer not to attempt to formulate at this time hard and fast\r\nrules requiring  separate representation of  tender offer and\r\nderivative claims in a class action.  \r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nvalue,  and  did so  in  circumstances  where the  derivative\r\n\nclaims   were  championed  by   an  independent   party,  the\r\n\nIntervenors.  \r\n\n          Although  City  submitted  an   expert's  affidavit\r\n\nstating  that  the  derivative  claims  were  worthless,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court did  not  rely on  City's  advocacy alone  in\r\n\nmaking its  decision.  The Intervenors,  who represented only\r\n\nthe derivative claims, vigorously argued  that the derivative\r\n\nclaims had  value and submitted their  own expert's affidavit\r\n\nas  support.    The  court examined  both  affidavits  before\r\n\nruling.   Thus  for the  purposes  of making  this  threshold\r\n\ndecision, the two sets  of claims were each represented  by a\r\n\ndifferent party.   The Intervenors' participation  eliminated\r\n\nthe risk that a conflict  problem would skew the presentation\r\n\nof the valuation issues and the court's holding  is therefore\r\n\nsubject  to the usual abuse  of discretion standard of review\r\n\nfor approval of class action settlements.  See Greenspun, 492\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 381.\r\n\n          We  do not  believe the  district court  abused its\r\n\ndiscretion in  approving the settlement and,  by implication,\r\n\ndetermining  that the  derivative claims  were of  little, if\r\n\nany, value.4  The  essence of the derivative claims  was that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  At oral argument, counsel for the Intervenors pointed out\r\nthat  the  district court  did not  explicitly find  that the\r\nderivative  claims  were  worthless.   However,  the  court's\r\napproval  of  a  settlement  which,  the  Intervenors  agree,\r\nprovided  for a release of  the derivative claims in exchange\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nAtlantic had coopted a  partnership opportunity by making the\r\n\ntender  offer on its own behalf instead of the partnerships'.\r\n\nThe  value  of  this  claim  is  entirely  dependent  on  the\r\n\npartnerships'  ability to  make the tender  offer themselves,\r\n\nand City's expert's affidavit explained that the partnerships\r\n\nwere unable to do so.\r\n\n          First,  the  partnership agreements  prohibited the\r\n\npartnerships from buying  partnership units.   Removing  this\r\n\nrestriction would have required the approval of the owners of\r\n\na majority of the  units.  Such approval might  not have been\r\n\nforthcoming  and  would  at  least have  been  difficult  and\r\n\nexpensive to obtain.  Also, even if the majority ownership of\r\n\neach partnership agreed, the result would have been to coerce\r\n\nthe dissenting minority  to participate in the  making of the\r\n\ntender offer.   By making  the tender offer  itself, Atlantic\r\n\navoided this possibility; only those unitholders  who desired\r\n\nto  tender their shares  participated in the  tender offer in\r\n\nany way.\r\n\n          City's expert also stated in his affidavit that the\r\n\npartnerships could  not have  obtained the  necessary outside\r\n\nloans  to finance the tender offer.  The loan desired by each\r\n\nindividual  partnership would  be  too small  to attract  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nfor  no  consideration  after  the  court's   examination  of\r\naffidavits  exclusively devoted  to  debating the  derivative\r\nclaims'  worth indicates that the court resolved the issue of\r\nthe claims' value against the Intervenors.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\ninterest  of  the  sort  of financial  institution  typically\r\n\ninvolved in this type of transaction.  In addition, potential\r\n\nlenders would have been much less willing to participate in a\r\n\nloan  to the  partnerships without  a cross-collateralization\r\n\nagreement, something prohibited by the partnership agreements\r\n\nwithout  the  approval of  the owners  of  a majority  of the\r\n\nunits.5    Moreover,  the  partnerships lacked  the  sort  of\r\n\ndeveloped  credit  history  which  Atlantic had,  making  the\r\n\nsecuring  of a  loan  more  difficult,  and  could  not  have\r\n\nsupplied  the   personal  guarantees  made   by  the  general\r\n\npartners.\r\n\n          The Intervenors' expert  believed the  partnerships\r\n\ncould have obtained financing for the tender offer by forming\r\n\na joint  venture or  by creating  a new  limited partnership.\r\n\nThe  purpose of establishing either would  be to overcome the\r\n\nproblems  of small loan size  and inability to  form a cross-\r\n\ncollateralization  agreement.   The  expert also  thought  it\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Atlantic was able  to provide a security  interest in the\r\ntendered units from all of the partnerships as collateral for\r\nthe loan.    If  a  partnership's tendered  units  failed  to\r\ngenerate sufficient  income  to pay  off  that  partnership's\r\nproportionate share of  the loan, the lender could use excess\r\nincome from  the other partnerships' tendered  units to cover\r\nthe shortfall.  However, if each partnership obtained its own\r\nloan  to make  a tender offer  for its own  units, the lender\r\nwould be unable to seek such coverage payments from the units\r\nof other partnerships and  would thus bear a greater  risk of\r\nloss.    The  lender  could  eliminate   this  risk  only  by\r\npersuading   the  partnerships   to  enter   into  a   cross-\r\ncollateralization  agreement  specifically  authorizing  such\r\ncoverage payments.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nwould be possible for  the partnerships to interest  a lender\r\n\nin financing  the  tender offers  individually,  despite  the\r\n\nsmall loan size, if all the loans were arranged at once.\r\n\n          City's  expert  submitted a  rebuttal  affidavit in\r\n\nwhich he explained why  these schemes were not feasible.   He\r\n\nwrote that  the administrative expenses involved  in creating\r\n\na joint venture of  the twenty-one limited partnerships would\r\n\nbe prohibitive and that creating a new limited partnership to\r\n\nmake the  tender offers  would be \"completely  unworkable and\r\n\nuneconomical.\"  He  also reiterated that  no lender would  be\r\n\ninterested  in making  loans of  the  size required  for each\r\n\npartnership individually, even if  all the loan requests were\r\n\nprocessed at once.\r\n\n          Considering the  evidence,  we think  the  district\r\n\ncourt was  justified in  holding that the  partnerships could\r\n\nnot  have  made the  tender  offers and  that  the derivative\r\n\nclaims therefore had no value.   Once this determination  had\r\n\nbeen made City's  potential conflict of  interest dissipated,\r\n\nand  its  ability to  represent the  interests of  the entire\r\n\nclass of limited partners ceased to be impaired in any way.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n",

The Intervenors allege that the settlement is not fair, reasonable or adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Procedural and Factual History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atlantic is the general partner in twenty-one limited partnerships, each of which was established to purchase and lease capital equipment such as aircraft, ships and construction machinery. On August 18, 1995, Atlantic made essentially identical tender offers (\"the tender offer\") to the limited partners in each of the partnerships, offering to purchase up to 45% of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest for a total price of approximately $22 million. The tender offer was to be financed by an outside lender with a loan secured in part by Atlantic's general partners' personal guarantees and in part by a security interest in all the units tendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 1995, City Partnership Co. (\"City\"), a limited partner in three of the partnerships, filed the class action suit below on behalf of all the limited partners of the twenty-one partnerships against Atlantic alleging, inter alia, that Atlantic had made material misrepresentations in the disclosure statement accompanying the tender offer, and that it had breached its fiduciary duty to the limited partners by not arranging for the loan to be made to the partnerships and limited partners directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the limited duration of the tender offer and the possibility that the financing would expire, the plaintiffs obtained expedited discovery and began negotiating with Atlantic. The Intervenors participated in the settlement negotiations and had access to all the discovery. Within a few weeks, the plaintiffs and Atlantic reached an agreement and filed a Stipulation of Settlement on September 27, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement agreement provided that Atlantic would limit its tender offer to 35% of the outstanding units,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> would furnish significant additional disclosures and would increase the tender offer price by almost 7%, a maximum premium over the initial offer of $1.5 million. In return, City granted Atlantic a broad release of all claims pertaining to the tender offer, actual and potential, direct and derivative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 3, 1995, notice of the settlement was sent out to all the class members, a group of over 31,000. The Intervenors moved to intervene for the sole purpose of objecting to the settlement on the ground that it contained a release of the partnerships' claims against Atlantic for appropriating a partnership opportunity for itself (the \"derivative claims\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Intervenors argue that the release of the derivative claims was obtained in exchange for little or no consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Intervenors' objections, the district court approved the settlement, and the Intervenors brought this appeal, arguing that the settlement was not fair, adequate or reasonable insofar as it approved the release of the derivative claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court can approve a class action settlement only if it is fair, adequate and reasonable. Durrett v. Housing Authority of the City of Providence, 896 F.2d 600, 604 (1st Cir. 1990). When sufficient discovery has been provided and the parties have bargained at arms-length, there is a presumption in favor of the settlement. See United States v. Cannons Engineering Corp., 720 F. Supp. 1027, 1036 (D. Mass. 1989) (quoting City of New York v. Exxon, 697 F. Supp. 677, 692 (S.D.N.Y. 1988)), aff'd, 899 F.2d 79 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon review, our role, \"is not to decide whose assertions are correct, but merely to ascertain whether the district court clearly abused its discretion in approving the settlement.\" Greenspun v. Bogan, 492 F.2d 375, 381 (1st Cir. 1974). Great deference is given to the trial court. \"It is only when one side is so obviously correct in its assertions of law and fact that it would be clearly unreasonable to require it to compromise to the extent of the settlement, that to approve the settlement would be an abuse of discretion.\" Id.Despite the deferential standard of review, the Intervenors argue that we should overturn the district court's approval of the settlement because City released claims which it did not raise in its complaint and because City was faced with a conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first argument is easily dispensed with. It is well-settled that \"in order to achieve a comprehensive settlement that would prevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action, a court may permit the release of a claim based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the settled class action even though the claim was not presented and might not have been presentable in the class action.\" TBK Partners, Ltd. v. Western Union Corp., 675 F.2d 456, 460 (2d Cir. 1982). See also Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Epstein, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 873, 879 (1996) (discussing Delaware law); Nottingham Partners v. Trans-Lux Corp., 925 F.2d 29, 33-34 (1st Cir. 1991); Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1287-88 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 953 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some dispute as to whether or not City did in fact bring the derivative claims in its class action suit. But regardless of whether it did or not, the derivative claims clearly arose from the same factual predicate as City's claims alleging misrepresentations and omissions in Atlantic's disclosure statements and breaches of Atlantic's fiduciary duties to the limited partners. All of these claims stemmed from problems with the tender offers and were releasable by the class action settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intervenors' second argument, alleging a conflict of interest, is potentially more troublesome. The presence of a conflict of interest would render the settlement suspect. As the Ninth Circuit has written, \"If, however, the settlement negotiations are biased, or skewed by a conflict of interest, we cannot presume that the attorneys have reached a fair settlement.\" In re Pacific Enterprises Securities Litigation, 47 F.3d 373, 378 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have recognized a potential for a conflict of interest in situations somewhat analogous to this. In Pacific Enterprises, for example, the Ninth Circuit reviewed a district court's approval of a simultaneous settlement of both a derivative class action lawsuit and a securities class action lawsuit. The court questioned the wisdom of allowing one party to represent both derivative and securities class action plaintiffs. It pointed to the corporate officer defendants' incentive in such situations to trade a larger securities settlement for lower derivative liability, thereby sparing themselves at the corporation's expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The potential conflict problem here is not the same as that in Pacific Enterprises. If there was a conflict, it arose from a difference in interest between those unitholders who would accept Atlantic's newly-sweetened offer and those who would choose to stay on as limited partners. The purpose of the class action was to force Atlantic to improve its tender offer by, inter alia, raising its price. Those who accepted the offer by selling their units benefited from the enhanced price. Those who remained limited partners--the tender offer being limited to 35% of all units--did not so benefit and lost out on whatever rewards a successful derivative suit might have conferred upon all unitholders, the possibility of a derivative suit having been surrendered in the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that there may bealthough we do not decide, infraa conflict of interest should one party like City represent both tender offer and derivative claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If such a party wished to tender its partnership units, it might have an incentive to offer to trade a lower derivative recovery for a higher offer price because once it sold its units it would no longer benefit from the derivative recovery. Similarly, if such a party did not wish to tender, it would have an incentive to trade a lower offer price for a higher derivative recovery. However, in order for there to be a meaningful conflict of interest in the representation of derivative and tender offer claims, there would first have to be derivative claims of substance. In this case, the district court approved the settlement only after considering arguments over whether or not the derivative claims had any value, and did so in circumstances where the derivative claims were championed by an independent party, the Intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although City submitted an expert's affidavit stating that the derivative claims were worthless, the district court did not rely on City's advocacy alone in making its decision. The Intervenors, who represented only the derivative claims, vigorously argued that the derivative claims had value and submitted their own expert's affidavit as support. The court examined both affidavits before ruling. Thus for the purposes of making this threshold decision, the two sets of claims were each represented by a different party. The Intervenors' participation eliminated the risk that a conflict problem would skew the presentation of the valuation issues and the court's holding is therefore subject to the usual abuse of discretion standard of review for approval of class action settlements. See Greenspun, 492 F.2d at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe the district court abused its discretion in approving the settlement and, by implication, determining that the derivative claims were of little, if any, value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The essence of the derivative claims was that Atlantic had coopted a partnership opportunity by making the tender offer on its own behalf instead of the partnerships'. The value of this claim is entirely dependent on the partnerships' ability to make the tender offer themselves, and City's expert's affidavit explained that the partnerships were unable to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the partnership agreements prohibited the partnerships from buying partnership units. Removing this restriction would have required the approval of the owners of a majority of the units. Such approval might not have been forthcoming and would at least have been difficult and expensive to obtain. Also, even if the majority ownership of each partnership agreed, the result would have been to coerce the dissenting minority to participate in the making of the tender offer. By making the tender offer itself, Atlantic avoided this possibility; only those unitholders who desired to tender their shares participated in the tender offer in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">City's expert also stated in his affidavit that the partnerships could not have obtained the necessary outside loans to finance the tender offer. The loan desired by each individual partnership would be too small to attract the interest of the sort of financial institution typically involved in this type of transaction. In addition, potential lenders would have been much less willing to participate in a loan to the partnerships without a cross-collateralization agreement, something prohibited by the partnership agreements without the approval of the owners of a majority of the units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, the partnerships lacked the sort of developed credit history which Atlantic had, making the securing of a loan more difficult, and could not have supplied the personal guarantees made by the general partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Intervenors' expert believed the partnerships could have obtained financing for the tender offer by forming a joint venture or by creating a new limited partnership. The purpose of establishing either would be to overcome the problems of small loan size and inability to form a cross-collateralization agreement.

The Intervenors allege that the settlement is not fair, reasonable or adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Procedural and Factual History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Atlantic is the general partner in twenty-one limited partnerships, each of which was established to purchase and lease capital equipment such as aircraft, ships and construction machinery. On August 18, 1995, Atlantic made essentially identical tender offers (\"the tender offer\") to the limited partners in each of the partnerships, offering to purchase up to 45% of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest for a total price of approximately $22 million. The tender offer was to be financed by an outside lender with a loan secured in part by Atlantic's general partners' personal guarantees and in part by a security interest in all the units tendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 1995, City Partnership Co. (\"City\"), a limited partner in three of the partnerships, filed the class action suit below on behalf of all the limited partners of the twenty-one partnerships against Atlantic alleging, inter alia, that Atlantic had made material misrepresentations in the disclosure statement accompanying the tender offer, and that it had breached its fiduciary duty to the limited partners by not arranging for the loan to be made to the partnerships and limited partners directly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the limited duration of the tender offer and the possibility that the financing would expire, the plaintiffs obtained expedited discovery and began negotiating with Atlantic. The Intervenors participated in the settlement negotiations and had access to all the discovery. Within a few weeks, the plaintiffs and Atlantic reached an agreement and filed a Stipulation of Settlement on September 27, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement agreement provided that Atlantic would limit its tender offer to 35% of the outstanding units,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> would furnish significant additional disclosures and would increase the tender offer price by almost 7%, a maximum premium over the initial offer of $1.5 million. In return, City granted Atlantic a broad release of all claims pertaining to the tender offer, actual and potential, direct and derivative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 3, 1995, notice of the settlement was sent out to all the class members, a group of over 31,000. The Intervenors moved to intervene for the sole purpose of objecting to the settlement on the ground that it contained a release of the partnerships' claims against Atlantic for appropriating a partnership opportunity for itself (the \"derivative claims\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Intervenors argue that the release of the derivative claims was obtained in exchange for little or no consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Intervenors' objections, the district court approved the settlement, and the Intervenors brought this appeal, arguing that the settlement was not fair, adequate or reasonable insofar as it approved the release of the derivative claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court can approve a class action settlement only if it is fair, adequate and reasonable.

Great deference is given to the trial court. \"It is only when one side is so obviously correct in its assertions of law and fact that it would be clearly unreasonable to require it to compromise to the extent of the settlement, that to approve the settlement would be an abuse of discretion.\" Id.Despite the deferential standard of review, the Intervenors argue that we should overturn the district court's approval of the settlement because City released claims which it did not raise in its complaint and because City was faced with a conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first argument is easily dispensed with. It is well-settled that \"in order to achieve a comprehensive settlement that would prevent relitigation of settled questions at the core of a class action, a court may permit the release of a claim based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the settled class action even though the claim was not presented and might not have been presentable in the class action.\" TBK Partners, Ltd. v.

But regardless of whether it did or not, the derivative claims clearly arose from the same factual predicate as City's claims alleging misrepresentations and omissions in Atlantic's disclosure statements and breaches of Atlantic's fiduciary duties to the limited partners. All of these claims stemmed from problems with the tender offers and were releasable by the class action settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intervenors' second argument, alleging a conflict of interest, is potentially more troublesome. The presence of a conflict of interest would render the settlement suspect. As the Ninth Circuit has written, \"If, however, the settlement negotiations are biased, or skewed by a conflict of interest, we cannot presume that the attorneys have reached a fair settlement.\" In re Pacific Enterprises Securities Litigation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688777\"><a href=\"/opinion/688777/in-re-pacific-enterprises-securities-litigation-lee-j-principe-ken-rudd/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 378 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have recognized a potential for a conflict of interest in situations somewhat analogous to this. In Pacific Enterprises, for example, the Ninth Circuit reviewed a district court's approval of a simultaneous settlement of both a derivative class action lawsuit and a securities class action lawsuit. The court questioned the wisdom of allowing one party to represent both derivative and securities class action plaintiffs. It pointed to the corporate officer defendants' incentive in such situations to trade a larger securities settlement for lower derivative liability, thereby sparing themselves at the corporation's expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The potential conflict problem here is not the same as that in Pacific Enterprises. If there was a conflict, it arose from a difference in interest between those unitholders who would accept Atlantic's newly-sweetened offer and those who would choose to stay on as limited partners. The purpose of the class action was to force Atlantic to improve its tender offer by, inter alia, raising its price. Those who accepted the offer by selling their units benefited from the enhanced price. Those who remained limited partners--the tender offer being limited to 35% of all units--did not so benefit and lost out on whatever rewards a successful derivative suit might have conferred upon all unitholders, the possibility of a derivative suit having been surrendered in the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that there may bealthough we do not decide, infraa conflict of interest should one party like City represent both tender offer and derivative claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If such a party wished to tender its partnership units, it might have an incentive to offer to trade a lower derivative recovery for a higher offer price because once it sold its units it would no longer benefit from the derivative recovery. Similarly, if such a party did not wish to tender, it would have an incentive to trade a lower offer price for a higher derivative recovery. However, in order for there to be a meaningful conflict of interest in the representation of derivative and tender offer claims, there would first have to be derivative claims of substance. In this case, the district court approved the settlement only after considering arguments over whether or not the derivative claims had any value, and did so in circumstances where the derivative claims were championed by an independent party, the Intervenors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although City submitted an expert's affidavit stating that the derivative claims were worthless, the district court did not rely on City's advocacy alone in making its decision. The Intervenors, who represented only the derivative claims, vigorously argued that the derivative claims had value and submitted their own expert's affidavit as support. The court examined both affidavits before ruling. Thus for the purposes of making this threshold decision, the two sets of claims were each represented by a different party. The Intervenors' participation eliminated the risk that a conflict problem would skew the presentation of the valuation issues and the court's holding is therefore subject to the usual abuse of discretion standard of review for approval of class action settlements. See Greenspun, 492 F.2d at 381.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe the district court abused its discretion in approving the settlement and, by implication, determining that the derivative claims were of little, if any, value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The essence of the derivative claims was that Atlantic had coopted a partnership opportunity by making the tender offer on its own behalf instead of the partnerships'. The value of this claim is entirely dependent on the partnerships' ability to make the tender offer themselves, and City's expert's affidavit explained that the partnerships were unable to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the partnership agreements prohibited the partnerships from buying partnership units. Removing this restriction would have required the approval of the owners of a majority of the units. Such approval might not have been forthcoming and would at least have been difficult and expensive to obtain. Also, even if the majority ownership of each partnership agreed, the result would have been to coerce the dissenting minority to participate in the making of the tender offer. By making the tender offer itself, Atlantic avoided this possibility; only those unitholders who desired to tender their shares participated in the tender offer in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">City's expert also stated in his affidavit that the partnerships could not have obtained the necessary outside loans to finance the tender offer. The loan desired by each individual partnership would be too small to attract the interest of the sort of financial institution typically involved in this type of transaction. In addition, potential lenders would have been much less willing to participate in a loan to the partnerships without a cross-collateralization agreement, something prohibited by the partnership agreements without the approval of the owners of a majority of the units.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, the partnerships lacked the sort of developed credit history which Atlantic had, making the securing of a loan more difficult, and could not have supplied the personal guarantees made by the general partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Intervenors' expert believed the partnerships could have obtained financing for the tender offer by forming a joint venture or by creating a new limited partnership. The purpose of establishing either would be to overcome the problems of small loan size and inability to form a cross-collateralization agreement. The expert also thought it would be possible for the partnerships to interest a lender in financing the tender offers individually, despite the small loan size, if all the loans were arranged at once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">City's expert submitted a rebuttal affidavit in which he explained why these schemes were not feasible. He wrote that the administrative expenses involved in creating a joint venture of the twenty-one limited partnerships would be prohibitive and that creating a new limited partnership to make the tender offers would be \"completely unworkable and uneconomical.\" He also reiterated that no lender would be interested in making loans of the size required for each partnership individually, even if all the loan requests were processed at once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the evidence, we think the district court was justified in holding that the partnerships could not have made the tender offers and that the derivative claims therefore had no value. Once this determination had been made City's potential conflict of interest dissipated, and its ability to represent the interests of the entire class of limited partners ceased to be impaired in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> No more than 15% of the units of any one partnership were actually tendered.
