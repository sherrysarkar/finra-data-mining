The National Labor Relations\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nBoard filed a host of unfair labor practice charges under   8\r\n\nof the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.   158, against\r\n\nYesterday's Children.   Yesterday's Children is  a non-profit\r\n\ncorporation which  operates,  among other  facilities,  Agape\r\n\nHouse,1  a  20-bed  residential  nursing  home  for  mentally\r\n\nretarded  adults in Ellsworth, Maine.   Evidence was heard in\r\n\nOctober 1993 by an  Administrative Law Judge, who recommended\r\n\ndismissal  of  all  the   charges,  based  in  part  on   his\r\n\ncredibility  determinations  after  observing the  witnesses.\r\n\nHis  decision was  reviewed by  a  three-member panel  of the\r\n\nNLRB.\r\n\n          The case comes  here with only  two of the  various\r\n\ncharges  still at  issue:   charges relating  to disciplinary\r\n\nactions taken against two employees,  nursing assistant Laura\r\n\nCunningham  and charge  nurse Jean  Smith.   As to  these two\r\n\ncharges,  the  Board  reversed  the ALJ  and  found  that the\r\n\nemployer's actions  were illegal  because the conduct  of the\r\n\ntwo employees was protected  by   7 of the  Act, 29 U.S.C.   \r\n\n157.   Cunningham  had been  issued  a written  reprimand for\r\n\n\"conduct unbecoming\" after calling  a co-worker to enlist her\r\n\nsupport  in  a letter-writing  campaign  to  the employer  in\r\n\nsupport of a recently discharged  supervisor.  Smith had been\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  During this  litigation, the facility's  name was changed\r\nfrom Agape House to Birchwood Living Center.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nissued   two  written   reprimands   and   then   discharged,\r\n\npurportedly for  her role in two  incidents involving patient\r\n\ncare.\r\n\n          The  Board ordered  reinstatement and back  pay for\r\n\nSmith and ordered the removal of the reprimands of both Smith\r\n\nand  Cunningham  from  the  employer's  files.    Yesterday's\r\n\nChildren  petitions this  court for  review, and  the General\r\n\nCounsel cross-petitions,  seeking  enforcement of  the  Board\r\n\norder.  We enforce the Smith order, but vacate the Cunningham\r\n\norder  and remand that portion  of the case  to the Board for\r\n\nfurther consideration.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The facts  are now largely undisputed.   During the\r\n\nfirst half of  1992 Laura Cunningham was  a nursing assistant\r\n\nat  Agape  House,  and  Smith  was  a  charge  nurse2  there.\r\n\nCunningham had been  working at Agape  House since 1988,  and\r\n\nSmith since 1985.  In January 1992, Jeffrey Cake was hired as\r\n\nthe  Executive  Director  of  Yesterday's  Children  and  the\r\n\nAdministrator of Agape House.\r\n\n          In mid-June 1992, Cunningham and Smith attempted to\r\n\nstart a  letter-writing campaign  to the employer's  Board of\r\n\nDirectors  in  support  of  the  recently  discharged  Glenda\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  record  does  not  reveal the  specific  duties  and\r\nresponsibilities of charge nurses at Agape House.  It appears\r\nthat the charge  nurse is the  head nurse on  a given  shift,\r\nthat  is,  the  person  at  the  facility  who  is  primarily\r\nresponsible for the medical care of the residents.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nLeavitt.  Leavitt is  alternately described in the  record as\r\n\nthe  \"Program Director\"  at  Agape House  and the  \"Qualified\r\n\nMental  Retardation Professional\"  (\"QMRP\") at  Agape House.3\r\n\nLeavitt had been fired by Cake on June 11, after  a series of\r\n\nletters  from state  authorities  led Cake  to conclude  that\r\n\nLeavitt did not have the required professional qualifications\r\n\nfor the position.   At the time of  the campaign, Leavitt was\r\n\nappealing her dismissal  to Yesterday's  Children's Board  of\r\n\nDirectors.\r\n\n          On  June 13,  Cunningham  called  Lucinda  Sargent,\r\n\nanother  nursing assistant,  at home  from a  nursing station\r\n\ntelephone to try  to enlist Sargent's support  in the letter-\r\n\nwriting  campaign.    Resolving  a  factual  dispute  between\r\n\nCunningham and  Sargent, the  ALJ determined  that Cunningham\r\n\nmade the  call during  her  work shift.   The  Board did  not\r\n\nquestion  this finding.   Cunningham made  several derogatory\r\n\nremarks  about   Cake  in   the  course  of   this  telephone\r\n\nconversation, referring  to him  as an \"asshole,\"  and saying\r\n\nthat she would like to \"get rid of\" him. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   Whatever her title, the record reflects that Leavitt was\r\nin  charge of  the implementation  and development  of active\r\ntreatment   services  for   the  residents.     It   was  her\r\nresponsibility to assess, evaluate, and  make recommendations\r\nto  an  interdisciplinary  team  of employees  on  goals  and\r\nobjectives for the residents and to monitor and  review those\r\nplans as they  were implemented.   She was  also involved  in\r\nemployee scheduling. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Sargent complained to her supervisor, Gayle Haslam,\r\n\nabout  the call.  Haslam  reported the incident  to Cake, who\r\n\nwrote a letter to Cunningham stating that her call to Sargent\r\n\n\"during regular working hours\" was, if the facts as  reported\r\n\nto  him were accurate, \"just cause for dismissal.\"  Cake then\r\n\nmet personally  with Cunningham to discuss  the incident, and\r\n\nconcluded  that  Cunningham's  effort  was  directed  not  at\r\n\nsupporting Leavitt, but at getting him (Cake) fired.\r\n\n          A  few days  later, Cake  sent Cunningham  a second\r\n\nletter which  constituted a \"formal  reprimand\" for  \"conduct\r\n\nunbecoming.\"    On  a  contemporaneous  \"employee  counseling\r\n\nform,\"  Cake noted  that  he had  reprimanded Cunningham  for\r\n\n\"using  agency  resources and  time  to  agitate against  the\r\n\nactions  of the  administration including  attempts to  place\r\n\nundue stress on other  staff while on duty.\"   Cunningham was\r\n\nnot fired.4\r\n\n          The conflicts  between Cake and  Smith ran  deeper.\r\n\nAlmost  immediately   upon  Cake's  arrival   at  Yesterday's\r\n\nChildren,  the two were at odds.   The ALJ traced this enmity\r\n\nto  January 1992, when a group of employees submitted to Cake\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  A  second   unfair   labor  practice   charge   regarding\r\nCunningham  involved an alleged \"interrogation\" of Cunningham\r\nby Cake in  response to rumors of a strike  in protest of the\r\nfiring of  Leavitt.  Cunningham claimed  that Cake threatened\r\nto fire any  employee who  walked out, but  the ALJ  credited\r\nCake's corroborated  testimony that  he made no  such threat.\r\nThe  Board upheld the ALJ's dismissal of this charge, and the\r\nGeneral Counsel does not press this claim on appeal.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\na  letter  requesting the  reinstatement  of  Liz Martin,  an\r\n\nemployee  Cake had  fired.   Smith's  name  led the  list  of\r\n\nsignatories.5    Then,  in  early  February,  Smith   angrily\r\n\nconfronted Cake, in front of another employee, over a memo he\r\n\nhad issued to employees stating  that he intended to withhold\r\n\npaychecks for a week to enable the  corporation to ride out a\r\n\ncash  flow crisis.  Cake  issued Smith an  official letter of\r\n\nreprimand after this incident,  which he later withdrew after\r\n\nSmith explained her views to him in greater detail.\r\n\n          In  June, Cake  discharged  Leavitt, and  Smith was\r\n\namong   the  employees   who  supported  Leavitt's   bid  for\r\n\nreinstatement.    Smith  and Cunningham  initiated  a letter-\r\n\nwriting campaign on Leavitt's  behalf.  Additionally, on July\r\n\n12, Smith and Leavitt met  with representatives of the Office\r\n\n&amp;  Professional  Employees   International  Union   regarding\r\n\norganizing  the facility.   Then,  on July  14, Smith  read a\r\n\nprepared letter in support of Leavitt to the employer's Board\r\n\nof  Directors, which  was meeting  at a  local hotel  to hear\r\n\nLeavitt's  appeal  of  her termination.6    Smith's statement\r\n\nincluded  sharp  criticism of  Cake.    After discussing  the\r\n\ncircumstances of  Leavitt's dismissal by Cake,  for instance,\r\n\nSmith claimed \"no professionalism was exhibited.\"  She stated\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Cunningham  also  signed this  letter,  a  fact noted  by\r\nneither the ALJ nor the Board.  In addition, thirty-one other\r\nemployees signed the letter.\r\n\n6.  This appeal was ultimately denied.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthat  Cake   \"has  managed  to  frighten   [the  staff]  into\r\n\nsubmission and silence by  threatening them with lawsuits and\r\n\ntheir  jobs.\"   Smith  also criticized  Cake's budget-cutting\r\n\ndecisions, which, she claimed,  had caused a deterioration in\r\n\nthe physical appearance of Agape House, posing health hazards\r\n\nto the residents.  During the meeting, the  Union distributed\r\n\nflyers outside on the street.  \r\n\n          Smith  was  also  involved  in   two  patient  care\r\n\nincidents  in July  1992.   One was denominated  the \"choking\r\n\nincident.\"   On  July 10,  Smith was  at the  nursing station\r\n\ntalking  with Dale  Zebulske, Leavitt's replacement  as QMRP,\r\n\nwhen they heard a brief scuffle a short distance away.  After\r\n\npeering down the hall, Smith said to Zebulske, whose back was\r\n\nto the incident, \"Patient     is choking patient    .\"  Smith\r\n\nclaims to have been joking and claims that there had  been no\r\n\nchoking at all.   Zebulske, however, did not realize  she was\r\n\njoking.  Later that day, Zebulske happened to be on the phone\r\n\nwith the mother of the resident he thought was the victim  of\r\n\nthe choking attack.   Though it was apparently  against Agape\r\n\nHouse policy,7 he  mentioned the incident to the  mother, who\r\n\nlater complained to state  authorities.  Although Smith would\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  No  explicit findings  were made  on this point,  but the\r\nBoard  apparently credited Smith's  undisputed testimony that\r\nYesterday's Children policy prohibited anyone other  than the\r\nstaff   social  worker,   Philip   Hurley,  from   contacting\r\nresidents'  parents about  incidents  like the  one  Zebulske\r\nthought had occurred.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nbe required to write up an \"incident report\" in  the event of\r\n\nan  incident like the one Zebulske believed occurred, she did\r\n\nnot doso (because,according toher, therehad beenno incident).\r\n\n          On July  16, at  the  request of  Joan Abbott,  the\r\n\nacting Director  of Nursing,8  Smith wrote an  explanation of\r\n\nthe  phantom incident; she said that  she had simply remarked\r\n\nto  Zebulske that it \"looked  like\" one of  the residents was\r\n\n\"going to choke\"  the other,  but that she  had no idea  that\r\n\nZebulske understood her to  be saying that a choking  attempt\r\n\nhad  in  fact  been made.    (Later,  at  the hearing,  Smith\r\n\ntestified  that  she had  been joking  and  that she  had not\r\n\nrealized that  Zebulske was taking  her seriously.)   On July\r\n\n21, Goss verbally counseled Smith for her \"poor judgment\" and\r\n\nissued a written confirmation of the counseling.  Cake signed\r\n\noff on this written confirmation.\r\n\n          The second patient care episode was denominated the\r\n\n\"sunburn  incident.\"  On July 16, a resident returned from an\r\n\nouting  with a serious sunburn on his shoulder.  Verna Chick,\r\n\na  staff  member who  had been  on  the outing,  reported the\r\n\nsunburn  to Cake and  to Smith, who  was the  charge nurse on\r\n\nduty at the time.   As required, Chick wrote  up an \"incident\r\n\nreport.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Abbott,  a   nurse  at   Agape  House,  was   filling  in\r\ntemporarily  for  Betty  Goss,  the  facility's  Director  of\r\nNursing, while Goss was on vacation.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Smith   applied  another   resident's  prescription\r\n\nSilvadene  ointment  to  the  sunburn.9    Smith  noted  this\r\n\ntreatment  on  Chick's  incident  report,  and  also  made  a\r\n\nnotation  in  the \"24-hour  notebook,\"  a  notebook in  which\r\n\nnurses  on  different  shifts  communicate  with  each  other\r\n\nconcerning patient matters.  She did not, however, record the\r\n\nincident  in  the  \"medical   logbook\"  (the  book  in  which\r\n\nindividualized records concerning each resident are kept) and\r\n\ndid  not enter it into the \"nursing notes\" (the formal record\r\n\nof nursing actions).10  These were both violations of policy.\r\n\n          Later, Smith told Ben Starbuck, the charge nurse in\r\n\nthe  next shift  (the  overnight shift),  about the  sunburn.\r\n\nStarbuck checked  the resident's  sunburn while  the resident\r\n\nslept  but took no other  action.  Starbuck,  in turn, claims\r\n\nthat he informed Virginia Conklin, the charge nurse  who took\r\n\nover in the morning,  about the sunburn.  Conklin  later told\r\n\nCake she had  not been informed  of the  sunburn, but at  the\r\n\nhearing admitted that she had been told.  Some time the  next\r\n\nmorning,  during Conklin's  shift, nursing  assistant Sargent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The state  investigators, who came in  later, erroneously\r\nconcluded  that the  resident's  sunburn went  untreated  for\r\nsixteen hours.   Both the ALJ and the  Board found that Smith\r\nhad in fact promptly treated the sunburn with Silvadene.\r\n\n10.   After  receiving a written reprimand  about the sunburn\r\nincident, however (see  below), Smith was  advised by one  of\r\nthe state  investigators  to  prepare  a late  entry  in  the\r\nnursing notes stating that she had applied Silvadene ointment\r\nto the sunburn.  She did this.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n(the  nursing  assistant  whom  Cunningham had  called  about\r\n\nLeavitt) allowed  the sunburned  resident to get  into a  hot\r\n\nwhirlpool  bath,  which  caused  extreme  blistering  of  the\r\n\nsunburn.   Sargent, who claims  that she had  not known about\r\n\nthe sunburn,  told Conklin about  the problem.   Conklin then\r\n\nwent to  Cake,  at  which  time Conklin  denied  having  been\r\n\ninformed  about the  sunburn.   Conklin then  arranged  for a\r\n\nprescription of Silvadene ointment for the resident.\r\n\n          On  July  27,  three  inspectors  from   the  State\r\n\nDepartment of  Human Services, which  had received  anonymous\r\n\ncomplaints about  Agape House,  showed up unannounced  at the\r\n\nfacility to investigate,  inter alia, the two  incidents.  At\r                                                \r\n\nthe end of their  visit, the state investigators gave  Goss a\r\n\nhand-written list of deficiencies.  Several shortcomings were\r\n\nnoted, including  the sunburn  incident (but not  the choking\r\n\nincident).    The  listed  deficiencies  were:   (1)  failure\r\n\nproperly  to  treat  a  resident for  an  ear  infection; (2)\r\n\ntreatment of  a resident with a psychotropic drug without the\r\n\nconsent  of his  guardian;  (3) failure  to establish  proper\r\n\nprocedures for  the use  of two psychotropic  drugs; and  (4)\r\n\nfailure  to treat a sunburn  for sixteen hours.   An official\r\n\nletter  of  violation  followed  on   August  19,  materially\r\n\nidentical to the July 27 hand-written list.\r\n\n            On  July  28,  Smith,  along  with  fifteen other\r\n\nemployees, attended a Union  organizing meeting and signed an\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nauthorization card.  The  next day, Goss told Cake  about the\r\n\nmeeting, but it is  unclear from the record whether  she told\r\n\nhim, or  he otherwise  discovered, that  Smith was  among the\r\n\nemployees who had attended the meeting.\r\n\n          On August 4, Goss issued Smith two separate written\r\n\nreprimands  for her  role  in the  sunburn  incident and  the\r\n\nchoking incident.  The choking incident reprimand stated that\r\n\nJames  Barnes,  one  of   the  state  inspectors,  \"was  very\r\n\nconcerned  about the  issue of  your judgement [sic]  and not\r\n\nsatisfied  with the  administrators [sic]  recommendations of\r\n\ncounseling.\"   However, Barnes  testified before the  ALJ and\r\n\ndenied having  ever expressed any such  dissatisfaction.  The\r\n\nsunburn incident  reprimand stated  that Smith's  \"failure to\r\n\nnote [the sunburn] within  [the patient's] medical records or\r\n\nexamine him  carefully, resulted in  his being placed  in the\r\n\nwhirlpool . . . .\"  The  letter went on  to state that  Smith\r\n\n\"failed  to properly act, both in terms of record keeping and\r\n\nin terms of making recommendations to the nurse assuming duty\r\n\nafter [her] shift.\"\r\n\n          On  August  10, Smith  was  fired.   The  discharge\r\n\nletter from Cake cited her conduct in the sunburn and choking\r\n\nincidents  and  her  lack  of   \"consistent  good  judgment.\"\r\n\nSmith's appeal of  her termination to the  board of directors\r\n\nwas denied.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          Because  the  employer asserts  that  there  is not\r\n\nsubstantial  evidence  supporting  the  Board's  unfair labor\r\n\npractice determinations,  and because  the Board and  the ALJ\r\n\nreached contrary conclusions, it is helpful to understand the\r\n\nopinions of the Board and of the ALJ.\r\n\nCunningham\r                      \r\n\n          The ALJ  found that  Cake \"honestly\"  believed that\r\n\nCunningham,  in  calling  Sargent,  was   agitating  for  his\r\n\ndismissal.  This aspect of  the call, said the ALJ, was  what\r\n\n\"bothered  Cake the most.\"  The ALJ found that the phone call\r\n\n\"was  clearly divorced . . . from any activity under the Act\"\r\n\nboth  because  it was  made  on  company time  using  company\r\n\nresources  (the   nursing  station  phone)  and   because  of\r\n\nCunningham's  derogatory  remarks  about Cake.    Hence,  the\r\n\nletter  of reprimand from Cake, concluded  the ALJ, though it\r\n\n\"may   have  not  been   completely  appropriate,\"  was  \"not\r\n\nunlawful.\"\r\n\n          On  appeal, the  Board,  without analyzing  whether\r\n\nCunningham's call was protected  by   7,11 ruled that  it did\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Section 7 provides, in relevant part, that:\r\n               Employees  shall  have the  right to\r\n          self-organization,  to   form,  join,  or\r\n          assist  labor  organizations, to  bargain\r\n          collectively  through representatives  of\r\n          their  own  choosing,  and  to  engage in\r\n          other   concerted   activities  for   the\r\n          purpose of collective bargaining or other\r\n          mutual aid and protection . . . .\r\n29 U.S.C.   157.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nnot lose  the protection of  the Act because  it was  made on\r\n\ncompany time or because of the derogatory remarks.  The Board\r\n\nreversed  the   ALJ,  finding  that   the  employer  violated\r\n\n  8(a)(1).12\r\n\n          The remarks  about Cake, said the  Board, were \"not\r\n\nso egregious as  to cause her to  lose the protection of  the\r\n\nAct.\"  The  prime focus of Cunningham's efforts, reasoned the\r\n\nBoard,  was not  to get  Cake fired  but was  to  get Leavitt\r\n\nreinstated, adding:\r\n\n          [E]mployees  who are engaged in Section 7\r\n          activity in  protest of actions  by their\r\n          employer  do not  lose the  protection of\r\n          the  Act simply because they mention that\r\n          they  dislike  an  employer  manager  and\r\n          would like to see the manager discharged.\r\n\nThe Board  stressed that there is no evidence that Cunningham\r\n\ntook any affirmative steps to get Cake fired.\r\n\n          Without discussing  whether  an employee's  use  of\r\n\ncompany time and company  resources to engage in the  kind of\r\n\nactivity at  issue here might justify a  reprimand, the Board\r\n\nstated  that the  employer had  failed to  establish that  it\r\n\ndisciplined Cunningham  for  this reason.   The  disciplinary\r\n\naction,  said the  Board, was  in response  to  the offensive\r\n\nremarks, not  to Cunningham's use of  company resources, and,\r\n\non these facts, this was impermissible.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  Section 8(a)(1) provides:  \"It shall  be an unfair labor\r\npractice  for an  employer  to interfere  with, restrain,  or\r\ncoerce  employees in  the  exercise of  rights guaranteed  in\r\n[  7].\"  29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1).\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nSmith\r                 \r\n\n          The Board's General Counsel asserted that Smith was\r\n\nfired for her engagement in activities protected under   7 of\r\n\nthe Act.  In contrast, the employer argued that she was fired\r\n\nfor her poor judgment and breach of proper protocol.  The ALJ\r\n\nemployed  the Wright  Line  burden-shifting  paradigm in  his\r                                      \r\n\nanalysis.    See  Wright  Line,  251  N.L.R.B.  1083  (1980),\r                                          \r\n\nenforced, 662 F.2d 899  (1st Cir. 1981).   He found that  the\r                    \r\n\nGeneral  Counsel had  failed to  \"make a prima  facie showing\r\n\nsufficient to  support the inference  that conduct  protected\r\n\nunder  the Act was a motivating factor\" in Smith's reprimands\r\n\nand  discharge.  The ALJ  found that \"Smith's  actions in the\r\n\n'choking'  and 'sunburn'  incidents did  prompt, in  part the\r\n\nstate  investigation\" and  that this,  \"together with  Cake's\r\n\npersonal dislike  for Smith,\" resulted in  the reprimands and\r\n\ntermination.  Thus,  the burden never shifted to the employer\r\n\nto show that the  punishment would have occurred even  in the\r\n\nabsence of  protected conduct  and the analysis  ended there.\r\n\nThe ALJ concluded that there was no unfair labor practice.\r\n\n          The Board, on appeal, reversed, finding a violation\r\n\nof    8(a)(1)  under  the same  Wright  Line  burden-shifting\r                                                        \r\n\nanalysis.  The elements  necessary to make out a  prima facie\r\n\ncase,  stated the Board,  are \"protected activity, knowledge,\r\n\ntiming,  and animus.\"  The Board said that all these elements\r\n\nwere  met  here.   Smith engaged  in  a variety  of protected\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nactivities; the  employer knew about her  engagement in these\r\n\nactivities; her reprimands and her termination were in \"close\r\n\nproximity\"  to the  employer's  learning about  her protected\r\n\nactivities;  and  the   employer's  animus  \"toward   Smith's\r\n\nprotected  activities  in  particular,  and   its  employees'\r\n\nprotected activities in general, is clear.\"\r\n\n          The  Board agreed with the  ALJ that Cake had acted\r\n\nout  of a personal dislike for Smith, but disagreed about the\r\n\nimport of this fact:\r\n\n          Cake's dislike of  Smith arose  initially\r\n          from   Cake's   resentment   of   Smith's\r\n          protected   activities. . . .  Thus,   as\r\n          Cake's dislike began from  animosity over\r\n          protected  activity,  we infer  that this\r\n          \"dislike\" was a product of  animus toward\r\n          Smith's protected activity.\r\n\nThus, the  Board found that the  General Counsel successfully\r\n\nmade out his prima facie case.\r\n\n          The  burden then shifted,  on the Board's analysis,\r\n\nto  Yesterday's   Children  to   show  that  it   would  have\r\n\ndisciplined and  discharged Smith even if she had not engaged\r\n\nin protected activities.  The Board found that the employer's\r\n\nproffered   explanation  --   that  Smith   failed  to   show\r\n\n\"'consistent    good   judgment    in   [her]    duties   and\r\n\nresponsibilities' with respect to the  'sunburn' and choking'\r\n\nincidents\"  --  was pretextual,  and  that  the employer  had\r\n\n\"failed to show that it  would have taken the same  action in\r\n\nthe absence of Smith's protected activity.\"\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          With regard to  the \"choking  incident,\" the  Board\r\n\nnoted that Zebulske, who violated company policy by informing\r\n\nthe  resident's mother  about  the phantom  incident, was  at\r\n\nleast  equally responsible  for the state  investigation, and\r\n\nyet was not disciplined  at all.  Additionally, the  August 4\r\n\nreprimand  from Goss  explained,  in light  of the  fact that\r\n\nSmith had already been scolded on July 21 for her role in the\r\n\nincident, that further reproach  was in order because Barnes,\r\n\none of the state investigators, was concerned about the issue\r\n\nof Smith's judgment and dissatisfied with the leniency of the\r\n\ncounseling.   Barnes, however, testified at  the hearing that\r\n\nhe had stated no such concern or dissatisfaction.\r\n\n          Regarding   the   \"sunburn  incident,\"   the  Board\r\n\nchallenged Cake's explanation that  Goss issued the reprimand\r\n\nto Smith  on  August  4  based on  the  state  investigators'\r\n\nreport,  which found  that Smith  had engaged  in  \"abuse\" by\r\n\nneglecting  to treat the  resident's sunburn.   The Board, in\r\n\ndiscrediting this explanation, noted  that the report did not\r\n\nissue  until  August 19,  after the  reprimand and  after the\r\n\ndischarge.13   Additionally,  while the  state investigators'\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The Board misread the  record.  The state investigators,\r\non the day of their investigation, July 27, gave Cake a hand-\r\nwritten list of deficiencies, which foreshadowed their formal\r\nfindings.    The  sunburn   incident  was  listed  among  the\r\ndeficiencies  on  this  note:   \"Client  suffered  a  sunburn\r\nresulting in blisters  on left shoulder  and not treated  for\r\nover  16  hours.\"    The  formal  letter,  dated  August  19,\r\nreiterated: \"[C]lient  sustained a sunburn  on 7/16/92, while\r\nat day  program,  which  resulted in  blisters  to  his  left\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreport  referenced  by  Goss's  letter  of  reprimand  listed\r\n\nvarious  deficiencies at  Agape House,  the Board  noted that\r\n\nonly Smith was disciplined in response to these deficiencies.\r\n\n          In conclusion, the Board said:\r\n\n          [H]aving found that  the General  Counsel\r\n          established a prima facie case warranting\r\n          an inference that  Smith was  reprimanded\r\n          and   subsequently  discharged   for  her\r\n          protected concerted  activity, and having\r\n          found   that   [Yesterday's   Children's]\r\n          explanations   for   its   actions   were\r\n          pretextual and that the actual reason for\r\n          Smith's reprimands and discharge were her\r\n          protected   concerted    activities,   we\r\n          conclude   that   [Yesterday's  Children]\r\n          violated Section  8(a)(1) by reprimanding\r\n          and subsequently discharging Smith.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Our standard  of review for decisions  of the Board\r\n\nis a deferential one.  \"As the Board is primarily responsible\r\n\nfor developing and applying a coherent national labor policy,\r\n\nwe  accord its  decisions considerable  deference.\"   NLRB v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBoston  Dist.

The Board  therefore  erred in\r\ndetermining that  the employer could  not have relied  on the\r\nstate investigators' findings on August 4 and August 10.\r\n          The investigators' citation erroneously stated that\r\nSmith failed to  treat the sunburn.

Conduct must  be both concerted  and protected to\r\n\nfall within    7.  In finding a   8(a)(1) violation, however,\r\n\nneither the Board nor the ALJ analyzed the issue, a close one\r\n\nin this case, of  whether Cunningham's concerted activity was\r\n\nprotected by    7.  This  compels a remand  to the Board  for\r\n\nfurther consideration.\r\n\n          The ALJ found that:\r\n\n          Cunningham's  phone  call to  Sargent was\r\n          improper  because it was  a personal call\r\n          made during working time from the nursing\r\n          station phone, rather than the employee's\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          phone.  But what bothered  Cake the most,\r\n          understandably,   was    the   derogatory\r\n          remarks made about him . . . .  That part\r\n          of Cunningham's call to Sargent regarding\r\n          support for Leavitt  could be  considered\r\n          protected  concerted  activity, if  taken\r\n          alone,  but other  aspects  of  the  call\r\n          (which  bothered  Cake the  most) clearly\r\n          divorced  the  call  from   any  activity\r\n          protected under the Act.\r\n\n          The  Board,  in reversing  the  ALJ  and finding  a\r\n\nviolation  of   8(a)(1),  misinterpreted the  ALJ's reasoning\r\n\nand in so doing \"glossed over the analytically tough question\r\n\npresented here.\"  NLRB v. Auciello Iron Works, Inc., 980 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n804,  811 (1st  Cir. 1992).   The  Board stated that  the ALJ\r\n\n\"found that  Cunningham's efforts  on behalf of  Leavitt were\r\n\nconcerted and protected,\" but that\r\n\n          [c]ontrary to  the [ALJ], we  do not find\r\n          that  Cunningham's  activities  lost  the\r\n          protection  of the Act either because (1)\r\n          the  conversation   contained  derogatory\r\n          remarks   about   Cake,   or    (2)   the\r\n          conversation alluded to the  discharge of\r\n          Cake, or (3) the  telephone call was made\r\n          during  working  time  from  the  nursing\r\n          station.\r\n\nThe  difficulty with the Board's position is that the ALJ did\r\n\nnot find  that Cunningham's  action was protected;  he simply\r               \r\n\nposited that even if her act were protected it would lose its\r                                \r\n\nprotection because of the manner in which she acted.\r\n\n          The end  result is  that neither  the  ALJ nor  the\r\n\nBoard  addressed the  basic  legal  issue underlying  whether\r\n\nCunningham's  phone call  was  protected by    7:   Leavitt's\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nundisputed  status  as  a  \"supervisor\"14   and  the  special\r\n\nstandards under    7 pertaining  to employee protests  of the\r\n\nemployer's supervisor-related actions.\r\n\n          The  General Counsel argues that the Board properly\r\n\nunderstood the ALJ's analysis.  This assertion is undermined,\r\n\nhowever,  by  the ALJ's  failure  even  to mention  Leavitt's\r\n\nstatus as  a  supervisor,  let alone  that  such  status  was\r\n\nrelevant to  the   7 inquiry.  The ALJ, on our reading of his\r\n\ndecision, did  not find that Cunningham's  call was protected\r\n\nby  the Act,  and  the Board  erred  in concluding  that  the\r\n\nconduct was  protected  without undertaking  the  appropriate\r\n\nlegal  analysis.    The  correct analysis,  as  both  parties\r\n\nimplicitly recognized, must begin  with the fact that Leavitt\r\n\nwas  a \"supervisor\"  for purposes  of the  Act, see  N.L.R.A.\r                                                               \r\n\n  2(11),  29  U.S.C.   152(11),  and that  Cunningham's phone\r\n\ncall  was at  best an  employee protest  about  a supervisory\r\n\nstaffing matter.\r\n\n          It is  fundamental to the structure of the Act that\r\n\n\"not all  forms of employee protest  over supervisory changes\r\n\nare  per se  protected.\"   Puerto Rico  Food Prods.

But the Regional Director, to whom the NLRB\r\n\nhad delegated its authority pursuant to   3(b) of the Act, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   153(b), found to the contrary on September 29, 1992.\r\n\nThe employer petitioned the NLRB for review of this decision.\r\n\n          In light of the adverse ruling in the certification\r\n\ncase, but  before the NLRB had  yet acted on  the request for\r\n\nreview,  the employer  chose not  to deny  that Smith  was an\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nemployee  in its November 19, 1992 answer to the complaint in\r\n\nthis  unfair labor  practice  case.   Shortly thereafter,  on\r\n\nDecember  14,  1992,  the  NLRB turned  down  the  employer's\r\n\nrequest for review of the Regional Director's finding in  the\r\n\ncertification case.  The  ALJ conducted the three-day hearing\r\n\nin this  unfair labor practice  case in  early October  1993.\r\n\nThen,  before the ALJ issued  his decision, the Supreme Court\r\n\ndecided Health Care on May 23, 1994, after which the employer\r                               \r\n\nsought  to amend  its  answer on  June  22.   The  ALJ, in  a\r\n\nfootnote to its  written opinion in  this case, issued  eight\r\n\ndays later on June 30, denied the motion without explanation,\r\n\nand the Board affirmed the denial on untimeliness grounds.\r\n\n          In  defense of  this  ruling,  the General  Counsel\r\n\ncites  the  basic  proposition  that  \"an  intervening  court\r\n\ndecision that  suggests a new and  previously unmade argument\r\n\nto  a respondent is not a circumstance that excuses a failure\r\n\nto raise the argument before an administrative  agency at the\r\n\ntime  appropriate  under   the  agency's  practice.\"     True\r\n\nenough,16 but at  the same  time it is  not entirely fair  to\r\n\ncharacterize  the  employer's  argument   here  as  \"new  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.

Significantly,\r\n\nthe  NLRB had not  yet ruled, at  the time of  the employer's\r\n\ninitial  filing of its answer in this case, on the employer's\r\n\npetition for review of the Regional Director's earlier ruling\r\n\non the charge nurses' non-supervisory status.   The fact that\r\n\nthe  employer  itself  had  sought  review  of  the  Regional\r\n\nDirector's decision, and that this request was pending at the\r\n\ntime the answer here  was filed, shows that the  employer did\r\n\nnot regard the Regional Director's decision as a final agency\r\n\ndetermination.    The  employer  should  have  preserved  the\r\n\nargument in this case by raising it in the pleadings.\r\n\n2.  Merits\r                      \r\n\n          Both the ALJ and the Board assumed without inquiry,\r\n\nfor the purpose of  the Wright Line analysis, that  Smith had\r                                               \r\n\nengaged  in  a range  of  protected  activities before  being\r\n\ndisciplined  by the  employer:  Smith's  signing a  letter to\r\n\nCake seeking  the reinstatement  of a co-worker,  Liz Martin;\r\n\nher confrontation with Cake  over Cake's decision to withhold\r\n\nemployee paychecks;  her initiation  of  the Leavitt  letter-\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nwriting campaign; her appearance before  the employer's board\r\n\nof directors on  Leavitt's behalf; and her two  meetings with\r\n\nUnion  organizers.   The Board  found that  Cake fired  Smith\r\n\nbecause he did  not like  her, and that  this dislike  \"arose\r\n\ninitially   from   [his]   resentment   of   [her]  protected\r\n\nactivities.\"    Thus,  concluded  the Board,  she  was  fired\r\n\nbecause of her protected activities.  \r\n\n          We  discount  two of  Smith's  activities  that the\r\n\nBoard deemed protected because  they were done in support  of\r\n\nLeavitt.  The  Board's analysis  is flawed  in precisely  the\r\n\nsame way as  its analysis of Cunningham's conduct.   However,\r\n\nSmith's  other cited  activities  -- the  Martin letter,  the\r\n\npaycheck  dispute, and  the Union  activity --  are obviously\r\n\nprotected.  They provide sufficient evidence in the record to\r\n\nuphold the  inference drawn by  the Board that  Cake disliked\r\n\nSmith because of her engagement in protected activities.  The\r\n\nBoard's view that Cake was, in effect,  discharging Smith for\r\n\nher involvement in these protected activities is a reasonable\r\n\none.  See  National Ass'n  of Letter  Carriers, 315  N.L.R.B.\r                                                          \r\n\n1176,  1178  &amp;  n.10  (1994) (if  employer's  animus  towards\r\n\nemployee  begins in  response  to  employee's protected  act,\r\n\nBoard  will presume  later  animus derives  from same  unless\r\n\ncontrary evidence presented).\r\n\n          The employer argues that it has met its Wright Line\r                                                                         \r\n\nburden because  it would have disciplined  Smith anyway, even\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nabsent the  protected activities, for her  involvement in the\r\n\nchoking  incident and the  sunburn incident.   Cake based the\r\n\nAugust 10 letter  of dismissal  largely on the  two August  4\r\n\nletters of reprimand  for those  two incidents.   If the  two\r\n\nletters of reprimand are pretextual, it follows, as the Board\r\n\nrecognized, that the letter  of dismissal is also pretextual.\r\n\nWe  address the two incidents  in turn, concluding that there\r\n\nis  sufficient support  for  the Board's  position that  both\r\n\nletters are pretextual.\r\n\n          Smith's  joke  about  an  attack  by  one  resident\r\n\nagainst  another  was   clearly  a  breach   of  professional\r\n\njudgment, especially  since Zebulske, the person  to whom she\r\n\nmade the facetious  remark, had only  begun working at  Agape\r\n\nHouse four days earlier and may  not have known Smith well at\r\n\nthis time.  The  Board, in calling it a  \"nonevent,\" blithely\r\n\nunderstated the seriousness of  the incident.17  The possible\r\n\nchoking  of one resident by  another is not  a joking matter.\r\n\nHowever,  the fact remains that both the timing of the August\r\n\n4  letter  of reprimand  and the  explanation offered  by the\r\n\nemployer for the discipline raise suspicions.\r\n\n          Smith had already been  verbally counselled by Goss\r\n\non July 21 about her role in the choking incident.   Cake had\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  The  General  Counsel  is  equally  cavalier  about  the\r\nchoking incident,  claiming that Zebulske's decision  to tell\r\nthe   resident's  mother   was  the   \"sole  cause\"   of  the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nrecommended  this  counseling,  and  he  signed  off  on  the\r\n\ncounselling  form.    This  level  of  discipline  apparently\r\n\nsatisfied  him  for two  weeks.   The  matter appeared  to be\r\n\nclosed, until it was reopened by the August 4 letter.\r\n\n          The  employer's stated  reasons for  increasing the\r\n\ndiscipline  on August 4 were that  Smith's breach of judgment\r\n\nhad, in part, led to the state investigation and that one  of\r\n\nthe investigators  was dissatisfied with the  leniency of the\r\n\nJuly 21 counselling.   Both explanations by the employer  are\r\n\nundercut  by the  record.   The  investigators'  hand-written\r\n\nstatement  of deficiencies  made  no mention  of the  choking\r\n\nincident  (nor  did  the   formal  letter  of  citation  that\r\n\nfollowed).  The  statement in  the August 4  letter that  the\r\n\nregional advocate, Barnes, was \"not satisfied\" with the prior\r\n\ndisciplinary measure is  even more  directly contradicted  by\r\n\nthe evidence.   In  testimony before  the ALJ, Barnes  stated\r\n\nthat,  while he  was aware  of the  choking incident  and had\r\n\ndiscussed it  with Cake,  he did not  express dissatisfaction\r\n\nwiththe informalcounselling orrecommendadditional discipline.\r\n\n          Additionally,  the  employer  took no  disciplinary\r\n\naction against Zebulske, who shared responsibility with Smith\r\n\nfor  the scandal.  It  was Zebulske who,  contrary to company\r\n\npolicy,  informed  the  resident's  mother  of   the  alleged\r\n\nchoking.   The existence  of disparate treatment  for similar\r\n\nmisconduct can  support a  finding of  improper motive.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nWyman-Gordon  Co. v. NLRB, 654 F.2d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                     \r\n\n          Given the employer's  implausible explanations  and\r\n\nthe disparate  treatment of  Smith and Zebulske,  the Board's\r\n\nconclusion  that the  August  4 reprimand  was pretextual  is\r\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\r\n\n          The  sunburn incident,  like the  choking incident,\r\n\nraises  serious concerns about  patient care.   The  story is\r\n\ntroubling in  two distinct ways.   First, while  the resident\r\n\nwas promptly  treated, the treatment was  with someone else's\r\n\nprescription ointment and  the treating nurse,  Smith, failed\r\n\nto create complete records.  Second, the resident was allowed\r\n\nthe  next morning  to get  into a  hot whirlpool  bath, which\r\n\ncaused  severe   blistering.    Clearly,  patient   care  was\r\n\ncompromised even before the  whirlpool, and Smith is squarely\r\n\nto  blame  for  this.   Nevertheless,  there  is  substantial\r\n\nevidence in the record to support the Board's conclusion that\r\n\nthe  employer's August 4 letter of reprimand to Smith for the\r\n\nsunburn incident was pretextual.\r\n\n          The August 4 letter states that Smith's \"failure to\r\n\nnote  [the sunburn]  within [the  patient's] medical  records\r\n\nresulted  in his  being placed  in the  whirlpool.\"   The ALJ\r\n\nfound,   however,  that  Smith,   despite  making  incomplete\r\n\ntreatment   records,   personally   informed  Starbuck,   the\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\novernight charge nurse, about  the resident's sunburn.18  And\r\n\nStarbuck, in turn, told Conklin, the charge nurse who came on\r\n\nduty in the morning.  It  was on Conklin's watch that nursing\r\n\nassistant Sargent allowed the  sunburned resident to get into\r\n\nthe hot bath.\r\n\n          The employer  does not challenge these  findings of\r\n\nfact.  It is clear that either Conklin or Sargent  -- and not\r\n\nSmith -- was to blame for the resident's being allowed to get\r\n\ninto the whirlpool.  This fault is at  least equal to Smith's\r\n\nfault.    But  only Smith  was  disciplined  for the  sunburn\r\n\nincident.   While the  employer was undoubtedly  justified in\r\n\ndisciplining her for  her role in the  incident, the employer\r\n\nhas  failed to explain why  no one else  was disciplined too.\r\n\nThis disparate  treatment is telling.   See Wyman-Gordon, 654\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 141.19\r\n\n          Like  us,  the Board  viewed  this  as a  disparate\r\n\ntreatment  case, but the Board  also relied on  the fact that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  Smith also  made a  notation in the  \"24-hour notebook,\"\r\nthe notebook in which nurses  at Agape House communicate with\r\neach  other across shifts.   The August 4  letter is somewhat\r\ndisingenuous, then, in stating that Smith \"failed to properly\r\nact, both in  terms of record keeping and in  terms of making\r\nrecommendations  to  the  nurse  assuming  duty  after  [her]\r\nshift.\"\r\n\n19.  Additionally,   a  few  weeks  after  Smith's  dismissal\r\nanother nurse  at Agape House was reprimanded, but not fired,\r\nfor  applying Silvadene  to  a sunburned  resident without  a\r\nprescription.  This too is reflective of disparate treatment.\r\nHowever,  a year before Smith's discharge,  a nurse was fired\r                                                                   \r\nfor the more  serious offense of giving a  seizure medication\r\nto a resident without a prescription.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nthe  employees  responsible for  the four  other deficiencies\r\n\ncited  by the  state  investigators were  not disciplined  by\r\n\nYesterday's Children.   The employer  has convincingly argued\r\n\nthat  these  other deficiencies  were  systemic problems  for\r\n\nwhich  no individual  employees were  at fault.   Our  focus,\r\n\nconsequently, is  on the other employees  responsible for the\r\n\nsunburn  incident.   While our  disparate treatment  analysis\r\n\ndiffers somewhat from the Board's, we think  that the Board's\r\n\nultimate conclusion of pretext is a reasonable one.\r\n\n          Because  we  conclude  that  there  is  substantial\r\n\nevidence  in the record to support the Board's inference that\r\n\nthe  employer's  discipline of  Smith  for  both the  choking\r\n\nincident and the sunburn incident was pretextual, the Board's\r\n\nSmith order  is enforced.   For reasons discussed  above, the\r                                    \r\n\nBoard's Cunningham order is vacated and her case  is remanded\r                                                                         \r\n\nto the Board for further consideration.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n",

Evidence was heard in\r\n\nOctober 1993 by an  Administrative Law Judge, who recommended\r\n\ndismissal  of  all  the   charges,  based  in  part  on   his\r\n\ncredibility  determinations  after  observing the  witnesses.\r\n\nHis  decision was  reviewed by  a  three-member panel  of the\r\n\nNLRB.\r\n\n          The case comes  here with only  two of the  various\r\n\ncharges  still at  issue:   charges relating  to disciplinary\r\n\nactions taken against two employees,  nursing assistant Laura\r\n\nCunningham  and charge  nurse Jean  Smith.   As to  these two\r\n\ncharges,  the  Board  reversed  the ALJ  and  found  that the\r\n\nemployer's actions  were illegal  because the conduct  of the\r\n\ntwo employees was protected  by   7 of the  Act, 29 U.S.C.   \r\n\n157.   Cunningham  had been  issued  a written  reprimand for\r\n\n\"conduct unbecoming\" after calling  a co-worker to enlist her\r\n\nsupport  in  a letter-writing  campaign  to  the employer  in\r\n\nsupport of a recently discharged  supervisor.  Smith had been\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  During this  litigation, the facility's  name was changed\r\nfrom Agape House to Birchwood Living Center.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nissued   two  written   reprimands   and   then   discharged,\r\n\npurportedly for  her role in two  incidents involving patient\r\n\ncare.\r\n\n          The  Board ordered  reinstatement and back  pay for\r\n\nSmith and ordered the removal of the reprimands of both Smith\r\n\nand  Cunningham  from  the  employer's  files.    Yesterday's\r\n\nChildren  petitions this  court for  review, and  the General\r\n\nCounsel cross-petitions,  seeking  enforcement of  the  Board\r\n\norder.  We enforce the Smith order, but vacate the Cunningham\r\n\norder  and remand that portion  of the case  to the Board for\r\n\nfurther consideration.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The facts  are now largely undisputed.   During the\r\n\nfirst half of  1992 Laura Cunningham was  a nursing assistant\r\n\nat  Agape  House,  and  Smith  was  a  charge  nurse2  there.\r\n\nCunningham had been  working at Agape  House since 1988,  and\r\n\nSmith since 1985.  In January 1992, Jeffrey Cake was hired as\r\n\nthe  Executive  Director  of  Yesterday's  Children  and  the\r\n\nAdministrator of Agape House.\r\n\n          In mid-June 1992, Cunningham and Smith attempted to\r\n\nstart a  letter-writing campaign  to the employer's  Board of\r\n\nDirectors  in  support  of  the  recently  discharged  Glenda\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  record  does  not  reveal the  specific  duties  and\r\nresponsibilities of charge nurses at Agape House.  It appears\r\nthat the charge  nurse is the  head nurse on  a given  shift,\r\nthat  is,  the  person  at  the  facility  who  is  primarily\r\nresponsible for the medical care of the residents.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nLeavitt.  Leavitt is  alternately described in the  record as\r\n\nthe  \"Program Director\"  at  Agape House  and the  \"Qualified\r\n\nMental  Retardation Professional\"  (\"QMRP\") at  Agape House.3\r\n\nLeavitt had been fired by Cake on June 11, after  a series of\r\n\nletters  from state  authorities  led Cake  to conclude  that\r\n\nLeavitt did not have the required professional qualifications\r\n\nfor the position.   At the time of  the campaign, Leavitt was\r\n\nappealing her dismissal  to Yesterday's  Children's Board  of\r\n\nDirectors.\r\n\n          On  June 13,  Cunningham  called  Lucinda  Sargent,\r\n\nanother  nursing assistant,  at home  from a  nursing station\r\n\ntelephone to try  to enlist Sargent's support  in the letter-\r\n\nwriting  campaign.    Resolving  a  factual  dispute  between\r\n\nCunningham and  Sargent, the  ALJ determined  that Cunningham\r\n\nmade the  call during  her  work shift.   The  Board did  not\r\n\nquestion  this finding.   Cunningham made  several derogatory\r\n\nremarks  about   Cake  in   the  course  of   this  telephone\r\n\nconversation, referring  to him  as an \"asshole,\"  and saying\r\n\nthat she would like to \"get rid of\" him. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   Whatever her title, the record reflects that Leavitt was\r\nin  charge of  the implementation  and development  of active\r\ntreatment   services  for   the  residents.     It   was  her\r\nresponsibility to assess, evaluate, and  make recommendations\r\nto  an  interdisciplinary  team  of employees  on  goals  and\r\nobjectives for the residents and to monitor and  review those\r\nplans as they  were implemented.   She was  also involved  in\r\nemployee scheduling. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Sargent complained to her supervisor, Gayle Haslam,\r\n\nabout  the call.  Haslam  reported the incident  to Cake, who\r\n\nwrote a letter to Cunningham stating that her call to Sargent\r\n\n\"during regular working hours\" was, if the facts as  reported\r\n\nto  him were accurate, \"just cause for dismissal.\"  Cake then\r\n\nmet personally  with Cunningham to discuss  the incident, and\r\n\nconcluded  that  Cunningham's  effort  was  directed  not  at\r\n\nsupporting Leavitt, but at getting him (Cake) fired.\r\n\n          A  few days  later, Cake  sent Cunningham  a second\r\n\nletter which  constituted a \"formal  reprimand\" for  \"conduct\r\n\nunbecoming.\"    On  a  contemporaneous  \"employee  counseling\r\n\nform,\"  Cake noted  that  he had  reprimanded Cunningham  for\r\n\n\"using  agency  resources and  time  to  agitate against  the\r\n\nactions  of the  administration including  attempts to  place\r\n\nundue stress on other  staff while on duty.\"   Cunningham was\r\n\nnot fired.4\r\n\n          The conflicts  between Cake and  Smith ran  deeper.\r\n\nAlmost  immediately   upon  Cake's  arrival   at  Yesterday's\r\n\nChildren,  the two were at odds.   The ALJ traced this enmity\r\n\nto  January 1992, when a group of employees submitted to Cake\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  A  second   unfair   labor  practice   charge   regarding\r\nCunningham  involved an alleged \"interrogation\" of Cunningham\r\nby Cake in  response to rumors of a strike  in protest of the\r\nfiring of  Leavitt.  Cunningham claimed  that Cake threatened\r\nto fire any  employee who  walked out, but  the ALJ  credited\r\nCake's corroborated  testimony that  he made no  such threat.\r\nThe  Board upheld the ALJ's dismissal of this charge, and the\r\nGeneral Counsel does not press this claim on appeal.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\na  letter  requesting the  reinstatement  of  Liz Martin,  an\r\n\nemployee  Cake had  fired.   Smith's  name  led the  list  of\r\n\nsignatories.5    Then,  in  early  February,  Smith   angrily\r\n\nconfronted Cake, in front of another employee, over a memo he\r\n\nhad issued to employees stating  that he intended to withhold\r\n\npaychecks for a week to enable the  corporation to ride out a\r\n\ncash  flow crisis.  Cake  issued Smith an  official letter of\r\n\nreprimand after this incident,  which he later withdrew after\r\n\nSmith explained her views to him in greater detail.\r\n\n          In  June, Cake  discharged  Leavitt, and  Smith was\r\n\namong   the  employees   who  supported  Leavitt's   bid  for\r\n\nreinstatement.    Smith  and Cunningham  initiated  a letter-\r\n\nwriting campaign on Leavitt's  behalf.  Additionally, on July\r\n\n12, Smith and Leavitt met  with representatives of the Office\r\n\n&amp;  Professional  Employees   International  Union   regarding\r\n\norganizing  the facility.   Then,  on July  14, Smith  read a\r\n\nprepared letter in support of Leavitt to the employer's Board\r\n\nof  Directors, which  was meeting  at a  local hotel  to hear\r\n\nLeavitt's  appeal  of  her termination.6    Smith's statement\r\n\nincluded  sharp  criticism of  Cake.    After discussing  the\r\n\ncircumstances of  Leavitt's dismissal by Cake,  for instance,\r\n\nSmith claimed \"no professionalism was exhibited.\"  She stated\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Cunningham  also  signed this  letter,  a  fact noted  by\r\nneither the ALJ nor the Board.  In addition, thirty-one other\r\nemployees signed the letter.\r\n\n6.  This appeal was ultimately denied.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthat  Cake   \"has  managed  to  frighten   [the  staff]  into\r\n\nsubmission and silence by  threatening them with lawsuits and\r\n\ntheir  jobs.\"   Smith  also criticized  Cake's budget-cutting\r\n\ndecisions, which, she claimed,  had caused a deterioration in\r\n\nthe physical appearance of Agape House, posing health hazards\r\n\nto the residents.  During the meeting, the  Union distributed\r\n\nflyers outside on the street.  \r\n\n          Smith  was  also  involved  in   two  patient  care\r\n\nincidents  in July  1992.   One was denominated  the \"choking\r\n\nincident.\"   On  July 10,  Smith was  at the  nursing station\r\n\ntalking  with Dale  Zebulske, Leavitt's replacement  as QMRP,\r\n\nwhen they heard a brief scuffle a short distance away.  After\r\n\npeering down the hall, Smith said to Zebulske, whose back was\r\n\nto the incident, \"Patient     is choking patient    .\"  Smith\r\n\nclaims to have been joking and claims that there had  been no\r\n\nchoking at all.   Zebulske, however, did not realize  she was\r\n\njoking.  Later that day, Zebulske happened to be on the phone\r\n\nwith the mother of the resident he thought was the victim  of\r\n\nthe choking attack.   Though it was apparently  against Agape\r\n\nHouse policy,7 he  mentioned the incident to the  mother, who\r\n\nlater complained to state  authorities.  Although Smith would\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  No  explicit findings  were made  on this point,  but the\r\nBoard  apparently credited Smith's  undisputed testimony that\r\nYesterday's Children policy prohibited anyone other  than the\r\nstaff   social  worker,   Philip   Hurley,  from   contacting\r\nresidents'  parents about  incidents  like the  one  Zebulske\r\nthought had occurred.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nbe required to write up an \"incident report\" in  the event of\r\n\nan  incident like the one Zebulske believed occurred, she did\r\n\nnot doso (because,according toher, therehad beenno incident).\r\n\n          On July  16, at  the  request of  Joan Abbott,  the\r\n\nacting Director  of Nursing,8  Smith wrote an  explanation of\r\n\nthe  phantom incident; she said that  she had simply remarked\r\n\nto  Zebulske that it \"looked  like\" one of  the residents was\r\n\n\"going to choke\"  the other,  but that she  had no idea  that\r\n\nZebulske understood her to  be saying that a choking  attempt\r\n\nhad  in  fact  been made.    (Later,  at  the hearing,  Smith\r\n\ntestified  that  she had  been joking  and  that she  had not\r\n\nrealized that  Zebulske was taking  her seriously.)   On July\r\n\n21, Goss verbally counseled Smith for her \"poor judgment\" and\r\n\nissued a written confirmation of the counseling.  Cake signed\r\n\noff on this written confirmation.\r\n\n          The second patient care episode was denominated the\r\n\n\"sunburn  incident.\"  On July 16, a resident returned from an\r\n\nouting  with a serious sunburn on his shoulder.  Verna Chick,\r\n\na  staff  member who  had been  on  the outing,  reported the\r\n\nsunburn  to Cake and  to Smith, who  was the  charge nurse on\r\n\nduty at the time.   As required, Chick wrote  up an \"incident\r\n\nreport.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Abbott,  a   nurse  at   Agape  House,  was   filling  in\r\ntemporarily  for  Betty  Goss,  the  facility's  Director  of\r\nNursing, while Goss was on vacation.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Smith   applied  another   resident's  prescription\r\n\nSilvadene  ointment  to  the  sunburn.9    Smith  noted  this\r\n\ntreatment  on  Chick's  incident  report,  and  also  made  a\r\n\nnotation  in  the \"24-hour  notebook,\"  a  notebook in  which\r\n\nnurses  on  different  shifts  communicate  with  each  other\r\n\nconcerning patient matters.  She did not, however, record the\r\n\nincident  in  the  \"medical   logbook\"  (the  book  in  which\r\n\nindividualized records concerning each resident are kept) and\r\n\ndid  not enter it into the \"nursing notes\" (the formal record\r\n\nof nursing actions).10  These were both violations of policy.\r\n\n          Later, Smith told Ben Starbuck, the charge nurse in\r\n\nthe  next shift  (the  overnight shift),  about the  sunburn.\r\n\nStarbuck checked  the resident's  sunburn while  the resident\r\n\nslept  but took no other  action.  Starbuck,  in turn, claims\r\n\nthat he informed Virginia Conklin, the charge nurse  who took\r\n\nover in the morning,  about the sunburn.  Conklin  later told\r\n\nCake she had  not been informed  of the  sunburn, but at  the\r\n\nhearing admitted that she had been told.  Some time the  next\r\n\nmorning,  during Conklin's  shift, nursing  assistant Sargent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The state  investigators, who came in  later, erroneously\r\nconcluded  that the  resident's  sunburn went  untreated  for\r\nsixteen hours.   Both the ALJ and the  Board found that Smith\r\nhad in fact promptly treated the sunburn with Silvadene.\r\n\n10.   After  receiving a written reprimand  about the sunburn\r\nincident, however (see  below), Smith was  advised by one  of\r\nthe state  investigators  to  prepare  a late  entry  in  the\r\nnursing notes stating that she had applied Silvadene ointment\r\nto the sunburn.  She did this.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n(the  nursing  assistant  whom  Cunningham had  called  about\r\n\nLeavitt) allowed  the sunburned  resident to get  into a  hot\r\n\nwhirlpool  bath,  which  caused  extreme  blistering  of  the\r\n\nsunburn.   Sargent, who claims  that she had  not known about\r\n\nthe sunburn,  told Conklin about  the problem.   Conklin then\r\n\nwent to  Cake,  at  which  time Conklin  denied  having  been\r\n\ninformed  about the  sunburn.   Conklin then  arranged  for a\r\n\nprescription of Silvadene ointment for the resident.\r\n\n          On  July  27,  three  inspectors  from   the  State\r\n\nDepartment of  Human Services, which  had received  anonymous\r\n\ncomplaints about  Agape House,  showed up unannounced  at the\r\n\nfacility to investigate,  inter alia, the two  incidents.  At\r                                                \r\n\nthe end of their  visit, the state investigators gave  Goss a\r\n\nhand-written list of deficiencies.  Several shortcomings were\r\n\nnoted, including  the sunburn  incident (but not  the choking\r\n\nincident).    The  listed  deficiencies  were:   (1)  failure\r\n\nproperly  to  treat  a  resident for  an  ear  infection; (2)\r\n\ntreatment of  a resident with a psychotropic drug without the\r\n\nconsent  of his  guardian;  (3) failure  to establish  proper\r\n\nprocedures for  the use  of two psychotropic  drugs; and  (4)\r\n\nfailure  to treat a sunburn  for sixteen hours.   An official\r\n\nletter  of  violation  followed  on   August  19,  materially\r\n\nidentical to the July 27 hand-written list.\r\n\n            On  July  28,  Smith,  along  with  fifteen other\r\n\nemployees, attended a Union  organizing meeting and signed an\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nauthorization card.  The  next day, Goss told Cake  about the\r\n\nmeeting, but it is  unclear from the record whether  she told\r\n\nhim, or  he otherwise  discovered, that  Smith was  among the\r\n\nemployees who had attended the meeting.\r\n\n          On August 4, Goss issued Smith two separate written\r\n\nreprimands  for her  role  in the  sunburn  incident and  the\r\n\nchoking incident.  The choking incident reprimand stated that\r\n\nJames  Barnes,  one  of   the  state  inspectors,  \"was  very\r\n\nconcerned  about the  issue of  your judgement [sic]  and not\r\n\nsatisfied  with the  administrators [sic]  recommendations of\r\n\ncounseling.\"   However, Barnes  testified before the  ALJ and\r\n\ndenied having  ever expressed any such  dissatisfaction.  The\r\n\nsunburn incident  reprimand stated  that Smith's  \"failure to\r\n\nnote [the sunburn] within  [the patient's] medical records or\r\n\nexamine him  carefully, resulted in  his being placed  in the\r\n\nwhirlpool . . . .\"  The  letter went on  to state that  Smith\r\n\n\"failed  to properly act, both in terms of record keeping and\r\n\nin terms of making recommendations to the nurse assuming duty\r\n\nafter [her] shift.\"\r\n\n          On  August  10, Smith  was  fired.   The  discharge\r\n\nletter from Cake cited her conduct in the sunburn and choking\r\n\nincidents  and  her  lack  of   \"consistent  good  judgment.\"\r\n\nSmith's appeal of  her termination to the  board of directors\r\n\nwas denied.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          Because  the  employer asserts  that  there  is not\r\n\nsubstantial  evidence  supporting  the  Board's  unfair labor\r\n\npractice determinations,  and because  the Board and  the ALJ\r\n\nreached contrary conclusions, it is helpful to understand the\r\n\nopinions of the Board and of the ALJ.\r\n\nCunningham\r                      \r\n\n          The ALJ  found that  Cake \"honestly\"  believed that\r\n\nCunningham,  in  calling  Sargent,  was   agitating  for  his\r\n\ndismissal.  This aspect of  the call, said the ALJ, was  what\r\n\n\"bothered  Cake the most.\"  The ALJ found that the phone call\r\n\n\"was  clearly divorced . . . from any activity under the Act\"\r\n\nboth  because  it was  made  on  company time  using  company\r\n\nresources  (the   nursing  station  phone)  and   because  of\r\n\nCunningham's  derogatory  remarks  about Cake.    Hence,  the\r\n\nletter  of reprimand from Cake, concluded  the ALJ, though it\r\n\n\"may   have  not  been   completely  appropriate,\"  was  \"not\r\n\nunlawful.\"\r\n\n          On  appeal, the  Board,  without analyzing  whether\r\n\nCunningham's call was protected  by   7,11 ruled that  it did\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.

The  disciplinary\r\n\naction,  said the  Board, was  in response  to  the offensive\r\n\nremarks, not  to Cunningham's use of  company resources, and,\r\n\non these facts, this was impermissible.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

He found that  the\r                    \r\n\nGeneral  Counsel had  failed to  \"make a prima  facie showing\r\n\nsufficient to  support the inference  that conduct  protected\r\n\nunder  the Act was a motivating factor\" in Smith's reprimands\r\n\nand  discharge.  The ALJ  found that \"Smith's  actions in the\r\n\n'choking'  and 'sunburn'  incidents did  prompt, in  part the\r\n\nstate  investigation\" and  that this,  \"together with  Cake's\r\n\npersonal dislike  for Smith,\" resulted in  the reprimands and\r\n\ntermination.  Thus,  the burden never shifted to the employer\r\n\nto show that the  punishment would have occurred even  in the\r\n\nabsence of  protected conduct  and the analysis  ended there.\r\n\nThe ALJ concluded that there was no unfair labor practice.\r\n\n          The Board, on appeal, reversed, finding a violation\r\n\nof    8(a)(1)  under  the same  Wright  Line  burden-shifting\r                                                        \r\n\nanalysis.  The elements  necessary to make out a  prima facie\r\n\ncase,  stated the Board,  are \"protected activity, knowledge,\r\n\ntiming,  and animus.\"  The Board said that all these elements\r\n\nwere  met  here.   Smith engaged  in  a variety  of protected\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nactivities; the  employer knew about her  engagement in these\r\n\nactivities; her reprimands and her termination were in \"close\r\n\nproximity\"  to the  employer's  learning about  her protected\r\n\nactivities;  and  the   employer's  animus  \"toward   Smith's\r\n\nprotected  activities  in  particular,  and   its  employees'\r\n\nprotected activities in general, is clear.\"\r\n\n          The  Board agreed with the  ALJ that Cake had acted\r\n\nout  of a personal dislike for Smith, but disagreed about the\r\n\nimport of this fact:\r\n\n          Cake's dislike of  Smith arose  initially\r\n          from   Cake's   resentment   of   Smith's\r\n          protected   activities. . . .  Thus,   as\r\n          Cake's dislike began from  animosity over\r\n          protected  activity,  we infer  that this\r\n          \"dislike\" was a product of  animus toward\r\n          Smith's protected activity.\r\n\nThus, the  Board found that the  General Counsel successfully\r\n\nmade out his prima facie case.\r\n\n          The  burden then shifted,  on the Board's analysis,\r\n\nto  Yesterday's   Children  to   show  that  it   would  have\r\n\ndisciplined and  discharged Smith even if she had not engaged\r\n\nin protected activities.  The Board found that the employer's\r\n\nproffered   explanation  --   that  Smith   failed  to   show\r\n\n\"'consistent    good   judgment    in   [her]    duties   and\r\n\nresponsibilities' with respect to the  'sunburn' and choking'\r\n\nincidents\"  --  was pretextual,  and  that  the employer  had\r\n\n\"failed to show that it  would have taken the same  action in\r\n\nthe absence of Smith's protected activity.\"\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          With regard to  the \"choking  incident,\" the  Board\r\n\nnoted that Zebulske, who violated company policy by informing\r\n\nthe  resident's mother  about  the phantom  incident, was  at\r\n\nleast  equally responsible  for the state  investigation, and\r\n\nyet was not disciplined  at all.  Additionally, the  August 4\r\n\nreprimand  from Goss  explained,  in light  of the  fact that\r\n\nSmith had already been scolded on July 21 for her role in the\r\n\nincident, that further reproach  was in order because Barnes,\r\n\none of the state investigators, was concerned about the issue\r\n\nof Smith's judgment and dissatisfied with the leniency of the\r\n\ncounseling.   Barnes, however, testified at  the hearing that\r\n\nhe had stated no such concern or dissatisfaction.\r\n\n          Regarding   the   \"sunburn  incident,\"   the  Board\r\n\nchallenged Cake's explanation that  Goss issued the reprimand\r\n\nto Smith  on  August  4  based on  the  state  investigators'\r\n\nreport,  which found  that Smith  had engaged  in  \"abuse\" by\r\n\nneglecting  to treat the  resident's sunburn.   The Board, in\r\n\ndiscrediting this explanation, noted  that the report did not\r\n\nissue  until  August 19,  after the  reprimand and  after the\r\n\ndischarge.13   Additionally,  while the  state investigators'\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The Board misread the  record.  The state investigators,\r\non the day of their investigation, July 27, gave Cake a hand-\r\nwritten list of deficiencies, which foreshadowed their formal\r\nfindings.    The  sunburn   incident  was  listed  among  the\r\ndeficiencies  on  this  note:   \"Client  suffered  a  sunburn\r\nresulting in blisters  on left shoulder  and not treated  for\r\nover  16  hours.\"    The  formal  letter,  dated  August  19,\r\nreiterated: \"[C]lient  sustained a sunburn  on 7/16/92, while\r\nat day  program,  which  resulted in  blisters  to  his  left\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreport  referenced  by  Goss's  letter  of  reprimand  listed\r\n\nvarious  deficiencies at  Agape House,  the Board  noted that\r\n\nonly Smith was disciplined in response to these deficiencies.\r\n\n          In conclusion, the Board said:\r\n\n          [H]aving found that  the General  Counsel\r\n          established a prima facie case warranting\r\n          an inference that  Smith was  reprimanded\r\n          and   subsequently  discharged   for  her\r\n          protected concerted  activity, and having\r\n          found   that   [Yesterday's   Children's]\r\n          explanations   for   its   actions   were\r\n          pretextual and that the actual reason for\r\n          Smith's reprimands and discharge were her\r\n          protected   concerted    activities,   we\r\n          conclude   that   [Yesterday's  Children]\r\n          violated Section  8(a)(1) by reprimanding\r\n          and subsequently discharging Smith.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Our standard  of review for decisions  of the Board\r\n\nis a deferential one.  \"As the Board is primarily responsible\r\n\nfor developing and applying a coherent national labor policy,\r\n\nwe  accord its  decisions considerable  deference.\"   NLRB v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBoston  Dist.

The  Board stated that  the ALJ\r\n\n\"found that  Cunningham's efforts  on behalf of  Leavitt were\r\n\nconcerted and protected,\" but that\r\n\n          [c]ontrary to  the [ALJ], we  do not find\r\n          that  Cunningham's  activities  lost  the\r\n          protection  of the Act either because (1)\r\n          the  conversation   contained  derogatory\r\n          remarks   about   Cake,   or    (2)   the\r\n          conversation alluded to the  discharge of\r\n          Cake, or (3) the  telephone call was made\r\n          during  working  time  from  the  nursing\r\n          station.\r\n\nThe  difficulty with the Board's position is that the ALJ did\r\n\nnot find  that Cunningham's  action was protected;  he simply\r               \r\n\nposited that even if her act were protected it would lose its\r                                \r\n\nprotection because of the manner in which she acted.\r\n\n          The end  result is  that neither  the  ALJ nor  the\r\n\nBoard  addressed the  basic  legal  issue underlying  whether\r\n\nCunningham's  phone call  was  protected by    7:   Leavitt's\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nundisputed  status  as  a  \"supervisor\"14   and  the  special\r\n\nstandards under    7 pertaining  to employee protests  of the\r\n\nemployer's supervisor-related actions.\r\n\n          The  General Counsel argues that the Board properly\r\n\nunderstood the ALJ's analysis.  This assertion is undermined,\r\n\nhowever,  by  the ALJ's  failure  even  to mention  Leavitt's\r\n\nstatus as  a  supervisor,  let alone  that  such  status  was\r\n\nrelevant to  the   7 inquiry.

One  of\r\n\nthese proceedings (RC-19849) involved the  certification of a\r\n\nclaimed bargaining unit which included the  facility's charge\r\n\nnurses.  In this proceeding,  the employer took the  position\r\n\nthat the charge nurses were supervisors under the Act, rather\r\n\nthan  employees.  But the Regional Director, to whom the NLRB\r\n\nhad delegated its authority pursuant to   3(b) of the Act, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   153(b), found to the contrary on September 29, 1992.\r\n\nThe employer petitioned the NLRB for review of this decision.\r\n\n          In light of the adverse ruling in the certification\r\n\ncase, but  before the NLRB had  yet acted on  the request for\r\n\nreview,  the employer  chose not  to deny  that Smith  was an\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nemployee  in its November 19, 1992 answer to the complaint in\r\n\nthis  unfair labor  practice  case.   Shortly thereafter,  on\r\n\nDecember  14,  1992,  the  NLRB turned  down  the  employer's\r\n\nrequest for review of the Regional Director's finding in  the\r\n\ncertification case.  The  ALJ conducted the three-day hearing\r\n\nin this  unfair labor practice  case in  early October  1993.\r\n\nThen,  before the ALJ issued  his decision, the Supreme Court\r\n\ndecided Health Care on May 23, 1994, after which the employer\r                               \r\n\nsought  to amend  its  answer on  June  22.   The  ALJ, in  a\r\n\nfootnote to its  written opinion in  this case, issued  eight\r\n\ndays later on June 30, denied the motion without explanation,\r\n\nand the Board affirmed the denial on untimeliness grounds.\r\n\n          In  defense of  this  ruling,  the General  Counsel\r\n\ncites  the  basic  proposition  that  \"an  intervening  court\r\n\ndecision that  suggests a new and  previously unmade argument\r\n\nto  a respondent is not a circumstance that excuses a failure\r\n\nto raise the argument before an administrative  agency at the\r\n\ntime  appropriate  under   the  agency's  practice.\"     True\r\n\nenough,16 but at  the same  time it is  not entirely fair  to\r\n\ncharacterize  the  employer's  argument   here  as  \"new  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.

Significantly,\r\n\nthe  NLRB had not  yet ruled, at  the time of  the employer's\r\n\ninitial  filing of its answer in this case, on the employer's\r\n\npetition for review of the Regional Director's earlier ruling\r\n\non the charge nurses' non-supervisory status.   The fact that\r\n\nthe  employer  itself  had  sought  review  of  the  Regional\r\n\nDirector's decision, and that this request was pending at the\r\n\ntime the answer here  was filed, shows that the  employer did\r\n\nnot regard the Regional Director's decision as a final agency\r\n\ndetermination.    The  employer  should  have  preserved  the\r\n\nargument in this case by raising it in the pleadings.\r\n\n2.  Merits\r                      \r\n\n          Both the ALJ and the Board assumed without inquiry,\r\n\nfor the purpose of  the Wright Line analysis, that  Smith had\r                                               \r\n\nengaged  in  a range  of  protected  activities before  being\r\n\ndisciplined  by the  employer:  Smith's  signing a  letter to\r\n\nCake seeking  the reinstatement  of a co-worker,  Liz Martin;\r\n\nher confrontation with Cake  over Cake's decision to withhold\r\n\nemployee paychecks;  her initiation  of  the Leavitt  letter-\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nwriting campaign; her appearance before  the employer's board\r\n\nof directors on  Leavitt's behalf; and her two  meetings with\r\n\nUnion  organizers.   The Board  found that  Cake fired  Smith\r\n\nbecause he did  not like  her, and that  this dislike  \"arose\r\n\ninitially   from   [his]   resentment   of   [her]  protected\r\n\nactivities.\"    Thus,  concluded  the Board,  she  was  fired\r\n\nbecause of her protected activities.  \r\n\n          We  discount  two of  Smith's  activities  that the\r\n\nBoard deemed protected because  they were done in support  of\r\n\nLeavitt.  The  Board's analysis  is flawed  in precisely  the\r\n\nsame way as  its analysis of Cunningham's conduct.   However,\r\n\nSmith's  other cited  activities  -- the  Martin letter,  the\r\n\npaycheck  dispute, and  the Union  activity --  are obviously\r\n\nprotected.  They provide sufficient evidence in the record to\r\n\nuphold the  inference drawn by  the Board that  Cake disliked\r\n\nSmith because of her engagement in protected activities.  The\r\n\nBoard's view that Cake was, in effect,  discharging Smith for\r\n\nher involvement in these protected activities is a reasonable\r\n\none.

Cake based the\r\n\nAugust 10 letter  of dismissal  largely on the  two August  4\r\n\nletters of reprimand  for those  two incidents.   If the  two\r\n\nletters of reprimand are pretextual, it follows, as the Board\r\n\nrecognized, that the letter  of dismissal is also pretextual.\r\n\nWe  address the two incidents  in turn, concluding that there\r\n\nis  sufficient support  for  the Board's  position that  both\r\n\nletters are pretextual.\r\n\n          Smith's  joke  about  an  attack  by  one  resident\r\n\nagainst  another  was   clearly  a  breach   of  professional\r\n\njudgment, especially  since Zebulske, the person  to whom she\r\n\nmade the facetious  remark, had only  begun working at  Agape\r\n\nHouse four days earlier and may  not have known Smith well at\r\n\nthis time.  The  Board, in calling it a  \"nonevent,\" blithely\r\n\nunderstated the seriousness of  the incident.17  The possible\r\n\nchoking  of one resident by  another is not  a joking matter.\r\n\nHowever,  the fact remains that both the timing of the August\r\n\n4  letter  of reprimand  and the  explanation offered  by the\r\n\nemployer for the discipline raise suspicions.\r\n\n          Smith had already been  verbally counselled by Goss\r\n\non July 21 about her role in the choking incident.   Cake had\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  The  General  Counsel  is  equally  cavalier  about  the\r\nchoking incident,  claiming that Zebulske's decision  to tell\r\nthe   resident's  mother   was  the   \"sole  cause\"   of  the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nrecommended  this  counseling,  and  he  signed  off  on  the\r\n\ncounselling  form.    This  level  of  discipline  apparently\r\n\nsatisfied  him  for two  weeks.   The  matter appeared  to be\r\n\nclosed, until it was reopened by the August 4 letter.\r\n\n          The  employer's stated  reasons for  increasing the\r\n\ndiscipline  on August 4 were that  Smith's breach of judgment\r\n\nhad, in part, led to the state investigation and that one  of\r\n\nthe investigators  was dissatisfied with the  leniency of the\r\n\nJuly 21 counselling.   Both explanations by the employer  are\r\n\nundercut  by the  record.   The  investigators'  hand-written\r\n\nstatement  of deficiencies  made  no mention  of the  choking\r\n\nincident  (nor  did  the   formal  letter  of  citation  that\r\n\nfollowed).  The  statement in  the August 4  letter that  the\r\n\nregional advocate, Barnes, was \"not satisfied\" with the prior\r\n\ndisciplinary measure is  even more  directly contradicted  by\r\n\nthe evidence.   In  testimony before  the ALJ, Barnes  stated\r\n\nthat,  while he  was aware  of the  choking incident  and had\r\n\ndiscussed it  with Cake,  he did not  express dissatisfaction\r\n\nwiththe informalcounselling orrecommendadditional discipline.\r\n\n          Additionally,  the  employer  took no  disciplinary\r\n\naction against Zebulske, who shared responsibility with Smith\r\n\nfor  the scandal.  It  was Zebulske who,  contrary to company\r\n\npolicy,  informed  the  resident's  mother  of   the  alleged\r\n\nchoking.   The existence  of disparate treatment  for similar\r\n\nmisconduct can  support a  finding of  improper motive.

NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                     \r\n\n          Given the employer's  implausible explanations  and\r\n\nthe disparate  treatment of  Smith and Zebulske,  the Board's\r\n\nconclusion  that the  August  4 reprimand  was pretextual  is\r\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\r\n\n          The  sunburn incident,  like the  choking incident,\r\n\nraises  serious concerns about  patient care.   The  story is\r\n\ntroubling in  two distinct ways.   First, while  the resident\r\n\nwas promptly  treated, the treatment was  with someone else's\r\n\nprescription ointment and  the treating nurse,  Smith, failed\r\n\nto create complete records.  Second, the resident was allowed\r\n\nthe  next morning  to get  into a  hot whirlpool  bath, which\r\n\ncaused  severe   blistering.    Clearly,  patient   care  was\r\n\ncompromised even before the  whirlpool, and Smith is squarely\r\n\nto  blame  for  this.   Nevertheless,  there  is  substantial\r\n\nevidence in the record to support the Board's conclusion that\r\n\nthe  employer's August 4 letter of reprimand to Smith for the\r\n\nsunburn incident was pretextual.\r\n\n          The August 4 letter states that Smith's \"failure to\r\n\nnote  [the sunburn]  within [the  patient's] medical  records\r\n\nresulted  in his  being placed  in the  whirlpool.\"   The ALJ\r\n\nfound,   however,  that  Smith,   despite  making  incomplete\r\n\ntreatment   records,   personally   informed  Starbuck,   the\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\novernight charge nurse, about  the resident's sunburn.18  And\r\n\nStarbuck, in turn, told Conklin, the charge nurse who came on\r\n\nduty in the morning.  It  was on Conklin's watch that nursing\r\n\nassistant Sargent allowed the  sunburned resident to get into\r\n\nthe hot bath.\r\n\n          The employer  does not challenge these  findings of\r\n\nfact.  It is clear that either Conklin or Sargent  -- and not\r\n\nSmith -- was to blame for the resident's being allowed to get\r\n\ninto the whirlpool.  This fault is at  least equal to Smith's\r\n\nfault.    But  only Smith  was  disciplined  for the  sunburn\r\n\nincident.   While the  employer was undoubtedly  justified in\r\n\ndisciplining her for  her role in the  incident, the employer\r\n\nhas  failed to explain why  no one else  was disciplined too.\r\n\nThis disparate  treatment is telling.   See Wyman-Gordon, 654\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 141.19\r\n\n          Like  us,  the Board  viewed  this  as a  disparate\r\n\ntreatment  case, but the Board  also relied on  the fact that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  Smith also  made a  notation in the  \"24-hour notebook,\"\r\nthe notebook in which nurses  at Agape House communicate with\r\neach  other across shifts.   The August 4  letter is somewhat\r\ndisingenuous, then, in stating that Smith \"failed to properly\r\nact, both in  terms of record keeping and in  terms of making\r\nrecommendations  to  the  nurse  assuming  duty  after  [her]\r\nshift.\"\r\n\n19.  Additionally,   a  few  weeks  after  Smith's  dismissal\r\nanother nurse  at Agape House was reprimanded, but not fired,\r\nfor  applying Silvadene  to  a sunburned  resident without  a\r\nprescription.  This too is reflective of disparate treatment.\r\nHowever,  a year before Smith's discharge,  a nurse was fired\r                                                                   \r\nfor the more  serious offense of giving a  seizure medication\r\nto a resident without a prescription.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nthe  employees  responsible for  the four  other deficiencies\r\n\ncited  by the  state  investigators were  not disciplined  by\r\n\nYesterday's Children.   The employer  has convincingly argued\r\n\nthat  these  other deficiencies  were  systemic problems  for\r\n\nwhich  no individual  employees were  at fault.   Our  focus,\r\n\nconsequently, is  on the other employees  responsible for the\r\n\nsunburn  incident.   While our  disparate treatment  analysis\r\n\ndiffers somewhat from the Board's, we think  that the Board's\r\n\nultimate conclusion of pretext is a reasonable one.\r\n\n          Because  we  conclude  that  there  is  substantial\r\n\nevidence  in the record to support the Board's inference that\r\n\nthe  employer's  discipline of  Smith  for  both the  choking\r\n\nincident and the sunburn incident was pretextual, the Board's\r\n\nSmith order  is enforced.   For reasons discussed  above, the\r                                    \r\n\nBoard's Cunningham order is vacated and her case  is remanded\r                                                                         \r\n\nto the Board for further consideration.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n</pre>",
