Appellant, who pled guilty to two counts\n\nstemming    from   his     unlawful    reentry       into   the   United    States\n\nfollowing deportation, claims that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to grant a downward departure in his sentence.                           We\n\nconclude that we have no jurisdiction to review this claim and\n\ntherefore dismiss the appeal.\n\n      A district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward\n\nis unreviewable unless the court mistakenly believed that it\n\nlacked authority to do so.

At sentencing in this case, appellant's\n\ncounsel urged the court to depart from the guideline range of 46\n\nto 57 months, and impose a sentence of 37 months, based on three\n\nfactors: (1) he returned to the United States because he wished\n\nto   reunite   with   his     wife    and    child    after      the    emotionally\n\ndifficult   death     of    his   mother,    for     whom   he    had    been   sole\n\ncaretaker; (2) he suffers from diabetes; and (3) his criminal\n\nhistory category overstates the severity of his past criminal\n\nconduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f    The record shows that the district court understood its\n\nauthority to depart, but declined to do so.        It imposed a 46-\n\nmonth term, stating:\n\n         The Court considers that the medical condition and\n    the other circumstances narrated by the defendant in\n    open court do not justify a downward departure in this\n    case, therefore, the verbal request is denied.\n\nIndeed, appellant does not argue that the court misunderstood\n\nits authority to depart.      Rather, he asserts that we should\n\nreview for abuse of discretion the court's judgment that his\n\ncircumstances   did   not   warrant   a   departure.   We   have   no\n\njurisdiction to do so, however; the abuse-of-discretion standard\n\napplies when a court has made a departure, see Koon v. United\n\nStates, 518 U.S. 81, 91, 100 (1996), not when it has made a\n\ndiscretionary decision against one.\n\n    The appeal is therefore dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
