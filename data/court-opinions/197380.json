Coska alleges  that she  suffered injuries,\r\n\nincluding a fractured ankle, as a result of the fall.    \r\n\n          At the time of the accident, the property was owned\r\n\nby  the  United States  through  the  United States  Marshals\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nService.  The Marshals Service had  entered into a management\r\n\ncontract with Barlou Management Company which required Barlou\r\n\nto  maintain the  property  and held  Barlou responsible  for\r\n\nremoving any snow or debris from the parking area, sidewalks,\r\n\nand entrances to  the premises.  Barlou  then contracted with\r\n\nanother company, Kevin Sutherland Landscaping (\"Sutherland\"),\r\n\nto handle the actual removal of any snow and debris.  \r\n\n          On April 13, 1993,  Coska's counsel sent letters to\r\n\nthe  Marshals  Service  and  to  Barlou Management  regarding\r\n\nCoska's accident at 386 West Broadway.  In relevant part, the\r\n\nletter to the United States stated: \r\n\n               Please be advised that  we represent\r\n          Ms. Barbara Coska, who  received personal\r\n          injuries as  a result of a  slip and fall\r\n          accident,  caused  by   the  failure   to\r\n          adequately clear the accumulation of snow\r\n          and  ice from  the  sidewalk  located  in\r\n          front of 386 West  Broadway . . . .   Ms.\r\n          Coska   sustained   a   fractured   ankle\r\n          (fractured  in  three  places),   and  is\r\n          currently in an ankle to hip length cast;\r\n          she may require surgery in the future.  A\r\n          claim for her damages resulting from this\r\n          accident is hereby made.  \r\n\nThe  letter   to  Barlou  employed  the   same  language  but\r\n\nexplicitly attributed the  failure to clear the snow  and ice\r\n\nfrom the sidewalk to the Barlou Management Company.1  Neither\r\n\nletter set forth the amount of damages being claimed. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  That    letter   stated   in    relevant   part:   \"Coska\r\n. . . received personal injuries  as a result  of a slip  and\r\nfall accident,  caused by Barlou Management  Co.'s failure to\r                                                              \r\nadequately  clear the accumulation  of snow and  ice from the\r\nsidewalk . . . .\" (emphasis added).\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The Marshals Service  responded to Coska's  counsel\r\n\nby  letter dated June 7,  1993, advising her  that a claimant\r\n\nmust submit  a claim for damages  in a \"sum certain\"  for any\r\n\ninjury  allegedly caused  by the  incident before  the agency\r\n\ncould  administratively  adjudicate  her  claim  for monetary\r\n\ndamages.  The letter  enclosed a Standard Form 95  (Claim for\r\n\nInjury, Damage,  or Death)  (hereinafter \"SF-95\")  and stated\r\n\nthat the form should be completed and returned along with all\r\n\ninformation  and  documentation  substantiating   the  claim.\r\n\nCoska never returned the requested form.  \r\n\n          Thirteen  months  later,  Barlou,  but  not  Coska,\r\n\nforwarded to  the United  States the  \"demand packet\"  it had\r\n\nearlier received from Coska's counsel.2  The 118-page packet,\r\n\ndated June 21, 1994, contained relevant information regarding\r\n\nCoska's  claim  against Barlou,  including  a  demand against\r\n\nBarlou in the amount of $225,000.  The letter included in the\r\n\npacket stated  that Barlou's  failure to clear  the entrances\r\n\nand sidewalks adjacent to 386 West Broadway was \"the sole and\r                                                                         \r\n\nproximate  cause  of  the plaintiff's  accident.\"   (emphasis\r                            \r\n\nadded).    The letter  contained  no  assertion of  liability\r\n\nagainst,  or  even  mention  of, the  United  States  or  the\r\n\nMarshals  Service.  At this point, Coska's counsel had yet to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  record  is unclear  as  to whether  Barlou  sent the\r\npacket on  its own initiative  or whether  the United  States\r\nrequested it.    Regardless,  it  was  not  sent  by  Coska's\r\ncounsel.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncontact  the  United States  in response  to its  request for\r\n\ndocumentation of the claim and/or the SF-95.\r\n\n      Five  more months passed with  no word from  Coska.  On\r\n\nDecember 12, 1994, the Marshals Service sent a second  letter\r\n\nto Coska's counsel.   This letter \"acknowledge[d] receipt\" of\r\n\nthe claim,  stated that \"[i]n  this regard, the  Federal Tort\r\n\nClaims [sic]  was received by the  agency to administratively\r\n\nadjudicate the claim,\" and then cited to the FTCA.  \r\n\n          In  its  first  communication with  the  government\r\n\nsince Coska's  initial letter sent almost  two years earlier,\r\n\nthe law firm representing Coska sent a letter to the Marshals\r\n\nService  dated February  14, 1995,  informing  the government\r\n\nthat new attorneys from  the same firm would be  handling the\r\n\ncase.   Counsel also asked  in this letter  whether the claim\r\n\nsatisfied the notice requirements of 28 U.S.C.   2401 and the\r\n\nprocedural  requirements  of  the  FTCA.    For  reasons  not\r\n\ndisclosed  by the record,  counsel enclosed a  second copy of\r\n\nthe  demand packet  sent to  Barlou \"in  the event  that [the\r\n\nUnited  States  was]  missing any  information  [required] to\r\n\nfully evaluate the claim\" and urged the government to contact\r\n\nthem if it needed any additional information. \r\n\n          About a month later,  the Marshals Service did just\r\n\nthat.    A paralegal  assigned  to  the case  called  Coska's\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncounsel  and requested  a  demand for  a  sum certain.3    In\r\n\nresponse, Coska's counsel claimed  that they were waiting for\r\n\nadditional medical bills  beyond those set out  in the demand\r\n\npacket to Barlou.   The paralegal then sent another  SF-95 to\r\n\nCoska's counsel, which was never returned.\r\n\n          The United  States sent  a third letter  to Coska's\r\n\ncounsel  on  June 20,  1995, requesting  a  demand for  a sum\r\n\ncertain and including yet another  SF-95 form.  The  Marshals\r\n\nService apparently denied the claim by letter dated September\r\n\n15,  1995, having  received  no response  to these  requests.\r\n\nCoska says she did not receive the letter.\r\n\n          On December  18, 1995,  Coska brought suit  against\r\n\nthe United  States alleging  negligence, breach  of contract,\r\n\nand breach of  warranty of habitability.4   The United States\r\n\nfiled a motion to  dismiss and, in the alternative,  a motion\r\n\nfor summary judgment.   The district court granted the motion\r\n\nto  dismiss, alternatively  characterizing it  as a  grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment.    \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The call  was  either placed  in  late March  before  the\r\nstatute of limitations had  run or in early April  just after\r\nthe period expired. \r\n\n4.  Similar claims  were brought against Barlou.   The United\r\nStates filed a cross-claim against Barlou, who in  turn filed\r\na  third party  complaint  against Sutherland  (snow  removal\r\ncontractor). \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          As the recitation of facts demonstrates, before the\r\n\nexpiration of  the limitations period, the  United States had\r\n\nmade  one or  two specific  requests for  a sum  certain from\r\n\nCoska and  had sent her at least  one SF-95 form to complete.\r\n\nMore  requests (with  accompanying  SF-95  forms)  were  made\r\n\nlater.  The issue on appeal is whether Coska's two letters to\r\n\nthe  government  and the  copy  of the  Barlou  demand packet\r\n\nincluded in the second of  those letters constitute a  notice\r\n\nof  claim against the United  States for a  sum certain under\r\n\nthe FTCA.  We find that they do not.\r\n\n          Under  the FTCA,  a tort  claim against  the United\r\n\nStates is  barred unless  it is  \"properly presented\"  to the\r\n\nagency within  two years  of its  accrual.  See  28 U.S.C.   \r                                                           \r\n\n2401(b); Corte-Real v.

An  administrative claim is  properly presented\r\n\nwhen  it  includes, among  other  things, a  claim  for money\r\n\ndamages in a sum  certain.  See 28 C.F.R.    14.2(a);5 Corte-\r                                                                         \r\n\nReal, 949 F.2d at 485.

Coska's letter,  which incorporated  by\r\n\nreference the  Barlou demand  packet, failed to  achieve this\r\n\nobjective.   That packet  contained no information  about the\r\n\nliability of the United States nor did it state the amount of\r\n\ndamages it would seek from the United States.  Indeed, by its\r\n\nown terms, the packet asserted a claim that Barlou was solely\r                                                              \r\n\nliable.   As the  district court observed,  the demand packet\r\n\nagainst Barlou \"is not  an appropriate substitute.\"  In  none\r\n\nof  the cases  Coska cites,  where this  court has  allowed a\r\n\nclaim  to proceed despite  a dispute over  the fulfillment of\r\n\nthe  sum certain  requirement, had  the plaintiff  completely\r\n\nfailed  to  assert explicitly  a  damage  amount against  the\r\n\nUnited  States.  See, e.g.,  Kokaras, 980 F.2d  at 23; Corte-\r                                                                         \r\n\nReal,  949  F.2d  at  486-87;  Lopez,  758  F.2d 808-11;  cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nSantiago-Ramirez v.  Secretary of  the Dep't of  Defense, 984\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nF.2d at 17-20 (1st Cir. 1993).6  Thus, Coska's arguments fall\r\n\nshort.7 \r\n\n          This need for  a specific sum certain  was not kept\r\n\nsecret from Coska  in hopes of  defeating her claim.   To the\r\n\ncontrary,  the  United  States  made  a  number  of  specific\r\n\nrequests for the  sum certain.   All of  those requests  were\r\n\nignored.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Coska's reliance on the Ninth Circuit's decision in House\r                                                                         \r\nv. Mine Safety Appliances Co., 573 F.2d 609, 615-16 (9th Cir.\r                                         \r\n1978)  is also misplaced.  That case supports the notion that\r\nincorporation by reference can, on certain facts, satisfy the\r\njurisdictional  requirement  of presenting  an administrative\r\nclaim.    The  Ninth  Circuit  found  that  the  sum  certain\r\nrequirement   had  not   been   met   because   neither   the\r\nincorporating nor the incorporated  documents set forth a sum\r\ncertain  claim  of  damages   explicitly  applicable  to  the\r\nclaimant(s).   See House,  573 F.2d  at 615-16,  overruled on\r                                                                         \r\nother  grounds  by  Warren  v.  United States  Dep't  of  the\r                                                                         \r\nInterior, 724 F.2d 776 (9th Cir. 1984) (en  banc). Similarly,\r                    \r\nin  this case, Coska made  no \"explicit[] link,\"  id. at 616,\r                                                                 \r\nbetween  any demand against the  United States and the demand\r\nfor a sum certain it asserted against Barlou.\r\n\n7.  The  government argues  that  Barlou and  Sutherland were\r\nindependent  contractors, that  liability was  not joint  and\r\nseveral  as Coska asserts, and so that notice to Barlou could\r\nnot  as a matter of law, provide notice to the United States.\r\nTherefore, the  United States  says, a demand  against Barlou\r\ncould not be  a demand against the United States.   To decide\r\nthis  case,  we  need   not  address  whether  Barlou  and/or\r\nSutherland were  \"independent contractors\" and  thus were not\r\njoint and severally liable.   That the government is  able to\r\nmake the argument, whatever its resolution, demonstrates that\r\nit  is far from a  foregone conclusion that  a demand against\r\nBarlou constituted  a demand against  the United States.   As\r\nthe district court observed,  a sum certain should  have been\r\ndemanded  by   Coska  from   the  United  States   with  some\r\nspecificity, irrespective of demands sent to joint or several\r\nor other tortfeasors.  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Coska claims that  affirming the  dismissal of  her\r\n\nclaim would  allow \"mere technicalities\" to  bar an otherwise\r\n\nwell-made  claim.    All  of  the  information  necessary  to\r\n\ninvestigate  the claim,  Coska argues,  was contained  in the\r\n\ndemand packet and  letters.  It is  the information available\r\n\nrather  than  the  form in  which  it  is  presented that  is\r\n\ncrucial. See,  e.g., Corte-Real,  949 F.2d  at 486; see  also\r                                                                         \r\n\nSantiago-Ramirez,  984 F.2d at  19 n.2.   However,  there was\r                            \r\n\nessential information missing from the packet and the letters\r\n\n-- namely, the amount of damages being sought from the United\r\n\nStates.    Cf.  Santiago-Ramirez,  984  F.2d  at  19  (notice\r                                            \r\n\nrequirement  of 28  U.S.C.    2675  is  satisfied when  claim\r\n\nincludes sufficient information to  investigate claim and the\r\n\namount of damages sought).8   Had the plaintiff included that\r\n\namount in  any  of  the  correspondence or  even  returned  a\r\n\ncompleted SF-95, which includes boxes for personal injury and\r\n\ntotal damages,  the situation  may have produced  a different\r\n\noutcome.  See, e.g., Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486-87.  This is\r                                           \r\n\nnot a case of exalting form over substance, nor is  it a case\r\n\nof \"bureaucratic overkill.\"  Cf. id. at 486.\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  We  reject  Coska's  argument  that  the  district  court\r\neffectively  merged the  statutory notice  requirement of  28\r\nU.S.C.    2675 and the presentment requirement of 28 C.F.R.  \r\n14.2(a).  This is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.  A\r\nfederal court has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit against\r\nthe  United  States  unless  a  claimant  has  presented,  in\r\nwriting,  a claim stating a sum certain.  See Corte-Real, 949\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d  at 485; Gonzalez-Bernal v.

Without\r\n\naddressing whether  Coska waived this argument,  we find that\r\n\neven without  the consideration of  the one  to two  requests\r\n\nmade  after  the  limitations period  passed,  Coska's  claim\r\n\nfails.  The district court's  finding hardly \"rested\" on  the\r\n\nrequests made after the  limitations period; it observed only\r\n\nthat  the  government  gave  Coska  adequate  notice  of  the\r\n\nshortcomings  of  her  submissions  and  that  \"perhaps\"  the\r\n\noutcome would be different had such notice not been given. \r\n\n            Affirmed.\r                        Affirmed\r                                \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n",

Holding that Coska failed to make a proper demand for a \"sum certain\" against the United States within the prescribed two-year limitations period, the United States district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and, in the alternative, granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.

Coska alleges that she suffered injuries, including a fractured ankle, as a result of the fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the accident, the property was owned by the United States through the United States Marshals Service.  The Marshals Service had entered into a management contract with Barlou Management Company which required Barlou to maintain the property and held Barlou responsible for removing any snow or debris from the parking area, sidewalks, and entrances to the premises.  Barlou then contracted with another company, Kevin Sutherland Landscaping (\"Sutherland\"), to handle the actual removal of any snow and debris.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 13, 1993, Coska's counsel sent letters to the Marshals Service and to Barlou Management regarding Coska's accident at 386 West Broadway.  In relevant part, the letter to the United States stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Please be advised that we represent Ms. Barbara Coska, who received personal injuries as a result of a slip and fall accident, caused by the failure to adequately clear the accumulation of snow and ice from the sidewalk located in front of 386 West Broadway....  Ms. Coska sustained a fractured ankle (fractured in three places), and is currently in an ankle to hip length cast;  she may require surgery in the future.  A claim for her damages resulting from this accident is hereby made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter to Barlou employed the same language but explicitly attributed the failure to clear the snow and ice from the sidewalk to the Barlou Management Company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Neither letter set forth the amount of damages being claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Marshals Service responded to Coska's counsel by letter dated June 7, 1993, advising her that a claimant must submit a claim for damages in a \"sum certain\" for any injury allegedly caused by the incident before the agency could administratively adjudicate her claim for monetary damages.  The letter enclosed a Standard Form 95 (Claim for Injury, Damage, or Death) (hereinafter \"SF-95\") and stated that the form should be completed and returned along with all information and documentation substantiating the claim.  Coska never returned the requested form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirteen months later, Barlou, but not Coska, forwarded to the United States the \"demand packet\" it had earlier received from Coska's counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The 118-page packet, dated June 21, 1994, contained relevant information regarding Coska's claim against Barlou, including a demand against Barlou in the amount of $225,000.  The letter included in the packet stated that Barlou's failure to clear the entrances and sidewalks adjacent to 386 West Broadway was \"the sole and proximate cause of the plaintiff's accident.\"  (emphasis added).  The letter contained no assertion of liability against, or even mention of, the United States or the Marshals Service.  At this point, Coska's counsel had yet to contact the United States in response to its request for documentation of the claim and/or the SF-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five more months passed with no word from Coska.  On December 12, 1994, the Marshals Service sent a second letter to Coska's counsel.  This letter \"acknowledge[d] receipt\" of the claim, stated that \"[i]n this regard, the Federal Tort Claims [sic] was received by the agency to administratively adjudicate the claim,\" and then cited to the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its first communication with the government since Coska's initial letter sent almost two years earlier, the law firm representing Coska sent a letter to the Marshals Service dated February 14, 1995, informing the government that new attorneys from the same firm would be handling the case.  Counsel also asked in this letter whether the claim satisfied the notice requirements of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2401 and the procedural requirements of the FTCA.  For reasons not disclosed by the record, counsel enclosed a second copy of the demand packet sent to Barlou \"in the event that [the United States was] missing any information [required] to fully evaluate the claim\" and urged the government to contact them if it needed any additional information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About a month later, the Marshals Service did just that.  A paralegal assigned to the case called Coska's counsel and requested a demand for a sum certain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In response, Coska's counsel claimed that they were waiting for additional medical bills beyond those set out in the demand packet to Barlou.  The paralegal then sent another SF-95 to Coska's counsel, which was never returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States sent a third letter to Coska's counsel on June 20, 1995, requesting a demand for a sum certain and including yet another SF-95 form.  The Marshals Service apparently denied the claim by letter dated September 15, 1995, having received no response to these requests.  Coska says she did not receive the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1995, Coska brought suit against the United States alleging negligence, breach of contract, and breach of warranty of habitability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The United States filed a motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion to dismiss, alternatively characterizing it as a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the recitation of facts demonstrates, before the expiration of the limitations period, the United States had made one or two specific requests for a sum certain from Coska and had sent her at least one SF-95 form to complete.  More requests (with accompanying SF-95 forms) were made later.  The issue on appeal is whether Coska's two letters to the government and the copy of the Barlou demand packet included in the second of those letters constitute a notice of claim against the United States for a sum certain under the FTCA.  We find that they do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTCA, a tort claim against the United States is barred unless it is \"properly presented\" to the agency within two years of its accrual.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2401(b);  Corte-Real v. United States, 949 F.2d 484, 485 (1st Cir.1991).  An administrative claim is properly presented when it includes, among other things, a claim for money damages in a sum certain.  See 28 C.F.R. &#167; 14.2(a);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 485.   A timely filed sum certain claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a tort action against the federal government.  Kokaras v. United States, 980 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1992) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the sum certain requirement goes beyond mere administrative convenience;  it is to apprise the government of its possible liability and to provide the government with notice \"sufficient to allow it to investigate the alleged negligent episode to determine if settlement would be in the best interests of all.\"  Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486 (quoting Lopez v. United States, 758 F.2d 806, 809 (1st Cir.1985)).  Coska's letter, which incorporated by reference the Barlou demand packet, failed to achieve this objective.  That packet contained no information about the liability of the United States nor did it state the amount of damages it would seek from the United States.  Indeed, by its own terms, the packet asserted a claim that Barlou was solely liable.  As the district court observed, the demand packet against Barlou \"is not an appropriate substitute.\"   In none of the cases Coska cites, where this court has allowed a claim to proceed despite a dispute over the fulfillment of the sum certain requirement, had the plaintiff completely failed to assert explicitly a damage amount against the United States.  See, e.g., Kokaras, 980 F.2d at 23;  Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486-87;  Lopez, 758 F.2d 806-11;  cf.  Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of the Dep't of Defense, 984 F.2d at 17-20 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, Coska's arguments fall short.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This need for a specific sum certain was not kept secret from Coska in hopes of defeating her claim.  To the contrary, the United States made a number of specific requests for the sum certain.  All of those requests were ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coska claims that affirming the dismissal of her claim would allow \"mere technicalities\" to bar an otherwise well-made claim.  All of the information necessary to investigate the claim, Coska argues, was contained in the demand packet and letters.  It is the information available rather than the form in which it is presented that is crucial.  See, e.g., Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486;  see also Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 19 n. 2. However, there was essential information missing from the packet and the letters--namely, the amount of damages being sought from the United States.  Cf. Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 19 (notice requirement of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2675 is satisfied when claim includes sufficient information to investigate claim and the amount of damages sought).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Had the plaintiff included that amount in any of the correspondence or even returned a completed SF-95, which includes boxes for personal injury and total damages, the situation may have produced a different outcome.  See, e.g., Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486-87.   This is not a case of exalting form over substance, nor is it a case of \"bureaucratic overkill.\"   Cf. id. at 486.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Coska argues that the district court impermissibly relied on the government's repeated requests for a sum certain made after the expiration of the limitations period in coming to its decision.

Coska alleges that she suffered injuries, including a fractured ankle, as a result of the fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the accident, the property was owned by the United States through the United States Marshals Service.  The Marshals Service had entered into a management contract with Barlou Management Company which required Barlou to maintain the property and held Barlou responsible for removing any snow or debris from the parking area, sidewalks, and entrances to the premises.  Barlou then contracted with another company, Kevin Sutherland Landscaping (\"Sutherland\"), to handle the actual removal of any snow and debris.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 13, 1993, Coska's counsel sent letters to the Marshals Service and to Barlou Management regarding Coska's accident at 386 West Broadway.  In relevant part, the letter to the United States stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Please be advised that we represent Ms. Barbara Coska, who received personal injuries as a result of a slip and fall accident, caused by the failure to adequately clear the accumulation of snow and ice from the sidewalk located in front of 386 West Broadway....  Ms. Coska sustained a fractured ankle (fractured in three places), and is currently in an ankle to hip length cast;  she may require surgery in the future.  A claim for her damages resulting from this accident is hereby made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter to Barlou employed the same language but explicitly attributed the failure to clear the snow and ice from the sidewalk to the Barlou Management Company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Neither letter set forth the amount of damages being claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Marshals Service responded to Coska's counsel by letter dated June 7, 1993, advising her that a claimant must submit a claim for damages in a \"sum certain\" for any injury allegedly caused by the incident before the agency could administratively adjudicate her claim for monetary damages.  The letter enclosed a Standard Form 95 (Claim for Injury, Damage, or Death) (hereinafter \"SF-95\") and stated that the form should be completed and returned along with all information and documentation substantiating the claim.  Coska never returned the requested form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirteen months later, Barlou, but not Coska, forwarded to the United States the \"demand packet\" it had earlier received from Coska's counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The 118-page packet, dated June 21, 1994, contained relevant information regarding Coska's claim against Barlou, including a demand against Barlou in the amount of $225,000.  The letter included in the packet stated that Barlou's failure to clear the entrances and sidewalks adjacent to 386 West Broadway was \"the sole and proximate cause of the plaintiff's accident.\"  (emphasis added).  The letter contained no assertion of liability against, or even mention of, the United States or the Marshals Service.  At this point, Coska's counsel had yet to contact the United States in response to its request for documentation of the claim and/or the SF-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five more months passed with no word from Coska.  On December 12, 1994, the Marshals Service sent a second letter to Coska's counsel.  This letter \"acknowledge[d] receipt\" of the claim, stated that \"[i]n this regard, the Federal Tort Claims [sic] was received by the agency to administratively adjudicate the claim,\" and then cited to the FTCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its first communication with the government since Coska's initial letter sent almost two years earlier, the law firm representing Coska sent a letter to the Marshals Service dated February 14, 1995, informing the government that new attorneys from the same firm would be handling the case.  Counsel also asked in this letter whether the claim satisfied the notice requirements of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2401 and the procedural requirements of the FTCA.  For reasons not disclosed by the record, counsel enclosed a second copy of the demand packet sent to Barlou \"in the event that [the United States was] missing any information [required] to fully evaluate the claim\" and urged the government to contact them if it needed any additional information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About a month later, the Marshals Service did just that.  A paralegal assigned to the case called Coska's counsel and requested a demand for a sum certain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In response, Coska's counsel claimed that they were waiting for additional medical bills beyond those set out in the demand packet to Barlou.  The paralegal then sent another SF-95 to Coska's counsel, which was never returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States sent a third letter to Coska's counsel on June 20, 1995, requesting a demand for a sum certain and including yet another SF-95 form.  The Marshals Service apparently denied the claim by letter dated September 15, 1995, having received no response to these requests.  Coska says she did not receive the letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 18, 1995, Coska brought suit against the United States alleging negligence, breach of contract, and breach of warranty of habitability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The United States filed a motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment.  The district court granted the motion to dismiss, alternatively characterizing it as a grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the recitation of facts demonstrates, before the expiration of the limitations period, the United States had made one or two specific requests for a sum certain from Coska and had sent her at least one SF-95 form to complete.  More requests (with accompanying SF-95 forms) were made later.  The issue on appeal is whether Coska's two letters to the government and the copy of the Barlou demand packet included in the second of those letters constitute a notice of claim against the United States for a sum certain under the FTCA.  We find that they do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTCA, a tort claim against the United States is barred unless it is \"properly presented\" to the agency within two years of its accrual.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2401(b);  Corte-Real v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572406\"><a href=\"/opinion/572406/miguel-corte-real-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 485 (1st Cir.1991).  An administrative claim is properly presented when it includes, among other things, a claim for money damages in a sum certain.  See 28 C.F.R. &#167; 14.2(a);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 485.   A timely filed sum certain claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite for a tort action against the federal government.  Kokaras v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595479\"><a href=\"/opinion/595479/peter-a-kokaras-and-diane-kokaras-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1992) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the sum certain requirement goes beyond mere administrative convenience;  it is to apprise the government of its possible liability and to provide the government with notice \"sufficient to allow it to investigate the alleged negligent episode to determine if settlement would be in the best interests of all.\"  Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486 (quoting Lopez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450375\"><a href=\"/opinion/450375/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 809 (1st Cir.1985)).  Coska's letter, which incorporated by reference the Barlou demand packet, failed to achieve this objective.  That packet contained no information about the liability of the United States nor did it state the amount of damages it would seek from the United States.  Indeed, by its own terms, the packet asserted a claim that Barlou was solely liable.  As the district court observed, the demand packet against Barlou \"is not an appropriate substitute.\"   In none of the cases Coska cites, where this court has allowed a claim to proceed despite a dispute over the fulfillment of the sum certain requirement, had the plaintiff completely failed to assert explicitly a damage amount against the United States.  See, e.g., Kokaras, 980 F.2d at 23;  Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486-87;  Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450375\"><a href=\"/opinion/450375/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>-11;  cf.  Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of the Dep't of Defense, 984 F.2d at 17-20 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, Coska's arguments fall short.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This need for a specific sum certain was not kept secret from Coska in hopes of defeating her claim.  To the contrary, the United States made a number of specific requests for the sum certain.  All of those requests were ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coska claims that affirming the dismissal of her claim would allow \"mere technicalities\" to bar an otherwise well-made claim.  All of the information necessary to investigate the claim, Coska argues, was contained in the demand packet and letters.  It is the information available rather than the form in which it is presented that is crucial.  See, e.g., Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486;  see also Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 19 n. 2. However, there was essential information missing from the packet and the letters--namely, the amount of damages being sought from the United States.  Cf. Santiago-Ramirez, 984 F.2d at 19 (notice requirement of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2675 is satisfied when claim includes sufficient information to investigate claim and the amount of damages sought).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Had the plaintiff included that amount in any of the correspondence or even returned a completed SF-95, which includes boxes for personal injury and total damages, the situation may have produced a different outcome.  See, e.g., Corte-Real, 949 F.2d at 486-87.   This is not a case of exalting form over substance, nor is it a case of \"bureaucratic overkill.\"   Cf. id. at 486.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Coska argues that the district court impermissibly relied on the government's repeated requests for a sum certain made after the expiration of the limitations period in coming to its decision.  Without addressing whether Coska waived this argument, we find that even without the consideration of the one to two requests made after the limitations period passed, Coska's claim fails.
