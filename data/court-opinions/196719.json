Plaintiff-appellant George\r                                             \r\n\nSerafino brought  a lawsuit  against Hasbro, Inc.  (\"Hasbro\") and\r\n\nits CEO, George R. Ditomassi, Jr., claiming that  they unlawfully\r\n\nterminated certain business arrangements and then  his employment\r\n\nbecause his daughter filed  a discrimination action against them.\r\n\nDuring discovery, Serafino refused to answer questions pertaining\r\n\nto alleged improprieties  surrounding the business  arrangements,\r\n\ninvoking   his   Fifth   Amendment   privilege    against   self-\r\n\nincrimination.  Upon determining that Serafino's silence on these\r\n\nmatters unfairly hampered defendants' ability to mount a defense,\r\n\nthe district court dismissed Serafino's claims with prejudice.  \r\n\n     In  this   appeal,  we  must   determine  whether  dismissal\r\n\nconstitutes   an   impermissible   infringement   on   Serafino's\r\n\nconstitutional  right  against  self-incrimination.    After  due\r\n\nconsideration, we  conclude that the district  court acted within\r\n\nits  power and  discretion in  dismissing Serafino's  claims, and\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r\n\n     From 1972  until his termination in  December 1994, Serafino\r\n\nworked as a mechanic and then group leader for the Milton Bradley\r\n\nCompany  (\"Milton Bradley\"),  a  division of  Hasbro since  1985,\r\n\nlocated  in  Springfield,  Massachusetts.   In  addition  to  his\r\n\nregular  employment,   Serafino   had  three   unusual   business\r\n\narrangements  with Milton  Bradley.   In  1976, Serafino  created\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  Since  this appeal is from an order  granting a motion to\r\ndismiss,  we derive the facts  from the pleadings.   PHC, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\nPioneer Healthcare, Inc., 75 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                  \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nHampden Battery Service, Inc. (\"Hampden Battery\"), which serviced\r\n\nand  reconditioned batteries  used  in  Milton Bradley  vehicles.\r\n\nThen,  in 1984, he formed ABC  Janitorial Services (\"ABC\"), which\r\n\nperformed  nightly cleaning service  at Milton Bradley buildings.\r\n\nFinally,  in  1985,  he  assumed  responsibility  for supervising\r\n\nground maintenance  at the company's facilities, for which he was\r\n\nguaranteed 20 hours a week of overtime.  \r\n\n     Anita Serafino,2 George Serafino's  daughter, also worked at\r\n\nMilton Bradley.  In January 1992, she filed a complaint  with the\r\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against  Discrimination alleging that  a\r\n\nco-worker  had  sexually  harassed  her.    In  July  1993,  both\r\n\nSerafinos  filed a  complaint in  Hampden Superior  Court against\r\n\nHasbro and Ditomassi alleging sex discrimination and retaliation.\r\n\nIn  particular,  George Serafino  alleged  that  Ditomassi, as  a\r\n\nretaliatory   measure,   instructed   two  high-ranking   company\r\n\nemployees, Joseph  Gulluni and  Arthur Peckham, to  terminate the\r\n\nthree   extracurricular   business   ventures.      The  overtime\r\n\narrangement  was discontinued  on January  1, 1993,  the business\r\n\nrelationship  with  Hampden Battery  in  April of  1993,  and the\r\n\nrelationship  with  ABC in  mid-1994.    Based on  these  events,\r\n\nSerafino  advanced three  theories  of liability:   violation  of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    To  avoid  confusion,  Anita  Serafino  will always  be\r\nreferred  to by her full name; George Serafino, at times, will be\r\nreferred to only as \"Serafino.\"\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L.  Ann. ch. 151B3,  quantum meruit,  and intentional\r                                                         \r\n\ninterference with advantageous relationship.  \r\n\n     Serafino was  deposed  in  the  fall of  1994.    Defendants\r\n\npursued   a  line   of   questioning   concerning   improprieties\r\n\nsurrounding  Hampden  Battery,  ABC  and  the  overtime benefits,\r\n\nfocusing,  in particular,  on how  Serafino, Gulluni  and Peckham\r\n\nmight have  illegally benefitted from these  ventures.  Serafino,\r\n\ninvoking his rights under  the Fifth Amendment and Article  12 of\r\n\nthe Massachusetts  Declaration of Rights, refused  to answer most\r\n\nquestions relating to these matters.  Such questions included:\r\n\n     Did you give money to other people  as a condition for doing\r\n     business with Milton Bradley?\r\n\n     [Did] Mr. Peckham ever get any financial benefit from  \r\n     ABC Cleaning Services?\r\n\n     Why did [Mr. Gulluni] have you report to his office    \r\n     every day?\r\n\n     Do you have any financial relations with Mr. Peckham?\r\n\n     Were you involved in criminal activity together?\r\n\n     Isn't it true that Mr. Peckham got financial benefit   \r\n     from your companies that was illegal?\r\n\n     George  Serafino  was  discharged  from  Milton  Bradley  in\r\n\nDecember 1994.   Shortly thereafter, the  Serafinos amended their\r\n\ncomplaint  to  include  this  termination  as  a  further act  of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3     Chapter   151B   protects   people  against   unlawful\r\ndiscrimination.  Wheelock College v. Massachusetts Comm'n Against\r                                                                           \r\nDiscrimination,  371  Mass.  130,  137, 355  N.E.2d  309  (1976).\r                        \r\nSerafino accused  defendants of violating chapter  151B,   4(4A),\r\nwhich makes it  unlawful for any  person \"to coerce,  intimidate,\r\nthreaten  or interfere with such other person for having aided or\r\nencouraged any other person  in the exercise or enjoyment  of any\r\nsuch right granted or protected by this chapter.\"\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nretaliation.  In response, defendants removed the case to federal\r\n\ncourt, on  the ground that  consideration of the  discharge would\r\n\nrequire the court to interpret a collective bargaining agreement,\r\n\nbringing  Serafino's  claim  within  Section  301  of  the  Labor\r\n\nManagement Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.   185.  \r\n\n     On  March  31,  1995,4  defendants  submitted  a  motion  to\r\n\ndismiss  Serafino's  claims.   They claimed  that by  refusing to\r\n\nrespond  to their  questions,  Serafino had  prevented them  from\r\n\ndiscovering important information about the very benefits that he\r\n\nsued  to  recover.     Defendants  asserted  that  the  questions\r\n\nsurrounding the benefits were central to the case:\r\n\n     If .  .  .  Serafino  paid criminal  bribes  to  Milton\r\n     Bradley  employees to maintain  his unusually favorable\r\n     overtime  arrangement,  battery  business and  cleaning\r\n     services,  then he  is  in no  position  to claim  that\r\n     defendants somehow wrongfully took these  benefits away\r\n     . . . [or that] his termination was [not] proper.\r\n\n     In  rebuttal,   Serafino  disputed  the   relevance  of  the\r\n\nquestions,  suggesting that defendants were instead attempting to\r\n\ngarner information for their  RICO complaint.  On July  28, 1995,\r\n\nthe  district  court  dismissed  all of  Serafino's  claims  with\r\n\nprejudice  and  remanded Anita  Serafino's  claims  to the  state\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n\n     Serafino  attacks  the  district  court's  decision  on  two\r\n\nfronts:  first, he argues that, as a matter of law, the court did\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4  A few days  earlier, Hasbro filed a civil RICO  complaint\r\nagainst  Serafino,  Gulluni  and  Peckham alleging  a  course  of\r\nconduct  involving  kickbacks,  overcharging  and  other  illegal\r\nactivity.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nnot have the  power to  dismiss his claims;  second, he  contends\r\n\nthat  the court  abused  its discretion  in  concluding that  his\r\n\nconstitutional interest was  outweighed by possible prejudice  to\r\n\ndefendants.  We address these issues in turn.\r\n\nA.   The District Court's Power to Dismiss \r                                                    \r\n\n     Serafino argues that the  legitimate exercise of one's Fifth\r\n\nAmendment privilege can never justify dismissal  of a civil claim\r\n\n-- a contention not without force.   The Supreme Court has stated\r\n\nthat the Fifth Amendment \"guarantees .  . . the right of a person\r\n\nto remain silent  unless he  chooses to speak  in the  unfettered\r\n\nexercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty . . . for such\r                                                            \r\n\nsilence.\"   Spevack v.

The\r                         \r\n\nconcept  of \"penalty\"  includes \"the  imposition of  any sanction\r\n\nwhich makes assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege 'costly.'\"\r\n\nId.  at 515  (quoting Griffin  v.

Columbia  Broadcasting Sys.,  608 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n1084,  1087-88 (5th Cir. 1979), we cannot agree that dismissal is\r\n\nalways impermissible.  See id. at 1087 n.6 (\"[T]he district court\r                                        \r\n\nis  not precluded  from using  dismissal as  a remedy  to prevent\r                                                               \r\n\nunfairness to the defendant.\").\r\n\n     The  Supreme Court has  indicated that the  assertion of the\r\n\nprivilege may  sometimes disadvantage  a party.    See Baxter  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPalmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976) (allowing adverse inferences\r                    \r\n\nto be drawn  from a  civil party's assertion  of the  privilege);\r                                    \r\n\nFlint v. Mullen, 499 F.2d 100, 104 (1st Cir. 1974)  (\"[N]ot every\r                         \r\n\nundesirable consequence which may follow from the exercise of the\r\n\nprivilege  against self-incrimination can  be characterized  as a\r\n\npenalty.\").    We  think  that  in  the  civil   context,  where,\r\n\nsystemically, the parties  are on a  somewhat equal footing,  one\r\n\nparty's  assertion  of  his   constitutional  right  should   not\r\n\nobliterate  another party's right to a fair proceeding.  In other\r\n\nwords, while a trial court should strive to accommodate a party's\r\n\nFifth  Amendment interests, see United States v. Parcels of Land,\r                                                                          \r\n\n903 F.2d  36, 44 (1st  Cir. 1990), it  also must ensure  that the\r\n\nopposing  party  is not  unduly  disadvantaged.   See  Gutierrez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodriguez  v.  Cartagena,  882  F.2d 553,  577  (1st  Cir.  1989)\r                                  \r\n\n(affirming district court's refusal to allow defendant to testify\r\n\nat  trial  when  he  asserted Fifth  Amendment  privilege  during\r\n\ndiscovery).  After balancing the conflicting interests, dismissal\r\n\nmay be the only viable alternative.5\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5  Though dismissal  has rarely been imposed or  affirmed, a\r\nnumber of courts  have acknowledged the court's power  to dismiss\r\neven in the  face of a party's proper assertion of the privilege.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n     We reiterate that the balance must be weighted to  safeguard\r\n\nthe Fifth Amendment privilege:  the burden on the party asserting\r\n\nit  should be no  more than  is necessary  to prevent  unfair and\r\n\nunnecessary prejudice to the other side.  See S.E.C. v. Graystone\r                                                                           \r\n\nNash, Inc., 25 F.3d at 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1994); Wehling, 608 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  1088.  As correctly delineated  by the district court in this\r\n\ncase,  \"the Fifth  Amendment  privilege should  be upheld  unless\r\n\ndefendants have  substantial need for particular  information and\r\n\nthere is  no other less  burdensome effective means  of obtaining\r\n\nit.\"  See Black Panther Party v.

Though Serafino\r\n\nhotly disputes  each premise, our more  detailed analysis compels\r\n\nus to agree with the court's conclusions.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n     1.   Importance of the Information\r                                                 \r\n\n     Serafino's alleged illegal conduct  is relevant in two ways.\r\n\nFirst, defendants  justify their  discharge of Serafino  on their\r\n\nbelief  that he conspired to defraud Hasbro.  Under the framework\r\n\nof McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973),\r                                             \r\n\nwhich  generally guides claims under Mass. Gen. L. Ann. ch. 151B,\r\n\nWoods v. Friction  Materials, Inc.,  30 F.3d 255,  263 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1994),  if defendants  propose  a nonretaliatory  reason for  the\r\n\ntermination and present facts in support, Serafino cannot prevail\r\n\nunless he proves that the reason is pretext, see Tate v. Dep't of\r                                                                           \r\n\nMental Health, 419 Mass. 356, 362-63, 645 N.E.2d 1159 (1995).  In\r                       \r\n\nthis context, the significance  of information that goes directly\r\n\nto the nonretaliatory justification is self-evident.\r\n\n     Second,  if in  fact the  benefits were  illegally obtained,\r\n\nthen  defendants could  effectively  argue that  Serafino is  not\r\n\nentitled to  compensation based on them.   Though we do  not, and\r\n\nneed  not,  determine   whether  his  alleged  misconduct   would\r\n\nforeclose all possible  relief,6 we easily conclude  that, at the\r\n\nvery least, it would greatly diminish his recovery.  Cf. McKennon\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Nashville Banner Pub. Co., 115 S. Ct. 879, 886 (1995) (holding\r                                      \r\n\nthat after-acquired evidence of an employee's misconduct does not\r\n\nbar  all relief under the ADEA but  must be taken into account in\r\n\ndetermining  an  appropriate remedy).    Without  the ability  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6      In  addition   to   seeking   compensation  for   the\r\ndiscontinuation  of  the  three business  arrangements,  Serafino\r\nseeks  emotional  and  exemplary  damages,  attorneys'  fees  and\r\ninjunctive relief against further retaliation.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ninvestigate  a matter  that  goes to  the  heart of  the  damages\r\n\nsought, defendants would be substantially prejudiced.\r\n\n     2.   Alternative Means\r                                     \r\n\n     The district court  found that \"there are no company records\r\n\nor  other Hasbro  employees  whose information  could effectively\r\n\nsubstitute  for  responses from  George  Serafino  himself.\"   We\r\n\nagree. Even if a  paper trail might show some  irregularities, it\r\n\nis  a  poor  proxy  for  Serafino's  testimony.    As  for  other\r\n\nemployees,  such as Peckham and Gulluni, if they were involved in\r\n\nillegal conduct,  they would almost certainly  assert their Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  privilege.    If,  instead,  they denied  involvement,\r\n\ndefendants  would be  back  at square  one, handicapped  in their\r\n\ndefense by Serafino's silence.  \r\n\n     3.   Alternative Remedies\r                                        \r\n\n     We  are left to consider whether a less drastic remedy would\r\n\nhave  sufficed.   At  oral argument  on  the motion  to  dismiss,\r\n\ncounsel for Serafino listed  several possibilities -- staying the\r\n\nmatter, allowing an  adverse inference to be  drawn, and striking\r\n\ntestimony --  but did not recommend one,  suggesting instead that\r\n\nthe court's  first alternative should be a  motion to compel.  We\r\n\ndoubt that  the  court  could  have ordered  Serafino  to  answer\r\n\nquestions to which the privilege attached.  See Wehling, 608 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 1087.  In any  event, since counsel did not even  suggest that\r\n\nSerafino would waive his  privilege, a motion to compel was not a\r\n\nreasonable alternative.  \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n     Though he  never requested  one, Serafino contends  that the\r\n\ncourt could  have issued a stay and cites Wehling in support.  In\r                                                           \r\n\nWehling,  the Fifth  Circuit reversed  the denial  of plaintiff's\r                 \r\n\nmotion for a  protective order and  stayed the civil  proceedings\r\n\nfor three years, until the expiration of the criminal limitations\r\n\nperiod.  608  F.2d at  1089.  Here,  upon considering  Serafino's\r\n\nfailure  to  file a  motion, and  the  hardship that  delay would\r\n\nimpose  on defendants, the  district court refused  to sua sponte\r                                                                           \r\n\nimpose  a  stay.   We  cannot say  this  constitutes an  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.  \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r\n\n     Information   regarding   potential   illegal   conduct   in\r\n\nconnection  with  the  three  business ventures  was  crucial  to\r\n\ndefendants'  ability  to  mount  an effective  defense,  and  was\r\n\nuniquely  within  plaintiff's control.    While  Serafino had  an\r\n\nabsolute  constitutional  right  not to  reveal  any  potentially\r\n\nincriminating  material,  his invocation  of  that  privilege, in\r\n\nthese   circumstances,  placed   defendants   at  a   significant\r\n\ndisadvantage.    Because the  district  court did  not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion in  balancing the  interests at  stake, we  affirm its\r\n\ndecision to dismiss Serafino's claims.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                       \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n",

In addition to his regular employment, Serafino had three unusual business arrangements with Milton Bradley.   In 1976, Serafino created Hampden Battery Service, Inc.  (\"Hampden Battery\"), which serviced and reconditioned batteries used in Milton Bradley vehicles.   Then, in 1984, he formed ABC Janitorial Services (\"ABC\"), which performed nightly cleaning service at Milton Bradley buildings.   Finally, in 1985, he assumed responsibility for supervising ground maintenance at the company's facilities, for which he was guaranteed 20 hours a week of overtime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anita Serafino,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> George Serafino's daughter, also worked at Milton Bradley.   In January 1992, she filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging that a co-worker had sexually harassed her.   In July 1993, both Serafinos filed a complaint in Hampden Superior Court against Hasbro and Ditomassi alleging sex discrimination and retaliation.   In particular, George Serafino alleged that Ditomassi, as a retaliatory measure, instructed two high-ranking company employees, Joseph Gulluni and Arthur Peckham, to terminate the three extracurricular business ventures.   The overtime arrangement was discontinued on January 1, 1993, the business relationship with Hampden Battery in April of 1993, and the relationship with ABC in mid-1994.   Based on these events, Serafino advanced three theories of liability:  violation of Mass.Gen.L.Ann. ch. 151B<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>, quantum meruit, and intentional interference with advantageous relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino was deposed in the fall of 1994.   Defendants pursued a line of questioning concerning improprieties surrounding Hampden Battery, ABC and the overtime benefits, focusing, in particular, on how Serafino, Gulluni and Peckham might have illegally benefitted from these ventures.   Serafino, invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment and Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, refused to answer most questions relating to these matters.   Such questions included:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Did you give money to other people as a condition for doing business with Milton Bradley?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[Did] Mr. Peckham ever get any financial benefit from ABC Cleaning Services?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Why did [Mr. Gulluni] have you report to his office every day?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Do you have any financial relations with Mr. Peckham?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Were you involved in criminal activity together?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Isn't it true that Mr. Peckham got financial benefit from your companies that was illegal?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George Serafino was discharged from Milton Bradley in December 1994.   Shortly thereafter, the Serafinos amended their complaint to include this termination as a further act of retaliation.   In response, defendants removed the case to federal court, on the ground that consideration of the discharge would require the court to interpret a collective bargaining agreement, bringing Serafino's claim within Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 1995,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> defendants submitted a motion to dismiss Serafino's claims.   They claimed that by refusing to respond to their questions, Serafino had prevented them from discovering important information about the very benefits that he sued to recover.   Defendants asserted that the questions surrounding the benefits were central to the case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>If ... Serafino paid criminal bribes to Milton Bradley employees to maintain his unusually favorable overtime arrangement, battery business and cleaning services, then he is in no position to claim that defendants somehow wrongfully took these benefits away ... [or that] his termination was [not] proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rebuttal, Serafino disputed the relevance of the questions, suggesting that defendants were instead attempting to garner information for their RICO complaint.   On July 28, 1995, the district court dismissed all of Serafino's claims with prejudice and remanded Anita Serafino's claims to the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino attacks the district court's decision on two fronts:  first, he argues that, as a matter of law, the court did not have the power to dismiss his claims;  second, he contends that the court abused its discretion in concluding that his constitutional interest was outweighed by possible prejudice to defendants.   We address these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The District Court's Power to Dismiss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino argues that the legitimate exercise of one's Fifth Amendment privilege can never justify dismissal of a civil claim--a contention not without force.   The Supreme Court has stated that the Fifth Amendment \"guarantees ... the right of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty ... for such silence.\"  Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 514, 87 S.Ct. 625, 627, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967) (quoting Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493-94, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964)) (emphasis added).   The concept of \"penalty\" includes \"the imposition of any sanction which makes assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege 'costly.' \"  Id. at 515, 87 S.Ct. at 628 (quoting Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1232-33, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unconstitutional penalties for the invocation of the privilege have included disbarment of a lawyer, see Spevack, 385 U.S. at 516, 87 S.Ct. at 629;  forfeiture of jobs by public employees, see Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 278, 88 S.Ct. 1913, ----, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968) and Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v. Commissioner of Sanitation, 392 U.S. 280, 284-85, 88 S.Ct. 1917, 1919-20, 20 L.Ed.2d 1089 (1968);  and imposition of substantial economic sanctions, see Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 82-83, 94 S.Ct. 316, 324-25, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973).   While automatic dismissal of a civil action could fall neatly within this category, see Wehling v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 608 F.2d 1084, 1087-88 (5th Cir.1979), we cannot agree that dismissal is always impermissible.   See id. at 1087 n. 6 (\"[T]he district court is not precluded from using dismissal as a remedy to prevent unfairness to the defendant.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has indicated that the assertion of the privilege may sometimes disadvantage a party.   See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1557-58, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976) (allowing adverse inferences to be drawn from a civil party's assertion of the privilege);  Flint v. Mullen, 499 F.2d 100, 104 (1st Cir.1974) (\"[N]ot every undesirable consequence which may follow from the exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination can be characterized as a penalty.\").   We think that in the civil context, where, systemically, the parties are on a somewhat equal footing, one party's assertion of his constitutional right should not obliterate another party's right to a fair proceeding.   In other words, while a trial court should strive to accommodate a party's Fifth Amendment interests, see United States v. Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 44 (1st Cir.1990), it also must ensure that the opposing party is not unduly disadvantaged.   See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 577 (1st Cir.1989) (affirming district court's refusal to allow defendant to testify at trial when he asserted Fifth Amendment privilege during discovery).   After balancing the conflicting interests, dismissal may be the only viable alternative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reiterate that the balance must be weighed to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege:  the burden on the party asserting it should be no more than is necessary to prevent unfair and unnecessary prejudice to the other side.   See S.E.C. v. Graystone Nash, Inc., 25 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir.1994);  Wehling, 608 F.2d at 1088.   As correctly delineated by the district court in this case, \"the Fifth Amendment privilege should be upheld unless defendants have substantial need for particular information and there is no other less burdensome effective means of obtaining it.\"   See Black Panther Party v. Smith, 661 F.2d 1243, 1272 (D.C.Cir.1981), vacated mem., 458 U.S. 1118, 102 S.Ct. 3505, 73 L.Ed.2d 1381 (1982) (enunciating similar balancing approach).   Having determined that the district court could, within its discretion, dismiss this case, and that it utilized the proper balancing test, we now evaluate the balancing itself for abuse of discretion.   See Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Court's Balancing Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Serafino's claims upon concluding that 1) the alleged illegal conduct underlying the outside benefits was central to defendants' defense;  2) there was no effective substitute for Serafino's answers;  and 3) there was no adequate alternative remedy to dismissal.   Though Serafino hotly disputes each premise, our more detailed analysis compels us to agree with the court's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Importance of the Information</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino's alleged illegal conduct is relevant in two ways.   First, defendants justify their discharge of Serafino on their belief that he conspired to defraud Hasbro.   Under the framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-26, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which generally guides claims under Mass.Gen.L.Ann. ch. 151B, Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1994), if defendants propose a nonretaliatory reason for the termination and present facts in support, Serafino cannot prevail unless he proves that the reason is pretext, see Tate v. Dep't of Mental Health, 419 Mass. 356, 362-63, 645 N.E.2d 1159 (1995).   In this context, the significance of information that goes directly to the nonretaliatory justification is self-evident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if in fact the benefits were illegally obtained, then defendants could effectively argue that Serafino is not entitled to compensation based on them.   Though we do not, and need not, determine whether his alleged misconduct would foreclose all possible relief,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> we easily conclude that, at the very least, it would greatly diminish his recovery.   Cf. McKennon v. Nashville Banner Pub. Co., --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 879, 886, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995) (holding that after-acquired evidence of an employee's misconduct does not bar all relief under the ADEA but must be taken into account in determining an appropriate remedy).   Without the ability to investigate a matter that goes to the heart of the damages sought, defendants would be substantially prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Alternative Means</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that \"there are no company records or other Hasbro employees whose information could effectively substitute for responses from George Serafino himself.\"   We agree.   Even if a paper trail might show some irregularities, it is a poor proxy for Serafino's testimony.   As for other employees, such as Peckham and Gulluni, if they were involved in illegal conduct, they would almost certainly assert their Fifth Amendment privilege.   If, instead, they denied involvement, defendants would be back at square one, handicapped in their defense by Serafino's silence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Alternative Remedies</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are left to consider whether a less drastic remedy would have sufficed.   At oral argument on the motion to dismiss, counsel for Serafino listed several possibilities--staying the matter, allowing an adverse inference to be drawn, and striking testimony--but did not recommend one, suggesting instead that the court's first alternative should be a motion to compel.   We doubt that the court could have ordered Serafino to answer questions to which the privilege attached.   See Wehling, 608 F.2d at 1087.   In any event, since counsel did not even suggest that Serafino would waive his privilege, a motion to compel was not a reasonable alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though he never requested one, Serafino contends that the court could have issued a stay and cites Wehling in support.   In Wehling, the Fifth Circuit reversed the denial of plaintiff's motion for a protective order and stayed the civil proceedings for three years, until the expiration of the criminal limitations period.  608 F.2d at 1089.   Here, upon considering Serafino's failure to file a motion, and the hardship that delay would impose on defendants, the district court refused to sua sponte impose a stay.   We cannot say this constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Information regarding potential illegal conduct in connection with the three business ventures was crucial to defendants' ability to mount an effective defense, and was uniquely within plaintiff's control.   While Serafino had an absolute constitutional right not to reveal any potentially incriminating material, his invocation of that privilege, in these circumstances, placed defendants at a significant disadvantage.   Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in balancing the interests at stake, we affirm its decision to dismiss Serafino's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Since this appeal is from an order granting a motion to dismiss, we derive the facts from the pleadings.

In addition to his regular employment, Serafino had three unusual business arrangements with Milton Bradley.   In 1976, Serafino created Hampden Battery Service, Inc.  (\"Hampden Battery\"), which serviced and reconditioned batteries used in Milton Bradley vehicles.   Then, in 1984, he formed ABC Janitorial Services (\"ABC\"), which performed nightly cleaning service at Milton Bradley buildings.   Finally, in 1985, he assumed responsibility for supervising ground maintenance at the company's facilities, for which he was guaranteed 20 hours a week of overtime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anita Serafino,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> George Serafino's daughter, also worked at Milton Bradley.   In January 1992, she filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging that a co-worker had sexually harassed her.   In July 1993, both Serafinos filed a complaint in Hampden Superior Court against Hasbro and Ditomassi alleging sex discrimination and retaliation.   In particular, George Serafino alleged that Ditomassi, as a retaliatory measure, instructed two high-ranking company employees, Joseph Gulluni and Arthur Peckham, to terminate the three extracurricular business ventures.   The overtime arrangement was discontinued on January 1, 1993, the business relationship with Hampden Battery in April of 1993, and the relationship with ABC in mid-1994.   Based on these events, Serafino advanced three theories of liability:  violation of Mass.Gen.L.Ann. ch. 151B<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>, quantum meruit, and intentional interference with advantageous relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino was deposed in the fall of 1994.   Defendants pursued a line of questioning concerning improprieties surrounding Hampden Battery, ABC and the overtime benefits, focusing, in particular, on how Serafino, Gulluni and Peckham might have illegally benefitted from these ventures.   Serafino, invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment and Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, refused to answer most questions relating to these matters.   Such questions included:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Did you give money to other people as a condition for doing business with Milton Bradley?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>[Did] Mr. Peckham ever get any financial benefit from ABC Cleaning Services?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Why did [Mr. Gulluni] have you report to his office every day?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Do you have any financial relations with Mr. Peckham?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Were you involved in criminal activity together?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Isn't it true that Mr. Peckham got financial benefit from your companies that was illegal?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">George Serafino was discharged from Milton Bradley in December 1994.   Shortly thereafter, the Serafinos amended their complaint to include this termination as a further act of retaliation.   In response, defendants removed the case to federal court, on the ground that consideration of the discharge would require the court to interpret a collective bargaining agreement, bringing Serafino's claim within Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 31, 1995,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> defendants submitted a motion to dismiss Serafino's claims.   They claimed that by refusing to respond to their questions, Serafino had prevented them from discovering important information about the very benefits that he sued to recover.   Defendants asserted that the questions surrounding the benefits were central to the case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>If ... Serafino paid criminal bribes to Milton Bradley employees to maintain his unusually favorable overtime arrangement, battery business and cleaning services, then he is in no position to claim that defendants somehow wrongfully took these benefits away ...

On July 28, 1995, the district court dismissed all of Serafino's claims with prejudice and remanded Anita Serafino's claims to the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino attacks the district court's decision on two fronts:  first, he argues that, as a matter of law, the court did not have the power to dismiss his claims;  second, he contends that the court abused its discretion in concluding that his constitutional interest was outweighed by possible prejudice to defendants.

We think that in the civil context, where, systemically, the parties are on a somewhat equal footing, one party's assertion of his constitutional right should not obliterate another party's right to a fair proceeding.   In other words, while a trial court should strive to accommodate a party's Fifth Amendment interests, see United States v. Parcels of Land, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541731\"><a href=\"/opinion/541731/united-states-v-parcels-of-land-etc-appeal-of-lionel-laliberte/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1990), it also must ensure that the opposing party is not unduly disadvantaged.   See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v.

After balancing the conflicting interests, dismissal may be the only viable alternative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reiterate that the balance must be weighed to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege:  the burden on the party asserting it should be no more than is necessary to prevent unfair and unnecessary prejudice to the other side.   See S.E.C. v. Graystone Nash, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670697\"><a href=\"/opinion/670697/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-graystone-nash-inc-thomas-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 192 (3d Cir.1994);  Wehling, 608 F.2d at 1088.   As correctly delineated by the district court in this case, \"the Fifth Amendment privilege should be upheld unless defendants have substantial need for particular information and there is no other less burdensome effective means of obtaining it.\"   See Black Panther Party v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396176\"><a href=\"/opinion/396176/the-black-panther-party-v-william-french-smith-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1272 (D.C.Cir.1981), vacated mem., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></span> (1982) (enunciating similar balancing approach).   Having determined that the district court could, within its discretion, dismiss this case, and that it utilized the proper balancing test, we now evaluate the balancing itself for abuse of discretion.   See Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Court's Balancing Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Serafino's claims upon concluding that 1) the alleged illegal conduct underlying the outside benefits was central to defendants' defense;  2) there was no effective substitute for Serafino's answers;  and 3) there was no adequate alternative remedy to dismissal.   Though Serafino hotly disputes each premise, our more detailed analysis compels us to agree with the court's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Importance of the Information</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serafino's alleged illegal conduct is relevant in two ways.   First, defendants justify their discharge of Serafino on their belief that he conspired to defraud Hasbro.   Under the framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1817</span></a></span>, 1824-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973), which generally guides claims under Mass.Gen.L.Ann. ch. 151B, Woods v. Friction Materials, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675091\"><a href=\"/opinion/675091/jimmie-e-woods-v-friction-materials-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.1994), if defendants propose a nonretaliatory reason for the termination and present facts in support, Serafino cannot prevail unless he proves that the reason is pretext, see Tate v. Dep't of Mental Health, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span>, 362-63, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></span> (1995).   In this context, the significance of information that goes directly to the nonretaliatory justification is self-evident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if in fact the benefits were illegally obtained, then defendants could effectively argue that Serafino is not entitled to compensation based on them.   Though we do not, and need not, determine whether his alleged misconduct would foreclose all possible relief,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> we easily conclude that, at the very least, it would greatly diminish his recovery.   Cf. McKennon v. Nashville Banner Pub. Co., --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></a></span>, 886, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span> (1995) (holding that after-acquired evidence of an employee's misconduct does not bar all relief under the ADEA but must be taken into account in determining an appropriate remedy).   Without the ability to investigate a matter that goes to the heart of the damages sought, defendants would be substantially prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Alternative Means</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that \"there are no company records or other Hasbro employees whose information could effectively substitute for responses from George Serafino himself.\"   We agree.   Even if a paper trail might show some irregularities, it is a poor proxy for Serafino's testimony.   As for other employees, such as Peckham and Gulluni, if they were involved in illegal conduct, they would almost certainly assert their Fifth Amendment privilege.   If, instead, they denied involvement, defendants would be back at square one, handicapped in their defense by Serafino's silence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Alternative Remedies</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are left to consider whether a less drastic remedy would have sufficed.   At oral argument on the motion to dismiss, counsel for Serafino listed several possibilities--staying the matter, allowing an adverse inference to be drawn, and striking testimony--but did not recommend one, suggesting instead that the court's first alternative should be a motion to compel.   We doubt that the court could have ordered Serafino to answer questions to which the privilege attached.   See Wehling, 608 F.2d at 1087.   In any event, since counsel did not even suggest that Serafino would waive his privilege, a motion to compel was not a reasonable alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though he never requested one, Serafino contends that the court could have issued a stay and cites Wehling in support.   In Wehling, the Fifth Circuit reversed the denial of plaintiff's motion for a protective order and stayed the civil proceedings for three years, until the expiration of the criminal limitations period.  608 F.2d at 1089.   Here, upon considering Serafino's failure to file a motion, and the hardship that delay would impose on defendants, the district court refused to sua sponte impose a stay.   We cannot say this constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Information regarding potential illegal conduct in connection with the three business ventures was crucial to defendants' ability to mount an effective defense, and was uniquely within plaintiff's control.   While Serafino had an absolute constitutional right not to reveal any potentially incriminating material, his invocation of that privilege, in these circumstances, placed defendants at a significant disadvantage.   Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in balancing the interests at stake, we affirm its decision to dismiss Serafino's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Since this appeal is from an order granting a motion to dismiss, we derive the facts from the pleadings.
