Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                              \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \r\n                Cyr and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r                                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDavid James Wyatt on brief pro se.\r                             \r\nMatthew E.

Appellant David  James Wyatt  appeals\r                                \r\n\nfrom  the dismissal  of  his action  against appellee  Boston\r\n\nTeachers  Union.  He filed a complaint in the district court,\r\n\nalleging  that  the  Union  had  retaliated  against  him  in\r\n\nviolation  of  Title VII  by  refusing  to represent  him  in\r\n\nopposing his termination  from his  job as a  teacher in  the\r\n\nBoston public  school system.  The  district court determined\r\n\nthat  appellant  had  not  filed  a  charge  with  the  Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission within 300 days as required\r\n\nby  42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(e).  We agree with the district court\r\n\nfor  essentially  the  reasons  stated in  its  Order,  dated\r\n\nDecember 14, 1995.  We add two comments.\r\n\n          1.    Appellant  raises  on appeal  a  new  theory,\r\n\nsupported by new  facts, concerning his argument  that he did\r\n\nnot discover  that the Union  was refusing  to represent  him\r\n\nuntil  June 24, 1994.  Appellant also raises the new argument\r\n\nthat he was unaware of his right to sue the Union under Title\r\n\nVII until we  issued our opinion in the  appeal of his action\r\n\nagainst the City of Boston and others.  See Wyatt  v. City of\r                                                                         \r\n\nBoston,  Nos. 93-2330  and  93-2367 (1st  Cir. September  15,\r                  \r\n\n1994).\r\n\n          In the absence  of extraordinary circumstances,  we\r\n\ndo not consider arguments never presented to the lower court.\r\n\nClauson   v.   Smith,   823   F.2d   660,   666   (1st   Cir.\r                                \r\n\n1987)(collecting cases).  We have reviewed the record and the\r\n\nbriefs, and  do  not find  such  circumstances here.    Thus,\r\r\n\nappellant  has  waived appellate  consideration of  these new\r\n\nassertions.  See id.\r                                \r\n\n          2.  Using  December 31, 1993 as  the time appellant\r\n\nlearned of  the  alleged  unlawful  practice  --  retaliatory\r\n\nrefusal of  representation --  we conclude that  the November\r\n\n25,  1994 filing  with the  Massachusetts Commission  Against\r\n\nDiscrimination occurred 328  days after this  date.  This  is\r\n\noutside  both the 240-day  limit for  filing charges  with an\r\n\nappropriate  state agency  and the  300-day limit  for filing\r\n\ncharges  with the  EEOC.   See    EEOC v.  Commercial  Office\r                                                                         \r\n\nProducts Co.,  486 U.S.  107, 110-11 (1988)  (with exceptions\r                        \r\n\nnot relevant here, a  complainant may not file a  charge with\r\n\nthe  EEOC until 60 days  have passed from  the initial filing\r\n\nwith  the proper state agency; thus, to meet the 300-day time\r\n\nlimit for  filing EEOC charges,  the state complaint  must be\r\n\nfiled  within 240 days of  the date the  alleged unlawful act\r\n\ntook place).\r\n\n          The judgment  of the  district  court is  summarily\r                                                                         \r\n\naffirmed.
