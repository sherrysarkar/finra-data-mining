Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n\n\nBefore\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nAldrich and Cudahy, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n\n\nPaul L. Lees, with whom Orlando &amp; Associates was on brief, for\r\nappellant.\r\nJeffrey B. Loeb, with whom Ardiff &amp; Morse P.C. was on brief,\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\n\n\nMarch 19, 1999\r\n        TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant James Albion\r\nbrought this action in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts against YMCA Camp Letts (\"Camp Letts\") to\r\nrecover for injuries allegedly sustained by him while he was\r\nemployed by Camp Letts at its location in Edgewater, Maryland.  In\r\nresponse, defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal\r\njurisdiction.  On May 6, 1998, the district court issued a\r\nMemorandum and Order granting defendant's motion.  Conceding that\r\npersonal jurisdiction does not lie in Massachusetts, Albion now\r\nrequests this court to transfer his case to the District Court for\r\nthe District of Maryland.  We affirm the district court's order of\r\ndismissal and decline plaintiff's transfer request.\r\nI.  Background\r\nAlbion was hired by Camp Letts to work as a sailing\r\ninstructor during the summer of 1994 at the camp's Edgewater,\r\nMaryland location.  On or about August 13, 1994, Albion engaged in\r\na demonstration for the campers on a boat owned by Camp Letts. \r\nWhile performing this demonstration, Albion fell and allegedly\r\nsuffered injuries.\r\nOn July 29, 1997 -- just two days before the statute of\r\nlimitations was to expire -- Albion brought suit under: (1) the\r\nJones Act, 46 U.S.C.  688; and (2) the General Maritime Law.  At\r\nthe time of the filing of the complaint, Albion was a resident of\r\nMassachusetts.  As both the complaint and the civil cover sheet\r\nindicate, Camp Letts is a Maryland corporation with its principal\r\nplace of business in Edgewater, Maryland.  Camp Letts has no\r\noffices in Massachusetts, does not own property in Massachusetts,\r\nand does not transact business in Massachusetts.  Albion requests\r\nthat this court transfer his case to the federal District Court for\r\nthe District of Maryland.\r\nII.  Discussion\r\nIn his opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss,\r\nAlbion argued that: (1) because Camp Letts is a federally chartered\r\ncorporation, it is subject to personal jurisdiction in\r\nMassachusetts; and (2) even if personal jurisdiction fails, the\r\ncase should be transferred to the District Court for the District\r\nof Maryland pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1404(a).  At oral argument\r\nbefore this court, Albion abandoned his personal jurisdiction\r\nargument and requested only that this court transfer his case to\r\nthe federal District Court in Maryland.  Accordingly, we address\r\nonly the transfer issue.\r\n1.  Section 1404(a)\r\nSection 1404(a) is a codification of the doctrine of\r\nforum non conveniens.  See Pedzewick v. Foe, 963 F. Supp. 48, 50\r\nn.1 (D. Mass 1997).  As the Supreme Court has stated, \"the\r\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens can never apply if there is\r\nabsence of jurisdiction or mistake of venue.\"  Gulf Oil Corp. v.\r\nGilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 504 (1947).  Given that Albion conceded the\r\nlack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant at oral argument,\r\ntransfer under  1404(a) is clearly inappropriate.  See id. \r\n2.  Section 1406(a)\r\nAlternatively, plaintiff seeks transfer under 28 U.S.C.\r\n1406(a).  Plaintiff first raised  1406(a) as a ground for\r\ntransfer at oral argument.  Neither his opposition to defendant's\r\nmotion to dismiss nor his appellate brief discusses or even cites\r\nthis transfer provision.  This alternative ground was not fairly\r\npresented to the district court and is thus waived.  See Sammartanov. Palmas Del Mar Properties, Inc., 161 F.3d 96, 97 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(finding theory not squarely raised before the district court to be\r\nwaived).  Defendant's motion to dismiss put plaintiff on notice\r\nthat both venue and personal jurisdiction were at issue in this\r\ncase.  Plaintiff had ample opportunity to raise his  1406(a)\r\nargument in the court below.  His failure in this regard now\r\nprecludes appellate review.  Section 1631 III.  Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's order dismissing plaintiff's complaint for lack of personal\r\njurisdiction and decline to transfer the case to the District Court\r\nfor the District of Maryland.\r\n",
