This  appeal  involves  the  duties\r            LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                 \r\n\nimposed by Massachusetts  law on a minority  shareholder in a\r\n\nclosely   held   corporation.       Arthur   W.    Chesterton\r\n\n(\"Chesterton\"), a minority shareholder in the A.W. Chesterton\r\n\nCompany, frustrated in his efforts to dispose of  his shares,\r\n\nproposed to transfer a portion of his stock in the Company to\r\n\ntwo  shell corporations.    Because  such  a  transfer  would\r\n\nterminate the  Company's  advantageous  Subchapter  S  status\r\n\nunder the  Internal Revenue  Code, the  district court  found\r\n\nthat  the proposed  transfer violated  Chesterton's fiduciary\r\n\nduty to the Company and enjoined him from proceeding with the\r\n\ntransfer.  Chesterton appeals this finding and injunction, as\r\n\nwell  as   the  district   court's  denial  of   Chesterton's\r\n\ncounterclaim for relief under M.G.L. ch. 156B.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          There  is  little  dispute  about the  facts  which\r\n\nemerged  from  the  trial.    While  it  is  unclear  whether\r\n\nChesterton  is asserting  that  the district  court's factual\r\n\nconclusions are not  supported by the evidence, we  state the\r\n\nfacts as the court could  have found them.  Cambridge Plating\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 756 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                              \r\n\n          The Company  has been a closely  held Massachusetts\r\n\ncorporation since  its inception  in 1885,  and is  currently\r\n\nowned  and operated  by  the  descendants  of  the  Company's\r\n\nfounder,  Arthur W. Chesterton.  Chesterton, the defendant in\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthis case and the grandson of the original Arthur Chesterton,\r\n\nis currently the  Company's largest shareholder, with  27.06%\r\n\nof  the  Company s stock.    The Company  and  its affiliates\r\n\nmanufacture  mechanical seals,  packaging, pumps  and related\r\n\nproducts, which are distributed throughout the world. \r\n\n          Two  corporate events  set the  stage.   The  first\r\n\noccurred  in 1975,  when  the  shareholders  of  the  Company\r\n\napproved the  Company's  Restated  Articles  of  Organization\r\n\n(\"the Articles\").   The Articles provide  the Company with  a\r\n\nright of first refusal in  the event that a shareholder seeks\r\n\nto transfer her shares to an individual or entity outside the\r\n\nimmediate Chesterton family.   The shareholder must  give the\r\n\nCompany 30  days notice;  the Company may  avoid the  sale by\r\n\nopting  to purchase the  stock within  the 30  days.   If the\r\n\nCompany declines the option, the shareholder may proceed with\r\n\nthe sale as planned.   Part of Chesterton s argument  focuses\r\n\non the fact that he had complied with these provisions of the\r\n\nArticles when he proposed his stock transfer.  \r\n\n          The second  occurred in  1985,  when the  Company's\r\n\nBoard of Directors voted to change the Company's status under\r\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code from a Subchapter C corporation  to\r\n\na Subchapter S corporation.  The Board perceived Subchapter S\r\n\nstatus  as  advantageous  to the  Company  because  it allows\r\n\nshareholders in  a small  business corporation  to avoid  the\r\n\ndouble   taxation  of  income  to  which  shareholders  in  a\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nSubchapter  C  corporation are  subject.    The  income of  a\r\n\nSubchapter  C corporation  is taxed  first  at the  corporate\r\n\nlevel when the company earns income, and a second time at the\r\n\nshareholder level when the shareholders receive the income in\r\n\nthe form  of  dividends.    A Subchapter  S  corporation,  in\r\n\ncontrast,  is not taxed at  the corporate level; rather, each\r\n\nshareholder pays income tax individually in proportion to her\r\n\nshare of  ownership in  the corporation.1   See 26  U.S.C.   \r                                                           \r\n\n1361 - 1399. \r\n\n          In order to  qualify for Subchapter S  treatment, a\r\n\ncorporation  must be a  domestic corporation which  does not:\r\n\n(1)  have more  than seventy-five  shareholders,  (2) have  a\r\n\ncorporation  or other  non-individual as  a  shareholder, (3)\r\n\nhave a non-resident alien as a shareholder, and (4) have more\r\n\nthan one  class of stock.  26 U.S.C.    1361(b).  Failure  to\r\n\nabide  by any  of  these  limitations  results  in  automatic\r\n\ntermination of  Subchapter S status. 26 U.S.C.   1362(d)(2). \r\n\n            After the Company Board voted to adopt Subchapter\r\n\nS status,  the officers  and directors  sought to  inform the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  There is a drawback to Subchapter S status known as\r\n\"phantom income.\" That phrase describes the liability that\r\nshareholders in an S corporation face for taxes on their\r\nshare of the corporation's profits, even if those profits are\r\nnot distributed to the shareholders as dividends.  Chesterton\r\nmakes much of the fact that the Company's shareholders are\r\nsubject to the risk of phantom income, but offered no\r\nevidence that the risk had materialized. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nshareholders  about the  benefits and  limitations  of the  S\r\n\nelection, and recommended  that the  shareholders give  their\r\n\nconsent.   Under  the Internal  Revenue  Code, the  unanimous\r\n\nconsent of the  shareholders of a corporation  is required in\r\n\norder  to  finalize  a  Subchapter  S  election.   26  U.S.C.\r\n\n1362(a)(2).  As an officer and director of the Company at the\r\n\ntime,  Chesterton was heavily  involved in this  process.  He\r\n\nled and  participated in  shareholder meetings  regarding the\r\n\nSubchapter  S election.   At those meetings  the shareholders\r\n\nwere provided  with  information regarding  the  benefits  of\r\n\nSubchapter S election, as well as the limitations it imposed.\r\n\nThe  shareholders unanimously  consented to the  Subchapter S\r\n\nelection.     Implicit  in   this  consent   was  a   general\r\n\nunderstanding  among the shareholders that they would take no\r\n\naction that would adversely affect the Company's Subchapter S\r\n\nstatus.  \r\n\n          In the early 1990's, Chesterton became discontented\r\n\nwith  the  Company's  performance,  including  its  declining\r\n\nprofits,  heavy debt,  and credit problems.2  Chesterton also\r\n\nobjects to a financial arrangement  that the Company has with\r\n\nChesterton International, B.V. (\"BV\"),  a Company affiliate.3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Chesterton points to testimony which showed that the\r\nCompany currently has $16,000,000 in outstanding debt, that\r\nit has violated its loan agreements, and that in 1994 the\r\nCompany needed to borrow money to pay dividends.\r\n\n3.  The affiliate BV is owned and operated by the same\r\nshareholders and Board of Directors as the Company.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nUnder  the arrangement, the  affiliate BV pays  the Company a\r\n\nlarge  management  fee,4  which has  allowed  the  Company to\r\n\ncontinue  to pay dividends  to its shareholders,  despite its\r\n\npoor financial  performance.  Chesterton  believes that  this\r\n\narrangement masks the Company s dire financial straights.  He\r                                                                    . \r\n\nalso  objects  to   the  arrangement  because  much   of  the\r\n\nmanagement  fee is funnelled into Company pension plans, from\r\n\nwhich Chesterton does not benefit because he is not a current\r\n\nCompany employee.  \r\n\n          Because  of his  dissatisfaction with  the Company,\r\n\nChesterton sought to sell his Company stock.  He found little\r\n\ninterest  because  all  he  could  offer  was  a  minority of\r\n\nshares.5   After some  failed efforts  to locate  an investor\r\n\nwilling to  purchase his  stock outright,  Chesterton devised\r\n\nthe scheme  at issue  in this case.   Chesterton  proposed to\r\n\ntransfer  a portion of  his shares to  two shell corporations\r\n\nwhich are  wholly-owned by him.  Chesterton complied with the\r\n\nArticles  of Organization by  providing the Company  with the\r\n\nproper notice  of  his proposed  transfer  so that  it  could\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Chesterton asserts that this management fee does not\r\nactually reflect the value of services provided to the BV by\r\nthe Company.  He argues that because the Internal Revenue\r\nService could reclassify the excess of the fee over the value\r\nof the services as dividends to the BV shareholders, this\r\nincongruity exposes the shareholders to increased tax\r\nliability.\r\n\n5.  None of Chesterton s fellow shareholders were willing to\r\nsell their stock and join him to offer a majority package.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\npurchase  his shares.  The Company, however, declined because\r\n\nit lacks the ability to purchase the shares. \r\n\n          When the  Company  would not  purchase his  shares,\r\n\nChesterton sought  to proceed  with the  transfer.   But that\r\n\ntransfer would have a deleterious effect on the Company's tax\r\n\nstatus.   The Company and its shareholders derive significant\r\n\ntax benefits  from  the Company s  status as  a Subchapter  S\r\n\ncorporation.     Should  a   corporation  become   a  Company\r\n\nshareholder,  as   it  would   under  Chesterton's   proposed\r\n\ntransfer, the  Subchapter S status  terminates automatically.\r\n\n26 U.S.C.     1362(d)(2).   If Chesterton were  to consummate\r\n\nhis  proposed transfer to the shell corporations, the Company\r\n\nwould  revert  to   Subchapter  C  status.     The  Company's\r\n\nSubchapter  S status enabled  it to distribute  an additional\r\n\n$5.3  million in dividends between  1985 and 1995.  Reversion\r\n\nto  Subchapter  C   status  would  represent  a   significant\r\n\nfinancial loss for the Company  and its shareholders.  Once a\r\n\ncorporation loses its Subchapter S status, it cannot reattain\r\n\nthat status for a minimum of  five years.  26 U.S.C. 1362(g).\r\n\nIn fact, loss of Subchapter S status would have a more severe\r\n\neffect on the  Company because it is  currently grandfathered\r\n\nunder   an  old   provision  which   exempted  Subchapter   S\r\n\ncorporations from taxes on the sale of corporate assets.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n26  U.S.C.    1374(c)(1).    Even if  the  Company eventually\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nregained its Subchapter  S status, it would  permanently lose\r\n\nits grandfathered status.\r\n\n          Fearing  the loss of  its Subchapter S  status, the\r\n\nCompany  and its  shareholders  instituted suit,  seeking  to\r\n\nenjoin Chesterton from  effectuating his plan.   The original\r\n\ncomplaint  alleged   breach  of  fiduciary  duty,  breach  of\r\n\ncontract, breach of implied covenant  of good faith and  fair\r\n\ndealing, and interference with an advantageous  relationship.\r\n\nBefore trial, the  parties stipulated to  a dismissal of  all\r\n\nclaims,  with prejudice, except  for the breach  of fiduciary\r\n\nduty claim.   Plaintiffs also  agreed to \"waive  their claims\r\n\nfor  damages, but [not]  their claims for  equitable relief.\"\r\n\nAfter  a  bench trial,  the  district  court ruled  that  the\r\n\nproposed transfers would violate Chesterton's fiduciary  duty\r\n\nunder  Massachusetts  law  and  that  they  would  result  in\r\n\nirreparable harm  to  the Company.   The  court enjoined  the\r\n\ntransfers and  denied Chesterton's counterclaim  for monetary\r\n\nrelief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B.  \r\n\n          Chesterton   argues   that   the   district   court\r\n\nimproperly  determined the  scope  of Chesterton's  fiduciary\r\n\nduty under  Massachusetts law.  He asserts  that the district\r\n\ncourt  improperly resurrected  the waived  contract claim  by\r\n\ndiscussing the general  agreement among the shareholders  not\r\n\nto disrupt the Company's Subchapter S status.  He argues that\r\n\nthe district court improperly concluded that the Subchapter S\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nelection imposed an implied restriction on transferability of\r\n\nstock,  where   the  Company   did  not   follow  the   legal\r\n\nrequirements for imposing  stock transfer restrictions  under\r\n\nMass.  Gen. Laws  ch.  156B.   Finally,  he  argues that  the\r\n\ndistrict    court    improperly    restricted    Chesterton's\r\n\npresentation of  evidence at trial concerning certain Company\r\n\naccounting practices.  We reject Chesterton's arguments.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          We review the district court's grant of a permanent\r\n\ninjunction for  abuse  of discretion.

If  Chesterton  were  to\r\n\neffectuate  his  proposed  transfer,  the   Company  and  its\r\n\nshareholders would  lose the  substantial financial  benefits\r\n\nthey have  derived from  the Company's  Subchapter S  status.\r\n\nSuch benefits are likely to continue if the Company maintains\r\n\nits  Subchapter  S  status.    Chesterton,  disgruntled  with\r\n\noverall Company  performance and in pursuit of  his own self-\r\n\ninterest,  has   threatened  to  destroy   these  substantial\r\n\nbenefits.  No claim  is before us  as to whether the  Company\r\n\nand   its  other  shareholders   have  acted   fairly  toward\r\n\nChesterton over the years; we  decide only that the  district\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in holding that he has not\r\n\nacted fairly towards them.  \r\n\n          Chesterton's attack focuses on part of the district\r\n\ncourt's analysis:\r\n\n          At  the  time  of  the  S  election,  the\r\n          shareholders were informed and understood\r\n          that the  Company would lose its S status\r\n          if a  shareholder sold shares  to another\r\n          corporation.   By unanimously  electing S\r\n          status, the shareholders agreed that they\r\n          would not act in any way that would cause\r\n          the  Company  to  lose  the  considerable\r\n          benefits of S  status. . .  . In view  of\r\n          the agreement  regarding S  status, which\r\n          Defendant supported  and facilitated,  he\r\n          cannot now  sell his  shares in  a manner\r\n          that  would  terminate  the  Company's  S\r\n          status,  even though  he would  have been\r\n          entitled  to do so under the Articles had\r\n          there been no S status agreement.\r\n\nA.W. Chesterton Co. v. Chesterton,  951 F. Supp. 291, 295 (D.\r                                             \r\n\nMass.  1997).     Chesterton  argues   that  this  discussion\r\n\nimproperly  resurrects  a  contract  claim  that   plaintiffs\r\n\nvoluntarily dismissed.  We disagree:   in context it is clear\r\n\nthat the court was discussing the shareholders' understanding\r\n\nas   it  relates  to  Chesterton's  fiduciary  duty.    Under\r\n\nMassachusetts law, the expectations and  understanding of the\r\n\nshareholders  are  relevant  to a  breach  of  fiduciary duty\r\n\ndetermination.  See, e.g., Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 353 N.E.2d 657, 664 (Mass. 1976) (holding that the duty\r                \r\n\nof  utmost  good faith  and  loyalty  at  a minimum  requires\r\n\nshareholders  to consider their  actions in light  of company\r\n\npolicies    or    long-standing   understandings    of    the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nshareholders).   Viewed  in this  context,  it is  irrelevant\r\n\nwhether  the agreement among the shareholders that they would\r\n\nnot act so as to destroy the Company's Subchapter S status is\r\n\nlegally enforceable.   The existence of the  agreement simply\r\n\nsheds  light  on   the  Company's  and   other  shareholders'\r\n\nexpectations,   and   reinforces  the   disloyal   nature  of\r\n\nChesterton's  proposed  plan.     Further,  the  strict  duty\r\n\nChesterton owes  is created at law and would exist regardless\r\n\nof any agreement.\r\n\n          Chesterton also  argues  that he  falls  within  an\r\n\nexception to Donahue.  In  Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 353 N.E.2d 657, 663 (Mass. 1976), the Supreme  Judicial\r                \r\n\nCourt  fashioned an  exception to  Donahue,  recognizing that\r                                                      \r\n\n\"the controlling group in a close corporation must  have some\r\n\nroom  to maneuver in establishing  the business policy of the\r\n\ncorporation.\"   If \"the  controlling group can  demonstrate a\r\n\nlegitimate business purpose for its action,\" then it will not\r\n\nbe  held  to  have   violated  its  fiduciary  duty   to  the\r\n\ncorporation and other shareholders.  Id.  The court held that\r                                                    \r\n\nthe proffered legitimate business purpose defense would fail,\r\n\nhowever, if the complaining  shareholder(s) could demonstrate\r\n\nthat the  same business  objective could  have been  achieved\r\n\nthrough a less harmful course of action.  Id.  \r                                                         \r\n\n          Implicitly  conceding  that his  proposed  transfer\r\n\nwould   further  his  own  personal  interests  but  not  the\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ninterests  of  the  business,   Chesterton  argues  that  the\r\n\nlegitimate business  purpose test  applies only  to  minority\r\n\nshareholders with management discretion  or control over  the\r\n\ncorporation,  and  that  he   is  not  in  such  a  position.\r\n\nChesterton proposes the adoption of a less demanding test for\r\n\nnon-managing minority shareholders that  inquires whether the\r\n\naction is for a \"bona  fide purpose.\"  Chesterton's bona fide\r\n\npurpose  test, although  creative,  fails  for  a  number  of\r\n\nreasons.  \r\n\n          First, Massachusetts law has  not adopted any  such\r\n\nrule.  The Massachusetts  cases make clear that a \"legitimate\r\n\nbusiness  purpose\" must  be  a  legitimate  purpose  for  the\r                                                                         \r\n\ncorporation, not for the defendant shareholder.  In Zimmerman\r                                                                         \r\n\nand Smith,  for example, the  defendant minority shareholders\r                     \r\n\nacted  to benefit their own interests, while disregarding the\r\n\ninterests  of the corporation.   The fact  that their actions\r\n\nwere  taken  to  benefit  themselves  was  no  excuse.    The\r\n\ndefendant in Smith argued  that his use of the veto  power to\r                              \r\n\nblock the payment of dividends was at least partly due to his\r\n\nown  legitimate  purposes,  specifically  a  \"tax   avoidance\r\n\npurpose.\"  Smith, 422 N.E.2d at 800.  Regardless of the Smith\r                                                                         \r\n\ndefendant s personal  reasons for  refusing to  authorize the\r\n\npayment of dividends,  the refusal nevertheless  violated his\r\n\nduty  of  good   faith  and  loyalty  to   the  corporation s\r\n\ninterests.  Id. at 803.    The  Massachusetts  cases  do  not\r                           \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nprovide any grounds for Chesterton s proposed test, and as  a\r\n\nfederal court  ruling on  Massachusetts law,  we hesitate  to\r\n\nexpand  that law beyond  its clearly  established boundaries.\r\n\nSee  F.D.I.C. v. Insurance  Co. of N.

If  the  defendant has  no\r                     \r\n\ncontrol over the enterprise, he  has no need for the business\r\n\ndiscretion  that the Wilkes court intended to protect through\r                                       \r\n\nits  legitimate business  purpose defense.    Furthermore, as\r\n\nSmith and Zimmerman  explain, a minority shareholder  is held\r                               \r\n\nto the Donahue  fiduciary duty precisely because  his actions\r                          \r\n\ncould and do affect the  interests of the corporation and the\r\n\nother shareholders.  Here, because Chesterton's actions  will\r\n\ndetermine  whether  the Company  retains  its advantageous  S\r\n\nstatus, he unquestionably has control over that issue.\r\n\n          Chesterton did not establish  a legitimate business\r\n\npurpose  for his  proposed transfer  at trial,  and  does not\r\n\nargue   one on appeal.   Indeed, if  there was no  market for\r\n\nChesterton's shares because they were minority  shares, there\r\n\nis  little reason  to think  that  there will  suddenly  be a\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nmarket  because   those  same   minority  shares   have  been\r\n\ntransferred to corporate ownership.   There is no evidence of\r\n\nany such effect.6   Further, Chesterton proposed  to transfer\r\n\nonly approximately  10% of  his shares  to the  corporations,\r\n\nwhich hardly  would have  satisfied his  articulated goal  of\r\n\ncomplete divestment.   The district court  did not abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion.  \r\n\n1.  Chesterton's Chapter 156B argument\r                                                  \r\n\n          Chesterton   argues   that  the   only   legitimate\r\n\nrestrictions on  the  transferability of  Company  stock  are\r\n\nthose found in the 1975 Restated Articles of Organization and\r\n\nthat he  complied with the Articles'  procedural requirements\r\n\nby  providing  the Company  with  the  proper  notice of  his\r\n\nproposed transfer.   This argument misses the point.   If the\r\n\nstrict  Donahue  fiduciary   obligations  did  not   restrict\r                           \r\n\notherwise legitimate  actions, they  would add  nothing to  a\r\n\nshareholder s  legal duties.  See, e.g., Smith, 422 N.E.2d at\r                                                          \r\n\n802  (minority shareholder breached his fiduciary duty to the\r\n\ncorporation  in  exercising veto  power  over dividends  that\r\n\ncorporate  charter gave  him).   Chesterton  cannot defend  a\r\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty claim  on the basis that he has  not\r\n\nviolated the Articles of Organization. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Chesterton asserts that he had a potential buyer for an\r\ninterest in his new corporations.  That buyer was an old\r\nfriend of Chesterton's and the district court found this\r\nrationale to be a sham.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          Chesterton   also   asserts   that   any   transfer\r\n\nrestriction beyond those incorporated in the 1975 Articles is\r\n\ninvalid for failure to comply with the requirements  of Mass.\r\n\nGen. Laws ch.  156B.  Chesterton refers to     76, 77(d), and\r\n\n87-98, which  provide, inter alia,  that a  shareholder in  a\r                                             \r\n\nchapter 156B corporation  is entitled to appraisal  rights in\r\n\nthe  event that the  corporation adopts any  amendment to its\r\n\narticles  which restrict the transferability of stock.  Those\r\n\nsections also require that notice of the rights of dissenting\r\n\nshareholders  be provided  in  the notice  of any  meeting at\r\n\nwhich the proposed transfer restrictions will be  considered.\r\n\nChesterton  argues that the district court was precluded from\r\n\nfinding that  the 1985 Subchapter  S election resulted  in an\r\n\nimplied restriction on the  shareholders  ability to transfer\r\n\ntheir shares because  the Company did  not comply with  Mass.\r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 156B.  \r\n\n          Again, Chesterton s  argument is misguided.   These\r\n\nprovisions do not apply here.  The procedures and rights that\r\n\nChesterton refers to apply in only three situations: (1) when\r\n\nthe corporation makes  certain amendments to the  articles of\r\n\norganization; (2) when certain  mergers are accomplished; and\r\n\n(3) when  the corporation sells  all or substantially  all of\r\n\nits assets.   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B,     76-77, 82-83, and\r\n\n86-98.  None of these situations exist in this case.  \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          Chesterton argues that even  if the 156B protective\r\n\nprocedures do not  technically apply to this  situation, 156B\r\n\nreveals  a  strong  public  policy  disfavoring  any transfer\r\n\nrestrictions  in the absence  of formal notice  and appraisal\r\n\nrights.    This  argument  fails  for  two  reasons.   First,\r\n\nChesterton s  strict  fiduciary  duty does  not  result  in a\r\n\ncomplete  transfer  restriction.    Chesterton  was  free  to\r\n\ntransfer his shares in a  manner that would not terminate the\r\n\nCompany s S status.   Second, the  public policy embodied  in\r\n\nthe  Donahue doctrine  is at  least as  strong as  the policy\r                        \r\n\ndisfavoring transfer restrictions. \r\n\n          We reject all of  Chesterton s inventive arguments,\r\n\nand  affirm  the district  court s  finding  that  plaintiffs\r\n\nsucceed  on the  merits  of their  breach  of fiduciary  duty\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\nB.  Irreparable Harm\r                                \r\n\n          The  district court  found that  the Company  would\r\n\nsuffer irreparable harm  from the  loss of  its Subchapter  S\r\n\nstatus,   in  part  because  that  harm  is  not  measurable.\r\n\nChesterton argues that  because the harm to  the Company from\r\n\nthe loss of  its Subchapter S  status is entirely  financial,\r\n\nequitable relief  is inappropriate.   Where  the harm  is not\r\n\nmeasurable,  it  is  not  an  abuse  of  discretion  to award\r\n\nequitable  relief.  Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.,  102 F.3d  12, 19  (1st Cir.  1996) (\"If  the plaintiff\r                \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nsuffers  a   substantial  injury   that  is   not  accurately\r\n\nmeasurable .  . .  irreparable harm  is a  natural sequel.\").\r\n\nThe loss of advantageous tax status can  form the basis for a\r\n\nfinding of irreparable  harm.  See San  Francisco Real Estate\r                                                                         \r\n\nInvestors v.  Real Estate Inv.  Trust of Am.,  701 F.2d 1000,\r                                                        \r\n\n1007 (1st  Cir. 1983)  (relying on  loss of advantageous  tax\r\n\nstatus   and  other   findings  to   support   a  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction).  The district court found that the actual degree\r\n\nof the injury was not  measurable, \"because the amount of the\r\n\nincreased  tax liability would be contingent on the Company's\r\n\nfuture   earnings  and  distributions.\"     This  finding  is\r\n\nsupported by the record and common sense, and is not an abuse\r\n\nof discretion.\r\n\n          Chesterton  also  argues  that  the  Company  would\r\n\nsuffer no  irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction,\r\n\nbecause the Company could have achieved a return equal to the\r\n\nSubchapter S status tax savings by redirecting the management\r\n\nfee  that the BV pays to the Company.   He argues that if the\r\n\nBV  made  distributions   of  its  income  directly   to  the\r\n\nshareholders,  rather  than   to  the  Company  through   the\r\n\nmanagement fee,  the shareholders  would receive  substantial\r\n\nsums of money.   In addition, he asserts  that the management\r\n\nfee  does  not  accurately  measure  the  value  of  services\r\n\nprovided by  the Company to  the BV, and  that this disparity\r\n\ncould result  in  an  IRS reallocation  of  income,  in  turn\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nresulting in substantially greater taxes to the shareholders.\r\n\nThis argument,  regardless of  its accuracy,  is  irrelevant.\r\n\nThe fact that the Company could achieve greater distributions\r\n\nfor its shareholders  by redirecting the management  fee does\r\n\nnot alter  the fact that the  loss of Subchapter  S status is\r\n\ninjurious in any event.    \r\n\n          For the same reasons,  we reject Chesterton's claim\r\n\nthat the  district court  improperly restricted  Chesterton's\r\n\nattempts to cross-examine the Company's  tax expert regarding\r\n\nthe nature  and propriety of  the management fee.   We review\r\n\nthe district court's  decision to exclude evidence  for abuse\r\n\nof discretion.  Stevens v.  Bangor and Aroostock R.R. Co., 97\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 594,  599 (1st Cir.  1996).  The  district court limited\r\n\nChesterton's proffered examination because  it found that the\r\n\ntestimony was collateral to the main issues in the case.  The\r\n\ncourt also relied on the fact that for the years 1991 through\r\n\n1993, the IRS had audited the Company's taxes and had made no\r\n\nadjustments or comments regarding the management fee.  Such a\r\n\nruling was well within the court's discretion.\r\n\nC.  Balance of Equities\r                                   \r\n\n          The final consideration regarding  the propriety of\r\n\ninjunctive relief is whether, on balance, the harm plaintiffs\r\n\nwill  suffer from the  proposed transfers outweighs  the harm\r\n\nthat  Chesterton will suffer  if his transfers  are enjoined.\r\n\nThe  district court found  that an injunction  would not harm\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nChesterton  because the  proposed sales  would  do little  to\r\n\nadvance  his efforts  to sell  the stock.   The  court stated\r\n\nthat, \"if  [Chesterton] was  unable to find  a buyer  for his\r\n\nshares in  the Company, it  strains logic to  believe that he\r\n\nwould  be able  to  find a  buyer  for shares  in [the  shell\r\n\ncorporations] when  their primary  assets are  the very  same\r\n\nshares he was previously unable to  sell.\"  Chesterton claims\r\n\nthat by transferring the shares to his shell corporations, he\r\n\nwill somehow increase  the liquidity  of those  shares.   The\r\n\nclaim is counter-intuitive  and no evidence was  presented to\r\n\nsupport it.   On  this record,  the district  court's finding\r\n\nthat the  potential harm to plaintiffs outweighs  the harm to\r\n\ndefendant was proper.\r                      \r\n\n     II. Chesterton s Counterclaim for Relief Under 156B\r                                                                    \r\n\n          Finally,  Chesterton appeals  the  district court's\r\n\ndenial  of his  claim for  relief under  Mass. Gen.  Laws ch.\r\n\n156B.   Chesterton argues  that  even if  the district  court\r\n\nproperly determined that the Subchapter S election  impliedly\r\n\nrestricted the  shareholders' rights to transfer  their stock\r\n\nto a corporation,  he is now  entitled to  notice and to  the\r\n\nexercise of his  dissenter's rights under  156B.  He  asserts\r\n\nthat the district court's decision is the first notice of the\r\n\nrestriction that he  has had, and that  under 156B he is  now\r\n\nentitled  to dissent  from the  restriction  and enforce  his\r\n\nappraisal rights.    Chesterton's  claim  to  156B  appraisal\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nrights  fails  for  the same  reason  that  his general  156B\r\n\nargument  fails:  that  provision is  not  triggered  by this\r\n\nsituation.  The district court correctly  denied Chesterton's\r\n\nmisdirected claim to 156B appraisal rights.\r\n\n           The decision of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n",

Arthur W. Chesterton (\"Chesterton\"), a minority shareholder in the A.W. Chesterton Company, frustrated in his efforts to dispose of his shares, proposed to transfer a portion of his stock in the Company to two shell corporations.  Because such a transfer would terminate the Company's advantageous Subchapter S status under the Internal Revenue Code, the district court found that the proposed transfer violated Chesterton's fiduciary duty to the Company and enjoined him from proceeding with the transfer.  Chesterton appeals this finding and injunction, as well as the district court's denial of Chesterton's counterclaim for relief under M.G.L. ch.  156B. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little dispute about the facts which emerged from the trial.  While it is unclear whether Chesterton is asserting that the district court's factual conclusions are not supported by the evidence, we state the facts as the court could have found them.  Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 756 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company has been a closely held Massachusetts corporation since its inception in 1885, and is currently owned and operated by the descendants of the Company's founder, Arthur W. Chesterton.  Chesterton, the defendant in this case and the grandson of the original Arthur Chesterton, is currently the Company's largest shareholder, with 27.06% of the Company's stock.  The Company and its affiliates manufacture mechanical seals, packaging, pumps and related products, which are distributed throughout the world.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two corporate events set the stage.  The first occurred in 1975, when the shareholders of the Company approved the Company's Restated Articles of Organization (\"the Articles\").  The Articles provide the Company with a right of first refusal in the event that a shareholder seeks to transfer her shares to an individual or entity outside the immediate Chesterton family.  The shareholder must give the Company 30 days notice;  the Company may avoid the sale by opting to purchase the stock within the 30 days.  If the Company declines the option, the shareholder may proceed with the sale as planned.  Part of Chesterton's argument focuses on the fact that he had complied with these provisions of the Articles when he proposed his stock transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second occurred in 1985, when the Company's Board of Directors voted to change the Company's status under the Internal Revenue Code from a Subchapter C corporation to a Subchapter S corporation.  The Board perceived Subchapter S status as advantageous to the Company because it allows shareholders in a small business corporation to avoid the double taxation of income to which shareholders in a Subchapter C corporation are subject.  The income of a Subchapter C corporation is taxed first at the corporate level when the company earns income, and a second time at the shareholder level when the shareholders receive the income in the form of dividends.  A Subchapter S corporation, in contrast, is not taxed at the corporate level;  rather, each shareholder pays income tax individually in proportion to her share of ownership in the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1361-1399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to qualify for Subchapter S treatment, a corporation must be a domestic corporation which does not:  (1) have more than seventy-five shareholders, (2) have a corporation or other non-individual as a shareholder, (3) have a non-resident alien as a shareholder, and (4) have more than one class of stock.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1361(b).  Failure to abide by any of these limitations results in automatic termination of Subchapter S status.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1362(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Company Board voted to adopt Subchapter S status, the officers and directors sought to inform the shareholders about the benefits and limitations of the S election, and recommended that the shareholders give their consent.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, the unanimous consent of the shareholders of a corporation is required in order to finalize a Subchapter S election.  26 U.S.C. 1362(a)(2).  As an officer and director of the Company at the time, Chesterton was heavily involved in this process.  He led and participated in shareholder meetings regarding the Subchapter S election.  At those meetings the shareholders were provided with information regarding the benefits of Subchapter S election, as well as the limitations it imposed.  The shareholders unanimously consented to the Subchapter S election.  Implicit in this consent was a general understanding among the shareholders that they would take no action that would adversely affect the Company's Subchapter S status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1990's, Chesterton became discontented with the Company's performance, including its declining profits, heavy debt, and credit problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Chesterton also objects to a financial arrangement that the Company has with Chesterton International, B.V.  (\"BV\"), a Company affiliate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Under the arrangement, the affiliate BV pays the Company a large management fee,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which has allowed the Company to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders, despite its poor financial performance.  Chesterton believes that this arrangement masks the Company's dire financial straights.  He also objects to the arrangement because much of the management fee is funnelled into Company pension plans, from which Chesterton does not benefit because he is not a current Company employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of his dissatisfaction with the Company, Chesterton sought to sell his Company stock.  He found little interest because all he could offer was a minority of shares.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  After some failed efforts to locate an investor willing to purchase his stock outright, Chesterton devised the scheme at issue in this case.  Chesterton proposed to transfer a portion of his shares to two shell corporations which are wholly-owned by him.  Chesterton complied with the Articles of Organization by providing the Company with the proper notice of his proposed transfer so that it could purchase his shares.  The Company, however, declined because it lacks the ability to purchase the shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Company would not purchase his shares, Chesterton sought to proceed with the transfer.  But that transfer would have a deleterious effect on the Company's tax status.  The Company and its shareholders derive significant tax benefits from the Company's status as a Subchapter S corporation.  Should a corporation become a Company shareholder, as it would under Chesterton's proposed transfer, the Subchapter S status terminates automatically.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1362(d)(2).  If Chesterton were to consummate his proposed transfer to the shell corporations, the Company would revert to Subchapter C status.  The Company's Subchapter S status enabled it to distribute an additional $5.3 million in dividends between 1985 and 1995.  Reversion to Subchapter C status would represent a significant financial loss for the Company and its shareholders.  Once a corporation loses its Subchapter S status, it cannot reattain that status for a minimum of five years.  26 U.S.C. 1362(g).  In fact, loss of Subchapter S status would have a more severe effect on the Company because it is currently grandfathered under an old provision which exempted Subchapter S corporations from taxes on the sale of corporate assets.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 1374(c)(1).  Even if the Company eventually regained its Subchapter S status, it would permanently lose its grandfathered status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fearing the loss of its Subchapter S status, the Company and its shareholders instituted suit, seeking to enjoin Chesterton from effectuating his plan.  The original complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and interference with an advantageous relationship.  Before trial, the parties stipulated to a dismissal of all claims, with prejudice, except for the breach of fiduciary duty claim.  Plaintiffs also agreed to \"waive their claims for damages, but [not] their claims for equitable relief.\"   After a bench trial, the district court ruled that the proposed transfers would violate Chesterton's fiduciary duty under Massachusetts law and that they would result in irreparable harm to the Company.  The court enjoined the transfers and denied Chesterton's counterclaim for monetary relief under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 156B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton argues that the district court improperly determined the scope of Chesterton's fiduciary duty under Massachusetts law.  He asserts that the district court improperly resurrected the waived contract claim by discussing the general agreement among the shareholders not to disrupt the Company's Subchapter S status.  He argues that the district court improperly concluded that the Subchapter S election imposed an implied restriction on transferability of stock, where the Company did not follow the legal requirements for imposing stock transfer restrictions under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  156B. Finally, he argues that the district court improperly restricted Chesterton's presentation of evidence at trial concerning certain Company accounting practices.  We reject Chesterton's arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.  Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F.3d 908, 912 (1st Cir.1996) (citing Caroline T. v. Hudson Sch. Dist., 915 F.2d 752, 754-55 (1st Cir.1990)).  The standard for issuing a permanent injunction requires the district court to find that (1) plaintiffs prevail on the merits;  (2) plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief;  (3) the harm to plaintiffs would outweigh the harm the defendant would suffer from the imposition of an injunction;  and (4) the public interest would not be adversely affected by an injunction.  Indian Motocycle Assoc.  III Ltd. Partnership v. Massachusetts Housing Fin.  Agency, 66 F.3d 1246, 1249 (1st Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted).  The district court found, and we agree, that the public interest was not at issue in this case.  We turn to the remaining three factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Success on the Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., 367 Mass. 578, 328 N.E.2d 505 (1975), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court first announced that shareholders in a closely held corporation owe an elevated fiduciary duty to one another.  See generally, Peter M. Rosenblum, Corporate Fiduciary Duties in Massachusetts and Delaware, in How to Incorporate and Counsel a Business 331, 354-366 (Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education, Inc., ed., 1996) (providing an informative review of Donahue and its progeny).  After noting that close corporations bear a \"striking resemblance to a partnership,\" the court stated that \"the relationship among the stockholders must be one of trust, confidence and absolute loyalty if the enterprise is to succeed.\"  Id. 328 N.E.2d at 515.   The court condemned \"[d]isloyalty and self-seeking conduct on the part of any stockholder\" in a close corporation, and held that such shareholders owe one another a duty of \"utmost good faith and loyalty.\"  Id. The court stated that stockholders in a close corporation \"may not act out of avarice, expediency or self-interest in derogation of their duty of loyalty to the other stockholders and to the corporation.\"  Id. Although the Donahue case itself dealt with the majority's treatment of a minority shareholder, the court expressly did not limit the application of its strict fiduciary duty standard to majority shareholders, and stated that \"[i]n the close corporation, the minority may do equal damage through unscrupulous and improper 'sharp dealings' with an unsuspecting majority.\"  Id. at n. 17 (citing Helms v. Duckworth, 249 F.2d 482 (D.C.Cir.1957)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first Massachusetts case to apply the Donahue standard to a minority shareholder was Smith v. Atlantic Properties, Inc., 12 Mass.App.Ct. 201, 422 N.E.2d 798 (1981).  In Smith, a provision in the corporate charter effectively gave minority shareholders the power to veto any distribution of dividends.  Although all the other shareholders desired a distribution of dividends, the defendant steadfastly refused to agree to a distribution because nondistribution was personally beneficial to him.  The appeals court held that the majority could seek protection from the actions of the minority shareholder which were detrimental to the interests of the corporation and the other shareholders.  Id. 422 N.E.2d at 801.   Although the court recognized that the veto provision was drafted in part to protect minority interests, it nevertheless determined that a minority shareholder was bound to the Donahue standard of fiduciary responsibility when that shareholder's actions controlled the disposition of a particular corporate issue.  Id. at 803 n. 9 (\" 'A minority shareholder whose conduct is controlling on a particular issue should be bound by no different standard [than the majority].' \") (quoting Hetherington, The Minority's Duty of Loyalty in Close Corporations, 1972 Duke L.J. 921, 946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court endorsed the Smith approach in Zimmerman v. Bogoff, 402 Mass. 650, 524 N.E.2d 849 (1988), holding a minority shareholder to the same standard of strict fiduciary duty as the majority, where the minority's self-interested actions were harmful to the corporation and other shareholders.  Id. 524 N.E.2d at 853-54.   The court made clear that \"[t]he protections of Donahue are not limited to those with less than 50% share ownership.\"  Id. at 853.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Donahue family of cases establishes that Chesterton owes the Company and its other shareholders a fiduciary duty of \"utmost good faith and loyalty.\"   The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Chesterton breached that duty.  If Chesterton were to effectuate his proposed transfer, the Company and its shareholders would lose the substantial financial benefits they have derived from the Company's Subchapter S status.  Such benefits are likely to continue if the Company maintains its Subchapter S status.  Chesterton, disgruntled with overall Company performance and in pursuit of his own self-interest, has threatened to destroy these substantial benefits.  No claim is before us as to whether the Company and its other shareholders have acted fairly toward Chesterton over the years;  we decide only that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that he has not acted fairly towards them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton's attack focuses on part of the district court's analysis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>At the time of the S election, the shareholders were informed and understood that the Company would lose its S status if a shareholder sold shares to another corporation.  By unanimously electing S status, the shareholders agreed that they would not act in any way that would cause the Company to lose the considerable benefits of S status....  In view of the agreement regarding S status, which Defendant supported and facilitated, he cannot now sell his shares in a manner that would terminate the Company's S status, even though he would have been entitled to do so under the Articles had there been no S status agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.W. Chesterton Co. v. Chesterton, 951 F.Supp. 291, 295 (D.Mass.1997).  Chesterton argues that this discussion improperly resurrects a contract claim that plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed.  We disagree:  in context it is clear that the court was discussing the shareholders' understanding as it relates to Chesterton's fiduciary duty.  Under Massachusetts law, the expectations and understanding of the shareholders are relevant to a breach of fiduciary duty determination.  See, e.g., Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home, Inc., 370 Mass. 842, 353 N.E.2d 657, 664 (1976) (holding that the duty of utmost good faith and loyalty at a minimum requires shareholders to consider their actions in light of company policies or long-standing understandings of the shareholders).  Viewed in this context, it is irrelevant whether the agreement among the shareholders that they would not act so as to destroy the Company's Subchapter S status is legally enforceable.  The existence of the agreement simply sheds light on the Company's and other shareholders' expectations, and reinforces the disloyal nature of Chesterton's proposed plan.  Further, the strict duty Chesterton owes is created at law and would exist regardless of any agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton also argues that he falls within an exception to Donahue.   In Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home, Inc., 370 Mass. 842, 353 N.E.2d 657, 663 (1976), the Supreme Judicial Court fashioned an exception to Donahue, recognizing that \"the controlling group in a close corporation must have some room to maneuver in establishing the business policy of the corporation.\"   If \"the controlling group can demonstrate a legitimate business purpose for its action,\" then it will not be held to have violated its fiduciary duty to the corporation and other shareholders.  Id. The court held that the proffered legitimate business purpose defense would fail, however, if the complaining shareholder(s) could demonstrate that the same business objective could have been achieved through a less harmful course of action.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicitly conceding that his proposed transfer would further his own personal interests but not the interests of the business, Chesterton argues that the legitimate business purpose test applies only to minority shareholders with management discretion or control over the corporation, and that he is not in such a position.  Chesterton proposes the adoption of a less demanding test for non-managing minority shareholders that inquires whether the action is for a \"bona fide purpose.\"   Chesterton's bona fide purpose test, although creative, fails for a number of reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Massachusetts law has not adopted any such rule.  The Massachusetts cases make clear that a \"legitimate business purpose\" must be a legitimate purpose for the corporation, not for the defendant shareholder.  In Zimmerman and Smith, for example, the defendant minority shareholders acted to benefit their own interests, while disregarding the interests of the corporation.  The fact that their actions were taken to benefit themselves was no excuse.  The defendant in Smith argued that his use of the veto power to block the payment of dividends was at least partly due to his own legitimate purposes, specifically a \"tax avoidance purpose.\"  Smith, 422 N.E.2d at 800.   Regardless of the Smith defendant's personal reasons for refusing to authorize the payment of dividends, the refusal nevertheless violated his duty of good faith and loyalty to the corporation's interests.  Id. at 803.   The Massachusetts cases do not provide any grounds for Chesterton's proposed test, and as a federal court ruling on Massachusetts law, we hesitate to expand that law beyond its clearly established boundaries.  See F.D.I.C. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 105 F.3d 778, 783 (1st Cir.1997) (\"We must apply the law of Massachusetts as given by its state legislature and state court decisions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Chesterton's proposed expansion mistakes the purpose of the legitimate business purpose test.  The test is designed to prevent \"the Donahue remedy [from placing] a strait jacket on legitimate corporate activity.\"  Zimmerman, 524 N.E.2d at 853.   If the defendant has no control over the enterprise, he has no need for the business discretion that the Wilkes court intended to protect through its legitimate business purpose defense.  Furthermore, as Smith and Zimmerman explain, a minority shareholder is held to the Donahue fiduciary duty precisely because his actions could and do affect the interests of the corporation and the other shareholders.  Here, because Chesterton's actions will determine whether the Company retains its advantageous S status, he unquestionably has control over that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton did not establish a legitimate business purpose for his proposed transfer at trial, and does not argue one on appeal.  Indeed, if there was no market for Chesterton's shares because they were minority shares, there is little reason to think that there will suddenly be a market because those same minority shares have been transferred to corporate ownership.  There is no evidence of any such effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Further, Chesterton proposed to transfer only approximately 10% of his shares to the corporations, which hardly would have satisfied his articulated goal of complete divestment.  The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Chesterton's</p>\n    <p>Chapter 156B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton argues that the only legitimate restrictions on the transferability of Company stock are those found in the 1975 Restated Articles of Organization and that he complied with the Articles' procedural requirements by providing the Company with the proper notice of his proposed transfer.  This argument misses the point.  If the strict Donahue fiduciary obligations did not restrict otherwise legitimate actions, they would add nothing to a shareholder's legal duties.  See, e.g., Smith, 422 N.E.2d at 802 (minority shareholder breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in exercising veto power over dividends that corporate charter gave him).  Chesterton cannot defend a breach of fiduciary duty claim on the basis that he has not violated the Articles of Organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton also asserts that any transfer restriction beyond those incorporated in the 1975 Articles is invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  156B. Chesterton refers to &#167;&#167; 76, 77(d), and 87-98, which provide, inter alia, that a shareholder in a chapter 156B corporation is entitled to appraisal rights in the event that the corporation adopts any amendment to its articles which restrict the transferability of stock.  Those sections also require that notice of the rights of dissenting shareholders be provided in the notice of any meeting at which the proposed transfer restrictions will be considered.  Chesterton argues that the district court was precluded from finding that the 1985 Subchapter S election resulted in an implied restriction on the shareholders' ability to transfer their shares because the Company did not comply with Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 156B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Chesterton's argument is misguided.  These provisions do not apply here.  The procedures and rights that Chesterton refers to apply in only three situations:  (1) when the corporation makes certain amendments to the articles of organization;  (2) when certain mergers are accomplished;  and (3) when the corporation sells all or substantially all of its assets.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167;&#167; 76-77, 82-83, and 86-98.  None of these situations exist in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton argues that even if the 156B protective procedures do not technically apply to this situation, 156B reveals a strong public policy disfavoring any transfer restrictions in the absence of formal notice and appraisal rights.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, Chesterton's strict fiduciary duty does not result in a complete transfer restriction.  Chesterton was free to transfer his shares in a manner that would not terminate the Company's S status.  Second, the public policy embodied in the Donahue doctrine is at least as strong as the policy disfavoring transfer restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject all of Chesterton's inventive arguments, and affirm the district court's finding that plaintiffs succeed on the merits of their breach of fiduciary duty claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Irreparable Harm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the Company would suffer irreparable harm from the loss of its Subchapter S status, in part because that harm is not measurable.  Chesterton argues that because the harm to the Company from the loss of its Subchapter S status is entirely financial, equitable relief is inappropriate.  Where the harm is not measurable, it is not an abuse of discretion to award equitable relief.  Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1996) (\"If the plaintiff suffers a substantial injury that is not accurately measurable ... irreparable harm is a natural sequel.\").  The loss of advantageous tax status can form the basis for a finding of irreparable harm.  See San Francisco Real Estate Investors v. Real Estate Inv. Trust of Am., 701 F.2d 1000, 1007 (1st Cir.1983) (relying on loss of advantageous tax status and other findings to support a preliminary injunction).  The district court found that the actual degree of the injury was not measurable, \"because the amount of the increased tax liability would be contingent on the Company's future earnings and distributions.\"   This finding is supported by the record and common sense, and is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton also argues that the Company would suffer no irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction, because the Company could have achieved a return equal to the Subchapter S status tax savings by redirecting the management fee that the BV pays to the Company.  He argues that if the BV made distributions of its income directly to the shareholders, rather than to the Company through the management fee, the shareholders would receive substantial sums of money.  In addition, he asserts that the management fee does not accurately measure the value of services provided by the Company to the BV, and that this disparity could result in an IRS reallocation of income, in turn resulting in substantially greater taxes to the shareholders.  This argument, regardless of its accuracy, is irrelevant.  The fact that the Company could achieve greater distributions for its shareholders by redirecting the management fee does not alter the fact that the loss of Subchapter S status is injurious in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, we reject Chesterton's claim that the district court improperly restricted Chesterton's attempts to cross-examine the Company's tax expert regarding the nature and propriety of the management fee.  We review the district court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.  Stevens v. Bangor and Aroostook R.R. Co., 97 F.3d 594, 599 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court limited Chesterton's proffered examination because it found that the testimony was collateral to the main issues in the case.  The court also relied on the fact that for the years 1991 through 1993, the IRS had audited the Company's taxes and had made no adjustments or comments regarding the management fee.  Such a ruling was well within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Balance of Equities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final consideration regarding the propriety of injunctive relief is whether, on balance, the harm plaintiffs will suffer from the proposed transfers outweighs the harm that Chesterton will suffer if his transfers are enjoined.  The district court found that an injunction would not harm Chesterton because the proposed sales would do little to advance his efforts to sell the stock.  The court stated that, \"if [Chesterton] was unable to find a buyer for his shares in the Company, it strains logic to believe that he would be able to find a buyer for shares in [the shell corporations] when their primary assets are the very same shares he was previously unable to sell.\"   Chesterton claims that by transferring the shares to his shell corporations, he will somehow increase the liquidity of those shares.  The claim is counter-intuitive and no evidence was presented to support it.  On this record, the district court's finding that the potential harm to plaintiffs outweighs the harm to defendant was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Chesterton's Counterclaim for Relief Under 156B</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Chesterton appeals the district court's denial of his claim for relief under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  156B. Chesterton argues that even if the district court properly determined that the Subchapter S election impliedly restricted the shareholders' rights to transfer their stock to a corporation, he is now entitled to notice and to the exercise of his dissenter's rights under 156B. He asserts that the district court's decision is the first notice of the restriction that he has had, and that under 156B he is now entitled to dissent from the restriction and enforce his appraisal rights.  Chesterton's claim to 156B appraisal rights fails for the same reason that his general 156B argument fails:  that provision is not triggered by this situation.  The district court correctly denied Chesterton's misdirected claim to 156B appraisal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is a drawback to Subchapter S status known as \"phantom income.\"   That phrase describes the liability that shareholders in an S corporation face for taxes on their share of the corporation's profits, even if those profits are not distributed to the shareholders as dividends.  Chesterton makes much of the fact that the Company's shareholders are subject to the risk of phantom income, but offered no evidence that the risk had materialized</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Chesterton points to testimony which showed that the Company currently has $16,000,000 in outstanding debt, that it has violated its loan agreements, and that in 1994 the Company needed to borrow money to pay dividends</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The affiliate BV is owned and operated by the same shareholders and Board of Directors as the Company</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Chesterton asserts that this management fee does not actually reflect the value of services provided to the BV by the Company.  He argues that because the Internal Revenue Service could reclassify the excess of the fee over the value of the services as dividends to the BV shareholders, this incongruity exposes the shareholders to increased tax liability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> None of Chesterton's fellow shareholders were willing to sell their stock and join him to offer a majority package</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Chesterton asserts that he had a potential buyer for an interest in his new corporations.

Arthur W. Chesterton (\"Chesterton\"), a minority shareholder in the A.W. Chesterton Company, frustrated in his efforts to dispose of his shares, proposed to transfer a portion of his stock in the Company to two shell corporations.  Because such a transfer would terminate the Company's advantageous Subchapter S status under the Internal Revenue Code, the district court found that the proposed transfer violated Chesterton's fiduciary duty to the Company and enjoined him from proceeding with the transfer.  Chesterton appeals this finding and injunction, as well as the district court's denial of Chesterton's counterclaim for relief under M.G.L. ch.  156B.

Chesterton.  Chesterton, the defendant in this case and the grandson of the original Arthur Chesterton, is currently the Company's largest shareholder, with 27.06% of the Company's stock.  The Company and its affiliates manufacture mechanical seals, packaging, pumps and related products, which are distributed throughout the world.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two corporate events set the stage.  The first occurred in 1975, when the shareholders of the Company approved the Company's Restated Articles of Organization (\"the Articles\").  The Articles provide the Company with a right of first refusal in the event that a shareholder seeks to transfer her shares to an individual or entity outside the immediate Chesterton family.  The shareholder must give the Company 30 days notice;  the Company may avoid the sale by opting to purchase the stock within the 30 days.  If the Company declines the option, the shareholder may proceed with the sale as planned.  Part of Chesterton's argument focuses on the fact that he had complied with these provisions of the Articles when he proposed his stock transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second occurred in 1985, when the Company's Board of Directors voted to change the Company's status under the Internal Revenue Code from a Subchapter C corporation to a Subchapter S corporation.  The Board perceived Subchapter S status as advantageous to the Company because it allows shareholders in a small business corporation to avoid the double taxation of income to which shareholders in a Subchapter C corporation are subject.  The income of a Subchapter C corporation is taxed first at the corporate level when the company earns income, and a second time at the shareholder level when the shareholders receive the income in the form of dividends.  A Subchapter S corporation, in contrast, is not taxed at the corporate level;  rather, each shareholder pays income tax individually in proportion to her share of ownership in the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1361-1399.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to qualify for Subchapter S treatment, a corporation must be a domestic corporation which does not:  (1) have more than seventy-five shareholders, (2) have a corporation or other non-individual as a shareholder, (3) have a non-resident alien as a shareholder, and (4) have more than one class of stock.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1361(b).  Failure to abide by any of these limitations results in automatic termination of Subchapter S status.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1362(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Company Board voted to adopt Subchapter S status, the officers and directors sought to inform the shareholders about the benefits and limitations of the S election, and recommended that the shareholders give their consent.  Under the Internal Revenue Code, the unanimous consent of the shareholders of a corporation is required in order to finalize a Subchapter S election.  26 U.S.C. 1362(a)(2).  As an officer and director of the Company at the time, Chesterton was heavily involved in this process.  He led and participated in shareholder meetings regarding the Subchapter S election.  At those meetings the shareholders were provided with information regarding the benefits of Subchapter S election, as well as the limitations it imposed.  The shareholders unanimously consented to the Subchapter S election.  Implicit in this consent was a general understanding among the shareholders that they would take no action that would adversely affect the Company's Subchapter S status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1990's, Chesterton became discontented with the Company's performance, including its declining profits, heavy debt, and credit problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Chesterton also objects to a financial arrangement that the Company has with Chesterton International, B.V.  (\"BV\"), a Company affiliate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Under the arrangement, the affiliate BV pays the Company a large management fee,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which has allowed the Company to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders, despite its poor financial performance.  Chesterton believes that this arrangement masks the Company's dire financial straights.  He also objects to the arrangement because much of the management fee is funnelled into Company pension plans, from which Chesterton does not benefit because he is not a current Company employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of his dissatisfaction with the Company, Chesterton sought to sell his Company stock.  He found little interest because all he could offer was a minority of shares.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  After some failed efforts to locate an investor willing to purchase his stock outright, Chesterton devised the scheme at issue in this case.  Chesterton proposed to transfer a portion of his shares to two shell corporations which are wholly-owned by him.  Chesterton complied with the Articles of Organization by providing the Company with the proper notice of his proposed transfer so that it could purchase his shares.  The Company, however, declined because it lacks the ability to purchase the shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the Company would not purchase his shares, Chesterton sought to proceed with the transfer.  But that transfer would have a deleterious effect on the Company's tax status.  The Company and its shareholders derive significant tax benefits from the Company's status as a Subchapter S corporation.  Should a corporation become a Company shareholder, as it would under Chesterton's proposed transfer, the Subchapter S status terminates automatically.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 1362(d)(2).  If Chesterton were to consummate his proposed transfer to the shell corporations, the Company would revert to Subchapter C status.  The Company's Subchapter S status enabled it to distribute an additional $5.3 million in dividends between 1985 and 1995.  Reversion to Subchapter C status would represent a significant financial loss for the Company and its shareholders.  Once a corporation loses its Subchapter S status, it cannot reattain that status for a minimum of five years.  26 U.S.C. 1362(g).  In fact, loss of Subchapter S status would have a more severe effect on the Company because it is currently grandfathered under an old provision which exempted Subchapter S corporations from taxes on the sale of corporate assets.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 1374(c)(1).  Even if the Company eventually regained its Subchapter S status, it would permanently lose its grandfathered status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fearing the loss of its Subchapter S status, the Company and its shareholders instituted suit, seeking to enjoin Chesterton from effectuating his plan.  The original complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and interference with an advantageous relationship.  Before trial, the parties stipulated to a dismissal of all claims, with prejudice, except for the breach of fiduciary duty claim.  Plaintiffs also agreed to \"waive their claims for damages, but [not] their claims for equitable relief.\"   After a bench trial, the district court ruled that the proposed transfers would violate Chesterton's fiduciary duty under Massachusetts law and that they would result in irreparable harm to the Company.  The court enjoined the transfers and denied Chesterton's counterclaim for monetary relief under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 156B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton argues that the district court improperly determined the scope of Chesterton's fiduciary duty under Massachusetts law.  He asserts that the district court improperly resurrected the waived contract claim by discussing the general agreement among the shareholders not to disrupt the Company's Subchapter S status.  He argues that the district court improperly concluded that the Subchapter S election imposed an implied restriction on transferability of stock, where the Company did not follow the legal requirements for imposing stock transfer restrictions under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  156B. Finally, he argues that the district court improperly restricted Chesterton's presentation of evidence at trial concerning certain Company accounting practices.

Rosenblum, Corporate Fiduciary Duties in Massachusetts and Delaware, in How to Incorporate and Counsel a Business 331, 354-366 (Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education, Inc., ed., 1996) (providing an informative review of Donahue and its progeny).  After noting that close corporations bear a \"striking resemblance to a partnership,\" the court stated that \"the relationship among the stockholders must be one of trust, confidence and absolute loyalty if the enterprise is to succeed.\"  Id. 328 N.E.2d at 515.   The court condemned \"[d]isloyalty and self-seeking conduct on the part of any stockholder\" in a close corporation, and held that such shareholders owe one another a duty of \"utmost good faith and loyalty.\"  Id.

In Smith, a provision in the corporate charter effectively gave minority shareholders the power to veto any distribution of dividends.  Although all the other shareholders desired a distribution of dividends, the defendant steadfastly refused to agree to a distribution because nondistribution was personally beneficial to him.  The appeals court held that the majority could seek protection from the actions of the minority shareholder which were detrimental to the interests of the corporation and the other shareholders.  Id. 422 N.E.2d at 801.   Although the court recognized that the veto provision was drafted in part to protect minority interests, it nevertheless determined that a minority shareholder was bound to the Donahue standard of fiduciary responsibility when that shareholder's actions controlled the disposition of a particular corporate issue.

If Chesterton were to effectuate his proposed transfer, the Company and its shareholders would lose the substantial financial benefits they have derived from the Company's Subchapter S status.  Such benefits are likely to continue if the Company maintains its Subchapter S status.  Chesterton, disgruntled with overall Company performance and in pursuit of his own self-interest, has threatened to destroy these substantial benefits.  No claim is before us as to whether the Company and its other shareholders have acted fairly toward Chesterton over the years;  we decide only that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that he has not acted fairly towards them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton's attack focuses on part of the district court's analysis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>At the time of the S election, the shareholders were informed and understood that the Company would lose its S status if a shareholder sold shares to another corporation.

In view of the agreement regarding S status, which Defendant supported and facilitated, he cannot now sell his shares in a manner that would terminate the Company's S status, even though he would have been entitled to do so under the Articles had there been no S status agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.W.

Chesterton argues that this discussion improperly resurrects a contract claim that plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed.  We disagree:  in context it is clear that the court was discussing the shareholders' understanding as it relates to Chesterton's fiduciary duty.  Under Massachusetts law, the expectations and understanding of the shareholders are relevant to a breach of fiduciary duty determination.  See, e.g., Wilkes v. Springside Nursing Home, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2073798\"><a href=\"/opinion/2073798/wilkes-v-springside-nursing-home-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2073798\"><a href=\"/opinion/2073798/wilkes-v-springside-nursing-home-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>, 664 (1976) (holding that the duty of utmost good faith and loyalty at a minimum requires shareholders to consider their actions in light of company policies or long-standing understandings of the shareholders).  Viewed in this context, it is irrelevant whether the agreement among the shareholders that they would not act so as to destroy the Company's Subchapter S status is legally enforceable.  The existence of the agreement simply sheds light on the Company's and other shareholders' expectations, and reinforces the disloyal nature of Chesterton's proposed plan.  Further, the strict duty Chesterton owes is created at law and would exist regardless of any agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton also argues that he falls within an exception to Donahue.

Id. The court held that the proffered legitimate business purpose defense would fail, however, if the complaining shareholder(s) could demonstrate that the same business objective could have been achieved through a less harmful course of action.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implicitly conceding that his proposed transfer would further his own personal interests but not the interests of the business, Chesterton argues that the legitimate business purpose test applies only to minority shareholders with management discretion or control over the corporation, and that he is not in such a position.  Chesterton proposes the adoption of a less demanding test for non-managing minority shareholders that inquires whether the action is for a \"bona fide purpose.\"   Chesterton's bona fide purpose test, although creative, fails for a number of reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Massachusetts law has not adopted any such rule.  The Massachusetts cases make clear that a \"legitimate business purpose\" must be a legitimate purpose for the corporation, not for the defendant shareholder.  In Zimmerman and Smith, for example, the defendant minority shareholders acted to benefit their own interests, while disregarding the interests of the corporation.  The fact that their actions were taken to benefit themselves was no excuse.  The defendant in Smith argued that his use of the veto power to block the payment of dividends was at least partly due to his own legitimate purposes, specifically a \"tax avoidance purpose.\"  Smith, 422 N.E.2d at 800.   Regardless of the Smith defendant's personal reasons for refusing to authorize the payment of dividends, the refusal nevertheless violated his duty of good faith and loyalty to the corporation's interests.  Id. at 803.   The Massachusetts cases do not provide any grounds for Chesterton's proposed test, and as a federal court ruling on Massachusetts law, we hesitate to expand that law beyond its clearly established boundaries.  See F.D.I.C. v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197193\"><a href=\"/opinion/197193/fdic-v-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir.1997) (\"We must apply the law of Massachusetts as given by its state legislature and state court decisions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Chesterton's proposed expansion mistakes the purpose of the legitimate business purpose test.  The test is designed to prevent \"the Donahue remedy [from placing] a strait jacket on legitimate corporate activity.\"  Zimmerman, 524 N.E.2d at 853.   If the defendant has no control over the enterprise, he has no need for the business discretion that the Wilkes court intended to protect through its legitimate business purpose defense.  Furthermore, as Smith and Zimmerman explain, a minority shareholder is held to the Donahue fiduciary duty precisely because his actions could and do affect the interests of the corporation and the other shareholders.  Here, because Chesterton's actions will determine whether the Company retains its advantageous S status, he unquestionably has control over that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton did not establish a legitimate business purpose for his proposed transfer at trial, and does not argue one on appeal.  Indeed, if there was no market for Chesterton's shares because they were minority shares, there is little reason to think that there will suddenly be a market because those same minority shares have been transferred to corporate ownership.  There is no evidence of any such effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Further, Chesterton proposed to transfer only approximately 10% of his shares to the corporations, which hardly would have satisfied his articulated goal of complete divestment.  The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Chesterton's</p>\n    <p>Chapter 156B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton argues that the only legitimate restrictions on the transferability of Company stock are those found in the 1975 Restated Articles of Organization and that he complied with the Articles' procedural requirements by providing the Company with the proper notice of his proposed transfer.  This argument misses the point.  If the strict Donahue fiduciary obligations did not restrict otherwise legitimate actions, they would add nothing to a shareholder's legal duties.  See, e.g., Smith, 422 N.E.2d at 802 (minority shareholder breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in exercising veto power over dividends that corporate charter gave him).  Chesterton cannot defend a breach of fiduciary duty claim on the basis that he has not violated the Articles of Organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton also asserts that any transfer restriction beyond those incorporated in the 1975 Articles is invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  156B. Chesterton refers to &#167;&#167; 76, 77(d), and 87-98, which provide, inter alia, that a shareholder in a chapter 156B corporation is entitled to appraisal rights in the event that the corporation adopts any amendment to its articles which restrict the transferability of stock.  Those sections also require that notice of the rights of dissenting shareholders be provided in the notice of any meeting at which the proposed transfer restrictions will be considered.  Chesterton argues that the district court was precluded from finding that the 1985 Subchapter S election resulted in an implied restriction on the shareholders' ability to transfer their shares because the Company did not comply with Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 156B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Chesterton's argument is misguided.  These provisions do not apply here.  The procedures and rights that Chesterton refers to apply in only three situations:  (1) when the corporation makes certain amendments to the articles of organization;  (2) when certain mergers are accomplished;  and (3) when the corporation sells all or substantially all of its assets.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167;&#167; 76-77, 82-83, and 86-98.  None of these situations exist in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton argues that even if the 156B protective procedures do not technically apply to this situation, 156B reveals a strong public policy disfavoring any transfer restrictions in the absence of formal notice and appraisal rights.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, Chesterton's strict fiduciary duty does not result in a complete transfer restriction.  Chesterton was free to transfer his shares in a manner that would not terminate the Company's S status.  Second, the public policy embodied in the Donahue doctrine is at least as strong as the policy disfavoring transfer restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject all of Chesterton's inventive arguments, and affirm the district court's finding that plaintiffs succeed on the merits of their breach of fiduciary duty claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Irreparable Harm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the Company would suffer irreparable harm from the loss of its Subchapter S status, in part because that harm is not measurable.  Chesterton argues that because the harm to the Company from the loss of its Subchapter S status is entirely financial, equitable relief is inappropriate.  Where the harm is not measurable, it is not an abuse of discretion to award equitable relief.  Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1996) (\"If the plaintiff suffers a substantial injury that is not accurately measurable ... irreparable harm is a natural sequel.\").  The loss of advantageous tax status can form the basis for a finding of irreparable harm.  See San Francisco Real Estate Investors v. Real Estate Inv. Trust of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"415366\"><a href=\"/opinion/415366/fed-sec-l-rep-p-99115-san-francisco-real-estate-investors-v-real/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1007 (1st Cir.1983) (relying on loss of advantageous tax status and other findings to support a preliminary injunction).  The district court found that the actual degree of the injury was not measurable, \"because the amount of the increased tax liability would be contingent on the Company's future earnings and distributions.\"   This finding is supported by the record and common sense, and is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chesterton also argues that the Company would suffer no irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction, because the Company could have achieved a return equal to the Subchapter S status tax savings by redirecting the management fee that the BV pays to the Company.  He argues that if the BV made distributions of its income directly to the shareholders, rather than to the Company through the management fee, the shareholders would receive substantial sums of money.  In addition, he asserts that the management fee does not accurately measure the value of services provided by the Company to the BV, and that this disparity could result in an IRS reallocation of income, in turn resulting in substantially greater taxes to the shareholders.  This argument, regardless of its accuracy, is irrelevant.  The fact that the Company could achieve greater distributions for its shareholders by redirecting the management fee does not alter the fact that the loss of Subchapter S status is injurious in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, we reject Chesterton's claim that the district court improperly restricted Chesterton's attempts to cross-examine the Company's tax expert regarding the nature and propriety of the management fee.  We review the district court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.  Stevens v. Bangor and Aroostook R.R. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197005\"><a href=\"/opinion/197005/stevens-v-bangor-and-aroostook/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 599 (1st Cir.1996).  The district court limited Chesterton's proffered examination because it found that the testimony was collateral to the main issues in the case.  The court also relied on the fact that for the years 1991 through 1993, the IRS had audited the Company's taxes and had made no adjustments or comments regarding the management fee.  Such a ruling was well within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Balance of Equities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final consideration regarding the propriety of injunctive relief is whether, on balance, the harm plaintiffs will suffer from the proposed transfers outweighs the harm that Chesterton will suffer if his transfers are enjoined.  The district court found that an injunction would not harm Chesterton because the proposed sales would do little to advance his efforts to sell the stock.  The court stated that, \"if [Chesterton] was unable to find a buyer for his shares in the Company, it strains logic to believe that he would be able to find a buyer for shares in [the shell corporations] when their primary assets are the very same shares he was previously unable to sell.\"   Chesterton claims that by transferring the shares to his shell corporations, he will somehow increase the liquidity of those shares.  The claim is counter-intuitive and no evidence was presented to support it.  On this record, the district court's finding that the potential harm to plaintiffs outweighs the harm to defendant was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III.

Chesterton argues that even if the district court properly determined that the Subchapter S election impliedly restricted the shareholders' rights to transfer their stock to a corporation, he is now entitled to notice and to the exercise of his dissenter's rights under 156B. He asserts that the district court's decision is the first notice of the restriction that he has had, and that under 156B he is now entitled to dissent from the restriction and enforce his appraisal rights.  Chesterton's claim to 156B appraisal rights fails for the same reason that his general 156B argument fails:  that provision is not triggered by this situation.  The district court correctly denied Chesterton's misdirected claim to 156B appraisal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is a drawback to Subchapter S status known as \"phantom income.\"   That phrase describes the liability that shareholders in an S corporation face for taxes on their share of the corporation's profits, even if those profits are not distributed to the shareholders as dividends.  Chesterton makes much of the fact that the Company's shareholders are subject to the risk of phantom income, but offered no evidence that the risk had materialized</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Chesterton points to testimony which showed that the Company currently has $16,000,000 in outstanding debt, that it has violated its loan agreements, and that in 1994 the Company needed to borrow money to pay dividends</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The affiliate BV is owned and operated by the same shareholders and Board of Directors as the Company</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Chesterton asserts that this management fee does not actually reflect the value of services provided to the BV by the Company.  He argues that because the Internal Revenue Service could reclassify the excess of the fee over the value of the services as dividends to the BV shareholders, this incongruity exposes the shareholders to increased tax liability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> None of Chesterton's fellow shareholders were willing to sell their stock and join him to offer a majority package</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Chesterton asserts that he had a potential buyer for an interest in his new corporations.  That buyer was an old friend of Chesterton's and the district court found this rationale to be a sham</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
