Richard and Mildred  Kerrigan appeal pro se\r                                                                         \r\n\nfrom district court orders enforcing Internal Revenue Service\r\n\n(\"IRS\") summonses.  We affirm.\r\n\n     The Kerrigans  argue that the summonses  were issued for\r\n\nimproper  purposes  and that  the  testimony  and other  data\r\n\nsought were already in  the possession of the IRS.   Contrary\r\n\nto the Kerrigans' suggestion, the fact of having been audited\r\n\nfor six and  a half  years is not,  by itself, sufficient  to\r\n\nraise  an inference  of bad  faith.   Moreover, we  think the\r\n\nKerrigans failed  to create a  substantial question regarding\r\n\ntheir allegation that the IRS already possessed everything it\r\n\nsought.   With the exception of third party bank records, the\r\n\nKerrigans  provided  no  specific   details  about  what  was\r\n\nprovided, by whom, and when.  \r\n\n     Nor do we think the fact that the revenue agent admitted\r\n\nto having bank records shows bad faith.  Cf. United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGroos Nat'l Bank  of San Antonio, 661  F.2d 36, 37 (5th  Cir.\r                                            \r\n\nUnit A Oct. 1981) (per curiam) (rejecting argument       that\r\n\nbecause the IRS already had some of the information it sought\r                                            \r\n\nin its  possession  the summonses  were  not issued  in  good\r\n\nfaith).   Rather,  at most,  it is a  reason to  restrict the\r\n\nscope  of the enforcement order.  See United States v. Davis,\r                                                                        \r\n\n636  F.2d 1028, 1037 (5th Cir.  Unit A Feb. 1981); cf. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Medlin, 986 F.2d  463 (11th Cir.  1993) (upholding\r                             \r\n\nenforcement order which  granted partial relief  by modifying\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe summons).   Here, the district  court limited enforcement\r\n\nof the  summons so as not to require the Kerrigans to provide\r\n\nthird party records already produced.\r\n\n     The  Kerrigans' remaining contentions are either waived,\r\n\nbecause they  are unaccompanied  by some effort  at developed\r\n\nargumentation,  or are  meritless.   We note,  in particular,\r\n\nthat the district court did not err in declining to entertain\r\n\nthe  Kerrigans'  counterclaim or  in denying  their discovery\r\n\nrequests.    Enforcement  proceedings  are  designed   to  be\r\n\nsummary.  See Donaldson  v. United States, 400 U.S.  517, 529\r                                                     \r\n\n(1971);  United States v.

Although the  Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure are\r\n\ngenerally applicable  to such  proceedings, courts  may limit\r\n\ntheir application  when to apply them  literally would impair\r\n\nthe summary  nature of the proceedings.   See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r                                                         \r\n\n81(a)(3); Alphin  v.

The Kerrigans' counterclaims  (assuming for the\r\n\nsake  of argument  that they  are viable) would  have greatly\r\n\nprolonged  the  proceedings,  and   there  was  no  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  in  declining to  entertain  them.   And,  having\r\n\nconcluded at  the hearing that the  Kerrigans' allegations of\r\n\nbad  faith largely  boiled down  to the  fact that  they have\r\n\n\"disagreements with the IRS\" (a conclusion we do not think is\r\n\nclearly erroneous), the court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n\nfailing to allow the discovery requests.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
