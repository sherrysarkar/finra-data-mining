His convictions\r\n\nstood, but we  held the court had  erred in finding  that his\r\n\nparticipation in  the conspiracy involved lasted  long enough\r\n\nto warrant  application of the Sentencing  Guidelines adopted\r\n\non  November 1, 1991.  United States  v. Twitty, 72 F.3d 228,\r                                                           \r\n\n232-34  (1st Cir.  1995).   The earlier Guidelines  were less\r\n\nsevere.   We  accordingly  remanded for  resentencing on  the\r\n\nearlier  version.  On remand,  the same judge,  by adopting a\r\n\ndifferent  calculation  for  Count I,  the  conspiracy count,\r\n\nreached the same sentence, and thence the original 97  months\r\n\ntotal.   We can  understand defendant's unhappiness  with the\r\n\nevaporation  of his  partial  victory.   However, we  affirm.\r\n\nMere appearances do not prevail over  established principles.\r\n\nSee United States v. Lombard, No. 96-1541, slip. op. at 12-13\r                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. Dec. 4, 1996).\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          At the first sentencing,  the court, believing that\r\n\nthe conspiracy  shown extended  beyond November 1,  1991, and\r\n\nadhering to  the rule that conspiracy should  be grouped with\r\n\nother counts  involving  its sole  object, U.S.S.G.    3D1.2,\r\n\nassigned thereto  Base Offense Level 14  pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2K2.1(a)(6) of the November 1991 Guidelines.  It then added\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfour sets of enhancements that brought defendant to Level 28,\r\n\nwhich with Criminal History Category II, produced a guideline\r\n\nrange of  87 to 108 months.   The court chose  97 months, the\r\n\nmiddle of the range, as the \"total punishment.\"  See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                \r\n\n  5G1.2  (providing a  mechanism  for  determining  a  \"total\r\n\npunishment\"  figure in  cases  with  convictions on  multiple\r\n\ncounts).   On this basis, the court sentenced defendant to 60\r\n\nmonths on  the conspiracy  count, the statutory  maximum, and\r\n\nthen imposed a consecutive sentence of 37 months on Count II.\r\n\nSee  United States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213, 215-17 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1994).  A  concurrent sentence of 37 months was  imposed on a\r\n\nthird count, leaving the total sentence at 97 months.\r\n\n          At resentencing, the Base  Offense Level dropped to\r\n\n6.   The court retained the  previous enhancements, resulting\r\n\nin an adjusted  level of 20 which this time  produced a 37 to\r\n\n46  month guideline range, well  under the 60 month statutory\r\n\nmaximum.    Explaining that  this  range  did not  adequately\r\n\nreflect the  magnitude  of  defendant's  conduct,  the  court\r\n\nproceeded to depart upward by adding  an additional 8 levels,\r\n\nending  up again  with an  87 to  108 month  guideline range.\r\n\nFrom  this it reimposed the 60 months on the first count, and\r\n\nthen effected a further upward departure by reimposing the 37\r\n\nmonth consecutive  sentence  on another  count, bringing  the\r\n\nultimate sentence again to 97 months.  It is to be noted that\r\n\nthe reaffirmed sentences  on Counts II and III were initially\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nimposed on the  basis of  the November  1990 guidelines,  and\r\n\nwere   appropriate  here,  assuming   the  additional  upward\r\n\ndeparture with respect to Count I.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          We start with the  general question. Defendant  has\r\n\ncited no authority for  the proposition that there can  be no\r\n\ngreater  sentence after  appeal, here  in effect  obtained by\r\n\nupward departure.    He might  have cited  North Carolina  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPearce,  where the  Court held  this to  be improper  after a\r                  \r\n\nsecond trial, if, as  here, there were no new  and subsequent\r\n\njustification for  so doing.   395 U.S.  711, 725-26  (1969).\r\n\nPearce  created a  presumption  of  vindictiveness,  viz.,  a\r                  \r\n\njudge's irritation at being reversed.  We have held, however,\r\n\nthat this presumption (and hence restriction) does not apply,\r\n\nfor  example,  when  the   two  proceedings  are  handled  by\r\n\ndifferent judges.  United  States v. Clark, 84 F.3d  506, 508\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir.), cert.  denied,      U.S.     ,  117 S.  Ct.  272\r                                      \r\n\n(1996).     Under   familiar   principles,  therefore,   that\r\n\ndefendant's present silence shows  he understands, he  should\r\n\nhave noted and invoked the presumption, if not when the court\r\n\nopened the  hearing, at least  when its action  presented the\r\n\nissue.  He did not.\r\n\n          We have no  doubt the  court, as a  court, had  the\r\n\ndiscretion  to  depart  upward  and  reimpose  the  97  month\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nsentence.   We  have previously  held that  when resentencing\r\n\nunder a multi-count conviction,\r\n\n          [C]ommon  sense  dictates that  the judge\r\n          should be free to  review the efficacy of\r\n          what  remains  in light  of  the original\r\n          sentencing plan, and  to reconstruct  the\r\n          sentencing   architecture   upon   remand\r\n          within   applicable   constitutional  and\r\n          statutory   limits,   if   that   appears\r\n          necessary in  order  to ensure  that  the\r\n          punishment still fits the crime.\r\n\nUnited States v. Dominguez, 951 F.2d 412, 416 (1st Cir. 1991)\r                                      \r\n\n(quoting United  States v.  Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d  9, 14\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. (1989) (en banc)).   The only  restrictions on the\r\n\ncourt when making an upward departure1 are that it adequately\r\n\nexplain its  decision and  that the departure  be reasonable.\r\n\nUnited States v. Rosales,  19 F.3d 763, 770 (1st  Cir. 1994);\r                                    \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Rivera,  994 F.2d  942,  946-47 (1st  Cir.\r                                     \r\n\n1993).   Here the court expressly  based the upward departure\r\n\non  the large number of  guns and the  endangerment of public\r\n\nsafety.  After review of the record, we have no basis to find\r\n\nthis unreasonable.\r\n\n          Defendant  also  complains  of \"double-dipping\"  in\r\n\nthat the upward departure  imposing an additional penalty for\r\n\nendangering public  safety2 was  anticipated by  and included\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Other  than vindictiveness,  presumed, North  Carolina v.\r                                                                      \r\nPearce, 395 U.S. 711 (1969), or proven.  See Wasman v. United\r                                                                         \r\nStates, 468 U.S. 559 (1984).\r                  \r\n\n2.  We  do  not  address  the three  level  upward  departure\r\nreflecting  the large number of guns involved as in his brief\r\ndefendant concedes that  apart from the  fact that the  exact\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nwithin the Guidelines and,  in any event, taken  into account\r\n\nby  the enhancements.   We disagree.   While it  is true that\r\n\nsome of the enhancements  reflected the fact that defendant's\r\n\nbehavior exceeded Guideline thresholds, the court determined,\r\n\nbased on  the entirety of defendant's  actions, i.e., putting\r\n\nat  least 225  serial  number obliterated  handguns onto  the\r\n\nstreets,  that  the thresholds  did not  go  far enough.   It\r\n\nconcluded  that this  is an  unusual case,  placing defendant\r\n\noutside  the heartland  of the  Guidelines and  allowing wide\r\n\ndiscretion  in upward departure.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 949\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1993).  We  can agree.   Moreover, in  Quinones we\r                                                                      \r\n\nnoted   that  \"appellate   review  of   a   district  court's\r\n\ndetermination that a case  is unusual, and therefore warrants\r\n\ndeparture,  must  take place  'with  full  awareness of,  and\r\n\nrespect  for, the trier's superior \"feel\" for the case.'\"  26\r\n\nF.3d  at 218  (quoting United  States v.  Diaz-Villafane, 874\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 43, 50  (1st Cir. 1989)).

Here the court expressly based the upward departure on the large number of guns and the endangerment of public safety.  After review of the record, we have no basis to find this unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also complains of \"double-dipping\" in that the upward departure imposing an additional penalty for endangering public safety<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> was anticipated by and included within the Guidelines and, in any event, taken into account by the enhancements.  We disagree.  While it is true that some of the enhancements reflected the fact that defendant's behavior exceeded Guideline thresholds, the court determined, based on the entirety of defendant's actions, i.e., putting at least 225 serial number obliterated handguns onto the streets, that the thresholds did not go far enough.  It concluded that this is an unusual case, placing defendant outside the heartland of the Guidelines and allowing wide discretion in upward departure.  See Rivera, 994 F.2d at 949 (1st Cir.1993).  We can agree.  Moreover, in Quinones we noted that \"appellate review of a district court's determination that a case is unusual, and therefore warrants departure, must take place 'with full awareness of, and respect for, the trier's superior \"feel\" for the case.' \"  26 F.3d at 218 (quoting United States v.

Twitty (hereinafter defendant), caught deep in the sale of illegal firearms, appealed following the imposition of a cumulative sentence of 97 months on three counts.  His convictions stood, but we held the court had erred in finding that his participation in the conspiracy involved lasted long enough to warrant application of the Sentencing Guidelines adopted on November 1, 1991.  United States v. Twitty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196496\"><a href=\"/opinion/196496/united-states-v-twitty/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 232-34 (1st Cir.1995).  The earlier Guidelines were less severe.  We accordingly remanded for resentencing on the earlier version.  On remand, the same judge, by adopting a different calculation for Count I, the conspiracy count, reached the same sentence, and thence the original 97 months total.  We can understand defendant's unhappiness with the evaporation of his partial victory.  However, we affirm.  Mere appearances do not prevail over established principles.  See United States v. Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197116\"><a href=\"/opinion/197116/united-states-v-lombard-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1996).I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first sentencing, the court, believing that the conspiracy shown extended beyond November 1, 1991, and adhering to the rule that conspiracy should be grouped with other counts involving its sole object, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2, assigned thereto Base Offense Level 14 pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a)(6) of the November 1991 Guidelines.  It then added four sets of enhancements that brought defendant to Level 28, which with Criminal History Category II, produced a guideline range of 87 to 108 months.  The court chose 97 months, the middle of the range, as the \"total punishment.\"   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2 (providing a mechanism for determining a \"total punishment\" figure in cases with convictions on multiple counts).  On this basis, the court sentenced defendant to 60 months on the conspiracy count, the statutory maximum, and then imposed a consecutive sentence of 37 months on Count II.  See United States v. Quinones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 215-17 (1st Cir.1994).  A concurrent sentence of 37 months was imposed on a third count, leaving the total sentence at 97 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At resentencing, the Base Offense Level dropped to 6. The court retained the previous enhancements, resulting in an adjusted level of 20 which this time produced a 37 to 46 month guideline range, well under the 60 month statutory maximum.  Explaining that this range did not adequately reflect the magnitude of defendant's conduct, the court proceeded to depart upward by adding an additional 8 levels, ending up again with an 87 to 108 month guideline range.  From this it reimposed the 60 months on the first count, and then effected a further upward departure by reimposing the 37 month consecutive sentence on another count, bringing the ultimate sentence again to 97 months.  It is to be noted that the reaffirmed sentences on Counts II and III were initially imposed on the basis of the November 1990 guidelines, and were appropriate here, assuming the additional upward departure with respect to Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the general question.  Defendant has cited no authority for the proposition that there can be no greater sentence after appeal, here in effect obtained by upward departure.  He might have cited North Carolina v. Pearce, where the Court held this to be improper after a second trial, if, as here, there were no new and subsequent justification for so doing.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 725-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span> (1969).  Pearce created a presumption of vindictiveness, viz., a judge's irritation at being reversed.  We have held, however, that this presumption (and hence restriction) does not apply, for example, when the two proceedings are handled by different judges.  United States v. Clark, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196789\"><a href=\"/opinion/196789/united-states-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span> (1996).  Under familiar principles, therefore, that defendant's present silence shows he understands, he should have noted and invoked the presumption, if not when the court opened the hearing, at least when its action presented the issue.  He did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt the court, as a court, had the discretion to depart upward and reimpose the 97 month sentence.  We have previously held that when resentencing under a multicount conviction,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>[C]ommon sense dictates that the judge should be free to review the efficacy of what remains in light of the original sentencing plan, and to reconstruct the sentencing architecture upon remand within applicable constitutional and statutory limits, if that appears necessary in order to ensure that the punishment still fits the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.
