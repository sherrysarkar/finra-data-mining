In  this  pro   se,  diversity  action,\r                            \r\n\nplaintiffs Ann and Joseph Adams advance a trio of tort claims\r\n\nagainst defendant  Dr. Larry  Stephenson.  Plaintiffs  are in\r\n\nthe  business of  preparing, editing  and  publishing medical\r\n\ntexts  and  periodicals,  often   under  the  auspices  of  a\r\n\nMassachusetts corporation (Adams  Publishing Group, Ltd.)  of\r\n\nwhich   plaintiff   Ann  Adams   is  the   sole  shareholder.\r\n\nDefendant,   having  worked   with   plaintiffs  on   earlier\r\n\noccasions, was engaged  to edit a  textbook published by  the\r\n\ncorporation in  1994.   The instant action  ensued when  that\r\n\nrelationship  soured.    After affording  plaintiffs  various\r\n\nopportunities  to  supplement their  pleadings,  the district\r\n\ncourt dismissed all claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for\r\n\nfailure to state a claim.  We affirm.\r\n\n     It  is   true,  as  plaintiffs  observe,   that  pro  se\r\n\ncomplaints  are accorded  \"an  extra degree  of  solicitude.\"\r\n\nRodi v. Ventetuolo,  941 F.2d 22, 23 (1st Cir.  1991).  It is\r                              \r\n\nalso  true  that,  at  least in  complex  litigation,  courts\r\n\n\"normally hesitate\"  to dismiss under Rule  12(b)(6) prior to\r\n\ndiscovery,  when  \"a  party  may not  have  all  the  facts.\"\r\n\nResolution Trust Corp. v. Driscoll, 985 F.2d 44, 48 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1993).  Yet even a pro se plaintiff is required \"to set forth\r\n\nfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting\r\n\neach material  element necessary  to  sustain recovery  under\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nsome actionable legal  theory.\"  Gooley  v. Mobil Oil  Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n851 F.2d 513,  515 (1st  Cir. 1988); accord,  e.g., Dewey  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nUniversity  of New Hampshire, 694  F.2d 1, 3  (1st Cir. 1982)\r                                        \r\n\n(it is \"not enough  to allege a general scenario  which could\r\n\nbe dominated by unpleaded facts\"; instead, the claim must \"at\r\n\nleast    set   forth    minimal    facts,   not    subjective\r\n\ncharacterizations, as to who did what to whom and why\").  The\r\n\ndemands  on  the  pleader   are  not  onerous:  dismissal  is\r\n\nappropriate at this stage only if \"a lenient construction [of\r\n\nthe complaint]  demonstrates beyond doubt  that the plaintiff\r\n\ncan prove no set of facts to support [the] claim for relief.\"\r\n\nRockwell v. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 260 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                      \r\n\nYet \"minimal  requirements are not tantamount  to nonexistent\r\n\nrequirements\"; \"[t]he threshold [for  stating a claim] may be\r\n\nlow, but  it is  real.\"   Gooley, 851 F.2d  at 514;  see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nGlassman v. Computervision  Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 628 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1996).   Having exercised de  novo review, we  agree with the\r                                              \r\n\ndistrict  court  that, even  with  all reasonable  inferences\r\n\ndrawn  in their  favor, plaintiffs'  amended  complaint fails\r\n\nunder these standards.\r\n\n     The  claim  of   interference  with  contractual  rights\r\n\nrequires   little   comment.     See,   e.g.,   Draghetti  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nChmielewski, 416  Mass. 808, 816 (1994)  (listing elements of\r                       \r\n\nclaim).   Defendant  is  alleged to  have induced  his former\r\n\nattorney  to disclose  proprietary information  pertaining to\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nplaintiffs'   business   affairs,    in   violation   of    a\r\n\nconfidentiality  agreement reached  in an  earlier, unrelated\r\n\nlawsuit between  plaintiffs and an  individual represented by\r\n\nthat  same attorney.    Plaintiffs were  directed to  submit,\r\n\nunder seal,  a description of the  information that allegedly\r\n\nhad been disclosed.   They claim  to have  done so; they  did\r\n\nnot.  Their submission  recited the confidentiality provision\r\n\nin  the   agreement  but   failed  to  identify   any  actual\r\n\ninformation that  was divulged.   The resulting  dismissal of\r\n\nthis claim was therefore fully justified. \r\n\n     Plaintiffs' \"defamation\"  claim  is subject  to  several\r\n\nalternative   constructions.     To  the   extent   they  are\r\n\ncomplaining of having been  personally libeled, we agree with\r\n\nthe  district court  that defendant's  March 19,  1996 letter\r\n\n\"was not reasonably susceptible of a defamatory connotation.\"\r\n\nDulgarian  v.  Stone, 420  Mass.  843,  848 (1995)  (internal\r                                \r\n\nquotation  omitted).   Indeed,  that  letter  (which cited  a\r\n\n\"controversy\"  over  the  rights  to the  textbook)  made  no\r\n\nmention of plaintiffs at  all; it referred only to  the Adams\r\n\ncorporation, which owned  the rights to the publication.   We\r\n\nnote in addition that, to the extent plaintiffs are advancing\r\n\na  claim  of   business  defamation,  they  lack   individual\r\n\nstanding.     Such  a  claim   would  belong  to   the  Adams\r\n\ncorporation,  notwithstanding  Ms.   Adams'  status  as  sole\r\n\nshareholder.   See,  e.g., Willis  v. Lipton,  947  F.2d 998,\r                                                        \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n1001-02  (1st  Cir. 1991);  Alford  v.  Frontier Enterprises,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 599 F.2d 483, 484  (1st Cir. 1979).  A  corporation, of\r                \r\n\ncourse,  may be represented in  court only by  counsel.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., American Metals Service  Export Co. v. Ahrens Aircraft,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 666 F.2d 718, 719 n.2 (1st Cir. 1981).  We fail to see,\r                \r\n\nin any  event, how  defendant's reference to  a \"controversy\"\r\n\ncould be  deemed defamatory--to either the  plaintiffs or the\r\n\ncorporation.\r\n\n     The defamation  claim might also be construed as one for\r\n\n\"injurious falsehood,\" see, e.g., Dulgarian, 420 Mass. at 852\r                                                       \r\n\n(quoting Restatement  (Second) of  Torts   623A  (1977)), or,\r\n\nmore particularly,  a category  thereof known as  \"slander of\r\n\ntitle,\"  see,  e.g.,  37  Joseph  Nolan  &amp;  Laurie  Sartorio,\r                               \r\n\nMassachusetts Practice--Tort  Law     132-33  (1989)  (citing\r                                             \r\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts, supra,   624); Fischer  v. Bar\r                                                                         \r\n\nHarbor  Banking  and Trust  Co., 857  F.2d  4, 7-8  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1988); Erikson  v.  O'Brien, 362  Mass. 876  (1972).   Again,\r                                       \r\n\nhowever, because the copyright to the textbook is held by the\r\n\nAdams corporation (rather than by plaintiffs personally), any\r\n\nsuch  claim  would  belong  to the  corporation.    Moreover,\r\n\nplaintiffs have made no  allegation that special damages were\r\n\nsustained--a necessary  element of  the offense.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nSharratt  v. Housing  Innovations, Inc.,  365 Mass.  141, 148\r                                                   \r\n\n(1974); Gott v. Pulsifer, 122 Mass. 235, 238 (1877); 37 Nolan\r                                    \r\n\n&amp; Sartorio, supra,   132, at 223-24.\r                             \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     Plaintiffs'   remaining  claim--for   interference  with\r\n\nadvantageous  business  relationships--falters  for much  the\r\n\nsame reasoning.   See, e.g.,  Swanset Dev. Corp.  v. City  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nTaunton,  423  Mass. 390,  397  (1996)  (listing elements  of\r                   \r\n\nclaim).   To  the  extent they  are  complaining of  business\r\n\nopportunities lost by the  Adams corporation, they again lack\r\n\nstanding.  The amended complaint is devoid of any description\r\n\nof plaintiffs'  personal business pursuits, much  less of how\r\n\nsuch pursuits may have  been affected by defendant's actions.\r\n\nNor have  plaintiffs made  any reference to  actual damages--\r\n\ni.e.,  the \"loss  of  advantage directly  resulting from  the\r\n\ndefendant's conduct,\" Elm Medical  Lab., Inc. v. RKO General,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 403 Mass. 779, 787 (1989)--which is a necessary element\r                \r\n\nof such  a claim, see, e.g.,  Sharratt, 365 Mass. at  148; 37\r                                                  \r\n\nNolan &amp; Sartorio, supra,   98, at 133.\r                                   \r\n\n     For   these  reasons,  we   conclude  that  the  amended\r\n\ncomplaint fails to  state a  claim upon which  relief can  be\r\n\ngranted.  Plaintiffs' motion  to strike transcripts comes too\r\n\nlate and is therefore  denied.  Defendant's motion  to strike\r                                         \r\n\nappendix is denied as moot.\r                              \r\n\n     Affirmed.                                \r                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

The resulting  dismissal of\r\n\nthis claim was therefore fully justified. \r\n\n     Plaintiffs' \"defamation\"  claim  is subject  to  several\r\n\nalternative   constructions.
