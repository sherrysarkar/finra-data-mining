Michael  A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Charles W. Groce, III for appellant.\r\n   Kevin O'Regan, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 16, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  After a five-day jury trial,\r\ndefendant-appellant Ramon Pena was found guilty of having violated\r\n21 U.S.C.  841(a), which makes it unlawful \"knowingly or\r\nintentionally . . . [to] manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or\r\npossess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a\r\ncontrolled substance.\"  Pena challenges (1) the district court's\r\nfailure to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment, and (2)\r\nthe court's denial of his motion for acquittal as a matter of law\r\nbased on the entrapment defense.  We reject both arguments, and\r\ntherefore affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\n             Factual and Procedural Background\r\nPena, a native of the Dominican Republic, emigrated to\r\nPuerto Rico in 1985, leaving behind a wife and five children.  In\r\n1989, he moved to New York City, and in 1992, he relocated to\r\nSpringfield, Massachusetts.\r\nUpon arriving in Springfield, Pena began to work at a\r\nconvenience store.  During this time, he sent funds to support his\r\nfamily in the Dominican Republic.  After about eight months, Pena\r\nwas injured in an automobile accident which left him unable to\r\nwork.  He soon began to use marijuana and to traffic in controlled\r\nsubstances.  \r\nIn July, 1995, Pena pleaded guilty to various drug-\r\nrelated state offenses, as well as two counts of illegal possession\r\nof a firearm.  He served two years in prison in Ludlow,\r\nMassachusetts.  Pena's I-551 Permanent Resident Card (commonly\r\ncalled a \"green card\") and all of his possessions were seized upon\r\narrest.\r\nAfter his release from prison in July 1997, Pena moved in\r\nwith his nephew in Springfield -- an apparent drug dealer -- and\r\nbegan to search for a job.  According to Pena, because he was\r\nunable to reclaim his green card upon release, he was limited to\r\nmenial employment.  Pena ultimately found work as a welder, earning\r\napproximately $150.00 per week.  He sent about $100.00 to his wife\r\nand children in the Dominican Republic each week after he had\r\nattempted, unsuccessfully, to bring them to the United States in\r\norder to alleviate their financial difficulties.\r\nBecause Pena's claim of entitlement to a jury instruction\r\non entrapment requires us to view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the defendant, see, e.g., United States v. Gamache,\r\n156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) -- and because, as described below,\r\nour resolution of that claim renders further inquiry unnecessary --\r\nthe following account of the events leading to Pena's conviction is\r\ntaken entirely from Pena's own testimony.  \r\nDuring the summer of 1997, while walking to work, Pena\r\nencountered Julia Cruz, who lived on the corner of his street. \r\nUnbeknownst to Pena, Cruz was a confidential government informant. \r\nDuring their first meeting, Cruz never broached the subjects of\r\ndrugs or drug sales.  Asked at trial whether he told Cruz anything\r\nabout himself at that point, Pena testified that \"[a]ll I just told\r\nher was that I was looking for a [better] job and that I needed my\r\ngreen card, that I hadn't gotten it back from the police and that\r\nI was looking for a job.  I needed it because I needed to help my\r\nfamily because I had been in jail . . . two years.\"  \r\nThe next time the two met, Cruz asked Pena into her\r\nhouse, where she told him that she was hoping to \"sell drugs for a\r\nDominican\" and that \"she wanted to get drugs [to] sell.\"  Pena\r\n\"told her that [he] wasn't involved in that, that [he] wasn't going\r\nto do that,\" and that he \"had been in jail . . . [and as a result]\r\nwas going to do something else [for a living].\"\r\nCruz and Pena continued to exchange pleasantries as Pena\r\nwalked to work each day.  Finally, Cruz again invited Pena into her\r\nhome.  There, she \"told [Pena] she wanted [him] to help her,\" and\r\nasked whether he had \"some friends out there who sell drugs[.]\" \r\nPena told her that he \"had a friend [who worked with drugs] but\r\n[again said] that [he] wasn't . . . going to do that anymore.\" \r\nNonetheless, Pena did contact Omar Almanso, a friend from prison\r\nwho, after his release, had resumed his commerce in illegal drugs. \r\nAlmanso refused to deal with Cruz.  Cruz then suggested to Pena\r\nthat they could both make money if Pena would help her sell drugs\r\ninstead.  Pena testified that Cruz did not threaten him in any way.\r\nPena agreed to help her.  When asked to explain his\r\ndecision, Pena testified at trial that \"[e]ach time I called [my\r\nfamily] I wouldn't be able to help my children.  I didn't have any\r\nwork to help them buy their books, to buy what they needed, and so\r\nthey had to use borrowed books for school.\"   \r\nTwo weeks later, Cruz hailed Pena as he walked past her\r\nhome.  She told him that she needed to speak with him about\r\nsomething \"urgent.\"  Cruz told Pena \"she had a customer for [him]\r\nwho had been a customer of hers before, and that [Pena and Cruz]\r\ncould sell to him and that [Pena] should go and that [they] would\r\nboth earn something from it.\"  In fact, Cruz's \"buyer\" was Agent\r\nJohn Jusino of the Chicopee, Massachusetts Police Department. Pena\r\nwent to Almanso, who sold him one hundred (100) bags of heroin for\r\n$500.00.  Pena and Cruz agreed to resell the heroin for $650.00. \r\nThis price included a $100.00 profit for Pena and a $50.00 profit\r\nfor Cruz.\r\nOn October 6, 1997, Cruz called Pena to tell him that her\r\n\"buyer\" would meet them the next day and that Pena should come to\r\nher house so that the two could go together to make the sale.  On\r\nOctober 7, Pena walked to Cruz's house, and the two then drove to\r\nmeet Jusino.  During their meeting, Jusino told Pena that in\r\naddition to heroin, he was also interested in buying cocaine.  Pena\r\nreplied that he had a friend from whom he could obtain cocaine. \r\nThe two executed the sale.  Pena kept his $100.00 profit and gave\r\n$50.00 to Julia.\r\nFollowing the initial meeting with Jusino, Pena obtained\r\na beeper to facilitate subsequent sales.  Pena and Jusino met five\r\nmore times, during which the former sold the latter heroin and, on\r\none occasion, crack cocaine.  Pena and Cruz divided the proceeds of\r\nall six sales.  Almanso supplied Pena with almost all of the drugs\r\nPena sold, but on one occasion, Pena obtained heroin from the\r\nnephew with whom he was living.\r\nDuring his meetings with Jusino, Pena spoke knowledgeably\r\nabout the various drugs his supplier offered.  He told Jusino that\r\nhe could obtain heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine.  Asked at trial\r\nhow he knew about these drugs, Pena replied that Almanso \"had all\r\nof those and thought that [Pena] might need to sell [them] to [his]\r\ncustomers.\"  On one occasion, when Jusino questioned the quality\r\nof the heroin, Pena admits that he replied, \"No, no, no, this is\r\ngood.  My bosses can't handle all the orders. . . .  This is good\r\nand guaranteed, you're going to call again.\"\r\nDuring their sixth and final meeting, Jusino arrested\r\nPena.  Pena was tried and convicted on five counts of having sold\r\ncontrolled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841.  This\r\nappeal followed.                              II.\r\n                         Discussion\r\nPena argues first that he was entitled to acquittal, as\r\na matter of law, based upon the entrapment defense, and second that\r\neven if he was not so entitled, the district court erred in\r\nrefusing to instruct the jury on that defense. \r\nBoth of Pena's claims hinge on the particular elements of\r\nthe entrapment defense.  \"[A] valid entrapment defense has two\r\nrelated elements: government inducement of the crime, and a lack of\r\npredisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the\r\ncriminal conduct.\" Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63\r\n(1988); see also United States v. Acosta, 67 F.3d 334, 337 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) (\"The legal tests for entrapment are well established. \r\nWhat is required is (1) that the government induce the offense and\r\n(2) that the defendant not be predisposed to commit it.\"); United\r\nStates v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994); United States\r\nv. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982, 988 (1st Cir. 1990).  Even if Pena's\r\ntestimony were assumed to be entirely truthful, he has failed to\r\nstate facts sufficient to satisfy the \"inducement\" prong.  We\r\ntherefore affirm the district court's rulings.\r\nA.  Pena's Entitlement to an Entrapment Instruction\r\nBefore discussing the merits of Pena's claim, we first\r\naddress the legal standards involved.  In evaluating a district\r\ncourt's refusal to instruct the jury as to the entrapment defense,\r\nthe question we must ask is whether the defendant has put forth\r\nevidence which, if viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\ndefense, could prompt a reasonable juror to find that both prongs\r\nof the entrapment test have been met.  See, e.g., Gamache, 156 F.3d\r\nat 9 (concluding that a defendant is \"entitled to an instruction on\r\nhis theory of defense so long as the theory is a valid one and\r\nthere is evidence in the record to support it\"); United States v.\r\nHernandez, 995 F.2d 307, 313 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that in order\r\nto merit an entrapment instruction, a defendant must \"produce[]\r\nsome evidence -- on both elements of the entrapment defense --\r\nsufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he was\"\r\nentrapped); United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 814 (1st Cir.\r\n1988) (requiring \"hard evidence\" supporting both prongs).  The\r\ninitial burden of producing evidence sufficient to establish the\r\ntwo entrapment prongs falls on the defendant.  \"If an accused\r\nsuggests that entrapment belongs in the case, it seems not unfair\r\nto expect him to point to a modicum of evidence supportive of his\r\nsuggestion.  The alternative -- that the prosecution be forced to\r\ndisprove entrapment in every case -- seems plainly unacceptable.\" \r\nRodriguez, 858 F.2d at 813-14; see also United States v. Coady, 809\r\nF.2d 119, 121 (1st Cir. 1987); Kadis v. United States, 484 F.2d\r\n370, 374 (1967).  The issue, then, turns on the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence put forth by the defense.  See Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814\r\n(\"[T]he accused's burden is measured by the . . . sufficiency-of-\r\nthe-evidence yardstick.\"). \r\nAlthough the requisites for entitlement to an entrapment\r\ninstruction are far from taxing, a defendant's threshold burden\r\ncannot be met by conclusory assertions alone; only \"hard evidence\r\nin the record which, if believed by a rational juror, would suffice\r\nto create a reasonable doubt as to whether government actors\r\ninduced the defendant to perform a criminal act that he was not\r\npredisposed to commit\" will suffice.  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 814\r\n(emphasis added); see also United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467\r\n(emphasizing the defendant's \"'entry-level burden' of showing that\r\n'the record, viewed most charitably to the proponent of the\r\ninstruction, furnishes an arguable basis' for an assertion of the\r\ndefense.\" (quoting Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812-13)).  The evidence\r\nneed not be \"'so substantial to require, if uncontroverted, a\r\ndirected verdict of acquittal [but] it must be more than a mere\r\nscintilla.'\"  Pratt, 913 F.2d at 988 (quoting Kadis, 373 F.2d at\r\n374); see also Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467; Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814. \r\nWhere the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\ndefendant, fail to satisfy the legal requisites for the entrapment\r\ndefense, no instruction is warranted.\r\nIn light of these standards, we review the decision below\r\nde novo:  \"The existence or nonexistence of the required quantity\r\nof evidence in a given case is a matter of law for the court, and\r\nthus our review is plenary, reading the record evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the defense.\"  United States v. Young, 78\r\nF.3d 758, 760 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814. \r\n1.  The Inducement Prong\r\nAs stated above, a defendant who asserts the entrapment\r\ndefense must first prove that the government \"induced\" his criminal\r\nconduct.  \"[I]nducement requires something more than that a\r\ngovernment agent or informant suggested the crime and provided the\r\noccasion for it.  Rather, inducement 'consists of [providing] an\r\n\"opportunity\" plus something else -- typically, excessive pressure\r\nby the government . . . or the government's taking advantage' of\r\nthe defendant in an improper way.\"  Acosta, 67 F.3d at 337 (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955 (1st Cir. 1994)); see also\r\nYoung, 78 F.3d at 761; Pratt, 913 F.2d at 988 (\"[The] defendant\r\nmust make a showing 'that a government agent turned him from a\r\nrighteous path to an iniquitous one.'\" (quoting Coady, 809 F.2d at\r\n122)).\r\n  It is well established that\r\n  it is proper (i.e., not an \"inducement\") for\r\nthe government to use a \"sting,\" at least\r\nwhere it amounts to providing a defendant with\r\nan \"opportunity\" to commit a crime.  Without\r\nthis kind of law enforcement weapon, it would\r\noften prove difficult, or impossible, to stop\r\ncertain seriously criminal activity,\r\nparticularly activity involving drugs, or\r\ncorruption, or other crimes in which no direct\r\nparticipant wants the crime detected.\r\nGendron, 18 F.3d at 961 (internal citations omitted); see also\r\nMathews v. United States, 486 U.S. 58, 66 (1988) (\"[E]vidence that\r\nGovernment agents merely afforded an opportunity or facilities for\r\nthe commission of the crime would be insufficient to warrant [an\r\nentrapment] instruction.\"); Pratt, 913 F.2d at 989 (\"The fact that\r\n[a government agent] put up the pretense of being a drug dealer,\r\nand solicited [defendant's] business, does not, without more, make\r\nthe government's involvement rise to the level of entrapment.\");\r\nCoady, 809 F.2d at 122 (finding no improper inducement where\r\ngovernment agent merely \"created a criminal opportunity by asking\r\n[defendant] to involve himself, and sweetened the pot with an offer\r\nof payment\").  \r\nIn order for a sting to constitute entrapment, then, the\r\ngovernment must engage in some kind of coercion -- the \"something\r\nelse\" alluded to in Acosta.  In Gendron, we reviewed examples of\r\nconduct that courts had considered \"improper.\"  Inducement was\r\nfound\r\n  where government officials: (1) used\r\n\"intimidation\" and \"threats\" against a\r\ndefendant's family; (2) called every day,\r\n\"began threatening\" the defendant, and were\r\nbelligerent; (3) engaged in a \"forceful\"\r\nsolicitation and \"dogged\" insistence until\r\n[defendant] capitulated\"; (4) played upon\r\ndefendant's sympathy for informant's common\r\nnarcotics experience and withdrawal symptoms;\r\n(5) played upon sentiment on \"one former war\r\nbuddy . . . for another\" to get liquor (during\r\nprohibition); (6) used \"repeated suggestions\r\nwhich succeeded only when defendant had lost\r\nhis job and needed money for his family's food\r\nand rent; (7) told defendant that she (the\r\nagent) was suicidal and in desperate need of\r\nmoney.\r\n\nGendron, 18 F.3d at 961-62 (internal citations omitted); see also\r\nAcosta, 67 F.3d at 338 (requiring evidence of threats, \"improper\r\nappeals to sympathy, promises of extravagant reward, or . . .\r\nrelentless and extreme trickery\"); Gifford, 17 F.3d at 468 (noting\r\nthat inducement involves \"pleading with a defendant,\" \"using\r\ninherently coercive tactics,\" or \"arm-twisting based on need,\r\nsympathy, friendship, or the like\").  \r\nIn light of the principles governing the entrapment\r\ndefense and of these examples of governmental overreaching, we\r\ndirect our inquiry to whether Pena offered evidence sufficient to\r\nmandate an entrapment instruction to the jury.  We conclude that he\r\ndid not.\r\nPena's entrapment defense is based on the following\r\nassertions:  Cruz befriended him, mentioning on their first meeting\r\nthat she was looking to procure drugs for resale.  Pena told her he\r\nwas not involved in such matters.  When, on a later visit, she\r\nasked him whether she might obtain drugs from a friend of his, he\r\nagreed to inquire.  That friend declined, but when Cruz then asked\r\nPena to sell narcotics as her partner, he agreed -- without any\r\ncoercion whatsoever -- and proceeded to engage in a total of six\r\nsales before his arrest.  Asked why he assented to Cruz's offer,\r\nPena cited only his children's need for new, rather than borrowed,\r\nbooks.  \r\nThese facts simply could not support a finding of\r\nimproper \"inducement.\"  Cruz and Agent Jusino did, of course,\r\nprovide Pena with an opportunity to commit the crimes for which he\r\nwas convicted.  But as we have stated, such behavior does not,\r\nabsent further coercion, constitute inducement.  Pena describes no\r\nsuch coercion here.  The activities in which Cruz and Jusino\r\nengaged fail even arguably to match the examples of misconduct\r\ncited in Gendron.  No witness testified that either Cruz or Jusino\r\nemployed \"intimidation\" or \"threats,\" that either played upon\r\nPena's common narcotics experiences or any other form of sentiment,\r\nor that either told Pena they were suicidal and in desperate need\r\nof drugs or money.  See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961-62.  Even those\r\ncases cited in Gendron which bear some resemblance to the facts\r\nbefore us differ in critical respects.  Pena's testimony contained\r\nno support for a finding that the government made \"repeated\r\nsuggestions\" that he could earn money by dealing drugs.  See\r\nGendron, 18 F. 3d at 961; see also Acosta, 67 F.3d at 338 (finding\r\nthat entrapment instruction would be required when government\r\nperpetrated a \"campaign of persistent [telephone] calls\" in its\r\nattempt to lure defendant into committing an offense\").  In fact,\r\nPena testified that although he initially expressed a hesitance to\r\nbecome involved in drugs, when Cruz actually suggested at a later\r\ndate that the two could make money by selling narcotics together,\r\nhe agreed without resisting.  Moreover, there is no hint that Cruz\r\n\"called [Pena] every day, 'began threatening' [him], and [was]\r\nbelligerent.\"  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961 (citing United States v.\r\nGroll, 992 F.2d 755, 759 (7th Cir. 1993)).  Individually, the\r\nGendron examples each evidence far more coercive government\r\nactivity than was present in this case; collectively, they\r\ndemonstrate that even as Pena states the facts, the government's\r\nactivities could not be held to constitute improper inducement.\r\nThe facts of Pena's case fall much closer to those in\r\nUnited States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758 (1st Cir. 1996).  Defendant\r\nYoung claimed he had met and become friendly with one Al Hendricks\r\nwhile both were enrolled in a narcotics detoxification program. \r\nHendricks insisted upon talking about drugs both during the program\r\nand after its termination.  Hendricks ultimately told Young that he\r\nwanted to obtain certain controlled substances, and Young agreed to\r\nsupply him.  The two agreed that they would together purchase and\r\nresell heroin.  But unbeknownst to Young, Hendricks had become a\r\ngovernment informant, and the \"buyer\" Hendricks \"found\" was a DEA\r\nagent.  Upon making the sale, Young was arrested.  See id. at 759.\r\nAt Young's trial, the district court refused to instruct\r\nthe jury on the entrapment defense.  Young appealed.  See id. at\r\n760.  We affirmed, finding that Young \"never testified that\r\nHendricks used [their] friendship as leverage constituting the\r\n'opportunity plus something else' legally required for a finding of\r\ninducement,\" or that Hendricks otherwise pressured him.  Id. at\r\n762.\r\nPena's case largely mirrors Young's.  Cruz befriended\r\nPena, as Hendricks had befriended Young.  Cruz and Pena discussed\r\ndrugs.  Ultimately, Cruz proposed that she and Pena together sell\r\ndrugs to a buyer who was, in fact, a government agent -- just as\r\nHendricks had proposed to Young.  Neither Pena nor Young testified\r\nthat the informant took advantage of any bond of friendship in\r\nencouraging the sale.  Like Young, Pena cannot claim that he was\r\n\"induced\" by a government informant's actions.  We conclude here,\r\nas we did in Young, that \"[t]here was no testimony or other\r\nevidence, let alone 'hard evidence,' of coercion or intimidation.\" \r\nId. at 761.     \r\nFurthermore, we are unpersuaded by Pena's contention that\r\nhis family's financial needs transformed what would have been a\r\npermissible government operation into illegal entrapment.  First,\r\nit is far from clear that Pena presented sufficient evidence to\r\nground a belief that the government was even aware of those\r\nfinancial needs.  The entirety of the testimony offered on this\r\nmatter was the following exchange between Pena and his counsel\r\nconcerning Pena's first meeting with Cruz:\r\n  Q:  Well, did you tell her anything about\r\nyourself that particular . . . time?\r\n\n  A:  All I just told her was that I was looking\r\nfor a job and that I needed my green card,\r\nthat I hadn't gotten it back from the police\r\nand that I was looking for a job.  I needed it\r\nbecause I needed to help my family because I\r\nhad been in jail in Ludlow two years.\r\nAlthough Pena testified more specifically at trial about his\r\nfamily's financial circumstances, he never testified that he had\r\ninformed Cruz of these circumstances.  Pena's family's hardship\r\ncould not be found to contribute to an entrapment finding if the\r\ngovernment was not even aware of that hardship during its\r\nundercover operation.\r\nEven if the government had been aware of Pena's financial\r\nsituation, however, such hardship does not have the legal effect\r\nPena suggests.  Pena's argument rests on his contention that he\r\nagreed to sell drugs with Cruz only because he \"didn't have any\r\nwork to help [his children] buy their books, to buy what they\r\nneeded, and so they had to use borrowed books for school.\"  But as\r\nwe stated in United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256 (1st Cir.\r\n1992), \"[e]ntrapment does not blossom whenever a person succumbs to\r\nhis own greed or to the lure of easy money.\"  Id. at 259 (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 121 (1st Cir. 1987)). \r\nAlthough one could be sympathetic to Pena if his children had been\r\nin a dire situation, their need for new, rather than borrowed,\r\nbooks is hardly sufficient to establish \"inducement\" where none\r\nexisted otherwise.\r\n2.  The Predisposition Prong\r\nBecause we find no improper inducement, we need not\r\ndetermine whether Pena was predisposed to commit the crimes in\r\nquestion.  The government argues that the evidence regarding\r\npredisposition was such that the entrapment defense would fail as\r\na matter of law on that ground alone.  But the district court did\r\nnot appear to rely on this ground, and, in light of Pena's failure\r\nto meet the requirements of the \"inducement\" prong, we need not do\r\nso either.  Pena's inability to raise evidence sufficient to ground\r\na finding of improper inducement alone rendered a jury instruction\r\non the entrapment defense inappropriate.  \r\nB.  Entrapment as Matter of Law\r\nIn ascertaining whether a defendant established\r\nentrapment as a matter of law, we review the record de novo, see\r\nUnited States v. Ellis, 168 F. 3d 558, 561 (1st Cir. 1999), to\r\ndetermine whether it contains \"undisputed facts\" demonstrating\r\nentrapment.  Tzimopoulos v. United States, 554 F.2d 1216, 1217 (1st\r\nCir. 1977); see also Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 554\r\n(1992).  Having found that Pena has failed to present evidence even\r\npermitting a finding of improper inducement, we naturally decline\r\nto find that the same evidence required such a finding.  For the\r\nreasons described in Part II.A, supra, Pena has not established\r\nentrapment as a matter of law.\r\n                            III.\r\n                         Conclusion\r\nPena failed to introduce evidence sufficient to ground a\r\nfinding that he was \"induced\" to commit the offenses underlying his\r\nconvictions.  For this reason, the district court properly refused\r\nto instruct the jury on the entrapment defense and properly denied\r\nPena's claim of entrapment as a matter of law.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

After a five-day jury trial,\r\ndefendant-appellant Ramon Pena was found guilty of having violated\r\n21 U.S.C.  841(a), which makes it unlawful \"knowingly or\r\nintentionally . . . [to] manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or\r\npossess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a\r\ncontrolled substance.\"  Pena challenges (1) the district court's\r\nfailure to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment, and (2)\r\nthe court's denial of his motion for acquittal as a matter of law\r\nbased on the entrapment defense.  We reject both arguments, and\r\ntherefore affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\n             Factual and Procedural Background\r\nPena, a native of the Dominican Republic, emigrated to\r\nPuerto Rico in 1985, leaving behind a wife and five children.  In\r\n1989, he moved to New York City, and in 1992, he relocated to\r\nSpringfield, Massachusetts.\r\nUpon arriving in Springfield, Pena began to work at a\r\nconvenience store.  During this time, he sent funds to support his\r\nfamily in the Dominican Republic.  After about eight months, Pena\r\nwas injured in an automobile accident which left him unable to\r\nwork.  He soon began to use marijuana and to traffic in controlled\r\nsubstances.  \r\nIn July, 1995, Pena pleaded guilty to various drug-\r\nrelated state offenses, as well as two counts of illegal possession\r\nof a firearm.  He served two years in prison in Ludlow,\r\nMassachusetts.  Pena's I-551 Permanent Resident Card (commonly\r\ncalled a \"green card\") and all of his possessions were seized upon\r\narrest.\r\nAfter his release from prison in July 1997, Pena moved in\r\nwith his nephew in Springfield -- an apparent drug dealer -- and\r\nbegan to search for a job.  According to Pena, because he was\r\nunable to reclaim his green card upon release, he was limited to\r\nmenial employment.  Pena ultimately found work as a welder, earning\r\napproximately $150.00 per week.  He sent about $100.00 to his wife\r\nand children in the Dominican Republic each week after he had\r\nattempted, unsuccessfully, to bring them to the United States in\r\norder to alleviate their financial difficulties.\r\nBecause Pena's claim of entitlement to a jury instruction\r\non entrapment requires us to view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the defendant, see, e.g., United States v. Gamache,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198087\"><a href=\"/opinion/198087/united-states-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) -- and because, as described below,\r\nour resolution of that claim renders further inquiry unnecessary --\r\nthe following account of the events leading to Pena's conviction is\r\ntaken entirely from Pena's own testimony.  \r\nDuring the summer of 1997, while walking to work, Pena\r\nencountered Julia Cruz, who lived on the corner of his street. \r\nUnbeknownst to Pena, Cruz was a confidential government informant. \r\nDuring their first meeting, Cruz never broached the subjects of\r\ndrugs or drug sales.  Asked at trial whether he told Cruz anything\r\nabout himself at that point, Pena testified that \"[a]ll I just told\r\nher was that I was looking for a [better] job and that I needed my\r\ngreen card, that I hadn't gotten it back from the police and that\r\nI was looking for a job.  I needed it because I needed to help my\r\nfamily because I had been in jail . . . two years.\"  \r\nThe next time the two met, Cruz asked Pena into her\r\nhouse, where she told him that she was hoping to \"sell drugs for a\r\nDominican\" and that \"she wanted to get drugs [to] sell.\"  Pena\r\n\"told her that [he] wasn't involved in that, that [he] wasn't going\r\nto do that,\" and that he \"had been in jail . . . [and as a result]\r\nwas going to do something else [for a living].\"\r\nCruz and Pena continued to exchange pleasantries as Pena\r\nwalked to work each day.  Finally, Cruz again invited Pena into her\r\nhome.  There, she \"told [Pena] she wanted [him] to help her,\" and\r\nasked whether he had \"some friends out there who sell drugs[.]\" \r\nPena told her that he \"had a friend [who worked with drugs] but\r\n[again said] that [he] wasn't . . . going to do that anymore.\" \r\nNonetheless, Pena did contact Omar Almanso, a friend from prison\r\nwho, after his release, had resumed his commerce in illegal drugs. \r\nAlmanso refused to deal with Cruz.  Cruz then suggested to Pena\r\nthat they could both make money if Pena would help her sell drugs\r\ninstead.  Pena testified that Cruz did not threaten him in any way.\r\nPena agreed to help her.  When asked to explain his\r\ndecision, Pena testified at trial that \"[e]ach time I called [my\r\nfamily] I wouldn't be able to help my children.  I didn't have any\r\nwork to help them buy their books, to buy what they needed, and so\r\nthey had to use borrowed books for school.\"   \r\nTwo weeks later, Cruz hailed Pena as he walked past her\r\nhome.  She told him that she needed to speak with him about\r\nsomething \"urgent.\"  Cruz told Pena \"she had a customer for [him]\r\nwho had been a customer of hers before, and that [Pena and Cruz]\r\ncould sell to him and that [Pena] should go and that [they] would\r\nboth earn something from it.\"  In fact, Cruz's \"buyer\" was Agent\r\nJohn Jusino of the Chicopee, Massachusetts Police Department. Pena\r\nwent to Almanso, who sold him one hundred (100) bags of heroin for\r\n$500.00.  Pena and Cruz agreed to resell the heroin for $650.00. \r\nThis price included a $100.00 profit for Pena and a $50.00 profit\r\nfor Cruz.\r\nOn October 6, 1997, Cruz called Pena to tell him that her\r\n\"buyer\" would meet them the next day and that Pena should come to\r\nher house so that the two could go together to make the sale.  On\r\nOctober 7, Pena walked to Cruz's house, and the two then drove to\r\nmeet Jusino.  During their meeting, Jusino told Pena that in\r\naddition to heroin, he was also interested in buying cocaine.  Pena\r\nreplied that he had a friend from whom he could obtain cocaine. \r\nThe two executed the sale.  Pena kept his $100.00 profit and gave\r\n$50.00 to Julia.\r\nFollowing the initial meeting with Jusino, Pena obtained\r\na beeper to facilitate subsequent sales.  Pena and Jusino met five\r\nmore times, during which the former sold the latter heroin and, on\r\none occasion, crack cocaine.  Pena and Cruz divided the proceeds of\r\nall six sales.  Almanso supplied Pena with almost all of the drugs\r\nPena sold, but on one occasion, Pena obtained heroin from the\r\nnephew with whom he was living.\r\nDuring his meetings with Jusino, Pena spoke knowledgeably\r\nabout the various drugs his supplier offered.  He told Jusino that\r\nhe could obtain heroin, cocaine, and crack cocaine.  Asked at trial\r\nhow he knew about these drugs, Pena replied that Almanso \"had all\r\nof those and thought that [Pena] might need to sell [them] to [his]\r\ncustomers.\"  On one occasion, when Jusino questioned the quality\r\nof the heroin, Pena admits that he replied, \"No, no, no, this is\r\ngood.  My bosses can't handle all the orders. . . .  This is good\r\nand guaranteed, you're going to call again.\"\r\nDuring their sixth and final meeting, Jusino arrested\r\nPena.  Pena was tried and convicted on five counts of having sold\r\ncontrolled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841.  This\r\nappeal followed.                              II.\r\n                         Discussion\r\nPena argues first that he was entitled to acquittal, as\r\na matter of law, based upon the entrapment defense, and second that\r\neven if he was not so entitled, the district court erred in\r\nrefusing to instruct the jury on that defense. \r\nBoth of Pena's claims hinge on the particular elements of\r\nthe entrapment defense.  \"[A] valid entrapment defense has two\r\nrelated elements: government inducement of the crime, and a lack of\r\npredisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the\r\ncriminal conduct.\" Mathews v.

Even if Pena's\r\ntestimony were assumed to be entirely truthful, he has failed to\r\nstate facts sufficient to satisfy the \"inducement\" prong.  We\r\ntherefore affirm the district court's rulings.\r\nA.  Pena's Entitlement to an Entrapment Instruction\r\nBefore discussing the merits of Pena's claim, we first\r\naddress the legal standards involved.  In evaluating a district\r\ncourt's refusal to instruct the jury as to the entrapment defense,\r\nthe question we must ask is whether the defendant has put forth\r\nevidence which, if viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\ndefense, could prompt a reasonable juror to find that both prongs\r\nof the entrapment test have been met.  See, e.g., Gamache, 156 F.3d\r\nat 9 (concluding that a defendant is \"entitled to an instruction on\r\nhis theory of defense so long as the theory is a valid one and\r\nthere is evidence in the record to support it\"); United States v.\r\nHernandez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608834\"><a href=\"/opinion/608834/united-states-v-jose-hernandez-united-states-of-america-v-aguilino-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding that in order\r\nto merit an entrapment instruction, a defendant must \"produce[]\r\nsome evidence -- on both elements of the entrapment defense --\r\nsufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he was\"\r\nentrapped); United States v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814 (1st Cir.\r\n1988) (requiring \"hard evidence\" supporting both prongs).  The\r\ninitial burden of producing evidence sufficient to establish the\r\ntwo entrapment prongs falls on the defendant.  \"If an accused\r\nsuggests that entrapment belongs in the case, it seems not unfair\r\nto expect him to point to a modicum of evidence supportive of his\r\nsuggestion.  The alternative -- that the prosecution be forced to\r\ndisprove entrapment in every case -- seems plainly unacceptable.\" \r\nRodriguez, 858 F.2d at 813-14; see also United States v. Coady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1st Cir. 1987); Kadis v.

The issue, then, turns on the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence put forth by the defense.  See Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814\r\n(\"[T]he accused's burden is measured by the . . . sufficiency-of-\r\nthe-evidence yardstick.\"). \r\nAlthough the requisites for entitlement to an entrapment\r\ninstruction are far from taxing, a defendant's threshold burden\r\ncannot be met by conclusory assertions alone; only \"hard evidence\r\nin the record which, if believed by a rational juror, would suffice\r\nto create a reasonable doubt as to whether government actors\r\ninduced the defendant to perform a criminal act that he was not\r\npredisposed to commit\" will suffice.  Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(emphasis added); see also United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467\r\n(emphasizing the defendant's \"'entry-level burden' of showing that\r\n'the record, viewed most charitably to the proponent of the\r\ninstruction, furnishes an arguable basis' for an assertion of the\r\ndefense.\" (quoting Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512578\"><a href=\"/opinion/512578/united-states-v-felix-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 812-13)).  The evidence\r\nneed not be \"'so substantial to require, if uncontroverted, a\r\ndirected verdict of acquittal [but] it must be more than a mere\r\nscintilla.'\"  Pratt, 913 F.2d at 988 (quoting Kadis, 373 F.2d at\r\n374); see also Gifford, 17 F.3d at 467; Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814. \r\nWhere the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\ndefendant, fail to satisfy the legal requisites for the entrapment\r\ndefense, no instruction is warranted.\r\nIn light of these standards, we review the decision below\r\nde novo:  \"The existence or nonexistence of the required quantity\r\nof evidence in a given case is a matter of law for the court, and\r\nthus our review is plenary, reading the record evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the defense.\"  United States v.

The Inducement Prong\r\nAs stated above, a defendant who asserts the entrapment\r\ndefense must first prove that the government \"induced\" his criminal\r\nconduct.  \"[I]nducement requires something more than that a\r\ngovernment agent or informant suggested the crime and provided the\r\noccasion for it.  Rather, inducement 'consists of [providing] an\r\n\"opportunity\" plus something else -- typically, excessive pressure\r\nby the government . . . or the government's taking advantage' of\r\nthe defendant in an improper way.\"  Acosta, 67 F.3d at 337 (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Gendron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195225\"><a href=\"/opinion/195225/united-states-v-gendron/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1994)); see also\r\nYoung, 78 F.3d at 761; Pratt, 913 F.2d at 988 (\"[The] defendant\r\nmust make a showing 'that a government agent turned him from a\r\nrighteous path to an iniquitous one.'\" (quoting Coady, 809 F.2d at\r\n122)).\r\n  It is well established that\r\n  it is proper (i.e., not an \"inducement\") for\r\nthe government to use a \"sting,\" at least\r\nwhere it amounts to providing a defendant with\r\nan \"opportunity\" to commit a crime.  Without\r\nthis kind of law enforcement weapon, it would\r\noften prove difficult, or impossible, to stop\r\ncertain seriously criminal activity,\r\nparticularly activity involving drugs, or\r\ncorruption, or other crimes in which no direct\r\nparticipant wants the crime detected.\r\nGendron, 18 F.3d at 961 (internal citations omitted); see also\r\nMathews v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (1988) (\"[E]vidence that\r\nGovernment agents merely afforded an opportunity or facilities for\r\nthe commission of the crime would be insufficient to warrant [an\r\nentrapment] instruction.\"); Pratt, 913 F.2d at 989 (\"The fact that\r\n[a government agent] put up the pretense of being a drug dealer,\r\nand solicited [defendant's] business, does not, without more, make\r\nthe government's involvement rise to the level of entrapment.\");\r\nCoady, 809 F.2d at 122 (finding no improper inducement where\r\ngovernment agent merely \"created a criminal opportunity by asking\r\n[defendant] to involve himself, and sweetened the pot with an offer\r\nof payment\").  \r\nIn order for a sting to constitute entrapment, then, the\r\ngovernment must engage in some kind of coercion -- the \"something\r\nelse\" alluded to in Acosta.  In Gendron, we reviewed examples of\r\nconduct that courts had considered \"improper.\"  Inducement was\r\nfound\r\n  where government officials: (1) used\r\n\"intimidation\" and \"threats\" against a\r\ndefendant's family; (2) called every day,\r\n\"began threatening\" the defendant, and were\r\nbelligerent; (3) engaged in a \"forceful\"\r\nsolicitation and \"dogged\" insistence until\r\n[defendant] capitulated\"; (4) played upon\r\ndefendant's sympathy for informant's common\r\nnarcotics experience and withdrawal symptoms;\r\n(5) played upon sentiment on \"one former war\r\nbuddy . . . for another\" to get liquor (during\r\nprohibition); (6) used \"repeated suggestions\r\nwhich succeeded only when defendant had lost\r\nhis job and needed money for his family's food\r\nand rent; (7) told defendant that she (the\r\nagent) was suicidal and in desperate need of\r\nmoney.\r\n\nGendron, 18 F.3d at 961-62 (internal citations omitted); see also\r\nAcosta, 67 F.3d at 338 (requiring evidence of threats, \"improper\r\nappeals to sympathy, promises of extravagant reward, or . . .\r\nrelentless and extreme trickery\"); Gifford, 17 F.3d at 468 (noting\r\nthat inducement involves \"pleading with a defendant,\" \"using\r\ninherently coercive tactics,\" or \"arm-twisting based on need,\r\nsympathy, friendship, or the like\").  \r\nIn light of the principles governing the entrapment\r\ndefense and of these examples of governmental overreaching, we\r\ndirect our inquiry to whether Pena offered evidence sufficient to\r\nmandate an entrapment instruction to the jury.  We conclude that he\r\ndid not.\r\nPena's entrapment defense is based on the following\r\nassertions:  Cruz befriended him, mentioning on their first meeting\r\nthat she was looking to procure drugs for resale.  Pena told her he\r\nwas not involved in such matters.  When, on a later visit, she\r\nasked him whether she might obtain drugs from a friend of his, he\r\nagreed to inquire.  That friend declined, but when Cruz then asked\r\nPena to sell narcotics as her partner, he agreed -- without any\r\ncoercion whatsoever -- and proceeded to engage in a total of six\r\nsales before his arrest.  Asked why he assented to Cruz's offer,\r\nPena cited only his children's need for new, rather than borrowed,\r\nbooks.  \r\nThese facts simply could not support a finding of\r\nimproper \"inducement.\"  Cruz and Agent Jusino did, of course,\r\nprovide Pena with an opportunity to commit the crimes for which he\r\nwas convicted.  But as we have stated, such behavior does not,\r\nabsent further coercion, constitute inducement.  Pena describes no\r\nsuch coercion here.  The activities in which Cruz and Jusino\r\nengaged fail even arguably to match the examples of misconduct\r\ncited in Gendron.  No witness testified that either Cruz or Jusino\r\nemployed \"intimidation\" or \"threats,\" that either played upon\r\nPena's common narcotics experiences or any other form of sentiment,\r\nor that either told Pena they were suicidal and in desperate need\r\nof drugs or money.  See Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961-62.  Even those\r\ncases cited in Gendron which bear some resemblance to the facts\r\nbefore us differ in critical respects.  Pena's testimony contained\r\nno support for a finding that the government made \"repeated\r\nsuggestions\" that he could earn money by dealing drugs.  See\r\nGendron, 18 F. 3d at 961; see also Acosta, 67 F.3d at 338 (finding\r\nthat entrapment instruction would be required when government\r\nperpetrated a \"campaign of persistent [telephone] calls\" in its\r\nattempt to lure defendant into committing an offense\").  In fact,\r\nPena testified that although he initially expressed a hesitance to\r\nbecome involved in drugs, when Cruz actually suggested at a later\r\ndate that the two could make money by selling narcotics together,\r\nhe agreed without resisting.  Moreover, there is no hint that Cruz\r\n\"called [Pena] every day, 'began threatening' [him], and [was]\r\nbelligerent.\"  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961 (citing United States v.\r\nGroll, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606041\"><a href=\"/opinion/606041/united-states-v-vicki-l-groll/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 759 (7th Cir. 1993)).  Individually, the\r\nGendron examples each evidence far more coercive government\r\nactivity than was present in this case; collectively, they\r\ndemonstrate that even as Pena states the facts, the government's\r\nactivities could not be held to constitute improper inducement.\r\nThe facts of Pena's case fall much closer to those in\r\nUnited States v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196643\"><a href=\"/opinion/196643/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1996).

Hendricks ultimately told Young that he\r\nwanted to obtain certain controlled substances, and Young agreed to\r\nsupply him.  The two agreed that they would together purchase and\r\nresell heroin.  But unbeknownst to Young, Hendricks had become a\r\ngovernment informant, and the \"buyer\" Hendricks \"found\" was a DEA\r\nagent.  Upon making the sale, Young was arrested.  See id. at 759.\r\nAt Young's trial, the district court refused to instruct\r\nthe jury on the entrapment defense.  Young appealed.  See id. at\r\n760.  We affirmed, finding that Young \"never testified that\r\nHendricks used [their] friendship as leverage constituting the\r\n'opportunity plus something else' legally required for a finding of\r\ninducement,\" or that Hendricks otherwise pressured him.  Id. at\r\n762.\r\nPena's case largely mirrors Young's.  Cruz befriended\r\nPena, as Hendricks had befriended Young.  Cruz and Pena discussed\r\ndrugs.  Ultimately, Cruz proposed that she and Pena together sell\r\ndrugs to a buyer who was, in fact, a government agent -- just as\r\nHendricks had proposed to Young.  Neither Pena nor Young testified\r\nthat the informant took advantage of any bond of friendship in\r\nencouraging the sale.  Like Young, Pena cannot claim that he was\r\n\"induced\" by a government informant's actions.  We conclude here,\r\nas we did in Young, that \"[t]here was no testimony or other\r\nevidence, let alone 'hard evidence,' of coercion or intimidation.\" \r\nId. at 761.     \r\nFurthermore, we are unpersuaded by Pena's contention that\r\nhis family's financial needs transformed what would have been a\r\npermissible government operation into illegal entrapment.  First,\r\nit is far from clear that Pena presented sufficient evidence to\r\nground a belief that the government was even aware of those\r\nfinancial needs.  The entirety of the testimony offered on this\r\nmatter was the following exchange between Pena and his counsel\r\nconcerning Pena's first meeting with Cruz:\r\n  Q:  Well, did you tell her anything about\r\nyourself that particular . . . time?\r\n\n  A:  All I just told her was that I was looking\r\nfor a job and that I needed my green card,\r\nthat I hadn't gotten it back from the police\r\nand that I was looking for a job.  I needed it\r\nbecause I needed to help my family because I\r\nhad been in jail in Ludlow two years.\r\nAlthough Pena testified more specifically at trial about his\r\nfamily's financial circumstances, he never testified that he had\r\ninformed Cruz of these circumstances.  Pena's family's hardship\r\ncould not be found to contribute to an entrapment finding if the\r\ngovernment was not even aware of that hardship during its\r\nundercover operation.\r\nEven if the government had been aware of Pena's financial\r\nsituation, however, such hardship does not have the legal effect\r\nPena suggests.  Pena's argument rests on his contention that he\r\nagreed to sell drugs with Cruz only because he \"didn't have any\r\nwork to help [his children] buy their books, to buy what they\r\nneeded, and so they had to use borrowed books for school.\"  But as\r\nwe stated in United States v. Panet-Collazo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580701\"><a href=\"/opinion/580701/united-states-v-pablo-panet-collazo-united-states-v-ruben-santana-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\r\n1992), \"[e]ntrapment does not blossom whenever a person succumbs to\r\nhis own greed or to the lure of easy money.\"  Id. at 259 (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Coady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1st Cir. 1987)). \r\nAlthough one could be sympathetic to Pena if his children had been\r\nin a dire situation, their need for new, rather than borrowed,\r\nbooks is hardly sufficient to establish \"inducement\" where none\r\nexisted otherwise.\r\n2.  The Predisposition Prong\r\nBecause we find no improper inducement, we need not\r\ndetermine whether Pena was predisposed to commit the crimes in\r\nquestion.  The government argues that the evidence regarding\r\npredisposition was such that the entrapment defense would fail as\r\na matter of law on that ground alone.  But the district court did\r\nnot appear to rely on this ground, and, in light of Pena's failure\r\nto meet the requirements of the \"inducement\" prong, we need not do\r\nso either.  Pena's inability to raise evidence sufficient to ground\r\na finding of improper inducement alone rendered a jury instruction\r\non the entrapment defense inappropriate.  \r\nB.  Entrapment as Matter of Law\r\nIn ascertaining whether a defendant established\r\nentrapment as a matter of law, we review the record de novo, see\r\nUnited States v. Ellis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198341\"><a href=\"/opinion/198341/united-states-v-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 (1st Cir. 1999), to\r\ndetermine whether it contains \"undisputed facts\" demonstrating\r\nentrapment.  Tzimopoulos v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"345397\"><a href=\"/opinion/345397/nicholas-tzimopoulos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1217 (1st\r\nCir. 1977); see also Jacobson v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 554\r\n(1992).  Having found that Pena has failed to present evidence even\r\npermitting a finding of improper inducement, we naturally decline\r\nto find that the same evidence required such a finding.  For the\r\nreasons described in Part II.A, supra, Pena has not established\r\nentrapment as a matter of law.\r\n                            III.\r\n                         Conclusion\r\nPena failed to introduce evidence sufficient to ground a\r\nfinding that he was \"induced\" to commit the offenses underlying his\r\nconvictions.  For this reason, the district court properly refused\r\nto instruct the jury on the entrapment defense and properly denied\r\nPena's claim of entrapment as a matter of law.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
