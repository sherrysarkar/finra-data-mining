Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDennis J. Roberts, II, with whom Gabriella G. Gaal, was on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\nRebecca Tedford Partington, Assistant Attorney General, for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nDecember 9, 1998\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant Rhoda\r\nTang (\"Tang\"), an Asian-American employee of the Rhode Island\r\nDepartment of Elderly Affairs (\"Department\"), filed a complaint\r\nagainst the Department alleging racial and gender discrimination,\r\nharassment and retaliation.  During the course of litigation, the\r\ndistrict court excluded certain evidence, granted judgment as a\r\nmatter of law for the Department, and granted attorney's fees to\r\nthe Department.  Tang appeals each of these decisions.  Because she\r\nhas failed to show that the district court's rulings on evidence\r\nand judgment as a matter of law were erroneous, we affirm.  We,\r\nhowever, remand the attorney's fee decision for clarification.\r\n                     I. Background\r\nDuring the decade preceding this litigation, Tang,\r\nindividually and in her role as president of the local union, filed\r\na series of grievances against the Department.  One such grievance,\r\nfiled in 1989 after the Department discharged her, went to an\r\narbitration hearing in May 1991.  During that hearing, the parties\r\nagreed to settle the grievance by reinstating Tang and had the\r\nstipulated settlement entered as the arbitrator's award.\r\nSeveral years later, Tang filed another grievance, this\r\ntime claiming racial and gender discrimination as well as\r\nretaliation for actions occurring before the 1991 hearing date. \r\nThe Department moved to dismiss the complaint based on the res\r\njudicata effect of the stipulated arbitration award.  Judge Pettine\r\nfound that he could not decide the issue on the basis of the record\r\nat the time, and consequently denied the motion.  During the course\r\nof that opinion, the court noted that at a recent conference the\r\nparties had discussed the admissibility of evidence underlying the\r\n1989 grievance.  Although the parties had not briefed the\r\nevidentiary issue, Judge Pettine stated that \"evidence of [Tang's\r\n1989] discharge will be admissible at trial\" whether or not Tang's\r\nclaim could be based on the earlier termination.\r\nDefendants subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal on\r\ngrounds not relevant here.  By the time the action was remanded to\r\nthe district court, Judge Pettine had retired, and the case had\r\nbeen assigned to Judge Torres.\r\nBased on the statement in Judge Pettine's opinion, Tang\r\nsought to introduce evidence underlying her 1989 discharge at\r\ntrial.  Judge Torres found that the existence of the grievance was\r\nrelevant to Tang's retaliation claim, but the facts underlying it\r\nwere not because it had been resolved.  Judge Torres therefore\r\nruled that Tang could introduce the fact that she had filed a\r\ngrievance but not the details of it.\r\nAfter the close of the plaintiff's case, Judge Torres\r\ngranted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Department.  He\r\nruled that Tang had presented no evidence that would support her\r\nclaims, and, in fact, the evidence contradicted her allegations.\r\nThe Department then filed a motion for attorney's fees\r\nunder 42 U.S.C.  1988.  Reiterating that the complaint was based\r\non \"a number of minor perceived slights\" and that there was\r\n\"absolutely no evidence\" that the slights were race or gender-based,\r\nJudge Torres granted the Department's motion for fees.\r\n                     II. Discussion\r\nA. Admission of Pre-1991 Evidence\r\nTang claims that Judge Torres erred in excluding the pre-\r\n1991 evidence because Judge Pettine's ruling that the evidence\r\nwould be admissible was the law of the case.  Whether the law of\r\nthe case doctrine bars subsequent litigation of a claim is an issue\r\nof law subject to plenary review by this court.  See Dopp v.\r\nPritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1245 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nTang's reliance on the law of the case doctrine is\r\nmisplaced.  As we recently said, that doctrine both prevents a\r\nparty from relitigating an issue decided by a lower court and\r\nunchallenged on appeal, and requires a lower court to comply with\r\na superior court's instructions on remand.  See Field v. Mans, 157\r\nF.3d 35, --, 1998 WL 696000, at *4-5 (1st Cir. 1998).  The doctrine\r\ndoes not preclude all reconsideration of an issue already settled. \r\nSee Bethlehem Steel Export Corp. v. Redondo Constr. Corp., 140 F.3d\r\n319, 321 (1st Cir. 1998).  \"Interlocutory orders, including denials\r\nof motions to dismiss, remain open to trial court reconsideration,\r\nand do not constitute the law of the case.\"  Perez-Ruiz v.\r\nCrespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r\nAt the time of Judge Pettine's comments, the parties had\r\nnot briefed whether the evidence was admissible; the Department had\r\nmade a motion to dismiss the complaint.  Even if Judge Pettine's\r\ncomments constituted a ruling on admissibility, that ruling was\r\ninterlocutory and subject to reconsideration.  The fact that the\r\nissue was reconsidered by Judge Torres, rather than Judge Pettine,\r\nis of no moment.  See United States v. O'Keefe, 128 F.3d 885, 891\r\n(5th Cir. 1997) (\"[A] successor judge has the same discretion to\r\nreconsider an order as would the first judge.\").  The law of the\r\ncase is simply not implicated in Judge Torres's ruling on the\r\nadmissibility of evidence.\r\nB. Judgment as a Matter of Law\r\nTang also alleges that the district court erroneously\r\ngranted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Department on\r\nher First Amendment freedom of speech claim.  We review the\r\ndistrict court's decision de novo, taking the facts in the light\r\nmost favorable to Tang.  See Russo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 140\r\nF.3d 6, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1998).  We may affirm the judgment only if\r\nthere \"is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable\r\njury to find for [her].\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).  Tang must provide\r\n\"more than a mere scintilla of evidence and may not rely on\r\nconjecture or speculation to justify the submission of an issue to\r\nthe jury.\"  Russo, 140 F.3d at 7-8 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\nTang claims the Department violated her First Amendment\r\nfree speech rights by retaliating against her for filing union\r\ngrievances, both on her own behalf and in her role as president of\r\nthe union. \r\nThe First Amendment guarantees every citizen the right\r\n\"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"  U.S.\r\nConst. amend. I.  Tang does not lose this right because she has\r\nbeen employed by the government.  See Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S.\r\n138, 140 (1983).  Nevertheless, absolute First Amendment protection\r\nis not accorded to any grievance a public employee files against an\r\nemployer, without regard to content.   If it did, anything she said\r\nin the Department \"would plant the seed of a constitutional case.\" \r\nId. at 149.\r\nInstead, we employ a three part test to determine whether\r\nTang has an actionable First Amendment freedom of speech claim. \r\nFirst, the court must determine whether Tang made her statements\r\n\"as a citizen upon matters of public concern.\"  Id. at 147.  If the\r\nspeech involved matters not of public concern, \"but instead . . .\r\nof personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a\r\nfederal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the\r\nwisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly\r\nin reaction to the employee's behavior.\"  Id.  Second, the court\r\nmust weigh the strength of the employee's and the public's First\r\nAmendment interests against the government's interest in the\r\nefficient performance of the workplace.  See Pickering v. Board of\r\nEduc., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968).  Third, if the employee's and the\r\npublic's First Amendment interests outweigh a legitimate\r\ngovernmental interest in curbing the employee's speech, Tang must\r\nshow that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating\r\nfactor in an adverse employment action.  See O'Connor v. Steeves,\r\n994 F.2d 905, 913 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nTang's claims fail at the first step because she has not\r\ndemonstrated that her speech involved any public interest.  In\r\nassessing whether Tang's speech implicates public concerns, we\r\nanalyze \"the content, form, and context of [the speech], as\r\nrevealed by the whole record.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48.\r\nHaving done so, we agree with the district court that\r\nTang has failed to develop a viable First Amendment claim.  Tang's\r\nbrief on appeal notes that she filed many grievances regarding\r\nemployment practices, but fails to provide any explicit description\r\nof their content, form, or context.  Nor does a review of the\r\nrecord below shed any further light on the nature and circumstances\r\nof the several dozen grievances Tang filed.\r\nThe record, at best, permits speculation that the\r\ngrievances underlying her First Amendment claim were similar to the\r\nsix alleged acts of harassment and retaliation, none of which,\r\nindividually or together, involved public concerns.  The first\r\nsuch act occurred on March 4, 1994, when Tang was informed that her\r\nposition was to be abolished due to budget cuts.  She was placed on\r\nadministrative leave with pay, and informed that she had the right\r\nto \"bump\" another union employee with less seniority.  Several days\r\nlater, the government realized that Tang's position could not be\r\nabolished, rescinded the March 4 notice, and reinstated Tang to her\r\nprevious position.  In essence, then, Tang's first complaint\r\ninvolves the fact that she was erroneously placed on administrative\r\nleave with pay for a few days.  The second instance involved\r\nrelocating her workspace from the third floor to the first floor,\r\nand sometime later to the second.  Third, she complained that a\r\nfiling cabinet was moved to a different floor from her workspace\r\nand placed alongside other filing cabinets.  Fourth, she alleges\r\nthat she was instructed to take her phone calls at her own desk,\r\nnot elsewhere in the department.  Fifth, she claims she was\r\nharassed and retaliated against when her coworker repeatedly asked\r\nher when she would no longer need a computer they shared.  Finally,\r\nthe sixth alleged act of harassment and retaliation involved the\r\nplacement of a photocopier near the shared computer.\r\nNone of these matters constitutes an issue of public\r\nconcern; they are all individual personal complaints about working\r\nconditions.  The Department retains the power to fashion an\r\nappropriate response to these issues in the workplace.  \"[T]he\r\nFirst Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a\r\nroundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.\" \r\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 149.  The district court appropriately granted\r\njudgment as a matter of law on Tang's First Amendment claim.\r\nC. Attorney's Fees\r\nTitle VII and  1988 provide the court with the power to\r\naward attorney's fees to prevailing parties in employment\r\ndiscrimination and civil rights actions, respectively.  See 42\r\nU.S.C.  2000e-5(k); 42 U.S.C.  1988.  Although courts are most\r\noften faced with motions for attorney's fees by prevailing\r\nplaintiffs, the statutes empower courts to grant fee requests by\r\nwhichever party prevails.  While decisions to grant defendants\r\ntheir fees are, and should be, rare, \"a district court may in its\r\ndiscretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant . . .\r\nupon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous,\r\nunreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in\r\nsubjective bad faith.\"  Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434\r\nU.S. 412, 421 (1978).  In determining whether this standard has\r\nbeen met, the court must assess the claim at the time the complaint\r\nwas filed, and must avoid the post-hoc reasoning that, because the\r\nplaintiff did not ultimately prevail, the claim must have been\r\nfrivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.  See Andrade v.\r\nJamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179, 1192 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing\r\nChristiansburg, 434 U.S. at 421-22).   \r\nAfter considerable deliberation, the district court\r\nreluctantly granted the Department's motion for attorney's fees on\r\nthe ground that the action was frivolous.  We review its decision\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v.\r\nRivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir. 1994).  Under this\r\nstandard, we may not simply substitute our judgment for that of the\r\ndistrict court; we will reverse only if we are left with \"a\r\ndefinite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear\r\nerror of judgment.\"  Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., 148\r\nF.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nOur review of the trial transcript and other record\r\nmaterials persuades us that the district court's finding that the\r\naction was frivolous was defensible.  As the court correctly\r\nconcluded, there were two hurdles Tang was unable to surmount,\r\nnamely an actual injury, and causation between that injury and\r\nrace, gender or retaliation.  Our discussion above demonstrates\r\nthat Tang's supposed injury amounts to no more than personal\r\ndispleasure with minor changes or inconveniences in her working\r\nsituation.  Individually and collectively, any allegation that Tang\r\nwas injured by these incidents, much less suffered the adverse\r\nemployment action required for Title VII liability, is frivolous,\r\nunreasonable and groundless.\r\nSimilarly, there was no evidence that any of the alleged\r\nactions were based on her race or gender or were done in\r\nretaliation for filing union grievances.  For instance, when her\r\nposition was mistakenly abolished, three other employees' positions\r\nalso were eliminated.  Two were white males and one was a white\r\nfemale.  Similarly, a number of the incidents involved interactions\r\nwith other union employees.  A claim that other union employees\r\nretaliated against Tang for her filing grievances on behalf of the\r\nunion is transparently meritless.\r\nRather than focusing on the strength of her claims, Tang\r\nargues that she should be insulated from paying the Department's\r\nattorney's fees for two reasons: 1) she relied on her lawyer to\r\ndetermine how to pursue the claim; and 2) on an earlier occasion\r\nshe had received a letter from the Rhode Island Commission for\r\nHuman Rights (\"RICHR\") suggesting \"probable cause\" to find\r\ndiscrimination had occurred.  Neither of these arguments\r\nundermines the district court's decision.  As a sister circuit has\r\nsuccinctly stated:\r\nThe proper test for [an attorney's fee award\r\nto a defendant] is whether the claim itself is\r\nclearly meritless. . . . [I]f a claim is\r\ngroundless, the mere fact that the plaintiff\r\nrelies on his attorney's erroneous contrary\r\nadvice does not relieve him of liability.\r\n\nDavidson v. Keenan, 740 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 1984).    Whether or\r\nnot Tang's reliance on her attorney's judgment was misplaced, she\r\nis legally responsible for the filing of the action.  See Prate v.\r\nFreedman, 583 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 1978).  See also Baker v.\r\nAlderman, 158 F.3d 516, ---, 1998 WL 726667, at *7 (11th Cir. Oct.\r\n19, 1998) (\"In deciding whether to assess attorney's fees against\r\na Title VII plaintiff, a court should not consider the plaintiff's\r\ncounsel's role in filing or maintenance of a frivolous, groundless,\r\nor unreasonable claim, or the plaintiff's apparent lack of personal\r\nfault.\").\r\nTang also relies on the fact that on an earlier occasion\r\nshe received a letter from the RICHR finding \"probable cause\" to\r\nbelieve discrimination had occurred.  However, that letter involved\r\nthe 1989 discharge, and Tang's own complaint admitted that, as a\r\nresult of the 1991 stipulated arbitration award, she voluntarily\r\nwithdrew her charge of discrimination regarding that discharge. \r\nThe fact that the RICHR had found probable cause in a charge she\r\nsubsequently agreed to withdraw is irrelevant to determining\r\nwhether the current action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without\r\nfoundation.\r\nIn essence, Tang's argument is that she filed the claim\r\nin good faith.  Although finding bad faith makes a fee award to the\r\ndefendant more likely, it is not a prerequisite.  See Local 285,\r\nService Employees Int'l Union v. Nonotuck Resource Assoc., Inc., 64\r\nF.3d 735, 737 (1st Cir. 1995).  Nor is good faith a defense to such\r\na claim.  See Independent Federation of Flight Attendants v. Zipes,\r\n491 U.S. 754, 759 (1989) (\"the prevailing defendant could be\r\nawarded fees . . . against the plaintiff whose suit was brought in\r\ngood faith, but only 'upon a finding that the plaintiff's action\r\nwas frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.'\").\r\nAlthough we have found that the district court's\r\ndetermination that the action was frivolous is supported, our\r\ninquiry is not over.  The transcript of the argument on the\r\nattorney's fee motion indicates that the district court was\r\ntroubled with the prospect of awarding defendants their fees, and\r\nfound the decision to do so \"distasteful.\"  Nevertheless, the court\r\nsaid the defendants were \"entitled\" to attorney's fees because the\r\naction was frivolous.  \r\nBecause the district court quoted the same language in a\r\nprior similar case, see Pontarelli v. Stone, 781 F. Supp. 114, 126\r\n(D.R.I. 1992), we believe that the term \"entitled\" comes from our\r\nown opinion in Cloutier v. Town of Epping, 714 F.2d 1184, 1193 (1st\r\nCir. 1983), in which we said \"[d]efendants are entitled to\r\nattorneys' fees under section 1988 only when a court finds that the\r\nplaintiff's claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\"\r\n(internal quotations omitted and emphasis added).  The word\r\n\"entitle\" embraces both the acknowledgment of a right and the\r\naffording of a basis for making a claim.  See Random House\r\nDictionary 649 (2d ed. unabridged 1987).  See also Webster's Third\r\nNew International Dictionary 758 (1981) (\"to give a right or legal\r\ntitle to\" and \"furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming\r\nsomething\").  The latter meaning is the pertinent one here.  In\r\nusing \"entitled,\" we did not intend to require district courts to\r\ngrant fee requests once frivolity has been established.  Rather, we\r\nintended to state that the finding of frivolity was a necessary\r\nprerequisite.  Notwithstanding such a finding, the district court\r\nstill retains discretion to deny or reduce fee requests after\r\nconsidering all the nuances of a particular case.  See Andrade, 82\r\nF.3d at 1193 (having \"calculated the lodestar for a prevailing\r\ndefendant, the district court may deny or reduce that amount after\r\nconsidering the plaintiff's financial condition.\").\r\nIt is not clear to us whether the district court\r\nrecognized its continued discretion.  The transcript of the\r\nattorney's fee motion hearing contains a number of ambiguous\r\ncomments by both parties and the court that could be interpreted to\r\nthe contrary.  The Department argued that the issue was an \"all or\r\nnothing proposition\"; the court could award the specific amount\r\nrequested, or nothing at all.  Tang's attorney parroted the\r\nDepartment's standard, and did not highlight the district court's\r\nwide discretion even if the action were frivolous.  In granting the\r\nDepartment's fee request, the court noted it was troubled by the\r\nfact that it was \"required to pass on a request for attorney's fees\r\nby a large institution such as a state, and the plaintiff is, as\r\nusually is the case, just a working person.\"  In going on to\r\ndescribe its duty the court said that the task was simple: to\r\ndetermine whether the action was frivolous.\r\nAlthough the record permits the decision made by the\r\ndistrict court, we are not sure whether the court actually\r\nexercised its discretion in so ruling.  The fact that it said the\r\ndefendants were \"entitled\" to the award, as \"distasteful\" as it might\r\nhave been, suggests that the court believed no discretion was\r\npermitted.  Because the court had a wide range of options\r\navailable, we remand to ensure that the court has the opportunity\r\nto utilize its discretion fully.  We leave to the district court's\r\ndiscretion as well what steps to take in issuing a new judgment,\r\nnoting only the Supreme Court's warning that attorney's fee motions\r\n\"should not result in a second major litigation.\"  Hensley v.\r\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983).\r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is\r\naffirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further action\r\nconsistent with this opinion.  Appellee may receive half its costs.\n",

He ruled that Tang had presented no evidence that would support her claims, and, in fact, the evidence contradicted her allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department then filed a motion for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.  Reiterating that the complaint was based on \"a number of minor perceived slights\" and that there was \"absolutely no evidence\" that the slights were race or gender-based, Judge Torres granted the Department's motion for fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Admission of Pre-1991 Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang claims that Judge Torres erred in excluding the pre-1991 evidence because Judge Pettine's ruling that the evidence would be admissible was the law of the case.  Whether the law of the case doctrine bars subsequent litigation of a claim is an issue of law subject to plenary review by this court.  See Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1245 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang's reliance on the law of the case doctrine is misplaced.  As we recently said, that doctrine both prevents a party from relitigating an issue decided by a lower court and unchallenged on appeal, and requires a lower court to comply with a superior court's instructions on remand.  See Field v. Mans, 157 F.3d 35, 40-41 (1st Cir.1998).  The doctrine does not preclude all reconsideration of an issue already settled.  See Bethlehem Steel Export Corp. v. Redondo Constr.  Corp., 140 F.3d 319, 321 (1st Cir.1998).  \"Interlocutory orders, including denials of motions to dismiss, remain open to trial court reconsideration, and do not constitute the law of the case.\"  Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-Guillen, 25 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Judge Pettine's comments, the parties had not briefed whether the evidence was admissible;  the Department had made a motion to dismiss the complaint.  Even if Judge Pettine's comments constituted a ruling on admissibility, that ruling was interlocutory and subject to reconsideration.  The fact that the issue was reconsidered by Judge Torres, rather than Judge Pettine, is of no moment.  See United States v. O'Keefe, 128 F.3d 885, 891 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[A] successor judge has the same discretion to reconsider an order as would the first judge.\").  The law of the case is simply not implicated in Judge Torres's ruling on the admissibility of evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang also alleges that the district court erroneously granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Department on her First Amendment freedom of speech claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We review the district court's decision de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Tang.  See Russo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 140 F.3d 6, 7-8 (1st Cir.1998).  We may affirm the judgment only if there \"is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [her].\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  Tang must provide \"more than a mere scintilla of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation to justify the submission of an issue to the jury.\"  Russo, 140 F.3d at 7-8 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang claims the Department violated her First Amendment free speech rights by retaliating against her for filing union grievances, both on her own behalf and in her role as president of the union.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment guarantees every citizen the right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"  U.S. Const. amend.  I.  Tang does not lose this right because she has been employed by the government.  See Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 140, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983).  Nevertheless, absolute First Amendment protection is not accorded to any grievance a public employee files against an employer, without regard to content.  If it did, anything she said in the Department \"would plant the seed of a constitutional case.\"  Id. at 149, 103 S.Ct. 1684.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we employ a three part test to determine whether Tang has an actionable First Amendment freedom of speech claim.  First, the court must determine whether Tang made her statements \"as a citizen upon matters of public concern.\"  Id. at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684.   If the speech involved matters not of public concern, \"but instead ... of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.\"  Id. Second, the court must weigh the strength of the employee's and the public's First Amendment interests against the government's interest in the efficient performance of the workplace.  See Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).  Third, if the employee's and the public's First Amendment interests outweigh a legitimate governmental interest in curbing the employee's speech, Tang must show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse employment action.  See O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F.2d 905, 913 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang's claims fail at the first step because she has not demonstrated that her speech involved any public interest.  In assessing whether Tang's speech implicates public concerns, we analyze \"the content, form, and context of [the speech], as revealed by the whole record.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having done so, we agree with the district court that Tang has failed to develop a viable First Amendment claim.  Tang's brief on appeal notes that she filed many grievances regarding employment practices, but fails to provide any explicit description of their content, form, or context.  Nor does a review of the record below shed any further light on the nature and circumstances of the several dozen grievances Tang filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, at best, permits speculation that the grievances underlying her First Amendment claim were similar to the six alleged acts of harassment and retaliation, none of which, individually or together, involved public concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The first such act occurred on March 4, 1994, when Tang was informed that her position was to be abolished due to budget cuts.  She was placed on administrative leave with pay, and informed that she had the right to \"bump\" another union employee with less seniority.  Several days later, the government realized that Tang's position could not be abolished, rescinded the March 4 notice, and reinstated Tang to her previous position.  In essence, then, Tang's first complaint involves the fact that she was erroneously placed on administrative leave with pay for a few days.  The second instance involved relocating her workspace from the third floor to the first floor, and sometime later to the second.  Third, she complained that a filing cabinet was moved to a different floor from her workspace and placed alongside other filing cabinets.  Fourth, she alleges that she was instructed to take her phone calls at her own desk, not elsewhere in the department.  Fifth, she claims she was harassed and retaliated against when her coworker repeatedly asked her when she would no longer need a computer they shared.  Finally, the sixth alleged act of harassment and retaliation involved the placement of a photocopier near the shared computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these matters constitutes an issue of public concern;  they are all individual personal complaints about working conditions.  The Department retains the power to fashion an appropriate response to these issues in the workplace.  \"[T]he First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S.Ct. 1684.   The district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law on Tang's First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII and &#167; 1988 provide the court with the power to award attorney's fees to prevailing parties in employment discrimination and civil rights actions, respectively.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(k);  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.  Although courts are most often faced with motions for attorney's fees by prevailing plaintiffs, the statutes empower courts to grant fee requests by whichever party prevails.  While decisions to grant defendants their fees are, and should be, rare, \"a district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant ... upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\"  Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In determining whether this standard has been met, the court must assess the claim at the time the complaint was filed, and must avoid the post-hoc reasoning that, because the plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, the claim must have been frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.  See Andrade v. Jamestown Hous.  Auth., 82 F.3d 1179, 1192 (1st Cir.1996) (citing Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 421-22, 98 S.Ct. 694).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considerable deliberation, the district court reluctantly granted the Department's motion for attorney's fees on the ground that the action was frivolous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We review its decision for abuse of discretion.  See Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir.1994).  Under this standard, we may not simply substitute our judgment for that of the district court;  we will reverse only if we are left with \"a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment.\"  Schubert v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., 148 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the trial transcript and other record materials persuades us that the district court's finding that the action was frivolous was defensible.  As the court correctly concluded, there were two hurdles Tang was unable to surmount, namely an actual injury, and causation between that injury and race, gender or retaliation.  Our discussion above demonstrates that Tang's supposed injury amounts to no more than personal displeasure with minor changes or inconveniences in her working situation.  Individually and collectively, any allegation that Tang was injured by these incidents, much less suffered the adverse employment action required for Title VII liability, is frivolous, unreasonable and groundless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, there was no evidence that any of the alleged actions were based on her race or gender or were done in retaliation for filing union grievances.  For instance, when her position was mistakenly abolished, three other employees' positions also were eliminated.  Two were white males and one was a white female.  Similarly, a number of the incidents involved interactions with other union employees.  A claim that other union employees retaliated against Tang for her filing grievances on behalf of the union is transparently meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than focusing on the strength of her claims, Tang argues that she should be insulated from paying the Department's attorney's fees for two reasons:  1) she relied on her lawyer to determine how to pursue the claim;  and 2) on an earlier occasion she had received a letter from the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (\"RICHR\") suggesting \"probable cause\" to find discrimination had occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Neither of these arguments undermines the district court's decision.  As a sister circuit has succinctly stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The proper test for [an attorney's fee award to a defendant] is whether the claim itself is clearly meritless....  [I]f a claim is groundless, the mere fact that the plaintiff relies on his attorney's erroneous contrary advice does not relieve him of liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davidson v. Keenan, 740 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir.1984).  Whether or not Tang's reliance on her attorney's judgment was misplaced, she is legally responsible for the filing of the action.  See Prate v. Freedman, 583 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir.1978).  See also Baker v. Alderman, 158 F.3d 516, 526-27 (11th Cir.1998) (\"In deciding whether to assess attorney's fees against a Title VII plaintiff, a court should not consider the plaintiff's counsel's role in filing or maintenance of a frivolous, groundless, or unreasonable claim, or the plaintiff's apparent lack of personal fault.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang also relies on the fact that on an earlier occasion she received a letter from the RICHR finding \"probable cause\" to believe discrimination had occurred.  However, that letter involved the 1989 discharge, and Tang's own complaint admitted that, as a result of the 1991 stipulated arbitration award, she voluntarily withdrew her charge of discrimination regarding that discharge.  The fact that the RICHR had found probable cause in a charge she subsequently agreed to withdraw is irrelevant to determining whether the current action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Tang's argument is that she filed the claim in good faith.  Although finding bad faith makes a fee award to the defendant more likely, it is not a prerequisite.  See Local 285, Service Employees Int'l Union v. Nonotuck Resource Assoc., Inc., 64 F.3d 735, 737 (1st Cir.1995).  Nor is good faith a defense to such a claim.  See Independent Federation of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 759, 109 S.Ct. 2732, 105 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (\"the prevailing defendant could be awarded fees ... against the plaintiff whose suit was brought in good faith, but only 'upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.' \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have found that the district court's determination that the action was frivolous is supported, our inquiry is not over.  The transcript of the argument on the attorney's fee motion indicates that the district court was troubled with the prospect of awarding defendants their fees, and found the decision to do so \"distasteful.\"   Nevertheless, the court said the defendants were \"entitled\" to attorney's fees because the action was frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court quoted the same language in a prior similar case, see Pontarelli v. Stone, 781 F.Supp. 114, 126 (D.R.I.1992), we believe that the term \"entitled\" comes from our own opinion in Cloutier v. Town of Epping, 714 F.2d 1184, 1193 (1st Cir.1983), in which we said \"[d]efendants are entitled to attorneys' fees under section 1988 only when a court finds that the plaintiff's claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\"  (internal quotations omitted and emphasis added).  The word \"entitle\" embraces both the acknowledgment of a right and the affording of a basis for making a claim.  See Random House Dictionary 649 (2d ed. unabridged 1987).  See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 758 (1981) (\"to give a right or legal title to\" and \"furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something\").  The latter meaning is the pertinent one here.  In using \"entitled,\" we did not intend to require district courts to grant fee requests once frivolity has been established.  Rather, we intended to state that the finding of frivolity was a necessary prerequisite.  Notwithstanding such a finding, the district court still retains discretion to deny or reduce fee requests after considering all the nuances of a particular case.  See Andrade, 82 F.3d at 1193 (having \"calculated the lodestar for a prevailing defendant, the district court may deny or reduce that amount after considering the plaintiff's financial condition.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear to us whether the district court recognized its continued discretion.  The transcript of the attorney's fee motion hearing contains a number of ambiguous comments by both parties and the court that could be interpreted to the contrary.  The Department argued that the issue was an \"all or nothing proposition\";  the court could award the specific amount requested, or nothing at all.  Tang's attorney parroted the Department's standard, and did not highlight the district court's wide discretion even if the action were frivolous.  In granting the Department's fee request, the court noted it was troubled by the fact that it was \"required to pass on a request for attorney's fees by a large institution such as a state, and the plaintiff is, as usually is the case, just a working person.\"   In going on to describe its duty the court said that the task was simple:  to determine whether the action was frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the record permits the decision made by the district court, we are not sure whether the court actually exercised its discretion in so ruling.  The fact that it said the defendants were \"entitled\" to the award, as \"distasteful\" as it might have been, suggests that the court believed no discretion was permitted.  Because the court had a wide range of options available, we remand to ensure that the court has the opportunity to utilize its discretion fully.  We leave to the district court's discretion as well what steps to take in issuing a new judgment, noting only the Supreme Court's warning that attorney's fee motions \"should not result in a second major litigation.\"  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further action consistent with this opinion.

Because it was neither argued nor briefed, such a claim has been waived.  See Rivera-Rosario v.

Because a freedom of association claim is not before us, we see no reason to address the disagreement among our sister circuits regarding whether the Connick test for freedom of speech claims, discussed infra, applies to freedom of association claims as well.  See Marshall v. Allen, 984 F.2d 787, 798 (7th Cir.1993) (applying Connick to freedom of association claims);  but see Hatcher v. Board of Pub.

In a Title VII case, receipt of a right to sue letter is a requirement that must be satisfied before a plaintiff may bring suit.  See McKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, 83 F.3d 498, 504 (1st Cir.1996).  Such a letter cannot protect Tang from any claim by the Department for fees.  If it could, courts would be foreclosed from granting defendants' motions for attorney's fees in Title VII cases, and the law is otherwise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note that our decision does not necessarily render the plaintiff lawyer's advice irrelevant.  We hold only that the plaintiff's reliance on a lawyer's advice is not a complete defense to attorney's fees claims by defendants.  In exercising its discretion, a district court might decline to award attorney's fees if a plaintiff had a strong factual case and suffered obvious injustice, but relied on a lawyer who pursued an unsuccessful legal theory.

During the course of litigation, the district court excluded certain evidence, granted judgment as a matter of law for the Department, and granted attorney's fees to the Department.  Tang appeals each of these decisions.  Because she has failed to show that the district court's rulings on evidence and judgment as a matter of law were erroneous, we affirm.  We, however, remand the attorney's fee decision for clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the decade preceding this litigation, Tang, individually and in her role as president of the local union, filed a series of grievances against the Department.  One such grievance, filed in 1989 after the Department discharged her, went to an arbitration hearing in May 1991.  During that hearing, the parties agreed to settle the grievance by reinstating Tang and had the stipulated settlement entered as the arbitrator's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several years later, Tang filed another grievance, this time claiming racial and gender discrimination as well as retaliation for actions occurring before the 1991 hearing date.  The Department moved to dismiss the complaint based on the res judicata effect of the stipulated arbitration award.  Judge Pettine found that he could not decide the issue on the basis of the record at the time, and consequently denied the motion.  During the course of that opinion, the court noted that at a recent conference the parties had discussed the admissibility of evidence underlying the 1989 grievance.  Although the parties had not briefed the evidentiary issue, Judge Pettine stated that \"evidence of [Tang's 1989] discharge will be admissible at trial\" whether or not Tang's claim could be based on the earlier termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal on grounds not relevant here.  By the time the action was remanded to the district court, Judge Pettine had retired, and the case had been assigned to Judge Torres.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the statement in Judge Pettine's opinion, Tang sought to introduce evidence underlying her 1989 discharge at trial.  Judge Torres found that the existence of the grievance was relevant to Tang's retaliation claim, but the facts underlying it were not because it had been resolved.  Judge Torres therefore ruled that Tang could introduce the fact that she had filed a grievance but not the details of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of the plaintiff's case, Judge Torres granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Department.  He ruled that Tang had presented no evidence that would support her claims, and, in fact, the evidence contradicted her allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department then filed a motion for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.  Reiterating that the complaint was based on \"a number of minor perceived slights\" and that there was \"absolutely no evidence\" that the slights were race or gender-based, Judge Torres granted the Department's motion for fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Admission of Pre-1991 Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang claims that Judge Torres erred in excluding the pre-1991 evidence because Judge Pettine's ruling that the evidence would be admissible was the law of the case.  Whether the law of the case doctrine bars subsequent litigation of a claim is an issue of law subject to plenary review by this court.  See Dopp v. Pritzker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681299\"><a href=\"/opinion/681299/paul-s-dopp-v-jay-pritzker-paul-s-dopp-v-jay-pritzker/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1245 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang's reliance on the law of the case doctrine is misplaced.  As we recently said, that doctrine both prevents a party from relitigating an issue decided by a lower court and unchallenged on appeal, and requires a lower court to comply with a superior court's instructions on remand.  See Field v. Mans, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198162\"><a href=\"/opinion/198162/field-v-mans/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.1998).  The doctrine does not preclude all reconsideration of an issue already settled.  See Bethlehem Steel Export Corp. v. Redondo Constr.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197891\"><a href=\"/opinion/197891/bethlehem-v-redondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 321 (1st Cir.1998).  \"Interlocutory orders, including denials of motions to dismiss, remain open to trial court reconsideration, and do not constitute the law of the case.\"  Perez-Ruiz v.

Even if Judge Pettine's comments constituted a ruling on admissibility, that ruling was interlocutory and subject to reconsideration.  The fact that the issue was reconsidered by Judge Torres, rather than Judge Pettine, is of no moment.  See United States v. O'Keefe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747751\"><a href=\"/opinion/747751/united-states-v-michael-okeefe-sr-eric-schmidt-john-obrien-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 891 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[A] successor judge has the same discretion to reconsider an order as would the first judge.\").  The law of the case is simply not implicated in Judge Torres's ruling on the admissibility of evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang also alleges that the district court erroneously granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Department on her First Amendment freedom of speech claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We review the district court's decision de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to Tang.  See Russo v.

We may affirm the judgment only if there \"is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [her].\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).  Tang must provide \"more than a mere scintilla of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation to justify the submission of an issue to the jury.\"  Russo, 140 F.3d at 7-8 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang claims the Department violated her First Amendment free speech rights by retaliating against her for filing union grievances, both on her own behalf and in her role as president of the union.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment guarantees every citizen the right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"  U.S. Const. amend.

Nevertheless, absolute First Amendment protection is not accorded to any grievance a public employee files against an employer, without regard to content.  If it did, anything she said in the Department \"would plant the seed of a constitutional case.\"  Id. at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, the court must determine whether Tang made her statements \"as a citizen upon matters of public concern.\"  Id. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the speech involved matters not of public concern, \"but instead ... of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.\"  Id. Second, the court must weigh the strength of the employee's and the public's First Amendment interests against the government's interest in the efficient performance of the workplace.  See Pickering v. Board of Educ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span> (1968).  Third, if the employee's and the public's First Amendment interests outweigh a legitimate governmental interest in curbing the employee's speech, Tang must show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in an adverse employment action.  See O'Connor v. Steeves, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608078\"><a href=\"/opinion/608078/patrick-j-oconnor-v-robert-w-steeves/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span>, 913 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tang's claims fail at the first step because she has not demonstrated that her speech involved any public interest.  In assessing whether Tang's speech implicates public concerns, we analyze \"the content, form, and context of [the speech], as revealed by the whole record.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Tang's brief on appeal notes that she filed many grievances regarding employment practices, but fails to provide any explicit description of their content, form, or context.  Nor does a review of the record below shed any further light on the nature and circumstances of the several dozen grievances Tang filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record, at best, permits speculation that the grievances underlying her First Amendment claim were similar to the six alleged acts of harassment and retaliation, none of which, individually or together, involved public concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The first such act occurred on March 4, 1994, when Tang was informed that her position was to be abolished due to budget cuts.  She was placed on administrative leave with pay, and informed that she had the right to \"bump\" another union employee with less seniority.  Several days later, the government realized that Tang's position could not be abolished, rescinded the March 4 notice, and reinstated Tang to her previous position.  In essence, then, Tang's first complaint involves the fact that she was erroneously placed on administrative leave with pay for a few days.  The second instance involved relocating her workspace from the third floor to the first floor, and sometime later to the second.  Third, she complained that a filing cabinet was moved to a different floor from her workspace and placed alongside other filing cabinets.  Fourth, she alleges that she was instructed to take her phone calls at her own desk, not elsewhere in the department.  Fifth, she claims she was harassed and retaliated against when her coworker repeatedly asked her when she would no longer need a computer they shared.  Finally, the sixth alleged act of harassment and retaliation involved the placement of a photocopier near the shared computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these matters constitutes an issue of public concern;  they are all individual personal complaints about working conditions.  The Department retains the power to fashion an appropriate response to these issues in the workplace.  \"[T]he First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.\"  Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(k);  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.  Although courts are most often faced with motions for attorney's fees by prevailing plaintiffs, the statutes empower courts to grant fee requests by whichever party prevails.  While decisions to grant defendants their fees are, and should be, rare, \"a district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant ... upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\"  Christiansburg Garment Co. v.

As the court correctly concluded, there were two hurdles Tang was unable to surmount, namely an actual injury, and causation between that injury and race, gender or retaliation.  Our discussion above demonstrates that Tang's supposed injury amounts to no more than personal displeasure with minor changes or inconveniences in her working situation.  Individually and collectively, any allegation that Tang was injured by these incidents, much less suffered the adverse employment action required for Title VII liability, is frivolous, unreasonable and groundless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, there was no evidence that any of the alleged actions were based on her race or gender or were done in retaliation for filing union grievances.  For instance, when her position was mistakenly abolished, three other employees' positions also were eliminated.  Two were white males and one was a white female.  Similarly, a number of the incidents involved interactions with other union employees.  A claim that other union employees retaliated against Tang for her filing grievances on behalf of the union is transparently meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than focusing on the strength of her claims, Tang argues that she should be insulated from paying the Department's attorney's fees for two reasons:  1) she relied on her lawyer to determine how to pursue the claim;  and 2) on an earlier occasion she had received a letter from the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (\"RICHR\") suggesting \"probable cause\" to find discrimination had occurred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Neither of these arguments undermines the district court's decision.  As a sister circuit has succinctly stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The proper test for [an attorney's fee award to a defendant] is whether the claim itself is clearly meritless....

However, that letter involved the 1989 discharge, and Tang's own complaint admitted that, as a result of the 1991 stipulated arbitration award, she voluntarily withdrew her charge of discrimination regarding that discharge.  The fact that the RICHR had found probable cause in a charge she subsequently agreed to withdraw is irrelevant to determining whether the current action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Tang's argument is that she filed the claim in good faith.  Although finding bad faith makes a fee award to the defendant more likely, it is not a prerequisite.  See Local 285, Service Employees Int'l Union v.

The transcript of the argument on the attorney's fee motion indicates that the district court was troubled with the prospect of awarding defendants their fees, and found the decision to do so \"distasteful.\"   Nevertheless, the court said the defendants were \"entitled\" to attorney's fees because the action was frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court quoted the same language in a prior similar case, see Pontarelli v. Stone, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></span>, 126 (D.R.I.1992), we believe that the term \"entitled\" comes from our own opinion in Cloutier v. Town of Epping, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423649\"><a href=\"/opinion/423649/wilfred-cloutier-v-the-town-of-epping-wilfred-cloutier-v-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1193 (1st Cir.1983), in which we said \"[d]efendants are entitled to attorneys' fees under section 1988 only when a court finds that the plaintiff's claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\"  (internal quotations omitted and emphasis added).  The word \"entitle\" embraces both the acknowledgment of a right and the affording of a basis for making a claim.  See Random House Dictionary 649 (2d ed. unabridged 1987).  See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 758 (1981) (\"to give a right or legal title to\" and \"furnish with proper grounds for seeking or claiming something\").  The latter meaning is the pertinent one here.  In using \"entitled,\" we did not intend to require district courts to grant fee requests once frivolity has been established.  Rather, we intended to state that the finding of frivolity was a necessary prerequisite.  Notwithstanding such a finding, the district court still retains discretion to deny or reduce fee requests after considering all the nuances of a particular case.  See Andrade, 82 F.3d at 1193 (having \"calculated the lodestar for a prevailing defendant, the district court may deny or reduce that amount after considering the plaintiff's financial condition.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not clear to us whether the district court recognized its continued discretion.  The transcript of the attorney's fee motion hearing contains a number of ambiguous comments by both parties and the court that could be interpreted to the contrary.  The Department argued that the issue was an \"all or nothing proposition\";  the court could award the specific amount requested, or nothing at all.  Tang's attorney parroted the Department's standard, and did not highlight the district court's wide discretion even if the action were frivolous.  In granting the Department's fee request, the court noted it was troubled by the fact that it was \"required to pass on a request for attorney's fees by a large institution such as a state, and the plaintiff is, as usually is the case, just a working person.\"   In going on to describe its duty the court said that the task was simple:  to determine whether the action was frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the record permits the decision made by the district court, we are not sure whether the court actually exercised its discretion in so ruling.  The fact that it said the defendants were \"entitled\" to the award, as \"distasteful\" as it might have been, suggests that the court believed no discretion was permitted.  Because the court had a wide range of options available, we remand to ensure that the court has the opportunity to utilize its discretion fully.  We leave to the district court's discretion as well what steps to take in issuing a new judgment, noting only the Supreme Court's warning that attorney's fee motions \"should not result in a second major litigation.\"  Hensley v.

Because it was neither argued nor briefed, such a claim has been waived.  See Rivera-Rosario v.

See Brief of Appellant, p. 2, Statement of Issues on Appeal (appealing the decision regarding her \"First Amendment right of freedom of speech\").  Because a freedom of association claim is not before us, we see no reason to address the disagreement among our sister circuits regarding whether the Connick test for freedom of speech claims, discussed infra, applies to freedom of association claims as well.  See Marshall v. Allen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599169\"><a href=\"/opinion/599169/cornelius-marshall-v-wilbert-allen-richard-anderson-and-anthony-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 798 (7th Cir.1993) (applying Connick to freedom of association claims);  but see Hatcher v.

(Amended Complaint, p 36).  Since she admittedly has the same job responsibilities and is still an employee of the Department, we interpret the comment about being transferred to a new division as factual background, not as an allegation of harassment or retaliation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Christiansburg involved a fee award in a Title VII case, but the Supreme Court has subsequently held that the same standard applies to &#167; 1988 fee requests by prevailing defendants.  See Hughes v.

She does not object to either the proposed hourly rate or the time spent by the Department defending the claim.  While we note that the award was significant, namely $63,183.00, the question as argued is not whether that amount was excessive, but rather whether any attorney's fees were warranted at all</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Although Tang also mentions her receipt of a \"right to sue\" letter from the EEOC, this letter is irrelevant to the district court's finding that the action was groundless and unreasonable.  In a Title VII case, receipt of a right to sue letter is a requirement that must be satisfied before a plaintiff may bring suit.  See McKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196739\"><a href=\"/opinion/196739/mckinnon-v-kwong-wah/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 504 (1st Cir.1996).  Such a letter cannot protect Tang from any claim by the Department for fees.  If it could, courts would be foreclosed from granting defendants' motions for attorney's fees in Title VII cases, and the law is otherwise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note that our decision does not necessarily render the plaintiff lawyer's advice irrelevant.  We hold only that the plaintiff's reliance on a lawyer's advice is not a complete defense to attorney's fees claims by defendants.  In exercising its discretion, a district court might decline to award attorney's fees if a plaintiff had a strong factual case and suffered obvious injustice, but relied on a lawyer who pursued an unsuccessful legal theory.  See Silva v. Witschen, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">809159</span></span> (D.R.I.
