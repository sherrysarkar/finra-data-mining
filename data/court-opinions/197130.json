On  December 11th\r\n\nof  that year, a  severe storm struck New  York City, causing the\r\n\nHudson and East  Rivers to  overflow their banks.   Flood  waters\r\n\nentered the basement of the Water  Street Building through cracks\r\n\nin  its foundation, resulting in more than one million dollars in\r\n\nproperty damage.   Slightly  more than  half the  damage involved\r\n\nenergized electrical switching panels which had come into contact\r\n\nwith the flood waters.  The water immediately caused a phenomenon\r\n\nknown as \"electrical arcing\"1    an electrical short  circuit, in\r\n\nlay terms     which in  turn caused an  immediate explosion  that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Electrical arcing is defined  as \"the movement of electrons\r\nfrom one point  to another.\"   Aetna Ins.

Much  of  the\r\n\nremaining damage, appraised at  $445,592, occurred when the flood\r\n\nwaters  came in contact  with non-energized electrical equipment;\r\n\nit involved no electrical arcing.\r\n\n          At  the  time of  the  storm,  three separate  policies\r\n\nprovided various coverages for the Water Street Building.  Two of\r\n\nthe policies     identical \"all risk\"  policies separately issued\r\n\nby appellants  Continental and  Hartford    insured  against \"all\r\n\nrisks  including  Flood and  Earthquake\"  up  to $75,000,000  per\r\n\noccurrence for the one-year period beginning March 3, 1992.  Each\r\n\npolicy  underwrote fifty  percent of  the $75,000,000  \"all risk\"\r\n\ncoverage  on  identical terms  and  conditions,  and contained  a\r\n\n$100,000 deductible for any  loss and damage arising out  of each\r\n\ncovered occurrence.  In addition, each \"all risk\" policy excluded\r\n\ncoverage  for  mechanical  or   electrical  breakdown  caused  by\r\n\nartificially generated electrical currents.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The policies stated, in pertinent part:\r\n\n          8.

As  concerns the  Water  Street\r\n\nBuilding  in  particular, the  Arkwright  policy  afforded up  to\r\n\n$100,000,000 in covered property loss from flooding, subject to a\r\n\n$75,000,000 deductible.   Thus, the Arkwright  policy principally\r\n\nserved  as  excess  \"all  risk\" coverage  above  the  $75,000,000\r                                                         \r\n\nliability limit on the two separate \"all risk\" policies issued by\r\n\nappellants Continental and Hartford.  \r\n\n          The  Arkwright  policy  on  the  Water  Street Building\r\n\nincluded  a  \"Special  Deductible  Endorsement,\"  which  afforded\r\n\nprimary insurance coverage for mechanical or electrical breakdown\r                 \r\n\nby  substituting a  $50,000 deductible  for the  $75,000,000 \"all\r\n\nrisk\" deductible in  the Arkwright policy.   The $50,000  Special\r\n\nDeductible    Endorsement   was   subject    to   the   following\r\n\nqualifications:\r\n\n          In the event of  insured loss or damage under\r                                                                 \r\n          the  policy  to  which  this  endorsement  is\r                               \r\n          attached, the Loss or Damage  described below\r                                                                 \r\n          shall  be subject to the following deductible\r                                                                 \r\n          amount(s)  in   lieu  of  any   other  Policy\r                                                                 \r\n          deductible amount(s) except those  for Flood,\r                                                                \r\n          Earthquake   or   Service   Interruption   if\r                                                                 \r\n          applicable:  \r                              \r\n\n                         [$50,000.00]\r                                              \r\n\n                         *    *    *\r\n          3.

(Emphasis added.)\r\n\n          Olympia submitted claims  to appellants Continental and\r\n\nHartford  for  the total  loss  sustained  at  the  Water  Street\r\n\nBuilding.  It maintained that the  entire loss had been caused by\r\n\nflooding and  therefore came  within the coverage  afforded under\r\n\nthe  two  primary  \"all  risk\"  policies  issued  by  appellants.\r\n\nContinental  and  Hartford  promptly paid  $937,557  to  Olympia,\r\n\nrepresenting  coverage  for  the  entire  loss  less  a  $100,000\r\n\ndeductible,  then  claimed reimbursement  from Arkwright  for the\r\n\n$581,225 loss to the electrical switching panels allegedly caused\r\n\nby  electrical   arcing.    Arkwright   refused  to   contribute,\r\n\ncontending  that all damage to the Water Street Building had been\r\n\ncaused by, or resulted  directly from, flooding.  Relying  on the\r\n\nSpecial Deductible  Endorsement language    \"in lieu of any other\r\n\nPolicy deductible amount(s) except  those for Flood\"    Arkwright\r\n\ninsisted that since the damage had been due to flood, the $50,000\r\n\ndeductible in  its endorsement  did not displace  the $75,000,000\r\n\ndeductible in its policy. \r\n\n          Continental  and  Hartford  instituted  this  diversity\r\n\nproceeding in  United States District  Court for the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts, seeking a judicial  declaration that Arkwright was\r\n\nliable for the portion of the electrical switching panel loss due\r\n\nto  electrical  arcing.   After  all  parties  moved  for summary\r\n\njudgment  based  on  their  respective  interpretations   of  the\r\n\napplicable New  York caselaw,  the district court  concluded that\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nunder  the Arkwright  insurance contract,  including its  Special\r\n\nDeductible Endorsement, as viewed by a reasonable business person\r\n\nin the relevant circumstances, see Bird v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine\r                                                                           \r\n\nIns.

The court based its  conclusion on\r\n\nthe fact  that the  $50,000  deductible is  made inapplicable  to\r\n\nflood  loss by  the express  language in  the Special  Deductible\r\n\nEndorsement excluding electrical breakdown  due to flood, as well\r\n\nas the fact that all the damage occurred virtually simultaneously\r\n\nat the same site.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION4\r                                     DISCUSSION\r                                               \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The parties stipulated, consistent with established \"choice\r\nof law\" principles, that New York law governs.  Under  the law of\r\nMassachusetts, the  forum state,  the applicable  substantive law\r\nwould be supplied  by New  York, the jurisdiction  with the  most\r\nsignificant  relationship  to  the  transaction.

Under established New\r\n\nYork law governing  insurance contract interpretation, appellants\r\n\nmaintain, the district  court was required  to identify the  most\r\n\ndirect,  physical cause  of the  damage, or  what is  termed \"the\r\n\ndominant and  proximate cause.\"   Novick  v.

Similarly,  appellants  maintain  that  the\r\n\nefficient, legal cause of  the damage to the switching  panels in\r\n\nthe present case was the  electrical arcing, whereas the flooding\r\n\nmerely  set the stage for the  arcing.5  Consequently, appellants\r\n\nconclude, the district court need have looked no further than the\r\n\nphenomenon of electrical arcing for the legal cause of the damage\r\n\nto the switching panels.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Appellants cite numerous cases for the proposition that the\r\nefficient,  legal  cause  of  a  loss  invariably  is  the  cause\r\n\"nearest\" the loss.

Under New\r\n\nYork law, insurance  policies are to be interpreted in accordance\r\n\nwith their  terms.  See,  e.g., Frey  v. Aetna Life  &amp; Cas.,  633\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.Y.S.2d 880, 882 (App. Div. 1995).  \r\n\n          In cases involving an  electrical breakdown not  caused\r\n\nby lightning,  the Special  Deductible Endorsement  substitutes a\r\n\n$50,000  deductible   for  the  $75,000,000  deductible   in  the\r\n\nArkwright  liability policy  proper,  except in  cases where  the\r\n\nhigher deductible for \"Flood\"  is \"applicable.\"  Appellants would\r\n\nhave the court interpret the operative provision (\"in lieu of any\r\n\nother   Policy  amount(s)  except  those  for  Flood  .  .  .  if\r\n\napplicable\")  to  mean that  the  $75,000,000  deductible in  the\r\n\nArkwright liability  policy proper  applies only  if  there is  a\r\n\nseparate, specific  policy deductible  for flood damage.   Absent\r\n\nsuch  a specific deductible for flood damage, appellants say, the\r\n\nexception for  loss from  flooding found  in the  $50,000 Special\r                   \r\n\nDeductible  Endorsement  is   never  triggered;  therefore,   the\r\n\nelectrical breakdown damage to  the switching panels comes within\r\n\nthe  $50,000  Special   Deductible  Endorsement,  displacing  the\r\n\n$75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright policy itself. \r\n\n          Appellants  misinterpret  the  plain  language  in  the\r\n\nSpecial  Deductible  Endorsement,  which unambiguously  indicates\r\n\nthat the $50,000 deductible does not  apply if another deductible\r                                                     \r\n\nfor  flooding damage  does apply.    Furthermore, the  \"all risk\"\r                                          \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ngeneral  liability  coverage  in   the  Arkwright  policy  itself\r\n\nexpressly insures against \"loss or damage resulting from a single\r\n\noccurrence,\" including flood.   Thus, the plain language employed\r\n\nin  both the  Special  Deductible Endorsement  and the  Arkwright\r\n\ngeneral  liability  policy  itself,  compatibly   interpreted  in\r\n\ncontext, means that damage  to mechanical or electrical equipment\r\n\nproximately caused by flooding comes within  the exception to the\r                                                                    \r\n\n$50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement  and hence the $75,000,000\r\n\ndeductible in  the Arkwright general liability  policy applies in\r\n\nsuch a situation.

Within the policy period, a fire of unknown origin broke\r\n\nout beneath some freight cars loaded with explosives  and located\r\n\nat a considerable distance from the pier where the insured vessel\r\n\nwas docked.    After burning  for approximately  30 minutes,  the\r\n\nfreight cars exploded, causing another fire, which in turn caused\r\n\na second explosion, the concussion from which damaged the insured\r\n\nvessel  located some  1,000  feet from  the  site of  the  second\r\n\nexplosion.  No  fire reached the vessel.  Id.  at 86.

Id. at 88. \r                                      \r\n\n          The critical consideration in  Bird was the \"element of\r                                                       \r\n\nproximity in space.\"  Id.  at 87.  As the initiating event    the\r                                   \r\n\nfire in  the freight cars     occurred a great distance  from the\r\n\ninsured  vessel, the court held that \"there was never exposure to\r\n\nits direct perils\" and  that the exposure to its  indirect perils\r\n\n   i.e., the concussion  from the second explosion     came \"only\r\n\nthrough the presence of extraordinary conditions, the release and\r\n\nintervention  of  tremendous   forces  of   destruction.\"     Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nConsequently,  the  court concluded,  reasonable  business people\r\n\nwould  not  have  expected  that an  insurance  policy  affording\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nprotection against fire would cover damage to a vessel  following\r\n\nsuccessive concussions  precipitated by explosions caused  by the\r\n\nfire in the distant freightyard.  As the Court of Appeals stated:\r\n\n          The case  comes,  therefore, to  this.

The flood waters  came\r                                                 \r\n\ndirectly in  contact with the  electrical equipment in  the Water\r                  \r\n\nStreet Building, instantaneously  precipitating the arcing  which\r                                          \r\n\nin turn caused the  immediate short-circuiting and explosion that\r                                       \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ndamaged the switching panels.   At most, mere seconds  would have\r\n\nelapsed from  the time  the flood  waters directly  contacted the\r\n\nelectrical  equipment  until   the  electrical  switching  panels\r\n\nexploded. \r\n\n          Where any  spatial and temporal  separation between the\r\n\ncovered  peril and  the  ensuing loss  is  so  minimal as  to  be\r\n\nvirtually nonexistent, Bird clearly contemplates that the loss be\r                                     \r\n\nconsidered well  within the  \"compass of  reasonable probability\"\r\n\nand  therefore  inferentially  within the  contemplation  of  the\r\n\nparties to  the insurance  contract.

This\r                        \r\n\npassage  distinguishes an  intrusion of  water and  steam  into a\r\n\nbasement,   gradually   causing   moisture   to    seep   through\r\n\ndeteriorating building materials into a duct, from a situation in\r\n\nwhich  water flows  directly onto  an electrical  system, causing\r\n\nimmediate  arcing and damage to  the electrical system.   In Home\r                                                                           \r\n\nInsurance, substantial  time and  space separated the  peril (the\r                   \r\n\nwater  and  steam  entering   the  basement)  from  the  eventual\r\n\nelectrical damage to the duct  system resulting from the moisture\r\n\ngradually  generated by  the  water and  steam.

Thus, the question before this\r                         \r\n\ncourt, as in Bird, is the question of law already resolved above:\r                                                   \r\n\nWhat would the  New York courts determine to have  been the legal\r\n\nor proximate cause of the loss?  Like the district court, we hold\r\n\nthat flood was the legal cause of the loss in this case.\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          As the district court correctly applied the controlling\r\n\nNew York law,  the judgment is  affirmed.   Costs are awarded  to\r                                                                           \r\n\nappellee.\r                  \r\n\n          SO ORDERED.\r                    SO ORDERED.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12As support for their claim that trialworthy issues of fact\r\nremain,  appellants point  to  a letter  written to  Arkwright by\r\nDavid  Passman, an  insurance broker  for  Olympia.   The Passman\r\nletter  is said  to contradict  the affidavit  of  Olympia's risk\r\nmanager,  David  Roth,  who  filed the  claim  for  loss  against\r\nappellants only, based on his  understanding that all the  damage\r\nstemmed from flooding within the contemplation of their policies.\r\nBut though  the Passman letter contends that the Arkwright policy\r\naffords coverage, it does not assert that the physical damage was\r\nfacilitated  by any phenomenon other than flood, nor does it take\r\nissue with the sequence of events as found by the district court.\r\nThus,  the  Passman letter  raised  no  trialworthy  issue.

(\"Olympia\") owned a high-rise office building at 55 Water Street, New York, New York (\"Water Street Building\").  On December 11th of that year, a severe storm struck New York City, causing the Hudson and East Rivers to overflow their banks.  Flood waters entered the basement of the Water Street Building through cracks in its foundation, resulting in more than one million dollars in property damage.  Slightly more than half the damage involved energized electrical switching panels which had come into contact with the flood waters.  The water immediately caused a phenomenon known as \"electrical arcing\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>--an electrical short circuit, in lay terms--which in turn caused an immediate explosion that blew large holes in the switching panels.  C &amp; H appraised the damage to the switching panels at $581,225.  Much of the remaining damage, appraised at $445,592, occurred when the flood waters came in contact with non-energized electrical equipment;  it involved no electrical arcing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the storm, three separate policies provided various coverages for the Water Street Building.  Two of the policies--identical \"all risk\" policies separately issued by appellants Continental and Hartford--insured against \"all risks including Flood and Earthquake\" up to $75,000,000 per occurrence for the one-year period beginning March 3, 1992.  Each policy underwrote fifty percent of the $75,000,000 \"all risk\" coverage on identical terms and conditions, and contained a $100,000 deductible for any loss and damage arising out of each covered occurrence.  In addition, each \"all risk\" policy excluded coverage for mechanical or electrical breakdown caused by artificially generated electrical currents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third policy, issued by appellee Arkwright, a Massachusetts corporation, afforded $3,000,000,000 in total liability coverage for the three-year period between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 1995, on approximately forty buildings owned by Olympia around the world.  As concerns the Water Street Building in particular, the Arkwright policy afforded up to $100,000,000 in covered property loss from flooding, subject to a $75,000,000 deductible.  Thus, the Arkwright policy principally served as excess \"all risk\" coverage above the $75,000,000 liability limit on the two separate \"all risk\" policies issued by appellants Continental and Hartford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Arkwright policy on the Water Street Building included a \"Special Deductible Endorsement,\" which afforded primary insurance coverage for mechanical or electrical breakdown by substituting a $50,000 deductible for the $75,000,000 \"all risk\" deductible in the Arkwright policy.  The $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement was subject to the following qualifications:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In the event of insured loss or damage under the policy to which this endorsement is attached, the Loss or Damage described below shall be subject to the following deductible amount(s) in lieu of any other Policy deductible amount(s) except those for Flood, Earthquake or Service Interruption if applicable:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[$50,000.00 ]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

It maintained that the entire loss had been caused by flooding and therefore came within the coverage afforded under the two primary \"all risk\" policies issued by appellants.  Continental and Hartford promptly paid $937,557 to Olympia, representing coverage for the entire loss less a $100,000 deductible, then claimed reimbursement from Arkwright for the $581,225 loss to the electrical switching panels allegedly caused by electrical arcing.  Arkwright refused to contribute, contending that all damage to the Water Street Building had been caused by, or resulted directly from, flooding.  Relying on the Special Deductible Endorsement language--\"in lieu of any other Policy deductible amount(s) except those for Flood\"--Arkwright insisted that since the damage had been due to flood, the $50,000 deductible in its endorsement did not displace the $75,000,000 deductible in its policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continental and Hartford instituted this diversity proceeding in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking a judicial declaration that Arkwright was liable for the portion of the electrical switching panel loss due to electrical arcing.  After all parties moved for summary judgment based on their respective interpretations of the applicable New York caselaw, the district court concluded that under the Arkwright insurance contract, including its Special Deductible Endorsement, as viewed by a reasonable business person in the relevant circumstances, see Bird v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 224 N.Y. 47, 120 N.E. 86 (1918), the damage to the electrical switching panels had been caused by flooding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that in identifying the cause of the storm-related damage to the electrical switching panels, a reasonable business person would not have segregated the flooding from the arcing.  The court based its conclusion on the fact that the $50,000 deductible is made inapplicable to flood loss by the express language in the Special Deductible Endorsement excluding electrical breakdown due to flood, as well as the fact that all the damage occurred virtually simultaneously at the same site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Continental and Hartford challenge the district court ruling that the flooding, rather than the electrical arcing, constituted the legal cause of the damage to the electrical switching panels.  Their proximate causation analysis focuses upon what point in the \"proverbial chain of causation\" a particular cause ceases to be remote and becomes the \"legal cause\" of the damage.  See Richard A. Fierce, Insurance Law-Concurrent Causation:  Examination of Alternative Approaches, 1985 S. Ill.  U. L.J. 527, 534 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Causation under New York Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants first contend that the district court misapplied New York law in ruling that a reasonable business person would consider the switching panels to have been damaged by flood rather than electrical arcing.  Under established New York law governing insurance contract interpretation, appellants maintain, the district court was required to identify the most direct, physical cause of the damage, or what is termed \"the dominant and proximate cause.\"   Novick v. United Servs.  Auto. Ass'n, 639 N.Y.S.2d 469, 471 (App.Div.1996).  According to appellants, the most direct, physical cause of a loss under New York law \"is that which is nearest to the loss because [it] is invariably the most direct and obvious cause.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants predicate their contention principally upon Home Ins. Co. v. American Ins. Co., 147 A.D.2d 353, 537 N.Y.S.2d 516 (1989), where water and steam precipitated electrical arcing which in turn damaged electrical equipment in a high-rise building.  There the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, held that electrical arcing, not steam, caused the damage, since the steam \"merely set the stage\" for the subsequent arcing and therefore constituted the remote, rather than the proximate, cause of the loss.  Id., 537 N.Y.S.2d at 517 (\" '[T]he causation inquiry stops at the efficient physical cause of the loss;  it does not trace events back to their metaphysical beginnings ....' \") (quoting Pan Am.  World Airways, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 505 F.2d 989, 1006 (2d Cir.1974)).  Similarly, appellants maintain that the efficient, legal cause of the damage to the switching panels in the present case was the electrical arcing, whereas the flooding merely set the stage for the arcing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Consequently, appellants conclude, the district court need have looked no further than the phenomenon of electrical arcing for the legal cause of the damage to the switching panels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the language in the Arkwright insurance contract to determine whether the damage to the switching panels was legally caused by flooding or electrical arcing.  Under New York law, insurance policies are to be interpreted in accordance with their terms.  See, e.g., Frey v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas., 221 A.D.2d 841, 633 N.Y.S.2d 880, 882 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases involving an electrical breakdown not caused by lightning, the Special Deductible Endorsement substitutes a $50,000 deductible for the $75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright liability policy proper, except in cases where the higher deductible for \"Flood\" is \"applicable.\"   Appellants would have the court interpret the operative provision (\"in lieu of any other Policy amount(s) except those for Flood ... if applicable\") to mean that the $75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright liability policy proper applies only if there is a separate, specific policy deductible for flood damage.  Absent such a specific deductible for flood damage, appellants say, the exception for loss from flooding found in the $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement is never triggered;  therefore, the electrical breakdown damage to the switching panels comes within the $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement, displacing the $75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright policy itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants misinterpret the plain language in the Special Deductible Endorsement, which unambiguously indicates that the $50,000 deductible does not apply if another deductible for flooding damage does apply.   Furthermore, the \"all risk\" general liability coverage in the Arkwright policy itself expressly insures against \"loss or damage resulting from a single occurrence,\" including flood.  Thus, the plain language employed in both the Special Deductible Endorsement and the Arkwright general liability policy itself, compatibly interpreted in context, means that damage to mechanical or electrical equipment proximately caused by flooding comes within the exception to the $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement and hence the $75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright general liability policy applies in such a situation.  See, e.g., Harris v. Allstate Ins. Co., 309 N.Y. 72, 127 N.E.2d 816, 817 (1955) (\"words of the policy are to be read in context, the language construed fairly and reasonably with an eye to the object and purpose to be achieved by the writing\");  Moshiko, Inc. v. Seiger &amp; Smith, Inc., 137 A.D.2d 170, 529 N.Y.S.2d 284, 287 (1988) (policy endorsements to be read in context of general liability provisions).  \"Where the provisions of the policy are 'clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning....,' \"  United States Fidelity &amp; Guar.

Kligler, 42 N.Y.2d 863, 864, 397 N.Y.S.2d 777, 366 N.E.2d 865 (1977)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>2.

Great N. Ins. Co. v. Dayco, 637 F.Supp. 765, 778 (S.D.N.Y.1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Moreover, in the context of an insurance contract, our inquiry may not proceed beyond the dominant, efficient, physical cause of the loss.  Home Insurance, 537 N.Y.S.2d at 517.   Ultimate causation--or what the Second Circuit has referred to as the \"metaphysical beginnings\"--is not our concern.  Pan Am.  World Airways, Inc. v.

In its seminal discourse on the \"loss causation\" inquiry under an insurance contract, the New York Court of Appeals charted the course:  \"[O]ur guide is the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary business man when making an ordinary business contract.  It is his intention, expressed or fairly to be inferred, that counts.  There are times when the law permits us to go far back in tracing events to causes.\"  Bird v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 224 N.Y. 47, 120 N.E. 86, 87 (1918) (Cardozo, J.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bird case involved a fire insurance contract on a vessel.  Within the policy period, a fire of unknown origin broke out beneath some freight cars loaded with explosives and located at a considerable distance from the pier where the insured vessel was docked.  After burning for approximately 30 minutes, the freight cars exploded, causing another fire, which in turn caused a second explosion, the concussion from which damaged the insured vessel located some 1,000 feet from the site of the second explosion.  No fire reached the vessel.  Id., 120 N.E. at 86.   Then-Judge Cardozo, writing for New York's highest court, employed a pragmatic, \"commonsense appraisement\" of the circumstances, id. at 87 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), in determining as a matter of law that coverage of the concussion damage sustained by the vessel could not be said to have been within the \"range of probable expectation\" under a policy which protected against fire.  Id. at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical consideration in Bird was the \"element of proximity in space.\"  Id. at 87.   As the initiating event--the fire in the freight cars--occurred a great distance from the insured vessel, the court held that \"there was never exposure to its direct perils\" and that the exposure to its indirect perils--i.e., the concussion from the second explosion--came \"only through the presence of extraordinary conditions, the release and intervention of tremendous forces of destruction.\"  Id. Consequently, the court concluded, reasonable business people would not have expected that an insurance policy affording protection against fire would cover damage to a vessel following successive concussions precipitated by explosions caused by the fire in the distant freightyard.  As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The case comes, therefore, to this.  Fire must reach the thing insured, or come within such proximity to it that damage, direct or indirect, is within the compass of reasonable probability.  Then only is it the proximate cause, because then only may we suppose that it was within the contemplation of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 88 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, absent an explicit policy declaration of the parties' intention, the contemplation of their insurance contract must be inferred by the court from all the circumstances surrounding the loss, including whether a peril insured against came directly or indirectly within such proximity to the property insured that the damage it sustained fairly can be considered \"within the compass of reasonable probability.\"  Id. Among the factors which must be assessed are the spatial and temporal proximity between the insured peril and the claimed loss.  See R. Dennis Withers, Proximate Cause and Multiple Causation in First--Party Insurance Cases, 20 Forum 256, 260 (January 1985) (Bird considers \"proximity of a cause as a judgment to be made upon matters of fact,\" including \"proximity in space.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case involves no spatial or temporal attenuation at all comparable to that present in Bird.  The flood waters came directly in contact with the electrical equipment in the Water Street Building, instantaneously precipitating the arcing which in turn caused the immediate short-circuiting and explosion that damaged the switching panels.  At most, mere seconds would have elapsed from the time the flood waters directly contacted the electrical equipment until the electrical switching panels exploded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where any spatial and temporal separation between the covered peril and the ensuing loss is so minimal as to be virtually nonexistent, Bird clearly contemplates that the loss be considered well within the \"compass of reasonable probability\" and therefore inferentially within the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract.  See Bird, 120 N.E. at 88.   Consequently, given the absence of any significant spatial separation or temporal remoteness between the insurgent flood waters, the electrical arcing and the explosion of the switching panels, we believe the district court correctly concluded that flooding proximately caused the loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recent New York caselaw continues implicitly to recognize the significance of what the Court of Appeals in Bird called the \"element of proximity in space,\" see id. at 87, as well as the temporal element.  In Home Insurance, for example, the Court of Appeals recently held electrical arcing to be the proximate cause of damage where arcing had been precipitated by a gradual intrusion of moisture.  The court elucidated upon its analysis as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>There was no flow of water directly onto the bus duct system.  Rather, the moisture saturated the duct insulation and supports, which had deteriorated due to age and environment, resulting in breakdown of the insulation and permitting an arc to result ....  Upon review of the record before this Court, we find that ... the steam merely set the stage for the later event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Home Ins.

This passage distinguishes an intrusion of water and steam into a basement, gradually causing moisture to seep through deteriorating building materials into a duct, from a situation in which water flows directly onto an electrical system, causing immediate arcing and damage to the electrical system.  In Home Insurance, substantial time and space separated the peril (the water and steam entering the basement) from the eventual electrical damage to the duct system resulting from the moisture gradually generated by the water and steam.  Also interposed between the peril and the damage in Home Insurance were the deteriorating insulation and supports, which gave rise to a considerably greater spatial separation than occurred here.  \"There is no use in arguing that distance ought not to count if life and experience tell us that it does.\"  Bird, 120 N.E. at 87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, neither Bird nor Home Insurance involved circumstances similar to the present, where flood waters flowed directly onto electrical equipment, immediately precipitating in turn the instantaneous electrical arcing, the short-circuiting, and the explosion which damaged the switching panels.  Accordingly, as the district court correctly ruled, the insurgent flood waters cannot reasonably be thought simply to have \"set the stage\" for a remote event, or to have been merely some metaphysical beginning to a succession of temporally remote events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Temporal remoteness and spatial separation distinguish many recent New York cases cited by appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Given the importance placed upon temporal remoteness and spatial separation in Bird, 120 N.E. at 88, the wellspring decision under New York law, we conclude that the district court correctly held that the legal cause of the damage to the electrical switching panels was the flooding, not electrical arcing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We therefore hold that a reasonable business person would consider that the damage sustained by the electrical switching panels in the Water Street Building, just as any other water damage to the building, was caused by flood.  That is to say, as then-Judge Cardozo did, since the flood waters surged onto the site of the loss, a reasonable business person would consider the damage to the electrical switching panels to have been \"within the danger zone of ordinary experience,\" see id. at 87, and consequently would expect the Continental and Hartford flood policy coverages, not the Arkwright Special Deductible Endorsement, to afford Olympia indemnification for the loss.  Thus, the exception to the Arkwright Special Deductible Endorsement applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Appropriateness of Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn briefly to appellants' alternate contention.  Continental and Hartford argue that the inquiry into the dominant and efficient cause of the loss presents a question of fact inappropriate for summary judgment.  Once again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, the determination as to which of two causes was the dominant and efficient cause of a loss is for the factfinder.  See, e.g., Molycorp, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 78 A.D.2d 510, 431 N.Y.S.2d 824, 825-26 (1980);  Novick, 639 N.Y.S.2d at 471.   The trial courts in the cited cases, however, were presented with a factual question as to which of the two perils physically caused the loss.  In our case, on the other hand, there is no dispute concerning the physical, as distinguished from the legal, cause of the damage--i.e., what physical phenomenon precipitated the alteration to the electrical switching panels.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  As the New York Court of Appeals explained in Bird:  \"For the physicist one thing is cause, for the jurist, another.\"  Bird, 120 N.E. at 88.   Thus, the question before this court, as in Bird, is the question of law already resolved above:  What would the New York courts determine to have been the legal or proximate cause of the loss?   Like the district court, we hold that flood was the legal cause of the loss in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly applied the controlling New York law, the judgment is affirmed.

In cases involving an electrical breakdown, the language of the Special Deductible Endorsement triggers the $50,000 deductible \"in lieu of any other Policy amount(s) except those for Flood ... if applicable.\"   As noted above, appellants argue that the phrase \"other Policy amounts\" should be read to mean other specific deductible amounts not including the $75,000,000 general deductible in the Arkwright general liability policy.  But since no other deductible amount for flood exists in the Arkwright policy covering the Water Street Building, and appellants have not been able to demonstrate the existence of any other special flood deductible in the entire Arkwright policy covering Olympia properties in general, their interpretation would mean that the phrase \"in lieu of other Policy amounts\" is \"mere surplusage\"--as, indeed, appellants concede in their brief</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Arkwright maintained at oral argument that the Special Deductible Endorsement excludes arcing whenever flood is the remote as well as the proximate cause of the damage.

(\"Olympia\") owned a high-rise office building at 55 Water Street, New York, New York (\"Water Street Building\").  On December 11th of that year, a severe storm struck New York City, causing the Hudson and East Rivers to overflow their banks.  Flood waters entered the basement of the Water Street Building through cracks in its foundation, resulting in more than one million dollars in property damage.  Slightly more than half the damage involved energized electrical switching panels which had come into contact with the flood waters.  The water immediately caused a phenomenon known as \"electrical arcing\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>--an electrical short circuit, in lay terms--which in turn caused an immediate explosion that blew large holes in the switching panels.  C &amp; H appraised the damage to the switching panels at $581,225.  Much of the remaining damage, appraised at $445,592, occurred when the flood waters came in contact with non-energized electrical equipment;  it involved no electrical arcing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the storm, three separate policies provided various coverages for the Water Street Building.  Two of the policies--identical \"all risk\" policies separately issued by appellants Continental and Hartford--insured against \"all risks including Flood and Earthquake\" up to $75,000,000 per occurrence for the one-year period beginning March 3, 1992.  Each policy underwrote fifty percent of the $75,000,000 \"all risk\" coverage on identical terms and conditions, and contained a $100,000 deductible for any loss and damage arising out of each covered occurrence.  In addition, each \"all risk\" policy excluded coverage for mechanical or electrical breakdown caused by artificially generated electrical currents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third policy, issued by appellee Arkwright, a Massachusetts corporation, afforded $3,000,000,000 in total liability coverage for the three-year period between January 1, 1992 and January 1, 1995, on approximately forty buildings owned by Olympia around the world.  As concerns the Water Street Building in particular, the Arkwright policy afforded up to $100,000,000 in covered property loss from flooding, subject to a $75,000,000 deductible.  Thus, the Arkwright policy principally served as excess \"all risk\" coverage above the $75,000,000 liability limit on the two separate \"all risk\" policies issued by appellants Continental and Hartford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Arkwright policy on the Water Street Building included a \"Special Deductible Endorsement,\" which afforded primary insurance coverage for mechanical or electrical breakdown by substituting a $50,000 deductible for the $75,000,000 \"all risk\" deductible in the Arkwright policy.  The $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement was subject to the following qualifications:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In the event of insured loss or damage under the policy to which this endorsement is attached, the Loss or Damage described below shall be subject to the following deductible amount(s) in lieu of any other Policy deductible amount(s) except those for Flood, Earthquake or Service Interruption if applicable:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[$50,000.00 ]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

It maintained that the entire loss had been caused by flooding and therefore came within the coverage afforded under the two primary \"all risk\" policies issued by appellants.  Continental and Hartford promptly paid $937,557 to Olympia, representing coverage for the entire loss less a $100,000 deductible, then claimed reimbursement from Arkwright for the $581,225 loss to the electrical switching panels allegedly caused by electrical arcing.  Arkwright refused to contribute, contending that all damage to the Water Street Building had been caused by, or resulted directly from, flooding.  Relying on the Special Deductible Endorsement language--\"in lieu of any other Policy deductible amount(s) except those for Flood\"--Arkwright insisted that since the damage had been due to flood, the $50,000 deductible in its endorsement did not displace the $75,000,000 deductible in its policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continental and Hartford instituted this diversity proceeding in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking a judicial declaration that Arkwright was liable for the portion of the electrical switching panel loss due to electrical arcing.  After all parties moved for summary judgment based on their respective interpretations of the applicable New York caselaw, the district court concluded that under the Arkwright insurance contract, including its Special Deductible Endorsement, as viewed by a reasonable business person in the relevant circumstances, see Bird v.

The court based its conclusion on the fact that the $50,000 deductible is made inapplicable to flood loss by the express language in the Special Deductible Endorsement excluding electrical breakdown due to flood, as well as the fact that all the damage occurred virtually simultaneously at the same site.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Continental and Hartford challenge the district court ruling that the flooding, rather than the electrical arcing, constituted the legal cause of the damage to the electrical switching panels.

Absent such a specific deductible for flood damage, appellants say, the exception for loss from flooding found in the $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement is never triggered;  therefore, the electrical breakdown damage to the switching panels comes within the $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement, displacing the $75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright policy itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants misinterpret the plain language in the Special Deductible Endorsement, which unambiguously indicates that the $50,000 deductible does not apply if another deductible for flooding damage does apply.   Furthermore, the \"all risk\" general liability coverage in the Arkwright policy itself expressly insures against \"loss or damage resulting from a single occurrence,\" including flood.  Thus, the plain language employed in both the Special Deductible Endorsement and the Arkwright general liability policy itself, compatibly interpreted in context, means that damage to mechanical or electrical equipment proximately caused by flooding comes within the exception to the $50,000 Special Deductible Endorsement and hence the $75,000,000 deductible in the Arkwright general liability policy applies in such a situation.

Within the policy period, a fire of unknown origin broke out beneath some freight cars loaded with explosives and located at a considerable distance from the pier where the insured vessel was docked.  After burning for approximately 30 minutes, the freight cars exploded, causing another fire, which in turn caused a second explosion, the concussion from which damaged the insured vessel located some 1,000 feet from the site of the second explosion.  No fire reached the vessel.  Id., 120 N.E. at 86.   Then-Judge Cardozo, writing for New York's highest court, employed a pragmatic, \"commonsense appraisement\" of the circumstances, id. at 87 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), in determining as a matter of law that coverage of the concussion damage sustained by the vessel could not be said to have been within the \"range of probable expectation\" under a policy which protected against fire.  Id. at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical consideration in Bird was the \"element of proximity in space.\"  Id. at 87.   As the initiating event--the fire in the freight cars--occurred a great distance from the insured vessel, the court held that \"there was never exposure to its direct perils\" and that the exposure to its indirect perils--i.e., the concussion from the second explosion--came \"only through the presence of extraordinary conditions, the release and intervention of tremendous forces of destruction.\"  Id. Consequently, the court concluded, reasonable business people would not have expected that an insurance policy affording protection against fire would cover damage to a vessel following successive concussions precipitated by explosions caused by the fire in the distant freightyard.  As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The case comes, therefore, to this.  Fire must reach the thing insured, or come within such proximity to it that damage, direct or indirect, is within the compass of reasonable probability.  Then only is it the proximate cause, because then only may we suppose that it was within the contemplation of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 88 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, absent an explicit policy declaration of the parties' intention, the contemplation of their insurance contract must be inferred by the court from all the circumstances surrounding the loss, including whether a peril insured against came directly or indirectly within such proximity to the property insured that the damage it sustained fairly can be considered \"within the compass of reasonable probability.\"  Id. Among the factors which must be assessed are the spatial and temporal proximity between the insured peril and the claimed loss.  See R. Dennis Withers, Proximate Cause and Multiple Causation in First--Party Insurance Cases, 20 Forum 256, 260 (January 1985) (Bird considers \"proximity of a cause as a judgment to be made upon matters of fact,\" including \"proximity in space.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case involves no spatial or temporal attenuation at all comparable to that present in Bird.  The flood waters came directly in contact with the electrical equipment in the Water Street Building, instantaneously precipitating the arcing which in turn caused the immediate short-circuiting and explosion that damaged the switching panels.  At most, mere seconds would have elapsed from the time the flood waters directly contacted the electrical equipment until the electrical switching panels exploded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where any spatial and temporal separation between the covered peril and the ensuing loss is so minimal as to be virtually nonexistent, Bird clearly contemplates that the loss be considered well within the \"compass of reasonable probability\" and therefore inferentially within the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract.  See Bird, 120 N.E. at 88.   Consequently, given the absence of any significant spatial separation or temporal remoteness between the insurgent flood waters, the electrical arcing and the explosion of the switching panels, we believe the district court correctly concluded that flooding proximately caused the loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recent New York caselaw continues implicitly to recognize the significance of what the Court of Appeals in Bird called the \"element of proximity in space,\" see id. at 87, as well as the temporal element.  In Home Insurance, for example, the Court of Appeals recently held electrical arcing to be the proximate cause of damage where arcing had been precipitated by a gradual intrusion of moisture.  The court elucidated upon its analysis as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>There was no flow of water directly onto the bus duct system.  Rather, the moisture saturated the duct insulation and supports, which had deteriorated due to age and environment, resulting in breakdown of the insulation and permitting an arc to result ....  Upon review of the record before this Court, we find that ... the steam merely set the stage for the later event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Home Ins. Co., 537 N.Y.S.2d at 517 (emphasis added).  This passage distinguishes an intrusion of water and steam into a basement, gradually causing moisture to seep through deteriorating building materials into a duct, from a situation in which water flows directly onto an electrical system, causing immediate arcing and damage to the electrical system.  In Home Insurance, substantial time and space separated the peril (the water and steam entering the basement) from the eventual electrical damage to the duct system resulting from the moisture gradually generated by the water and steam.  Also interposed between the peril and the damage in Home Insurance were the deteriorating insulation and supports, which gave rise to a considerably greater spatial separation than occurred here.  \"There is no use in arguing that distance ought not to count if life and experience tell us that it does.\"  Bird, 120 N.E. at 87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, neither Bird nor Home Insurance involved circumstances similar to the present, where flood waters flowed directly onto electrical equipment, immediately precipitating in turn the instantaneous electrical arcing, the short-circuiting, and the explosion which damaged the switching panels.  Accordingly, as the district court correctly ruled, the insurgent flood waters cannot reasonably be thought simply to have \"set the stage\" for a remote event, or to have been merely some metaphysical beginning to a succession of temporally remote events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Temporal remoteness and spatial separation distinguish many recent New York cases cited by appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Given the importance placed upon temporal remoteness and spatial separation in Bird, 120 N.E. at 88, the wellspring decision under New York law, we conclude that the district court correctly held that the legal cause of the damage to the electrical switching panels was the flooding, not electrical arcing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We therefore hold that a reasonable business person would consider that the damage sustained by the electrical switching panels in the Water Street Building, just as any other water damage to the building, was caused by flood.  That is to say, as then-Judge Cardozo did, since the flood waters surged onto the site of the loss, a reasonable business person would consider the damage to the electrical switching panels to have been \"within the danger zone of ordinary experience,\" see id. at 87, and consequently would expect the Continental and Hartford flood policy coverages, not the Arkwright Special Deductible Endorsement, to afford Olympia indemnification for the loss.  Thus, the exception to the Arkwright Special Deductible Endorsement applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Appropriateness of Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn briefly to appellants' alternate contention.  Continental and Hartford argue that the inquiry into the dominant and efficient cause of the loss presents a question of fact inappropriate for summary judgment.  Once again, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, the determination as to which of two causes was the dominant and efficient cause of a loss is for the factfinder.  See, e.g., Molycorp, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></span>, 825-26 (1980);  Novick, 639 N.Y.S.2d at 471.   The trial courts in the cited cases, however, were presented with a factual question as to which of the two perils physically caused the loss.  In our case, on the other hand, there is no dispute concerning the physical, as distinguished from the legal, cause of the damage--i.e., what physical phenomenon precipitated the alteration to the electrical switching panels.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  As the New York Court of Appeals explained in Bird:  \"For the physicist one thing is cause, for the jurist, another.\"  Bird, 120 N.E. at 88.   Thus, the question before this court, as in Bird, is the question of law already resolved above:  What would the New York courts determine to have been the legal or proximate cause of the loss?   Like the district court, we hold that flood was the legal cause of the loss in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly applied the controlling New York law, the judgment is affirmed.

In cases involving an electrical breakdown, the language of the Special Deductible Endorsement triggers the $50,000 deductible \"in lieu of any other Policy amount(s) except those for Flood ... if applicable.\"   As noted above, appellants argue that the phrase \"other Policy amounts\" should be read to mean other specific deductible amounts not including the $75,000,000 general deductible in the Arkwright general liability policy.  But since no other deductible amount for flood exists in the Arkwright policy covering the Water Street Building, and appellants have not been able to demonstrate the existence of any other special flood deductible in the entire Arkwright policy covering Olympia properties in general, their interpretation would mean that the phrase \"in lieu of other Policy amounts\" is \"mere surplusage\"--as, indeed, appellants concede in their brief</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Arkwright maintained at oral argument that the Special Deductible Endorsement excludes arcing whenever flood is the remote as well as the proximate cause of the damage.

The Passman letter is said to contradict the affidavit of Olympia's risk manager, David Roth, who filed the claim for loss against appellants only, based on his understanding that all the damage stemmed from flooding within the contemplation of their policies.  But though the Passman letter contends that the Arkwright policy affords coverage, it does not assert that the physical damage was facilitated by any phenomenon other than flood, nor does it take issue with the sequence of events as found by the district court.  Thus, the Passman letter raised no trialworthy issue.  See Guzman-Rivera v.
