RADKOVA,\n\n                           Petitioners,\n\n                                v.\n\n              IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE,\n\n                            Respondent.\n\n\n\n      ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF DEPORTATION\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Stahl, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n         Peter Popov for petitioners.\n\n          Brenda M. O'Malley, with whom David W. Ogden, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Senior Litigation Counsel,\nwere on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         December 20, 2000\n\f         Per Curiam. The key question in this case is whether\n\ncounsel of record for the petitioners was ever mailed the BIA's\n\nDecember 29, 1998 decision denying petitioners' application for\n\npolitical asylum1 and therefore excluding the petitioners as aliens\n\nnot in possession of valid immigrant visas.    If the decision was sent\n\nout in due course, then the petitioners missed the ninety-day\n\ndeadline to move to reopen from the final administrative decision.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(2).    The petitioners did file a motion to\n\nreopen, which was received by the BIA on July 15, 1999 and denied as\n\nuntimely on June 1, 2000.2\n\nIn support of their motion to reopen, petitioners submitted an\n\naffidavit from their attorney of record at the time, Sylvia J.\n\nRolinski, Esq., stating that she never received the BIA's December\n\n29, 1998 decision.   In its June 1, 2000 decision, the BIA found that\n\npetitioners' motion to reopen was not timely filed.\n\n\n\n    1\n          Petitioner Marta D.P. Radkova did not submit a separate\nasylum application but was included as a derivative beneficiary\nin the asylum application of her husband, petitioner Radko\nRadkov.\n    2\n          The BIA also concluded that even were it to construe\npetitioners' motion as one to reconsider, it would likewise deny\nit as untimely filed.     See 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(b)(2) (motion to\nreconsider must be filed within thirty days of decision by BIA).\n\n                               -2-\n\f            Two provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations interact\n\non the timeliness issue.    The first, 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(2) provides\n\nthat the:\n\n          motion [to reopen] must be filed no later than 90 days\n          after the date which the final administrative decision was\n          rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\nThe second, 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(f), provides that:\n\n            The decision of the Board shall be in writing and copies\n            thereof shall be transmitted by the Board to the Service\n            and a copy shall be served upon the alien or party\n            affected as provided in Part 292 of this chapter.3\n\nThe courts have generally held that the time for filing a review\n\npetition begins to run when the BIA complies with the terms of the\n\nfederal regulations by mailing its decision to a petitioner's address\n\nof record.    See, e.g., Martinez-Serrano v. INS, 94 F.3d 1256, 1258-59\n\n(9th Cir. 1996); Ouedraogo v. INS, 864 F.2d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\nIn instances where it is undisputed that the BIA decision was mailed,\n\nat least one court has held that the fact that counsel did not\n\nreceive the notice did not excuse the failure to file.    See Nowak v.\n\nINS, 94 F.3d 390, 391-92 (7th Cir. 1996).    We do not reach the latter\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n    3\n     Section 292 of Title 8 of the Code provides that service of\na final deportation order may be upon an alien's counsel of\nrecord. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5 (requiring service of \"any paper\nother than a warrant of arrest or a subpoena\" upon \"the attorney\nor representative of record, or the person himself if\nunrepresented\"); Arreaza-Cruz v. INS, 39 F.3d 909, 911 (9th Cir.\n1994).\n\n                                -3-\n\f          The difficulty for judicial review is that the BIA's\n\ndecision not to reopen appears to be based on an argument not\n\nparticularly germane to the core issue.     Petitioners have put into\n\nquestion whether the December 29 decision was in fact mailed by the\n\nBIA.   The BIA focused on the assumption that the decision had been\n\nmailed to the attorney of record, Rolinski, at the address provided\n\non the notice of entry of appearance previously submitted to the BIA\n\non December 22, 1992.   This appears to be in response to a statement\n\nin attorney Rolinski's affidavit that she had changed her address in\n\nOctober, 1993 and so notified the agency.     The BIA concluded that the\n\nrecord did not reflect any written notice of such change.     Thus the\n\nBIA's decision seems to rest on its right to disregard the asserted\n\nchange in the attorney’s business mailing address.\n\n          However, that issue -- the issue of the attorney's proper\n\naddress -- is, in our view, irrelevant, because attorney Rolinski\n\nalso states in her affidavit that she continued to receive mail at\n\nboth addresses and simply did not receive the December 29, 1998\n\ndecision at either address.   In denying petitioners' motion to\n\nreopen, the BIA did not address the sworn contention by Rolinski that\n\nshe never received the December 29, 1998 decision, which raises the\n\nquestion of whether the December 29 decision was ever actually\n\nmailed.   It is true that the record shows a copy of BIA Chairman Paul\n\nW. Schmidt's transmittal letter dated December 29, 1998, but the\n\n\n                              -4-\n\fBIA's June 1 decision does not address the claim that the earlier\n\ndecision and letter were never sent out.\n\n          Because the BIA's decision appears to be based on\n\nreasoning extraneous to the central issue, we vacate and remand for\n\nfurther consideration and explanation of whether the December 29\n\nopinion and order was in fact properly mailed, see 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(f),\n\nin light of the affidavit from counsel that it was never received,\n\ncf. Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43-47 (1st Cir. 1998). On remand the\n\nBIA should also consider the apparent absence in the record of a\n\ncontemporaneous notation, such as an entry on a docket sheet, that\n\nwould support a finding that the December 29 decision was in fact\n\nmailed.   See Ouedraogo, 864 F.2d at 378.   Both parties are free to\n\nsubmit additional evidence on remand.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f",
