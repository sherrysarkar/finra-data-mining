Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance\r\nCo., Ltd. (\"Tokyo Marine\"), as subrogee to the rights of its\r\ninsured, Mitsubishi Motors Sales of the Caribbean, Inc.\r\n(\"Mitsubishi\"), filed this tort suit in diversity against defendant\r\nPrez y Ca. de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Prez y Ca.\") for the damage\r\ncaused to vehicles owned by Mitsubishi while they were stored at a\r\nfacility owned by Prez y Ca.  After holding a bench trial, the\r\ndistrict court entered judgment finding Prez y Ca. liable to\r\nTokyo Marine on seven out of the eight counts in the complaint. \r\nTokyo Marine and Prez y Ca. now cross-appeal from the judgment of\r\nthe district court.  Tokyo Marine contends that the district court\r\nerred in finding that the first count of its complaint was time-\r\nbarred, while Prez y Ca. challenges the court's finding of\r\nliability.  Prez y Ca. also appeals from the district court's\r\ndecision to award attorneys' fees to Tokyo Marine under P.R. R.\r\nCiv. P. 44.1 as a sanction for what it perceived as Prez y Ca.'s\r\nobstinate conduct in this litigation.  For the reasons explained\r\nbelow, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nI.  Background\r\nWe recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\njudgment.  See Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Boulos, 89 F.3d 17,\r\n18 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nThis case involves eight shipments of cars owned by\r\nMitsubishi that were damaged while they were stored at a harbor-\r\nside lot owned by defendant Prez y Ca.  On February 15, 1993, the\r\nM/V ORION HIGHWAY arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and docked at\r\na berthing facility owned by Prez y Ca.  The ship was carrying\r\nthe first shipment of cars at issue in this case, which consisted\r\nof 619 Mitsubishi-brand motor vehicles consigned to Mitsubishi\r\nMotors Sales of the Caribbean, Inc.  The cars were discharged and\r\nstationed on Prez y Ca.'s lot for one week, at the end of which\r\nthey were delivered to Mitsubishi.  The Prez y Ca. dock and\r\nstorage lot were chosen by San Juan Mercantile Corp., Mitsubishi's\r\nagent and stevedoring contractor.  San Juan Mercantile was\r\nresponsible for the vehicles from the time of discharge until they\r\nwere delivered to Mitsubishi.\r\n Tokyo Marine had a working arrangement with Intermodal\r\nTransportation Services, Inc. (\"Intermodal\"), a Florida firm that\r\nprovides survey services, whereby Intermodal surveyed vehicle\r\ndamage claims presented to Tokyo Marine under the insurance policy\r\nissued to Mitsubishi.  Pursuant to this arrangement, Intermodal's\r\nsurveyors would conduct \"hatch and discharge\" surveys of vehicle\r\nshipments when they arrived at a port, and \"first point of rest\"\r\nsurveys just after the vehicles were discharged.  The purpose of\r\nthese surveys was to discover any damage to the vehicles, and to\r\ndetermine whether such damage occurred before, during, or after the\r\ndischarge of the vehicles from the ship.\r\nAfter the M/V ORION HIGHWAY arrived, a local surveyor\r\nretained by Intermodal performed hatch, discharge, and first point\r\nof rest surveys of the shipment, and found the vehicles to be free\r\nof paint damage.  When the vehicles were delivered to Mitsubishi a\r\nweek later, however, many were found to be covered with a light\r\ndusting of paint.  It was later discovered that during the week\r\nthat the cars were parked at Prez y Ca.'s lot, Prez y Ca.\r\nemployees were also painting an ocean-going barge at a drydock\r\ndirectly adjacent to the lot on its upwind side.  After hearing\r\nevidence on the issue, the district court found that the Mitsubishi\r\nvehicles were damaged by free-floating paint that wafted onto the\r\nvehicles.  \r\nThe district court also found that Mitsubishi vehicles\r\nthat arrived in seven other shipments over the next year and a half\r\nwere damaged in like manner while they were stored at the Prez y\r\nCa. lot.  The district court determined that the claim based on\r\nthe damage to the vehicles in the first shipment was time-barred,\r\nbut allowed the claims arising from the damage to vehicles in the\r\nremaining seven shipments.  With regard to those claims, the\r\ndistrict court found that Prez y Ca. was negligent in permitting\r\nthe vehicles to be damaged because, although its employees knew of\r\nthe \"over spray\" problem, the company took no measures to avoid or\r\nprevent the problem.  The district court also found that Mitsubishi\r\nhad not acted in a comparatively negligent manner by continuing to\r\nstore its vehicles at the Prez y Ca. lot because, short of\r\nstopping vehicle shipments altogether, it could not prevent the use\r\nof the Prez y Ca. berthing and vehicle storage facilities.  The\r\ndistrict court therefore entered judgment for the plaintiff in the\r\namount of $243,530.  Finally, the district court concluded that the\r\ndefendant had been obstinate in its conduct of this litigation and\r\nwas therefore liable for attorneys' fees pursuant to P.R. R. Civ.\r\nP. 44.1. Both parties have appealed from the judgment below.\r\nII.  Statute of Limitations \r\nTokyo Marine argues that the district court erred in\r\nfinding that its claim for the damage caused to the cars in the M/V\r\nORION HIGHWAY shipment was barred by the applicable statute of\r\nlimitations.  This tort action was brought under Puerto Rico's tort\r\nstatute, article 1802 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\r\n5141.  Tort claims under article 1802 are subject to the one-year\r\nstatute of limitations provided by article 1868(2) of the Civil\r\nCode, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5298(2).  A cause of action under\r\narticle 1802 accrues - and the prescriptive period set by article\r\n1868(2) therefore begins to run - when the injured party knew or\r\nshould have known of the injury and of the likely identity of the\r\ntortfeasor.  See Coln-Prieto v. Gigel, 115 P.R. Dec. 232, 243\r\n(1984).  As noted above, the district court found that the cars in\r\nthe M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment were damaged at some point no later\r\nthan February 23, 1993.  This suit was filed on April 19, 1994,\r\nmore than one year after the cause of action had accrued. \r\nTherefore, unless the prescription of the cause of action was\r\ninterrupted, the cause of action relating to the cars in the M/V\r\nORION HIGHWAY shipment would be time-barred.\r\nPursuant to article 1873 of the Civil Code, a\r\nprescriptive period may be interrupted in one of three ways:  by\r\nthe institution of an action \"before the courts, by extrajudicial\r\nclaim of the creditor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt\r\nby the debtor.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5303 (official\r\ntranslation 1991).  Although prescription is an affirmative\r\ndefense, once it has been raised, the burden of proving that\r\nprescription has been interrupted shifts to the plaintiff.  SeeVelez-Rodrguez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 135 P.R. Dec.    , 1994 WL\r\n909577, at *8 (Mar. 18, 1994); Zambrana-Maldonado v. Puerto Rico,\r\n129 P.R. Dec.    , 1992 WL 754997, at *4 (Jan. 30, 1992).  Under\r\narticle 1874 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, the interruption of\r\nprescription against one defendant also tolls the statute against\r\nany other defendants who are solidarily liable with the first. \r\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5304 (\"Interruption of prescription\r\nof actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the\r\ncreditors or debtors.\") (official translation 1991); Arroyo v.\r\nHospital La Concepcin, 130 P.R. Dec.    , 1992 WL 755630, at *6\r\n(June 5, 1992).  Regardless of the method used, when the\r\nprescriptive period is successfully interrupted, the full period\r\nbegins to run again.  See Cintrn v. Puerto Rico, 127 P.R. Dec.\r\n582, 589 (1990); Daz-de-Diana v. A.J.A.S. Ins. Co., 110 P.R. Dec.\r\n471, 474 (1980).  \r\nNeither the first nor the third method of interrupting\r\nprescription is applicable here: no suit concerning the events in\r\nquestion was filed before April 19, 1994, and the defendants have\r\nconsistently denied liability.  The issue before us is therefore\r\nreduced to the question whether the plaintiff interposed an\r\n\"extrajudicial claim\" with regard to the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment\r\nthat successfully interrupted the prescription of the cause of\r\naction before the original one-year term expired on February 23,\r\n1994.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has often relied on a\r\ndefinition of \"extrajudicial claim\" written by Spanish commentator\r\nLuis Diez-Picazo: \r\n  In principle, claim stands for demand or\r\n  notice.  That is:  it is an act for which\r\n  the holder of a substantive right\r\n  addresses the passive subject of said\r\n  right, demanding that he adopt the\r\n  required conduct.\r\n\nLuis Diez-Picazo, La prescripcin en el Cdigo Civil [Prescription\r\nin the Civil Code] at 130 (Barcelona, Ed. Bosch 1964) (translation\r\nours) (cited in Cintrn, 127 P.R. Dec. at 592;  Secretario del\r\nTrabajo v. Finetex Hosiery Co., 116 P.R. Dec. 823, 827 (1986);\r\nDaz-de-Diana, 110 P.R. Dec. at 476).  As this court has previously\r\nexplained, an extrajudicial claim is subject to only a few\r\nrequirements:\r\n  [A]n extrajudicial claim does in fact\r\n  include virtually any demand formulated by\r\n  the creditor.  The only limitations are\r\n  that the claim must be made by the holder\r\n  of the substantive right (or his legal\r\n  representative), . . . it must be\r\n  addressed to the debtor or passive subject\r\n  of the right, not to a third party, . . .\r\n  and it must require or demand the same\r\n  conduct or relief ultimately sought in the\r\n  subsequent lawsuit.\r\n\nRodrguez-Nrvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 44 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(citations omitted); see Galib-Frangie v. El Vocero, Inc., 138 P.R.\r\nDec.    , 1995 WL 905884, at *3 (June 6, 1995) (enumerating\r\nrequirements for extrajudicial claims).  The prescriptive term is\r\ninterrupted on the date on which the defendant receives the\r\nextrajudicial claim.  See Daz-de-Diana, 110 P.R. Dec. at 477.\r\nIt follows that a letter sent by a tort plaintiff to the\r\ntortfeasor, complaining of the tortious conduct and demanding\r\ncompensation, is an extrajudicial claim that, if timely, interrupts\r\nthe prescription of the cause of action in tort.  Tokyo Marine\r\nargues that the parties involved in this suit sent each other\r\nseveral letters that, either separately or in conjunction,\r\nconstituted extrajudicial claims that tolled the statute of\r\nlimitations for the cause of action arising out of the M/V ORION\r\nHIGHWAY shipment.  Because we find that one of these letters\r\nsufficed to interrupt the prescription of this cause of action, we\r\nneed not consider the others. \r\nOn January 10, 1994, Tokyo Marine's attorneys wrote a\r\nletter to Prez y Ca.'s insurance company, Underwriters Adjustment\r\nCo., Inc. (\"UAC\"), stating that: \r\n  We have been retained by the interested\r\n  cargo underwriters to effect a recovery\r\n  for damage to Mitsubishi automobiles due\r\n  to paint over spray on February 15, 1993. \r\n  We are holding your assured, Prez y Ca.\r\n  de Puerto Rico, Inc. responsible for this\r\n  loss in the amount of $369,700.  The\r\n  following is a breakdown of the damages:\r\n  . . . .  Kindly acknowledge receipt of\r\n  this claim notice and provide us with your\r\n  settlement advises. \r\n\nThe letter was timely, was sent by persons with standing to do so,\r\nand sought the same relief subsequently claimed in this lawsuit. \r\nThis letter therefore constituted an extrajudicial claim that\r\nclearly interrupted the prescription of any claims against UAC.\r\nUAC, however, was never made a party to this suit.  Tokyo\r\nMarine contends that the interruption of prescription with regard\r\nto its claims against UAC also tolled the statute as to its claims\r\nagainst Prez y Ca.  As noted above, under article 1874 of the\r\nCivil Code, the interruption of the prescription of claims against\r\none defendant also interrupts the prescription of claims against\r\nany other defendants who are solidarily liable with the first. \r\nAccordingly, Tokyo Marine argues that UAC is solidarily liable for\r\nthe damage caused by its insured, Prez y Ca.\r\nThe concept of solidarity is defined by the provisions of\r\nCivil Code articles 1090-1115, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  3101-12,\r\nwhich establish the differences between mancomunal (similar to\r\n\"several\") and solidary obligations.  As noted before, solidarity\r\nis very similar to joint and several liability. See supra note 1. \r\nThe essential feature of solidarity is that the solidary debtors\r\nare jointly responsible for the the same obligation.  See Arroyo,\r\n1992 WL 755630, at *1-2; Ramos v. Caparra Dairy, Inc., 116 P.R.\r\nDec. 60, 62-63 (1985).\r\nHowever, solidarity does not presuppose that the scope or\r\nsource of liability is identical for each solidary debtor.  To the\r\ncontrary, \"[s]olidarity may exist, even though the creditors and\r\ndebtors are not bound in the same manner, and for the same periods\r\nand under the same conditions.\"  P.R. Civ. C. art. 1093, P.R. Laws\r\nAnn. tit. 31,  3104.   More generally, the entire set of\r\nprovisions regarding solidary obligations recognizes that solidary\r\ndebtors may be obligated to different degrees; thus the reference\r\nto shares.  The same principle is implicit in P.R. Civ. C. art.\r\n1101, which provides \"[a] solidary debtor may utilize, against the\r\nclaim of the creditor, all the exceptions arising from the nature\r\nof the obligation and those which are personal to him.\"  P.R. Laws\r\nAnn. tit. 31,  3112.  After all, personal exceptions are precisely\r\nthose not shared by the other solidary debtors.\r\nOne of the \"secondary\" consequences of categorizing an\r\nobligation as solidary rather than mancomunal is that the rules\r\nregarding the interruption of prescription are different.  SeeArroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at *5.  Specifically, the \"[i]nterruption\r\nof prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or\r\ninjures all the creditors or debtors,\" while \"in [mancomunal]\r\nobligations, when the creditor does not claim from one of the\r\ndebtors more than the part pertaining to him, prescription is not\r\ninterrupted for that reason with regard to the other co-debtors.\" \r\nP.R. Civ. C. art. 1874.  The reason for the difference is that\r\nsolidarity is based on the theory that there is one obligation,\r\nshared by several debtors.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at *5.  The\r\ninterruption of the prescription of the cause of action based on\r\nthat unitary obligation therefore need only be performed once.\r\nThere are two sources of solidarity: contract and\r\nstatute.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at *2-3 &amp; n.3 (\"Solidarity\r\nexists by the will of the parties or by law.\") (translation ours). \r\nThe provisions cited above apply equally to both contractual and\r\nstatutory solidarity; the only difference between them is that\r\nwhile contractual obligations are presumed not to be solidary\r\nunless there is an express agreement to the contrary, see P.R. Civ.\r\nC. art. 1090, statutory solidarity operates without regard to the\r\nparties' consent to be so bound with each other, see Arroyo, 1992\r\nWL 755630, at *3 (holding that joint tortfeasors are solidarily\r\nliable).\r\nTokyo Marine has not argued that UAC and Prez y Ca.\r\nexpressly agreed to be solidarily liable to any persons injured by\r\nPrez y Ca.  The question is therefore whether the liability of an\r\ninsurer for the harm caused by its insured can be described as\r\nsolidary liability.  In order to answer this question, we look to\r\nthe only case in which the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has\r\nexplicitly held that a statute had imposed a variety of solidary\r\nliability.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630.  In that case, the Puerto\r\nRico Supreme Court concluded that joint tortfeasors are solidarily\r\nliable, even though P.R. Civ. C. art. 1802 does not explicitly\r\nmention solidarity.  See id. at *4.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court\r\nbased its conclusion on the nature and scope of tort liability. \r\nUnder article 1802, when the negligent acts of more than one person\r\nhave adequately caused a harm, each such person is a joint\r\ntortfeasor who is liable in full to the plaintiff for the harm\r\ncaused.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court found that the relationship\r\nbetween the liabilities of joint tortfeasors was indistinguishable\r\nfrom the contractual solidarity described in P.R. Civ. C. art. 1090\r\nbecause joint tortfeasors, like contractual solidary debtors, are\r\njointly liable for the same obligation.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\r\n31,  3101; Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at *4.  The Puerto Rico Supreme\r\nCourt therefore held that article 1874 of the Civil Code applies to\r\njoint tortfeasors, so that the timely filing of a suit against one\r\njoint tortfeasor had interrupted the prescription of the suit\r\nagainst the other tortfeasors.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at *5.\r\nApplying the analysis employed in Arroyo, we conclude\r\nthat the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would hold that insured\r\ndefendants and their insurance companies are solidarily liable for\r\nthe acts of the insured.  The Puerto Rico Insurance Code specifies\r\nthe nature and extent of a liability insurer's responsibility for\r\nthe damage caused by its insured.  In particular, article 20.010 of\r\nthe Insurance Code makes liability insurers absolutely liable to\r\npersons injured by their insured.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,\r\n2001.  Article 20.010 must be read in conjunction with article\r\n20.030, according to which an injured party may bring an action\r\ndirectly against the tortfeasor's liability insurer, or against\r\nboth the tortfeasor and the insurer.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,\r\n2003.  Admittedly, article 20.030 does not state explicitly that\r\ntortfeasors and their insurers are liable in solido, which raises\r\nthe possibility that the Puerto Rico Legislature did not intend to\r\nmake them so.  But then, P.R. Civ. C. art. 1802 does not explicitly\r\nmention solidarity, either.  As in the case of joint tortfeasors,\r\nthe liability imposed by the Insurance Code upon insurers is co-\r\nextensive with that of their insured, up to the limits of the\r\npolicies in question.  \r\nMoreover, the fact that the statutory sources of\r\nliability for a tortfeasor and its insurer are different does not\r\nprevent their liabilities from being solidary.  As noted above,\r\n\"[s]olidarity may exist, even though the creditors and debtors are\r\nnot bound in the same manner, and for the same periods and under\r\nthe same conditions.\"  P.R. Civ. C. 1093.\r\nOur conclusion that an insurer and its insured are\r\nsolidarily liable is bolstered by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's\r\ndetermination that a suit against an insurer may be filed up to one\r\nyear after judgment is entered in a suit against the insured.  SeeBarrientos v. Gobierno de la Capital, 97 P.R. Dec. 552, 576-77\r\n(1969) (interpreting P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030(2)).  The holding in\r\nBarrientos is consistent with our conclusion; as we noted above,\r\none of the secondary consequences of solidarity is that the\r\ninterruption of prescription as to one solidary debtor affects the\r\nother solidary debtors, see P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874, so that a suit\r\nagainst one joint tortfeasor may be filed up to one year after\r\njudgment is entered in a suit against another joint tortfeasor, seeArroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at *5.\r\nWhile the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not decided this\r\nissue, three justices have addressed it in dicta.  All agree with\r\nour conclusion.  For example, in an opinion dissenting on a\r\ndifferent issue, Associate Justice Rebollo explicitly stated that,\r\n\"[a]s is well-known, an insurance company . . . is solidarily\r\nliable for the negligent acts that its insured may commit.\"  Torresv. Puerto Rico, 130 P.R. Dec.    , 1992 WL 755617, at *2 (June 8,\r\n1992) (translation ours).  Similarly, Associate Justice Naveira de\r\nRodn noted in her concurrence in another case that the defendants\r\ntherein -- a leasing company, its insurance company, and the\r\nlessor-driver -- were solidarily liable for injuries resulting from\r\nthe driver's negligence.  See Marrero-Albino v. Vzquez-Egean, 135\r\nP.R. Dec.    , 1994 WL 909230, at *2 (Feb. 24, 1994).  In an\r\nopinion dissenting on other grounds in that same case, Associate\r\nJustice Fuster-Berlingeri also wrote that \"there is no doubt\r\nwhatsoever as to the solidarity existing between the tortfeasor, .\r\n. . the company that owned the vehicle that he was driving, and its\r\ninsurer.\"  Marrero-Albino, 1994 WL 909232, at *5.  As Justice\r\nFuster explained, \"in light of the clear literal sense and purposes\r\nserved by [P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.010], it is necessary to conclude\r\nthat, with regard to the plaintiff's claim, the three defendants\r\n. . . were equally situated from a legal point of view, as if they\r\nwere one party with regard to the claim made by the plaintiff.\" \r\nId.\r\nMore oblique support for this conclusion is found in\r\nMiranda v. Puerto Rico, 137 P.R. Dec.    , 1994 WL 908883, at *6\r\n(Dec. 7, 1994), in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the\r\ntrial court's judgment, which, among other things, held the\r\ndefendants and their insurance companies to be solidarily liable\r\nfor the award of damages.  Similarly, in Trigo v. The Travelers\r\nInsurance Co., 91 P.R. Dec. 868 (1965), the Puerto Rico Supreme\r\nCourt reversed a trial court's determination that a claim against\r\nthe insurer was time-barred, even though the plaintiff had made a\r\ntimely extrajudicial claim against it.  Since the trial court\r\nreasoned that the interruption of prescription against the insurer\r\nhad not interrupted prescription against the insured, the Puerto\r\nRico Supreme Court could be understood to have disapproved of the\r\ntrial court's implicit determination that the insured was not\r\nliable in solido with its insurer.  Cf. Neptune Packing Corp. v.\r\nThe Wackenhut Corp., 120 P.R. Dec. 283, 289 (1988) (stating that\r\nclaims against insurer and insured should generally be brought in\r\nthe same suit rather than separately).\r\nThe handful of cases that could be read to support the\r\nopposite conclusion - that defendants and their insurers are not\r\nsolidarily liable - appear to us to be less compelling.  For\r\nexample, in Velilla v. Pueblo Supermarkets, Inc., 111 P.R. Dec. 585\r\n(1981), the plaintiff-appellant had originally communicated with\r\nthe defendant, Pueblo Supermarkets.  Pueblo, however, referred the\r\nplaintiff to International Claims Investigators, Inc., an\r\nindependent insurance adjuster.  When, more than a year afterwards,\r\nthe plaintiff filed suit against Pueblo, Pueblo moved for and\r\nobtained dismissal of the suit on the basis that the cause of\r\naction was barred by the statute of limitations because the\r\ninsurance adjuster was not its agent.  The Supreme Court reversed,\r\nbut not because the claims made against the insurer had\r\nsimultaneously interrupted prescription as to Pueblo.  Instead, the\r\nSupreme Court merely held that Pueblo was equitably estopped from\r\nraising the time-bar defense.  Although one could read the choice\r\nof rationale as a suggestion that the claim against the insurer\r\ndoes not simultaneously interrupt prescription as to the insured,\r\nwe find the inference weak because there were other, more likely\r\nreasons why the court decided as it did.\r\nFurthermore, our conclusion is consistent with the\r\nhistory and purpose of P.R. Ins. C. arts. 20.010 and 20.030, which\r\nwere intended to reverse by statute a number of decisions of the\r\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court.  In Cruz-Nieves v. Gonzlez, 66 P.R.\r\nDec. 212 (1946), the plaintiff had timely filed an extrajudicial\r\nclaim with the defendant's insurance company, but did not file suit\r\nagainst the defendant until more than a year after the accident. \r\nWhen the defendant raised the failure to file suit within the one\r\nyear period required by P.R. Civ. C. art. 1868, the plaintiff\r\ncountered that the prescription of her action against the defendant\r\nhad been interrupted by the extrajudicial claim against the\r\ninsurance company because the two were solidarily liable.  \r\nAt issue in Cruz-Nieves was article 175 of the former\r\nInsurance Law of Puerto Rico (predecessor to the current Insurance\r\nCode), which permitted a plaintiff to file a claim against an\r\ninsurance company jointly with the insured.  In the court's view,\r\nan insurance company was liable under article 175 only if its\r\ninsured were found liable.  The court accepted for purposes of\r\nargument the plaintiff's contention that the insurance company was\r\ndirectly liable to her and therefore that her extrajudicial claim\r\nagainst the company interrupted the prescription of her claim\r\nagainst the company.  Nevertheless, since the claim against the\r\ndefendant was barred by the statute of limitations, the insurance\r\ncompany could not be liable.  Based on this transparently circular\r\nreasoning, the court rejected her argument and affirmed the\r\ndismissal of her complaint.  Noting that \"solidarity is not\r\npresumed, nor does it exist unless it has been expressly agreed\r\nto,\" the court also concluded that the liability of the defendant\r\nand its insurance company could not be solidary because the\r\ncomplaint had not alleged that the insurance contract had expressly\r\nprovided that the insurance company would be directly liable to\r\nthird parties.  Id. at 214.\r\nOne year later, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court expressly\r\nrejected the claim that it had accepted for purposes of argument in\r\nCruz-Nieves; namely, the argument that an insurance company was\r\ndirectly liable to a person injured by its insured.  See United\r\nStates Cas. Co. v. Corte de Distrito de Arecibo, 66 P.R. Dec. 937,\r\n939 (1947).  The court held that article 175 of the Puerto Rico\r\nInsurance Law did not create a cause of action against an insurer. \r\nThe court explained that article 175 authorized a claim against an\r\ninsurer only when the plaintiff had already obtained a judgment\r\nagainst the insured defendant, or when the insurer had been named\r\na party to the same suit as the insured.  See id.  Based on its\r\ndecisions in Cruz-Nieves and United States Casualty Co., the Puerto\r\nRico Supreme Court subsequently held that the extrajudicial claim\r\nmade to the insurer within the one-year prescriptive period did not\r\ninterrupt the prescription of the claim against the insured.  SeeBithorn-Huicy v. Santana, 68 P.R. Dec. 300, 306 (1948); see alsoGuerra v. Ortiz, 71 P.R. Dec. 613, 624 (1950); Autoridad de Fuentes\r\nFluviales v. Irizarry, 72 P.R. Dec. 644, 650 (1951).\r\nAs the Puerto Rico Supreme Court noted several years\r\nlater, the excessively technical interpretation of the law adopted\r\nin this series of cases placed a number of frustrating roadblocks\r\nin the way of injured persons who sought compensation from the\r\ninsurers of the persons who injured them.  See Trigo v. The\r\nTravelers Ins. Co., 91 P.R. Dec. 868, 871 (1965).  It was no\r\ncoincidence, surmised the Trigo court, that the Legislative\r\nAssembly of Puerto Rico amended article 175 in 1952 to allow\r\nplaintiffs the option of suing insurance companies either directly,\r\nor jointly with the insured.  See Act No. 60 of April 17, 1952.  By\r\npermitting a direct suit against an insurer, the amended section\r\n175 seemed to establish a separate, direct cause of action against\r\ninsurers.\r\nThat interpretation of the amendment, however, was\r\nrejected in Prez v. Maryland Casualty Co., 78 P.R. Dec. 475\r\n(1955).  In Prez, Associate Justice Snyder (the author of the\r\ncourt's opinion in Bithorn-Huicy) wrote for the court that the 1952\r\namendment was merely procedural, permitting a suit to go forward\r\neven when the insured was not amenable to service of process.  The\r\ncourt held that the amendment had not created a direct cause of\r\naction against insurers, such as the one provided by Louisiana law,\r\nbecause a plaintiff still had to prove that the insured was liable. \r\nSee id. at 480 &amp; n.3 (citing La. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,  655);\r\nsee also Landol v. Coln, 78 P.R. Dec. 602 (1955) (following\r\nPrez); but see Aponte v. American Surety Co., 276 F.2d 678 (1st\r\nCir. 1960) (holding that 1952 amendment created new direct cause of\r\naction against insurers).\r\nAs the Trigo court remarked, the Prez opinion rendered\r\nthe 1952 amendment effectively irrelevant.  See 91 P.R. Dec. at\r\n873.  In 1957, however, the old insurance law was repealed and\r\nreplaced by the current Insurance Code.  See Act No. 77 of June 19,\r\n1957, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26.  The new code contained a number of\r\nprovisions, particularly articles 20.010 and 20.030, that clearly\r\nestablished a direct cause of action against insurers.  See Trigo,\r\n91 P.R. Dec. at 874.  It is evident that the enactment of P.R. Ins.\r\nC. arts. 20.010 and 20.030 was intended to reverse the Puerto Rico\r\nSupreme Court's decisions in Cruz-Nieves, United States Casualty\r\nCo., Bithorn-Huicy, Guerra, Autoridad de Fuentes Fluviales, Prez,\r\nand Landol.  Since these cases held, among other things, that an\r\ninsurer and its insured were not solidarily liable, their reversal\r\nsupports (although, admittedly, does not compel) the conclusion\r\nthat the direct liability newly imposed upon insurers is solidary\r\nwith the liability of their insured.\r\nThe court also noted in Trigo that P.R. Ins. C. art.\r\n20.030 uses \"language [that is] very similar to the one in the\r\nLouisiana legislation to which we made reference in the Prez case,\r\nwhich makes the insurer substantively and directly responsible\" for\r\nthe harm caused by its insured.  Trigo, 91 P.R. Dec. at 874\r\n(translation ours).  Under Louisiana law, the insurer and the\r\ninsured are joint and solidary obligors, and, thus, a suit against\r\nthe insurer interrupts prescription against the insured.  SeeHoefly v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 418 So.2d 575 (La. 1982);\r\nPearson v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemn. Co., 281 So.2d 724, 726-27\r\n(La. 1973); Tuck v. Commercial Standard Ins. Co., 164 So.2d 472\r\n(La. App. Ct. 1935); see also Cormier v. Clemco Servs. Corp., 48\r\nF.3d 179 (5th Cir. 1995); McDermott v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 418\r\nF.2d 598 (5th Cir. 1969); Melancon v. The Travelers Ins. Co., 209\r\nF. Supp. 68 (W.D. La. 1962); see generally H. Alston Johnson, The\r\nLouisiana Direct Action Statute, 43 La. L. Rev. 1455, 1506-14\r\n(1983).  It is reasonable to conclude that in adopting a rule based\r\non Louisiana law, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly intended for\r\nthe rule to be interpreted in a similar manner.  See Garca v.\r\nNorthern Assurance Co., 92 P.R. Dec. 245, 250-53 (1965) (relying on\r\nLouisiana case law in order to interpret P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030\r\nbecause it was derived from Louisiana law).\r\nIn sum, we conclude that an insured defendant is\r\nsolidarily liable with its liability insurance company.  Thus, the\r\ntimely interruption of prescription as to UAC had a like effect as\r\nto its insured, Prez y Ca.  See P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874, P.R. Laws\r\nAnn. tit. 31,  5304.  Accordingly, we find that the district court\r\nerred in dismissing as time-barred Tokyo Marine's cause of action\r\nbased on the damage to the vehicles in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY\r\nshipment.  \r\nIn the normal course of events, we would remand this case\r\nfor further proceedings.  In this case, however, the district court\r\nhad already made a finding as to amount of the damages to the\r\nvehicles in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment, setting the finding\r\naside only because the court determined that the claim was time-\r\nbarred.  Specifically, the district court found that the damages\r\naccruing under such claim amounted to $90,500.  We therefore amend\r\nthe judgment for Tokyo Marine to increase its award by $90,500, for\r\na total of $334,030.\r\nIII.  Finding of Liability and Award of Damages\r\nPrez y Ca. raises on appeal a number of arguments as to\r\nwhy the district court's findings of liability and award of damages\r\nwere erroneous.  In particular, Prez y Ca. contends that the\r\ndistrict court erred in determining that Prez y Ca. caused the\r\npaint damage to the cars, in failing to determine that the docking\r\npermit application absolved it of any liability for damage to the\r\nvehicles, in failing to determine that Tokyo Marine's insured,\r\nMitsubishi, was comparatively negligent in failing to mitigate\r\ndamages, and in assessing special damages.  All of these arguments,\r\nexcept for the one concerning interpretation of the docking permit\r\napplication, are challenges to the district court's findings of\r\nfact.  We review such findings only for clear error, see Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 52(a), and find such error only where we are firmly\r\nconvinced that a mistake has been made, see Strahan v. Coxe, 127\r\nF.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nAfter reviewing the evidence, we conclude that the\r\ndistrict court's findings of liability and damages were not clearly\r\nerroneous.  There was evidence before the court supporting its\r\nconclusions that the ship painting operations caused the damage to\r\nthe cars, that there was no alternative location where Mitsubishi\r\ncould have stored the vehicles, and that Mitsubishi mitigated\r\ndamages by promptly restoring the vehicles to their original\r\ncondition, thereby preventing further damages such as decreased\r\nsales.  Similarly, there was evidence to support the court's\r\nfinding that the amounts paid by Mitsubishi to Professional Car\r\nPaint, the company that repaired the vehicles, were reasonable.\r\nPrez y Ca. had also argued that liability was\r\nforeclosed by clause 9 of the docking permit application, which\r\nstated that \"Prez assumes no responsibility for the safety of the\r\ncargo or equipment handled by the applicant . . . while this cargo\r\nis being handled or in storage in the facilities of Prez.\"  Under\r\nPuerto Rico law, however, such release clauses are interpreted\r\nagainst exoneration because releases from liability for future\r\nnegligent conduct are not favored.  See Cabrera v. Doval, 76 P.R.\r\nDec. 777, 781 (1954).  Thus, such a clause will release a party\r\nfrom liability for future negligence only where the clause clearly\r\nand explicitly states so.  We agree with the district court that\r\nclause 9 did not meet this standard.\r\nIV.  Award of Attorneys' Fees\r\n\nRules 44.1(d) and 44.3(b) of the Puerto Rico Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure require trial courts to award attorney's fees and\r\ninterest against parties that have litigated \"obstinately or\r\nfrivolously.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, app. III R. 44.1(d),\r\n44.3(b).  \"The purpose behind the rules is to penalize 'a losing\r\nparty that because of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness, and\r\ninsistent frivolous attitude has forced the other party to\r\nneedlessly assume the pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of\r\na litigation.'\"  Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1253 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (quoting Fernndez v. San Juan Cement Co., 118 P.R. Dec. 713,\r\n718 (1987)).  The district court below found that Prez y Ca. had\r\nbeen obstinate in this litigation and was therefore liable for\r\nattorneys' fees.  Reviewing this determination for abuse of\r\ndiscretion, see Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253, we find none.\r\nThe decision of the district court is affirmed in part,\r\nreversed in part, and amended as to damages, as discussed above. \r\nCosts are awarded to the plaintiff.\n",

(\"Tokyo Marine\"), as subrogee to the rights of its insured, Mitsubishi Motors Sales of the Caribbean, Inc.  (\"Mitsubishi\"), filed this tort suit in diversity against defendant Perez y Ca. de Puerto Rico, Inc.  (\"Perez y Ca.\") for the damage caused to vehicles owned by Mitsubishi while they were stored at a facility owned by Perez y Ca.  After holding a bench trial, the district court entered judgment finding Perez y Ca. liable to Tokyo Marine on seven out of the eight counts in the complaint.  Tokyo Marine and Perez y Ca. now cross-appeal from the judgment of the district court.  Tokyo Marine contends that the district court erred in finding that the first count of its complaint was time-barred, while Perez y Ca. challenges the court's finding of liability.  Perez y Ca. also appeals from the district court's decision to award attorneys' fees to Tokyo Marine under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1 as a sanction for what it perceived as Perez y Ca.'s obstinate conduct in this litigation.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.  See Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Boulos, 89 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves eight shipments of cars owned by Mitsubishi that were damaged while they were stored at a harbor-side lot owned by defendant Perez y Ca.  On February 15, 1993, the M/V ORION HIGHWAY arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and docked at a berthing facility owned by Perez y Ca.  The ship was carrying the first shipment of cars at issue in this case, which consisted of 619 Mitsubishi-brand motor vehicles consigned to Mitsubishi Motors Sales of the Caribbean, Inc. The cars were discharged and stationed on Perez y Ca.'s lot for one week, at the end of which they were delivered to Mitsubishi.  The Perez y Ca. dock and storage lot were chosen by San Juan Mercantile Corp., Mitsubishi's agent and stevedoring contractor.  San Juan Mercantile was responsible for the vehicles from the time of discharge until they were delivered to Mitsubishi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tokyo Marine had a working arrangement with Intermodal Transportation Services, Inc.  (\"Intermodal\"), a Florida firm that provides survey services, whereby Intermodal surveyed vehicle damage claims presented to Tokyo Marine under the insurance policy issued to Mitsubishi.  Pursuant to this arrangement, Intermodal's surveyors would conduct \"hatch and discharge\" surveys of vehicle shipments when they arrived at a port, and \"first point of rest\" surveys just after the vehicles were discharged.  The purpose of these surveys was to discover any damage to the vehicles, and to determine whether such damage occurred before, during, or after the discharge of the vehicles from the ship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the M/V ORION HIGHWAY arrived, a local surveyor retained by Intermodal performed hatch, discharge, and first point of rest surveys of the shipment, and found the vehicles to be free of paint damage.  When the vehicles were delivered to Mitsubishi a week later, however, many were found to be covered with a light dusting of paint.  It was later discovered that during the week that the cars were parked at Perez y Ca.'s lot, Perez y Ca. employees were also painting an ocean-going barge at a drydock directly adjacent to the lot on its upwind side.  After hearing evidence on the issue, the district court found that the Mitsubishi vehicles were damaged by free-floating paint that wafted onto the vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also found that Mitsubishi vehicles that arrived in seven other shipments over the next year and a half were damaged in like manner while they were stored at the Perez y Ca. lot.  The district court determined that the claim based on the damage to the vehicles in the first shipment was time-barred, but allowed the claims arising from the damage to vehicles in the remaining seven shipments.  With regard to those claims, the district court found that Perez y Ca. was negligent in permitting the vehicles to be damaged because, although its employees knew of the \"over spray\" problem, the company took no measures to avoid or prevent the problem.  The district court also found that Mitsubishi had not acted in a comparatively negligent manner by continuing to store its vehicles at the Perez y Ca. lot because, short of stopping vehicle shipments altogether, it could not prevent the use of the Perez y Ca. berthing and vehicle storage facilities.  The district court therefore entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $243,530.  Finally, the district court concluded that the defendant had been obstinate in its conduct of this litigation and was therefore liable for attorneys' fees pursuant to P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  Both parties have appealed from the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tokyo Marine argues that the district court erred in finding that its claim for the damage caused to the cars in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  This tort action was brought under Puerto Rico's tort statute, article 1802 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5141.  Tort claims under article 1802 are subject to the one-year statute of limitations provided by article 1868(2) of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5298(2).  A cause of action under article 1802 accrues--and the prescriptive period set by article 1868(2) therefore begins to run--when the injured party knew or should have known of the injury and of the likely identity of the tortfeasor.  See Colon Prieto v. Geigel, 115 P.R. Dec. 232, 243, 1984 WL 270950 (1984).  As noted above, the district court found that the cars in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment were damaged at some point no later than February 23, 1993.  This suit was filed on April 19, 1994, more than one year after the cause of action had accrued.  Therefore, unless the prescription of the cause of action was interrupted, the cause of action relating to the cars in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment would be time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to article 1873 of the Civil Code, a prescriptive period may be interrupted in one of three ways:  by the institution of an action \"before the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5303 (official translation 1991).  Although prescription is an affirmative defense, once it has been raised, the burden of proving that prescription has been interrupted shifts to the plaintiff.  See Velez Rodriguez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 135 P.R. Dec. ----, 1994 WL 909577, at * 8 (Mar. 18, 1994);  Zambrana Maldonado v. Puerto Rico, 129 P.R. Dec. ----, 1992 WL 754996, at * 4 (Jan. 30, 1992).  Under article 1874 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, the interruption of prescription against one defendant also tolls the statute against any other defendants who are solidarily liable<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with the first.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5304 (\"Interruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors.\")  (official translation 1991);  Arroyo v. Hospital La Concepcion, 130 P.R. Dec. ----, 1992 WL 755630, at * 6 (June 5, 1992).  Regardless of the method used, when the prescriptive period is successfully interrupted, the full period begins to run again.  See Cintron v. Puerto Rico, 127 P.R. Dec. 582, 589, 1990 WL 710069 (1990);  Diaz De Diana v. A.J.A.S. Ins. Co., 110 P.R.

Because we find that one of these letters sufficed to interrupt the prescription of this cause of action, we need not consider the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 10, 1994, Tokyo Marine's attorneys wrote a letter to Perez y Ca.'s insurance company, Underwriters Adjustment Co., Inc.  (\"UAC\"), stating that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>We have been retained by the interested cargo underwriters to effect a recovery for damage to Mitsubishi automobiles due to paint over spray on February 15, 1993.  We are holding your assured, Perez y Ca. de Puerto Rico, Inc. responsible for this loss in the amount of $369,700.  The following is a breakdown of the damages:....  Kindly acknowledge receipt of this claim notice and provide us with your settlement advises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter was timely, was sent by persons with standing to do so,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and sought the same relief subsequently claimed in this lawsuit.  This letter therefore constituted an extrajudicial claim that clearly interrupted the prescription of any claims against UAC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UAC, however, was never made a party to this suit.  Tokyo Marine contends that the interruption of prescription with regard to its claims against UAC also tolled the statute as to its claims against Perez y Ca.  As noted above, under article 1874 of the Civil Code, the interruption of the prescription of claims against one defendant also interrupts the prescription of claims against any other defendants who are solidarily liable with the first.  Accordingly, Tokyo Marine argues that UAC is solidarily liable for the damage caused by its insured, Perez y Ca.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept of solidarity is defined by the provisions of Civil Code articles 1090-1101, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3101-12, which establish the differences between mancomunal (similar to \"several\") and solidary obligations.  As noted before, solidarity is very similar to joint and several liability.  See supra note 1. The essential feature of solidarity is that the solidary debtors are jointly responsible for the same obligation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 1-2;  Ramos v. Caparra Dairy, Inc., 116 P.R. Dec. 60, 62-63, 1985 WL 301268 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, solidarity does not presuppose that the scope or source of liability is identical for each solidary debtor.  To the contrary, \"[s]olidarity may exist, even though the creditors and debtors are not bound in the same manner, and for the same periods and under the same conditions.\"   P.R. Civ. C. art. 1093, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3104.  More generally, the entire set of provisions regarding solidary obligations recognizes that solidary debtors may be obligated to different degrees;  thus the reference to shares.  The same principle is implicit in P.R. Civ. C. art. 1101, which provides \"[a] solidary debtor may utilize, against the claim of the creditor, all the exceptions arising from the nature of the obligation and those which are personal to him.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3112.  After all, personal exceptions are precisely those not shared by the other solidary debtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the \"secondary\" consequences of categorizing an obligation as solidary rather than mancomunal is that the rules regarding the interruption of prescription are different.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 5.  Specifically, the \"[i]nterruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors,\" while \"in [mancomunal] obligations, when the creditor does not claim from one of the debtors more than the part pertaining to him, prescription is not interrupted for that reason with regard to the other co-debtors.\"   P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874.  The reason for the difference is that solidarity is based on the theory that there is one obligation, shared by several debtors.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 5.  The interruption of the prescription of the cause of action based on that unitary obligation therefore need only be performed once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two sources of solidarity:  contract and statute.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 2-3 &amp; n. 3 (\"Solidarity exists by the will of the parties or by law.\")  (translation ours).  The provisions cited above apply equally to both contractual and statutory solidarity;  the only difference between them is that while contractual obligations are presumed not to be solidary unless there is an express agreement to the contrary, see P.R. Civ. C. art. 1090, statutory solidarity operates without regard to the parties' consent to be so bound with each other, see Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 3 (holding that joint tortfeasors are solidarily liable).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tokyo Marine has not argued that UAC and Perez y Ca. expressly agreed to be solidarily liable to any persons injured by Perez y Ca.  The question is therefore whether the liability of an insurer for the harm caused by its insured can be described as solidary liability.  In order to answer this question, we look to the only case in which the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explicitly held that a statute had imposed a variety of solidary liability.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630.   In that case, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court concluded that joint tortfeasors are solidarily liable, even though P.R. Civ. C. art. 1802 does not explicitly mention solidarity.  See id.at * 4.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court based its conclusion on the nature and scope of tort liability.  Under article 1802, when the negligent acts of more than one person have adequately caused a harm, each such person is a joint tortfeasor who is liable in full to the plaintiff for the harm caused.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court foundthat the relationship between the liabilities of joint tortfeasors was indistinguishable from the contractual solidarity described in P.R. Civ. C. art. 1090 because joint tortfeasors, like contractual solidary debtors, are jointly liable for the same obligation.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3101;  Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 4.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court therefore held that article 1874 of the Civil Code applies to joint tortfeasors, so that the timely filing of a suit against one joint tortfeasor had interrupted the prescription of the suit against the other tortfeasors.  See Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the analysis employed in Arroyo, we conclude that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would hold that insured defendants and their insurance companies are solidarily liable for the acts of the insured.  The Puerto Rico Insurance Code specifies the nature and extent of a liability insurer's responsibility for the damage caused by its insured.  In particular, article 20.010 of the Insurance Code makes liability insurers absolutely liable to persons injured by their insured.  See P.R. LAWS ANN. TIT. 26, &#167; 2001.   ARTICLE 20.010<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> must be read in conjunction with article 20.030, according to which an injured party may bring an action directly against the tortfeasor's liability insurer, or against both the tortfeasor and the insurer.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Admittedly, article 20.030 does not state explicitly that tortfeasors and their insurers are liable in solido, which raises the possibility that the Puerto Rico Legislature did not intend to make them so.  But then, P.R. Civ. C. art. 1802 does not explicitly mention solidarity, either.  As in the case of joint tortfeasors, the liability imposed by the Insurance Code upon insurers is co-extensive with that of their insured, up to the limits of the policies in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the fact that the statutory sources of liability for a tortfeasor and its insurer are different does not prevent their liabilities from being solidary.  As noted above, \"[s]olidarity may exist, even though the creditors and debtors are not bound in the same manner, and for the same periods and under the same conditions.\"   P.R. Civ. C. 1093.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that an insurer and its insured are solidarily liable is bolstered by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's determination that a suit against an insurer may be filed up to one year after judgment is entered in a suit against the insured.  See Barrientos v. Gobierno De La Capital, 97 P.R. Dec. 552, 576-77, 1969 WL 21597 (1969) (interpreting P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030(2)).  The holding in Barrientos is consistent with our conclusion;  as we noted above, one of the secondary consequences of solidarity is that the interruption of prescription as to one solidary debtor affects the other solidary debtors, see P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874, so that a suit against one joint tortfeasor may be filed up to one year after judgment is entered in a suit against another joint tortfeasor, see Arroyo, 1992 WL 755630, at * 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not decided this issue, three justices have addressed it in dicta.  All agree with our conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  For example, in an opinion dissenting on a different issue, Associate Justice Rebollo explicitly stated that, \"[a]s is well-known, an insurance company ... is solidarily liable for the negligent acts that its insured may commit.\"  Torres v. Puerto Rico, 130 P.R. Dec. ----, 1992 WL 755617, at * 2 (June 8, 1992) (translation ours).  Similarly, Associate Justice Naveira de Rodn noted in her concurrence in another case that the defendants therein--a leasing company, its insurance company, and the lessor-driver--were solidarily liable for injuries resulting from the driver's negligence.  See Marrero-Albino v. Vazquez-Egean, 135 P.R. Dec. ----, 1994 WL 909230, at * 2 (Feb. 24, 1994).  In an opinion dissenting on other grounds in that same case, Associate Justice Fuster-Berlingeri also wrote that \"there is no doubt whatsoever as to the solidarity existing between the tortfeasor, ... the company that owned the vehicle that he was driving, and its insurer.\"   Marrero-Albino, 1994 WL 909232, at * 5.  As Justice Fuster explained, \"in light of the clear literal sense and purposes served by [P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.010], it is necessary to conclude that, with regard to the plaintiff's claim, the three defendants ... were equally situated from a legal point of view, as if they were one party with regard to the claim made by the plaintiff.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More oblique support for this conclusion is found in Miranda v. Puerto Rico, 137 P.R. Dec. ----, 1994 WL 908883, at * 6 (Dec. 7, 1994), in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which, among other things, held the defendants and their insurance companies to be solidarily liable for the award of damages.  Similarly, in Trigo v. the Travelers Insurance Co., 91 P.R. Dec. 868, 1965 WL 14346 (1965), the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed a trial court's determination that a claim against the insurer was time-barred, even though the plaintiff had made a timely extrajudicial claim against it.  Since the trial court reasoned that the interruption of prescription against the insurer had not interrupted prescription against the insured, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court could be understood to have disapproved of the trial court's implicit determination that the insured was not liable in solido with its insurer.  Cf. Neptune Packing Corp. v. The Wackenhut Corp., 120 P.R. Dec. 283, 289, 1988 WL 580867 (1988) (stating that claims against insurer and insured should generally be brought in the same suit rather than separately).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The handful of cases that could be read to support the opposite conclusion--that defendants and their insurers are not solidarily liable--appear to us to be less compelling.  For example, in Velilla v. Pueblo Supermarkets, Inc., 111 P.R. Dec. 585, 1981 WL 176460 (1981), the plaintiff-appellant had originally communicated with the defendant, Pueblo Supermarkets.  Pueblo, however, referred the plaintiff to International Claims Investigators, Inc., an independent insurance adjuster.  When, more than a year afterwards, the plaintiff filed suit against Pueblo, Pueblo moved for and obtained dismissal of the suit on the basis that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations because the insurance adjuster was not its agent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Supreme Court reversed, but not because the claims made against the insurer had simultaneously interrupted prescription as to Pueblo.  Instead, the Supreme Court merely held that Pueblo was equitably estopped from raising the time-bar defense.  Although one could read the choice of rationale as a suggestion that the claim against the insurer does not simultaneously interrupt prescription as to the insured, we find the inference weak because there were other, more likely reasons why the court decided as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, our conclusion is consistent with the history and purpose of P.R. Ins. C. arts. 20.010 and 20.030, which were intended to reverse by statute a number of decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.  In Cruz Nieves v. Gonzalez, 66 P.R. Dec. 212, 1946 WL 6440 (1946), the plaintiff had timely filed an extrajudicial claim with the defendant's insurance company, but did not file suit against the defendant until more than a year after the accident.  When the defendant raised the failure to file suit within the one year period required by P.R. Civ. C. art. 1868, the plaintiff countered that the prescription of her action against the defendant had been interrupted by the extrajudicial claim against the insurance company because the two were solidarily liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in Cruz Nieves was article 175 of the former Insurance Law of Puerto Rico (predecessor to the current Insurance Code), which permitted a plaintiff to file a claim against an insurance company jointly with the insured.  In the court's view, an insurance company was liable under article 175 only if its insured were found liable.  The court accepted for purposes of argument the plaintiff's contention that the insurance company was directly liable to her and therefore that her extrajudicial claim against the company interrupted the prescription of her claim against the company.  Nevertheless, since the claim against the defendant was barred by the statute of limitations, the insurance company could not be liable.  Based on this transparently circular reasoning, the court rejected her argument and affirmed the dismissal of her complaint.  Noting that \"solidarity is not presumed, nor does it exist unless it has been expressly agreed to,\" the court also concluded that the liability of the defendant and its insurance company could not be solidary because the complaint had not alleged that the insurance contract had expressly provided that the insurance company would be directly liable to third parties.  Id. at 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court expressly rejected the claim that it had accepted for purposes of argument in Cruz Nieves;  namely, the argument that an insurance company was directly liable to a person injured by its insured.  See United States Cas. Co. v. Corte De Distrito De Arecibo, 66 P.R. Dec. 937, 939, 1947 WL 7463 (1947).  The court held that article 175 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Law did not create a cause of action against an insurer.  The court explained that article 175 authorized a claim against an insurer only when the plaintiff had already obtained a judgment against the insured defendant, or when the insurer had been named a party to the same suit as the insured.  See id.   Based on its decisions in Cruz Nieves and United States Casualty Co., the Puerto Rico Supreme Court subsequently held that the extrajudicial claim made to the insurer within the one-year prescriptive period did not interrupt the prescription of the claim against the insured.  See Bithorn Huicy v. Santana, 68 P.R. Dec. 300, 306, 1948 WL 6750 (1948);  see also Guerra v. Ortiz, 71 P.R. Dec. 613, 624, 1950 WL 7228 (1950);  Autoridad De Las Fuentes Fluviales v. Irizarry, 72 P.R. Dec. 644, 650, 1951 WL 7615 (1951).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Puerto Rico Supreme Court noted several years later, the excessively technical interpretation of the law adopted in this series of cases placed a number of frustrating roadblocks in the way of injured persons who sought compensation from the insurers of the persons who injured them.  See Trigo v. the Travelers Ins. Co., 91 P.R. Dec. 868, 871, 1965 WL 14346 (1965).  It was no coincidence, surmised the Trigo court, that the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico amended article 175 in 1952 to allow plaintiffs the option of suing insurance companies either directly, or jointly with the insured.  See Act No. 60 of April 17, 1952.  By permitting a direct suit against an insurer, the amended section 175 seemed to establish a separate, direct cause of action against insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That interpretation of the amendment, however, was rejected in Perez v. Maryland Casualty Co., 78 P.R. Dec. 475, 1955 WL 11571 (1955).  In Perez, Associate Justice Snyder (the author of the court's opinion in Bithorn Huicy) wrote for the court that the 1952 amendment was merely procedural, permitting a suit to go forward even when the insured was not amenable to service of process.  The court held that the amendment had not created a direct cause of action against insurers, such as the one provided by Louisiana law, because a plaintiff still had to prove that the insured was liable.  See id. at 480 &amp; n. 3 (citing La.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 655);  see also Landol v. Colon, 78 P.R. Dec. 602, 1955 WL 11555 (1955) (following Perez);  but see Aponte v. American Surety Co., 276 F.2d 678 (1st Cir.1960) (holding that 1952 amendment created new direct cause of action against insurers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Trigo court remarked, the Perez opinion rendered the 1952 amendment effectively irrelevant.  See 91 P.R. Dec. at 873.   In 1957, however, the old insurance law was repealed and replaced by the current Insurance Code.  See Act No. 77 of June 19, 1957, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26.  The new code contained a number of provisions, particularly articles 20.010 and 20.030, that clearly established a direct cause of action against insurers.  See Trigo, 91 P.R. Dec. at 874.   It is evident that the enactment of P.R. Ins. C. arts. 20.010 and 20.030 was intended to reverse the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decisions in Cruz-Nieves, United States Casualty Co., Bithorn Huicy, Guerra, Autoridad De Las Fuentes Fluviales, Perez, and Landol.   Since these cases held, among other things, that an insurer and its insured were not solidarily liable, their reversal supports (although, admittedly, does not compel) the conclusion that the direct liability newly imposed upon insurers is solidary with the liability of their insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also noted in Trigo that P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030 uses \"language [that is] very similar to the one in the Louisiana legislation to which we made reference in the Perez case, which makes the insurer substantively and directly responsible\" for the harm caused by its insured.  Trigo, 91 P.R. Dec. at 874 (translation ours).  Under Louisiana law, the insurer and the insured are joint and solidary obligors, and, thus, a suit against the insurer interrupts prescription against the insured.  See Hoefly v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 418 So.2d 575 (La.1982);  Pearson v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemn.  Co., 281 So.2d 724, 726-27 (La.1973);   Tuck v. Commercial Standard Ins. Co., 164 So. 472 (La.App.Ct.1935);  see also Cormier v. Clemco Servs.  Corp., 48 F.3d 179 (5th Cir.1995);  McDermott v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 418 F.2d 598 (5th Cir.1969);  Melancon v. The Travelers Ins. Co., 209 F.Supp. 68 (W.D.La.1962);  see generally H. Alston Johnson, The Louisiana Direct Action Statute, 43 La.  L.Rev. 1455, 1506-14 (1983).  It is reasonable to conclude that in adopting a rule based on Louisiana law, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly intended for the rule to be interpreted in a similar manner.  See Garcia v. Northern Assurance Co., 92 P.R. Dec. 245, 250-53, 1965 WL 14310 (1965) (relying on Louisiana case law in order to interpret P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030 because it was derived from Louisiana law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that an insured defendant is solidarily liable with its liability insurance company.  Thus, the timely interruption of prescription as to UAC had a like effect as to its insured, Perez y Ca.  See P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5304.  Accordingly, we find that the district court erred in dismissing as time-barred Tokyo Marine's cause of action based on the damage to the vehicles in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal course of events, we would remand this case for further proceedings.  In this case, however, the district court had already made a finding as to amount of the damages to the vehicles in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment, setting the finding aside only because the court determined that the claim was time-barred.  Specifically, the district court found that the damages accruing under such claim amounted to $90,500.  We therefore amend the judgment for Tokyo Marine to increase its award by $90,500, for a total of $334,030.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>III. Finding of Liability and Award of Damages</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez y Ca. raises on appeal a number of arguments as to why the district court's findings of liability and award of damages were erroneous.  In particular, Perez y Ca. contends that the district court erred in determining that Perez y Ca. caused the paint damage to the cars, in failing to determine that the docking permit application absolved it of any liability for damage to the vehicles, in failing to determine that Tokyo Marine's insured, Mitsubishi, was comparatively negligent in failing to mitigate damages, and in assessing special damages.  All of these arguments, except for the one concerning interpretation of the docking permit application, are challenges to the district court's findings of fact.  We review such findings only for clear error, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and find such error only where we are firmly convinced that a mistake has been made, see Strahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the evidence, we conclude that the district court's findings of liability and damages were not clearly erroneous.  There was evidence before the court supporting its conclusions that the ship painting operations caused the damage to the cars, that there was no alternative location where Mitsubishi could have stored the vehicles, and that Mitsubishi mitigated damages by promptly restoring the vehicles to their original condition, thereby preventing further damages such as decreased sales.  Similarly, there was evidence to support the court's finding that the amounts paid by Mitsubishi to Professional Car Paint, the company that repaired the vehicles, were reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez y Ca. had also argued that liability was foreclosed by clause 9 of the docking permit application, which stated that \"Perez assumes no responsibility for the safety of the cargo or equipment handled by the applicant ... while this cargo is being handled or in storage in the facilities of Perez.\"   Under Puerto Rico law, however, such release clauses are interpreted against exoneration because releases from liability for future negligent conduct are not favored.  See Cabrera v. Doval, 76 P.R. Dec. 777, 781, 1954 WL 10805 (1954).

Our analysis has been aimed only at determining whether the prescriptive period was interrupted by the letter received by UAC in January 1994.  In order to do so, we asked whether the liability of insurers, as established by the Insurance Code, should be categorized as solidary liability.  Our task was therefore descriptive, not prescriptive, and our holding does not change the substantive liability of insurers.  In particular, this means that a liability insurer is not solidarily liable when the loss is not covered by the insurance agreement.  See P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.010, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 2001 (insurer is liable whenever a covered loss occurs).  Similarly, the plaintiff's direct action against the insurer is subject to \"the terms and limitations of the policy.\"   P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 2003</p>\n        <p>Thus, in a case in which the prescriptive period has been interrupted by notifying an alleged tortfeasor's insurer, and suit is then brought against the insured after the original prescriptive period would have run, a subsequent motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants would succeed if the uncontroverted evidence showed that the loss was not covered.  This is no different from a case involving allegations that the defendants are joint tortfeasors;  if the evidence later demonstrates that the only defendant against whom interruption was properly made was not, in fact, a joint tortfeasor, then the interruption was not effective against the other defendants.

(\"Tokyo Marine\"), as subrogee to the rights of its insured, Mitsubishi Motors Sales of the Caribbean, Inc.  (\"Mitsubishi\"), filed this tort suit in diversity against defendant Perez y Ca. de Puerto Rico, Inc.  (\"Perez y Ca.\") for the damage caused to vehicles owned by Mitsubishi while they were stored at a facility owned by Perez y Ca.  After holding a bench trial, the district court entered judgment finding Perez y Ca. liable to Tokyo Marine on seven out of the eight counts in the complaint.  Tokyo Marine and Perez y Ca. now cross-appeal from the judgment of the district court.  Tokyo Marine contends that the district court erred in finding that the first count of its complaint was time-barred, while Perez y Ca. challenges the court's finding of liability.  Perez y Ca. also appeals from the district court's decision to award attorneys' fees to Tokyo Marine under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1 as a sanction for what it perceived as Perez y Ca.'s obstinate conduct in this litigation.  For the reasons explained below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.  See Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Boulos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196869\"><a href=\"/opinion/196869/wainwright-bank-v-boulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves eight shipments of cars owned by Mitsubishi that were damaged while they were stored at a harbor-side lot owned by defendant Perez y Ca.  On February 15, 1993, the M/V ORION HIGHWAY arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and docked at a berthing facility owned by Perez y Ca.  The ship was carrying the first shipment of cars at issue in this case, which consisted of 619 Mitsubishi-brand motor vehicles consigned to Mitsubishi Motors Sales of the Caribbean, Inc. The cars were discharged and stationed on Perez y Ca.'s lot for one week, at the end of which they were delivered to Mitsubishi.  The Perez y Ca. dock and storage lot were chosen by San Juan Mercantile Corp., Mitsubishi's agent and stevedoring contractor.  San Juan Mercantile was responsible for the vehicles from the time of discharge until they were delivered to Mitsubishi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tokyo Marine had a working arrangement with Intermodal Transportation Services, Inc.  (\"Intermodal\"), a Florida firm that provides survey services, whereby Intermodal surveyed vehicle damage claims presented to Tokyo Marine under the insurance policy issued to Mitsubishi.  Pursuant to this arrangement, Intermodal's surveyors would conduct \"hatch and discharge\" surveys of vehicle shipments when they arrived at a port, and \"first point of rest\" surveys just after the vehicles were discharged.  The purpose of these surveys was to discover any damage to the vehicles, and to determine whether such damage occurred before, during, or after the discharge of the vehicles from the ship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the M/V ORION HIGHWAY arrived, a local surveyor retained by Intermodal performed hatch, discharge, and first point of rest surveys of the shipment, and found the vehicles to be free of paint damage.  When the vehicles were delivered to Mitsubishi a week later, however, many were found to be covered with a light dusting of paint.  It was later discovered that during the week that the cars were parked at Perez y Ca.'s lot, Perez y Ca. employees were also painting an ocean-going barge at a drydock directly adjacent to the lot on its upwind side.  After hearing evidence on the issue, the district court found that the Mitsubishi vehicles were damaged by free-floating paint that wafted onto the vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also found that Mitsubishi vehicles that arrived in seven other shipments over the next year and a half were damaged in like manner while they were stored at the Perez y Ca. lot.  The district court determined that the claim based on the damage to the vehicles in the first shipment was time-barred, but allowed the claims arising from the damage to vehicles in the remaining seven shipments.  With regard to those claims, the district court found that Perez y Ca. was negligent in permitting the vehicles to be damaged because, although its employees knew of the \"over spray\" problem, the company took no measures to avoid or prevent the problem.  The district court also found that Mitsubishi had not acted in a comparatively negligent manner by continuing to store its vehicles at the Perez y Ca. lot because, short of stopping vehicle shipments altogether, it could not prevent the use of the Perez y Ca. berthing and vehicle storage facilities.  The district court therefore entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $243,530.  Finally, the district court concluded that the defendant had been obstinate in its conduct of this litigation and was therefore liable for attorneys' fees pursuant to P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  Both parties have appealed from the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tokyo Marine argues that the district court erred in finding that its claim for the damage caused to the cars in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  This tort action was brought under Puerto Rico's tort statute, article 1802 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5141.  Tort claims under article 1802 are subject to the one-year statute of limitations provided by article 1868(2) of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5298(2).  A cause of action under article 1802 accrues--and the prescriptive period set by article 1868(2) therefore begins to run--when the injured party knew or should have known of the injury and of the likely identity of the tortfeasor.  See Colon Prieto v. Geigel, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.

As noted above, the district court found that the cars in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment were damaged at some point no later than February 23, 1993.  This suit was filed on April 19, 1994, more than one year after the cause of action had accrued.  Therefore, unless the prescription of the cause of action was interrupted, the cause of action relating to the cars in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment would be time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to article 1873 of the Civil Code, a prescriptive period may be interrupted in one of three ways:  by the institution of an action \"before the courts, by extrajudicial claim of the creditor, and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5303 (official translation 1991).

Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5304 (\"Interruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors.\")  (official translation 1991);  Arroyo v.

The prescriptive term is interrupted on the date on which the defendant receives the extrajudicial claim.  See Diaz De Diana, 110 P.R. Dec. at 477.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that a letter sent by a tort plaintiff to the tortfeasor, complaining of the tortious conduct and demanding compensation, is an extrajudicial claim that, if timely, interrupts the prescription of the cause of action in tort.  Tokyo Marine argues that the parties involved in this suit sent each other several letters that, either separately or in conjunction, constituted extrajudicial claims that tolled the statute of limitations for the cause of action arising out of the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment.  Because we find that one of these letters sufficed to interrupt the prescription of this cause of action, we need not consider the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 10, 1994, Tokyo Marine's attorneys wrote a letter to Perez y Ca.'s insurance company, Underwriters Adjustment Co., Inc.  (\"UAC\"), stating that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>We have been retained by the interested cargo underwriters to effect a recovery for damage to Mitsubishi automobiles due to paint over spray on February 15, 1993.  We are holding your assured, Perez y Ca. de Puerto Rico, Inc. responsible for this loss in the amount of $369,700.  The following is a breakdown of the damages:....  Kindly acknowledge receipt of this claim notice and provide us with your settlement advises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter was timely, was sent by persons with standing to do so,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and sought the same relief subsequently claimed in this lawsuit.  This letter therefore constituted an extrajudicial claim that clearly interrupted the prescription of any claims against UAC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UAC, however, was never made a party to this suit.  Tokyo Marine contends that the interruption of prescription with regard to its claims against UAC also tolled the statute as to its claims against Perez y Ca.  As noted above, under article 1874 of the Civil Code, the interruption of the prescription of claims against one defendant also interrupts the prescription of claims against any other defendants who are solidarily liable with the first.  Accordingly, Tokyo Marine argues that UAC is solidarily liable for the damage caused by its insured, Perez y Ca.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept of solidarity is defined by the provisions of Civil Code articles 1090-1101, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3101-12, which establish the differences between mancomunal (similar to \"several\") and solidary obligations.  As noted before, solidarity is very similar to joint and several liability.  See supra note 1. The essential feature of solidarity is that the solidary debtors are jointly responsible for the same obligation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 1-2;  Ramos v. Caparra Dairy, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span>, 62-63, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">301268</span></span> (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, solidarity does not presuppose that the scope or source of liability is identical for each solidary debtor.  To the contrary, \"[s]olidarity may exist, even though the creditors and debtors are not bound in the same manner, and for the same periods and under the same conditions.\"   P.R. Civ. C. art. 1093, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3104.  More generally, the entire set of provisions regarding solidary obligations recognizes that solidary debtors may be obligated to different degrees;  thus the reference to shares.  The same principle is implicit in P.R. Civ. C. art. 1101, which provides \"[a] solidary debtor may utilize, against the claim of the creditor, all the exceptions arising from the nature of the obligation and those which are personal to him.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3112.  After all, personal exceptions are precisely those not shared by the other solidary debtors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the \"secondary\" consequences of categorizing an obligation as solidary rather than mancomunal is that the rules regarding the interruption of prescription are different.  See Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 5.  Specifically, the \"[i]nterruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors,\" while \"in [mancomunal] obligations, when the creditor does not claim from one of the debtors more than the part pertaining to him, prescription is not interrupted for that reason with regard to the other co-debtors.\"   P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874.  The reason for the difference is that solidarity is based on the theory that there is one obligation, shared by several debtors.  See Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 5.  The interruption of the prescription of the cause of action based on that unitary obligation therefore need only be performed once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two sources of solidarity:  contract and statute.  See Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 2-3 &amp; n. 3 (\"Solidarity exists by the will of the parties or by law.\")  (translation ours).  The provisions cited above apply equally to both contractual and statutory solidarity;  the only difference between them is that while contractual obligations are presumed not to be solidary unless there is an express agreement to the contrary, see P.R. Civ. C. art. 1090, statutory solidarity operates without regard to the parties' consent to be so bound with each other, see Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 3 (holding that joint tortfeasors are solidarily liable).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tokyo Marine has not argued that UAC and Perez y Ca. expressly agreed to be solidarily liable to any persons injured by Perez y Ca.  The question is therefore whether the liability of an insurer for the harm caused by its insured can be described as solidary liability.  In order to answer this question, we look to the only case in which the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explicitly held that a statute had imposed a variety of solidary liability.  See Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>.   In that case, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court concluded that joint tortfeasors are solidarily liable, even though P.R. Civ. C. art. 1802 does not explicitly mention solidarity.  See id.at * 4.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court based its conclusion on the nature and scope of tort liability.  Under article 1802, when the negligent acts of more than one person have adequately caused a harm, each such person is a joint tortfeasor who is liable in full to the plaintiff for the harm caused.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court foundthat the relationship between the liabilities of joint tortfeasors was indistinguishable from the contractual solidarity described in P.R. Civ. C. art. 1090 because joint tortfeasors, like contractual solidary debtors, are jointly liable for the same obligation.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3101;  Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 4.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court therefore held that article 1874 of the Civil Code applies to joint tortfeasors, so that the timely filing of a suit against one joint tortfeasor had interrupted the prescription of the suit against the other tortfeasors.  See Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the analysis employed in Arroyo, we conclude that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would hold that insured defendants and their insurance companies are solidarily liable for the acts of the insured.  The Puerto Rico Insurance Code specifies the nature and extent of a liability insurer's responsibility for the damage caused by its insured.  In particular, article 20.010 of the Insurance Code makes liability insurers absolutely liable to persons injured by their insured.  See P.R. LAWS ANN. TIT. 26, &#167; 2001.   ARTICLE 20.010<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> must be read in conjunction with article 20.030, according to which an injured party may bring an action directly against the tortfeasor's liability insurer, or against both the tortfeasor and the insurer.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Admittedly, article 20.030 does not state explicitly that tortfeasors and their insurers are liable in solido, which raises the possibility that the Puerto Rico Legislature did not intend to make them so.  But then, P.R. Civ. C. art. 1802 does not explicitly mention solidarity, either.  As in the case of joint tortfeasors, the liability imposed by the Insurance Code upon insurers is co-extensive with that of their insured, up to the limits of the policies in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the fact that the statutory sources of liability for a tortfeasor and its insurer are different does not prevent their liabilities from being solidary.  As noted above, \"[s]olidarity may exist, even though the creditors and debtors are not bound in the same manner, and for the same periods and under the same conditions.\"   P.R. Civ. C. 1093.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that an insurer and its insured are solidarily liable is bolstered by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's determination that a suit against an insurer may be filed up to one year after judgment is entered in a suit against the insured.  See Barrientos v. Gobierno De La Capital, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></span>, 576-77, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21597</span></span> (1969) (interpreting P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030(2)).  The holding in Barrientos is consistent with our conclusion;  as we noted above, one of the secondary consequences of solidarity is that the interruption of prescription as to one solidary debtor affects the other solidary debtors, see P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874, so that a suit against one joint tortfeasor may be filed up to one year after judgment is entered in a suit against another joint tortfeasor, see Arroyo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755630</span></span>, at * 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has not decided this issue, three justices have addressed it in dicta.  All agree with our conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  For example, in an opinion dissenting on a different issue, Associate Justice Rebollo explicitly stated that, \"[a]s is well-known, an insurance company ... is solidarily liable for the negligent acts that its insured may commit.\"  Torres v. Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">755617</span></span>, at * 2 (June 8, 1992) (translation ours).  Similarly, Associate Justice Naveira de Rodn noted in her concurrence in another case that the defendants therein--a leasing company, its insurance company, and the lessor-driver--were solidarily liable for injuries resulting from the driver's negligence.  See Marrero-Albino v. Vazquez-Egean, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909230</span></span>, at * 2 (Feb. 24, 1994).  In an opinion dissenting on other grounds in that same case, Associate Justice Fuster-Berlingeri also wrote that \"there is no doubt whatsoever as to the solidarity existing between the tortfeasor, ... the company that owned the vehicle that he was driving, and its insurer.\"   Marrero-Albino, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">909232</span></span>, at * 5.  As Justice Fuster explained, \"in light of the clear literal sense and purposes served by [P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.010], it is necessary to conclude that, with regard to the plaintiff's claim, the three defendants ... were equally situated from a legal point of view, as if they were one party with regard to the claim made by the plaintiff.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More oblique support for this conclusion is found in Miranda v. Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">908883</span></span>, at * 6 (Dec. 7, 1994), in which the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which, among other things, held the defendants and their insurance companies to be solidarily liable for the award of damages.  Similarly, in Trigo v. the Travelers Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">14346</span></span> (1965), the Puerto Rico Supreme Court reversed a trial court's determination that a claim against the insurer was time-barred, even though the plaintiff had made a timely extrajudicial claim against it.  Since the trial court reasoned that the interruption of prescription against the insurer had not interrupted prescription against the insured, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court could be understood to have disapproved of the trial court's implicit determination that the insured was not liable in solido with its insurer.  Cf. Neptune Packing Corp. v. The Wackenhut Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></span>, 289, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">580867</span></span> (1988) (stating that claims against insurer and insured should generally be brought in the same suit rather than separately).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The handful of cases that could be read to support the opposite conclusion--that defendants and their insurers are not solidarily liable--appear to us to be less compelling.  For example, in Velilla v. Pueblo Supermarkets, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">176460</span></span> (1981), the plaintiff-appellant had originally communicated with the defendant, Pueblo Supermarkets.  Pueblo, however, referred the plaintiff to International Claims Investigators, Inc., an independent insurance adjuster.  When, more than a year afterwards, the plaintiff filed suit against Pueblo, Pueblo moved for and obtained dismissal of the suit on the basis that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations because the insurance adjuster was not its agent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Supreme Court reversed, but not because the claims made against the insurer had simultaneously interrupted prescription as to Pueblo.  Instead, the Supreme Court merely held that Pueblo was equitably estopped from raising the time-bar defense.  Although one could read the choice of rationale as a suggestion that the claim against the insurer does not simultaneously interrupt prescription as to the insured, we find the inference weak because there were other, more likely reasons why the court decided as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, our conclusion is consistent with the history and purpose of P.R. Ins. C. arts. 20.010 and 20.030, which were intended to reverse by statute a number of decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.  In Cruz Nieves v. Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6440</span></span> (1946), the plaintiff had timely filed an extrajudicial claim with the defendant's insurance company, but did not file suit against the defendant until more than a year after the accident.  When the defendant raised the failure to file suit within the one year period required by P.R. Civ. C. art. 1868, the plaintiff countered that the prescription of her action against the defendant had been interrupted by the extrajudicial claim against the insurance company because the two were solidarily liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in Cruz Nieves was article 175 of the former Insurance Law of Puerto Rico (predecessor to the current Insurance Code), which permitted a plaintiff to file a claim against an insurance company jointly with the insured.  In the court's view, an insurance company was liable under article 175 only if its insured were found liable.  The court accepted for purposes of argument the plaintiff's contention that the insurance company was directly liable to her and therefore that her extrajudicial claim against the company interrupted the prescription of her claim against the company.  Nevertheless, since the claim against the defendant was barred by the statute of limitations, the insurance company could not be liable.  Based on this transparently circular reasoning, the court rejected her argument and affirmed the dismissal of her complaint.  Noting that \"solidarity is not presumed, nor does it exist unless it has been expressly agreed to,\" the court also concluded that the liability of the defendant and its insurance company could not be solidary because the complaint had not alleged that the insurance contract had expressly provided that the insurance company would be directly liable to third parties.  Id. at 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court expressly rejected the claim that it had accepted for purposes of argument in Cruz Nieves;  namely, the argument that an insurance company was directly liable to a person injured by its insured.  See United States Cas. Co. v. Corte De Distrito De Arecibo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></span>, 939, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7463</span></span> (1947).  The court held that article 175 of the Puerto Rico Insurance Law did not create a cause of action against an insurer.  The court explained that article 175 authorized a claim against an insurer only when the plaintiff had already obtained a judgment against the insured defendant, or when the insurer had been named a party to the same suit as the insured.  See id.   Based on its decisions in Cruz Nieves and United States Casualty Co., the Puerto Rico Supreme Court subsequently held that the extrajudicial claim made to the insurer within the one-year prescriptive period did not interrupt the prescription of the claim against the insured.  See Bithorn Huicy v. Santana, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></span>, 306, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6750</span></span> (1948);  see also Guerra v.

See Trigo v. the Travelers Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></span>, 871, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">14346</span></span> (1965).  It was no coincidence, surmised the Trigo court, that the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico amended article 175 in 1952 to allow plaintiffs the option of suing insurance companies either directly, or jointly with the insured.  See Act No. 60 of April 17, 1952.  By permitting a direct suit against an insurer, the amended section 175 seemed to establish a separate, direct cause of action against insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That interpretation of the amendment, however, was rejected in Perez v. Maryland Casualty Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.

In Perez, Associate Justice Snyder (the author of the court's opinion in Bithorn Huicy) wrote for the court that the 1952 amendment was merely procedural, permitting a suit to go forward even when the insured was not amenable to service of process.  The court held that the amendment had not created a direct cause of action against insurers, such as the one provided by Louisiana law, because a plaintiff still had to prove that the insured was liable.

See 91 P.R. Dec. at 873.   In 1957, however, the old insurance law was repealed and replaced by the current Insurance Code.  See Act No. 77 of June 19, 1957, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26.  The new code contained a number of provisions, particularly articles 20.010 and 20.030, that clearly established a direct cause of action against insurers.  See Trigo, 91 P.R. Dec. at 874.   It is evident that the enactment of P.R. Ins. C. arts. 20.010 and 20.030 was intended to reverse the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decisions in Cruz-Nieves, United States Casualty Co., Bithorn Huicy, Guerra, Autoridad De Las Fuentes Fluviales, Perez, and Landol.   Since these cases held, among other things, that an insurer and its insured were not solidarily liable, their reversal supports (although, admittedly, does not compel) the conclusion that the direct liability newly imposed upon insurers is solidary with the liability of their insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also noted in Trigo that P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030 uses \"language [that is] very similar to the one in the Louisiana legislation to which we made reference in the Perez case, which makes the insurer substantively and directly responsible\" for the harm caused by its insured.  Trigo, 91 P.R. Dec. at 874 (translation ours).  Under Louisiana law, the insurer and the insured are joint and solidary obligors, and, thus, a suit against the insurer interrupts prescription against the insured.  See Hoefly v.

It is reasonable to conclude that in adopting a rule based on Louisiana law, the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly intended for the rule to be interpreted in a similar manner.  See Garcia v.

Thus, the timely interruption of prescription as to UAC had a like effect as to its insured, Perez y Ca.  See P.R. Civ. C. art. 1874, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5304.  Accordingly, we find that the district court erred in dismissing as time-barred Tokyo Marine's cause of action based on the damage to the vehicles in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal course of events, we would remand this case for further proceedings.  In this case, however, the district court had already made a finding as to amount of the damages to the vehicles in the M/V ORION HIGHWAY shipment, setting the finding aside only because the court determined that the claim was time-barred.  Specifically, the district court found that the damages accruing under such claim amounted to $90,500.  We therefore amend the judgment for Tokyo Marine to increase its award by $90,500, for a total of $334,030.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>III. Finding of Liability and Award of Damages</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez y Ca. raises on appeal a number of arguments as to why the district court's findings of liability and award of damages were erroneous.  In particular, Perez y Ca. contends that the district court erred in determining that Perez y Ca. caused the paint damage to the cars, in failing to determine that the docking permit application absolved it of any liability for damage to the vehicles, in failing to determine that Tokyo Marine's insured, Mitsubishi, was comparatively negligent in failing to mitigate damages, and in assessing special damages.  All of these arguments, except for the one concerning interpretation of the docking permit application, are challenges to the district court's findings of fact.  We review such findings only for clear error, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and find such error only where we are firmly convinced that a mistake has been made, see Strahan v. Coxe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747149\"><a href=\"/opinion/747149/richard-max-strahan-v-trudy-coxe-secretary-of-massachusetts-executive/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 172 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the evidence, we conclude that the district court's findings of liability and damages were not clearly erroneous.  There was evidence before the court supporting its conclusions that the ship painting operations caused the damage to the cars, that there was no alternative location where Mitsubishi could have stored the vehicles, and that Mitsubishi mitigated damages by promptly restoring the vehicles to their original condition, thereby preventing further damages such as decreased sales.  Similarly, there was evidence to support the court's finding that the amounts paid by Mitsubishi to Professional Car Paint, the company that repaired the vehicles, were reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez y Ca. had also argued that liability was foreclosed by clause 9 of the docking permit application, which stated that \"Perez assumes no responsibility for the safety of the cargo or equipment handled by the applicant ... while this cargo is being handled or in storage in the facilities of Perez.\"   Under Puerto Rico law, however, such release clauses are interpreted against exoneration because releases from liability for future negligent conduct are not favored.  See Cabrera v. Doval, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></span>, 781, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">10805</span></span> (1954).  Thus, such a clause will release a party from liability for future negligence only where the clause clearly and explicitly states so.  We agree with the district court that clause 9 did not meet this standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

The district court below found that Perez y Ca. had been obstinate in this litigation and was therefore liable for attorneys' fees.

Although we have found no reported decision directly on point, this conclusion is demonstrably correct.

To prevent the creditor and some of the debtors from colluding against the other debtors, the Code also provides that \"[t]he waiver or remission made by the creditor of the part affecting one of the [solidary] debtors does not release the latter from his liability with regard to his codebtors in case the debt should have been paid in full by any of them.\"   P.R.

Our analysis has been aimed only at determining whether the prescriptive period was interrupted by the letter received by UAC in January 1994.  In order to do so, we asked whether the liability of insurers, as established by the Insurance Code, should be categorized as solidary liability.  Our task was therefore descriptive, not prescriptive, and our holding does not change the substantive liability of insurers.  In particular, this means that a liability insurer is not solidarily liable when the loss is not covered by the insurance agreement.  See P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.010, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 2001 (insurer is liable whenever a covered loss occurs).  Similarly, the plaintiff's direct action against the insurer is subject to \"the terms and limitations of the policy.\"   P.R. Ins. C. art. 20.030, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 2003</p>\n        <p>Thus, in a case in which the prescriptive period has been interrupted by notifying an alleged tortfeasor's insurer, and suit is then brought against the insured after the original prescriptive period would have run, a subsequent motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants would succeed if the uncontroverted evidence showed that the loss was not covered.  This is no different from a case involving allegations that the defendants are joint tortfeasors;  if the evidence later demonstrates that the only defendant against whom interruption was properly made was not, in fact, a joint tortfeasor, then the interruption was not effective against the other defendants.
