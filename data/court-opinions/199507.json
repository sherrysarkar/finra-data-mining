In this sentencing appeal, we\n\naddress   for    the    first    time    two     important     questions.       The\n\nprincipal question concerns the validity of an advance waiver of\n\nappellate rights contained in a plea agreement.1                        Although we\n\nconclude that such waivers are not forbidden, we refuse to give\n\neffect to the waiver in this case because the record offers no\n\nsufficient      assurance       that    it     was    tendered    knowingly     and\n\nvoluntarily.\n\n          Despite winning this battle, the appellant ultimately\n\nloses the war.         Entertaining her appeal, we reach the second\n\nmain question — one that involves the effect to be given to a\n\nstipulation, contained in a plea agreement, as to how a specific\n\nsentencing issue should be resolved.                 On the facts of this case,\n\nwe hold that the district court did not commit reversible error\n\nin accepting and acting upon a stipulated cross-reference within\n\nthe sentencing guidelines and, concomitantly, employing the\n\nstipulated base offense level (BOL) produced by the use of that\n\ncross-reference.\n\n          The     appellant       also    raises      other,     more    pedestrian\n\nissues.   As to those issues, we hold that the district court's\n\n\n    1 We have alluded to this issue in earlier cases, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ramirez, 252 F.3d 516, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No.\n00-2274, slip op. at 3]; United States v. Hines, 196 F.3d 270,\n272 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Springer, 28 F.3d 236, 237\n(1st Cir. 1994), but we have yet to resolve it.\n\n                                         -3-\n\frefusal to depart downward from the guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR) did not constitute an appealable event; and that the\n\ncourt's assessment of the appellant's role in the offense was\n\nnot clearly erroneous.        Consequently, we affirm the substantial\n\nprison sentence imposed below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             Defendant-appellant Patricia A. Teeter is a forty-\n\nsomething-year-old woman whose story, insofar as relevant here,\n\nreflects     misplaced   affection,       terrible   judgment,       and   the\n\ngruesome depths of man's inhumanity to man.            We recount the tale\n\nat some length.\n\n             The appellant's troubles began when she forged a close\n\nfriendship with Steven Brown despite warnings from friends that\n\nBrown had a propensity for violence.             On March 22, 1999, a\n\nmatrimonial court found that Brown had physically abused his\n\nestranged wife, Deborah, and the couple's minor children.                  The\n\ncourt dealt Brown a series of heavy blows:             it awarded custody\n\nto Deborah, sanctioned her departure from New York, and ordered\n\nBrown   to   refrain   from   any   contact   either    with   her    or   the\n\nchildren.      Brown told the appellant of the court's decree,\n\nleaving no doubt about his perturbation.\n\n             On March 27, Brown asked the appellant to accompany him\n\non a \"vacation\" trip to Maine (during which he would retrieve\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhis dog from Deborah).       Although the appellant knew that Brown\n\nhad threatened violence against Deborah if he lost custody of\n\nhis offspring, she nonetheless agreed to the excursion.                 She\n\nthen watched Brown pack her car with a small arsenal, including\n\nan SKS assault rifle, a .20 gauge shotgun, ammunition for the\n\nweapons, and a pair of knives.            Brown also stowed duct tape,\n\nrope, and two hand-held radios aboard the vehicle.\n\n            The \"vacationers\" departed from New York early the next\n\nmorning.     Once in New Hampshire, they temporarily abandoned the\n\nappellant's    car,   rented   another     vehicle,   and   proceeded    to\n\nLebanon, Maine.     They eventually located the trailer occupied by\n\nDeborah, her children, her brother, her father, and her new\n\nswain.     The new arrivals spent the afternoon and evening spying\n\non   the   group   while   Brown   formulated    a   plan   for   Deborah's\n\nabduction.\n\n            That night, Brown instructed the appellant to approach\n\nthe trailer and attempt to lure one of the male occupants\n\noutside by claiming (falsely) that she was having car trouble.\n\nBrown told the appellant that if she succeeded, he would then\n\nincapacitate the good Samaritan.          Following Brown's script, the\n\nappellant inveigled Deborah's brother, Donald Wood, Jr., to come\n\noutside.     Brown hit him over the head with a piece of lead pipe\n\nas he approached the rental car.          The blow made an \"eerie\" sound\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthat the appellant later said she would never forget.                  Brown\n\nthen dragged Wood into the woods — out of the appellant's sight\n\n— and stabbed him twice.        As matters turned out, this last bit\n\nof mayhem was totally unnecessary, inasmuch as an autopsy later\n\nrevealed that the blow to the head was fatal.\n\n            At Brown's request, the appellant returned to the\n\ntrailer   and,    telling   the    same    apocryphal   tale,       convinced\n\nDeborah's consort, Chris Brouillard, to inspect the car.                 When\n\nBrouillard    approached,       Brown   forced   him    to    the     ground,\n\nquestioned him about his relationship with Deborah, struck him\n\nwith the pipe, dragged him into the copse, and stabbed him three\n\ntimes.\n\n            Not content with two murders, Brown instructed the\n\nappellant    to   fetch   yet    another    victim   from    the    trailer.\n\nAlthough the appellant attempted to comply, the third try did\n\nnot go according to the script.              Deborah — her suspicions\n\naroused by the previous activity — insisted that she drive her\n\nown truck to the spot where the appellant's vehicle ostensibly\n\nhad been stranded.    As Deborah neared the rental car, she spied\n\nBrown lurking in the woods and drove away at high speed.                After\n\na short interval, she returned to the trailer.              When she pulled\n\ninto the driveway, Brown forced her into the rental car at\n\ngunpoint and drove to New Hampshire (with the appellant as an\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fadded passenger).       The rental car was returned only after the\n\nappellant had wiped it down to obliterate her fingerprints.\n\n             The trio proceeded in the appellant's automobile to a\n\nmotel   in    East   Greenbush,    New    York.       Acting   on   Brown's\n\ninstructions, the appellant rented two adjoining rooms (one for\n\nherself, one for her fellow travelers).           To prevent Deborah from\n\ncalling for help, Brown removed the telephone from his room and\n\ngave it to the appellant.       During the day, the appellant washed\n\nBrown's bloodstained clothes and ran errands for him.                While\n\naway from the motel, she called a friend who informed her that\n\nWood and Brouillard were dead, and that the police had mounted\n\na manhunt for Brown.       The appellant made no attempt either to\n\nflee or to contact the authorities.         When the police raided the\n\nmotel the next morning, she vainly attempted to warn Brown by\n\ngiving a prearranged signal.\n\n             Following her arrest, the appellant faced a plethora\n\nof federal and state charges.             With respect to the federal\n\ncharges,     she   eventually   entered    into   a   plea   agreement   and\n\nadmitted her guilt as to one count of conspiracy, two counts\n\nanent the use of a firearm in connection with a crime of\n\nviolence, two counts of aiding and abetting interstate domestic\n\nviolence, one count of aiding and abetting interstate stalking,\n\nand one count of aiding and abetting the interstate violation of\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fa protection order.              18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 371, 924(b)-(c), 2261(a),\n\n2261A, 2262(a)-(1).              The appellant also agreed not to contest\n\ncertain of the state charges.2                   In return, the United States\n\nagreed          to   dismiss    three   other     counts,     including    one   for\n\nkidnapping.               The parties stipulated, for federal sentencing\n\npurposes, to a BOL of 43 (a figure derived by cross-reference to\n\nthe first-degree murder guideline, USSG §2A1.1).                     Finally, the\n\nappellant waived her right to appeal any sentence imposed by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                 The court convened a change-of-plea hearing on January\n\n19, 2000.            At that session, the court queried the appellant as\n\nto her overall understanding of the plea agreement, confirmed\n\nthat       no    unexpressed       promises      had   been   made   to   her,   and\n\ndetermined that she was changing her plea voluntarily.                    However,\n\nthe court neglected to mention the waiver of appellate rights\n\ncontained            in   the   plea   agreement.       Instead,     it   told   the\n\nappellant, without qualification and without any demurrer from\n\nthe prosecutor, that she would have a right to appeal any\n\nsentence imposed.\n\n\n\n       2\n     In line with this aspect of the agreement, the appellant\neventually pled guilty in a Maine state court to two counts of\nfelony murder and one count of kidnapping.      She received a\ntwenty-year incarcerative sentence, to be served concurrently\nwith the sentence previously imposed by the federal district\ncourt.\n\n                                           -8-\n\f            At   the   disposition    hearing     (which   stretched   over\n\nseveral days), the appellant asseverated that notwithstanding\n\nthe terms of her plea agreement, the district court should\n\nrenounce the suggested cross-reference and recalculate her BOL.\n\nAs a fallback, she argued that even if the cross-reference\n\nendured, she was entitled to a downward departure because she\n\nhad never intended that Wood or Brouillard perish.            Lastly, she\n\nsought a role-in-the-offense adjustment on the ground that she\n\nwas a minimal (or, at most, minor) participant in the criminal\n\nactivity.\n\n            The sentencing court rejected each and all of these\n\nimportunings.      The court cross-referenced to the first-degree\n\nmurder guideline to reach a BOL of 43, reduced the offense level\n\nto 40 because the appellant had both accepted responsibility for\n\nher   actions    and   cooperated    with   the   authorities,   see   USSG\n\n§3E1.1, and used that figure in calculating her GSR (eschewing\n\nany role-in-the-offense discount).           Given the absence of any\n\nsignificant criminal history, these computations yielded a GSR\n\nof 292-365 months.       The court sentenced the appellant at the\n\nbottom of that range but added a mandatory consecutive sentence\n\nof 60 months on the firearm counts.          The court then advised the\n\nappellant, without tailoring its comments to the contours of the\n\nplea-agreement waiver of appeal, \"that you have a right to\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fappeal this sentence if you wish to do so.\"               The prosecutor did\n\nnot attempt to correct this apparent misstatement.\n\n            This timely appeal ensued.          In it, the appellant seeks\n\nto revisit the issues that she unsuccessfully advanced at the\n\ndisposition hearing.        Before discussing that proffer, however,\n\nwe first must confront the government's contention that this\n\nappeal cannot go forward because Teeter should be held to the\n\nterms of the waiver embedded in her plea agreement.\n\nII.    PRESENTENCE WAIVERS OF APPELLATE RIGHTS\n\n            We    divide   this   portion    of   our   opinion   into   three\n\nsegments.         First,   we   discuss   the     validity   in   general   of\n\npresentence waivers of appellate rights.                Next, we explore the\n\nspecific criteria and conditions that must be met in order for\n\nsuch waivers to be effective, as well as the general power of\n\nappellate courts to override such waivers in the interests of\n\njustice.    Finally, we assay the waiver at issue here.\n\n  A.    Presentence Waivers of Appellate Rights:             An Overview.\n\n            The    basic   argument    against     presentence    waivers   of\n\nappellate rights is that such waivers are anticipatory:                  at the\n\ntime the defendant signs the plea agreement, she does not have\n\na clue as to the nature and magnitude of the sentencing errors\n\nthat may be visited upon her.         Her waiver typically embraces all\n\ndeterminations later made by the sentencing court — some of\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fwhich    may    never    have    occurred       either    to     her    or     to    the\n\ngovernment, and some of which may be quite different than either\n\nthought possible.        In a certain sense, then — though not in the\n\nusual criminal law sense — a waiver of the right to appeal\n\ncannot   be    \"knowing.\"        In    the    appellant's       view,    this       is    a\n\nfundamental defect — and one that distinguishes presentence\n\nwaivers of appellate rights from other waivers contained in a\n\nplea agreement.\n\n              We are not unsympathetic to this argument.                       Withal,\n\nthree reasons counsel persuasively in favor of a rule that\n\naccords general validity to presentence waivers of appellate\n\nrights.3 First, waivers are not inherently suspect in criminal\n\ncases    any   more     than    in    civil    cases.     Criminal       defendants\n\ntypically      may    waive    their    rights,    as    long    as     they    do       so\n\n\n    3We note at the outset that the sort of waiver we are\ndiscussing differs from the waiver disapproved in Worcester v.\nCommissioner, 370 F.2d 713 (1st Cir. 1966).          There, the\nCommissioner sought to estop the taxpayer by reference to a\nrelated criminal case.    We rejected that effort, finding the\ncriminal proceeding to have been tainted because the court had\npressured the taxpayer-defendant into waiving his right to\nappeal in exchange for a lighter sentence.          Id. at 718\n(explaining that \"[t]he court was without right to bargain thus\nwith the defendant, or to put a price on an appeal\").         We\nexpressed concern that, if we permitted this sort of plea\nbargaining, a sentencing court might abuse its power in order to\navoid appellate review, and the defendant, in an unequal\nbargaining position, would have little choice but to go along.\nId. When, as now, the agreement is between the prosecution and\nthe defense (and, thus, subject to the independent supervision\nof the trial court), the Worcester rationale is inapposite.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fvoluntarily    and   with   knowledge   of   the   general   nature   and\n\nconsequences of the waiver.        See Adams v. United States, 317\n\nU.S. 269, 275 (1942) (discussing waiver of right to jury trial);\n\nJohnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464-67 (1938) (discussing\n\nwaiver of right to counsel).      Indeed, guilty pleas are a staple\n\nof our criminal justice system — and a guilty plea inevitably\n\nentails a waiver of numerous rights.          Although many of these\n\nwaivers pertain to future events — a waiver of the right to\n\ntrial by jury is a good example — their prospective nature has\n\nnever been thought to place them off limits or to render the\n\ndefendant's act \"unknowing.\"\n\n         Moreover, the idea of permitting presentence waivers\n\nof appellate rights seems relatively tame because the right to\n\nappeal in a criminal case is not of constitutional magnitude.\n\nSee Jones v.    Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983).             Since the\n\nSupreme Court repeatedly has ruled that a defendant may waive\n\nconstitutional rights as part of a plea agreement, e.g., Town of\n\nNewton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 393 (1987); Brady v. United\n\nStates, 397 U.S. 742, 752-53 (1970), it follows logically that\n\na defendant ought to be able to waive rights that are purely\n\ncreatures of statute.\n\n         The Criminal Rules themselves lend support to this\n\nconclusion.    Effective December 1, 1999, the Supreme Court, with\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthe approval of Congress, amended the Criminal Rules to provide\n\nspecifically         that,    during      a     change-of-plea         hearing,       the\n\npresiding judge \"must address the defendant personally in open\n\ncourt   and    inform       the    defendant     of,    and   determine       that    the\n\ndefendant understands . . . the terms of any provision in a plea\n\nagreement waiving the right to appeal.\"                          Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(c)(6).       While the advisory committee, in its explanatory\n\nnote, made clear that it took \"no position on the underlying\n\nvalidity of such waivers,\" it recognized that they had become an\n\naccepted part of federal plea-agreement practice.                             See id.,\n\nadvisory committee notes.                This widespread acceptance of the\n\npractice is itself a clear indication that those who deal most\n\nfrequently      with    criminal        cases    have    come    to    conclude      that\n\npresentence waivers of appellate rights are not forbidden.\n\n              Considerations of public policy furnish a second pillar\n\non   which     to    rest     a    holding      that    breathes      vitality       into\n\npresentence         waivers       of   appellate       rights.        Since   criminal\n\ndefendants are entitled to appeal convictions and sentences as\n\na matter of statutory right, see 18 U.S.C. § 3742; 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291, a defendant is unlikely to waive this right unless she\n\nbelieves that some feature of a proffered plea agreement makes\n\nit worth her while to do so.               Allowing a criminal defendant to\n\nagree to a waiver of appeal gives her an additional bargaining\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fchip in negotiations with the prosecution; she may, for example,\n\nbe able to exchange this waiver for the government's assent to\n\nthe dismissal of other charges.            This benefit is very real; in\n\nsome cases the government, without such a waiver, might not be\n\nwilling to plea-bargain at all.\n\n            The   benefit   to    the    prosecution       —   conservation      of\n\nresources — is obvious.4         In the same vein, presentence waivers\n\nof   appellate     rights   also        husband    judicial      resources       by\n\ndiscouraging      groundless     sentencing       appeals.         With    court-\n\nappointed    counsel   freely     available       and    nothing   to     lose   by\n\ntrying, a defendant, unfettered by a waiver agreement, is quite\n\nlikely to appeal on a wing and a prayer.                Reducing the number of\n\nbaseless appeals promotes both efficiency and finality in the\n\nadjudication of criminal cases.5\n\n            These policy considerations properly factor into our\n\nassessment of presentence waivers of appellate rights.                    Cf. New\n\n\n\n     4\n     Less obvious, perhaps, is the protection against bait-and-\nswitch tactics on the part of a defendant who makes concessions\nto the government and then seeks to keep what she got and\nwithdraw what she gave. In the last analysis, it is up to the\ncourts to keep this balance steady and true.\n     5\n     Finality is an especially important consideration in\nsociety's attempt to administer a zetetick criminal justice\nsystem. Its virtues have been extolled elsewhere, e.g., Daniels\nv. United States, 121 S. Ct. 1578, 1582 (2001); Lackawanna\nCounty Dist. Atty. v. Cross, 121 S. Ct. 1567, 1573-74 (2001),\nand it would be pleonastic to rehearse them here.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fYork v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 117 (2000) (\"We allow waiver of\n\nnumerous constitutional protections for criminal defendants that\n\nalso serve broader social interests.\").           They indicate that the\n\ngovernment, the defendant, and the judicial system all have\n\nsomething to gain from presentence waivers of appellate rights.\n\nThis    makes    the   device   attractive:      broadly   speaking,   plea\n\nagreements are in the best interests of the parties and the\n\ncriminal justice system, United States v. Penta, 898 F.2d 815,\n\n817 (1st Cir. 1990); Correale v. United States, 479 F.2d 944,\n\n947 (1st Cir. 1973), and the more options that both sides have,\n\nthe more likely it is that they will reach an accord.\n\n            The    third   reason    supporting   a    rule   that   accords\n\nvalidity to presentence waivers of appellate rights is the sheer\n\nweight of authority.        On a close question, where no obviously\n\nright or wrong answer exists, courts of appeals should strive to\n\navoid    creating      needless     conflicts.        In   this   instance,\n\npresentence waivers of appellate rights have been accepted by\n\nall nine of the circuit courts which have passed upon their\n\nvalidity.       See United States v. Hernandez, 242 F.3d 110, 113 (2d\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Fleming, 239 F.3d 761, 763-64 (6th\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Jemison, 237 F.3d 911, 917 (7th\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Nguyen, 235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Cuevas-Andrade, 232 F.3d 440, 446\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f(5th Cir. 2000); United States v. Brown, 232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Black, 201 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Howle, 166 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th\n\nCir. 1999); United States v. Michelsen, 141 F.3d 867, 871 (8th\n\nCir. 1998).       While these courts set varying boundaries, they all\n\nagree that, under ordinary circumstances, a knowing, voluntary\n\nwaiver of the right to appeal from a sentence, contained in a\n\nplea agreement, ought to be enforced.6                Absent some convincing\n\ncountervailing argument — and we are aware of none — we are\n\nreluctant to brush aside this collective wisdom.                       Thus, this\n\nunanimity strongly suggests that such waivers, if appropriately\n\ndrafted, asserted to, and explained, should be honored.\n\n             We    will   not      paint    the   lily.   Given    the    general\n\navailability of waivers in criminal cases, the public policy\n\ngains   to    be    reaped      by   allowing     plea-agreement       waivers   of\n\nappellate     rights,        and     the    impressive    body    of    precedent\n\n\n\n\n    6 Although the courts of appeals have been consentient, we\nnote that individual judges have demurred. E.g., United States\nv. Melancon, 972 F.2d 566, 570-80 (5th Cir. 1992) (Parker, J.,\nconcurring); United States v. Perez, 46 F. Supp. 2d 59, 64-72\n(D. Mass. 1999); United States v. Johnson, 992 F. Supp. 437,\n438-40 (D.D.C. 1997); United States v. Raynor, 989 F. Supp. 43,\n43-49 (D.D.C. 1997). Some commentators also have argued against\nthe validity of presentence waivers of appellate rights. E.g.,\nJack W. Campbell IV & Gregory A. Castanias, Sentencing-Appeal\nWaivers:    Recent Decisions Open the Door to Reinvigorated\nChallenges, The Champion, May 2000, at 34.\n\n                                           -16-\n\fsanctioning such waivers, we hold that presentence waivers of\n\nappellate rights are valid in theory.\n\n\n\n\n                       B.     Criteria and Conditions.\n\n            We    do    not    lend        our    imprimatur   to     such   waivers\n\nindiscriminately.           There are obvious dangers attendant to the\n\npractice.        Sentences ultimately are imposed by the district\n\ncourts,     which      must     make       sentencing    determinations       under\n\ncontrolling law.        When a district court errs in sentencing, that\n\nerror may be manifest on the record.                     Thus, in addition to\n\nconcerns    about      fairness      to     the   defendant,    an    institutional\n\ninterest – public confidence in the judicial system – may be\n\nadversely affected if such errors go uncorrected.                     To ameliorate\n\nthese risks, we deem it appropriate that such waivers meet\n\nstringent criteria.           Even then, we think that limits must be set\n\non the effect that can be given to them.                            It is to those\n\ncriteria and conditions that we now turn.\n\n            The baseline for any waiver of rights is that the\n\ndefendant enter into it knowingly and voluntarily.                      Rumery, 480\n\nU.S. at 394.      In the plea-bargain context, the text of the plea\n\nagreement and the content of the change-of-plea colloquy are\n\ncritically       important      to     a    determination      of    knowledge   and\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\fvolition.    See, e.g., United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d\n\n368, 373 (1st Cir. 1994) (examining both the text of the plea\n\nagreement and the change-of-plea colloquy to determine whether\n\na guilty plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily).                             Like\n\nother courts, e.g.,           Jemison, 237 F.3d at 916-18; Nguyen, 235\n\nF.3d at 1182-83, we will consult those sources in determining\n\nthe validity of a particular presentence waiver of appellate\n\nrights.\n\n            We    look      first   to    confirm     that    the    written      plea\n\nagreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement\n\nelucidating       the    waiver     and    delineating       its    scope.        E.g.,\n\nFleming, 239 F.3d at 762; Brown, 232 F.3d at 401.                     Mindful that\n\nRule 11(c)(6), quoted supra at 11, specifically recognizes the\n\nimportance       of   the    change-of-plea        hearing    to    any   waiver    of\n\nappellate rights, we next will examine the transcript of that\n\nhearing.    The focus of this inquiry is to ascertain whether the\n\ncourt's interrogation suffices to ensure that the defendant\n\nfreely and intelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her\n\nforthcoming sentence.\n\n            In respect to presentence waivers of appellate rights,\n\nseveral courts had held, without reference to the neoteric\n\nprovisions       of   Rule    11(c)(6),     that    the   district        judge    must\n\nquestion the defendant specifically about her understanding of\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fthe   waiver    provision       and     adequately     inform    her   of   its\n\nramifications.      E.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 917-18; Brown, 232\n\nF.3d at 401-02, 405-06.          While some courts previously had held\n\nwaivers of appellate rights to be valid despite the absence of\n\nspecific questioning during the change-of-plea colloquy, e.g.,\n\nMichelsen, 141 F.3d at 871-72; United States v. Wenger, 58 F.3d\n\n280, 282 (7th Cir. 1995), these decisions antedate the adoption\n\nof Rule 11(c)(6).        That rule — which was in force when Teeter\n\nchanged   her    plea     —    alters    the   decisional    calculus.       In\n\nexplicating the rationale for adopting the rule, the advisory\n\ncommittee    made   it    pellucid      that   such   an   inquiry,    properly\n\nperformed, offers considerable assurance of the defendant's\n\nknowledge and volition.         See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(6), advisory\n\ncommittee notes.       Consequently, we hold that the district court\n\nmust inquire specifically at the change-of-the-plea hearing into\n\nany waiver of appellate rights.7                Neglecting this duty will\n\nconstitute     error     and   may    serve    to   invalidate   the    waiver,\n\ndepending upon what the record shows as to the defendants'\n\nknowledge (that is, whether the defendant, notwithstanding the\n\n\n      7\n     We refrain from prescribing any mandatory language for such\nan inquiry because the circumstances will vary from case to\ncase, from defendant to defendant, and from plea agreement to\nplea agreement. We caution only that the court's interrogation\nshould  be   specific   enough  to   confirm   the  defendant's\nunderstanding of the waiver and her acquiescence in the\nrelinquishment of rights that it betokens.\n\n                                        -19-\n\fabsence   of      a     particularized     inquiry,    understood          the   full\n\nsignificance       of    the   waiver)    and   the   existence       vel    non   of\n\nprejudice.       See United States v. Bushert, 997 F.2d 1343, 1351-52\n\n(11th Cir. 1993); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).\n\n            Of course, courts ought to strive for consistency.\n\nWhile not necessarily a fatal error, a court can compromise an\n\notherwise        adequate      change-of-plea         colloquy        by    sending\n\ncontradictory messages to the defendant.                One potential source\n\nof confusion looms when the trial court, acting pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(5),8 tells the defendant\n\nat sentencing about her right to appeal.                   If a presentence\n\nwaiver of appellate rights is in place, the court should be\n\nespecially careful in its choice of words, taking pains to\n\nexplain     to    the     defendant      that   her    right     to    appeal      is\n\ncircumscribed by her preexisting waiver.\n\n            One court has held that a blanket assurance about the\n\nright of appeal, delivered when sentence is pronounced, cancels\n\n\n\n     8The rule provides in pertinent part:\n\n            After imposing sentence in any case, the\n            court must advise the defendant of any right\n            to appeal the sentence, and of the right of\n            a person who is unable to pay the cost of an\n            appeal to apply for leave to appeal in forma\n            pauperis.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(5).\n\n                                         -20-\n\fa preexisting waiver of appellate rights.                  United States v.\n\nBuchanan, 59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that the\n\nsentencing court's statement created \"a reasonable expectation\"\n\non the defendant's part that he could appeal his sentence,\n\nnotwithstanding the preexisting waiver).               Other courts have\n\ndisagreed, e.g., United States v. Atterberry, 144 F.3d 1299,\n\n1301 (10th Cir. 1998); Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872, and so do we.\n\nWhile   broad   assurances     to   a   defendant    who    has    waived    her\n\nappellate    rights   (e.g.,    \"you    have   a   right    to    appeal    your\n\nsentence\") are to be avoided — they muddy the waters and tend to\n\ninstill false hope — they do not effect a per se nullification\n\nof a plea-agreement waiver of appellate rights.                   Whether such\n\nassurances may constitute reversible error in particular cases,\n\nand if so when, are matters that may be left for another day.\n\n            We add a coda.     We have endeavored to provide general\n\nguidance to the district courts and the bar concerning plea-\n\nagreement waivers of appellate rights.              We caution, however,\n\nthat because such waivers are made before any manifestation of\n\nsentencing error emerges, appellate courts must remain free to\n\ngrant relief from them in egregious cases.           When all is said and\n\ndone, such waivers are meant to bring finality to proceedings\n\nconducted in the ordinary course, not to leave acquiescent\n\ndefendants totally exposed to future vagaries (however harsh,\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\funfair, or unforeseeable).              Our basic premise, therefore, is\n\nthat if denying a right of appeal would work a miscarriage of\n\njustice, the appellate court, in its sound discretion, may\n\nrefuse to honor the waiver. 9            As a subset of this premise, we\n\nthink      that   the    same   flexibility    ought    to   pertain       when   the\n\ndistrict court plainly errs in sentencing.10\n\n              In sum, we conclude that plea-agreement waivers of the\n\nright to appeal from imposed sentences are presumptively valid\n\n(if   knowing      and    voluntary),    but   are     subject   to    a    general\n\nexception under which the court of appeals retains inherent\n\npower to relieve the defendant of the waiver, albeit on terms\n\nthat are just to the government, where a miscarriage of justice\n\noccurs.      In charting this course, we recognize that the term\n\n\"miscarriage of justice\" is more a concept than a constant.\n\n\n\n      9\n     This category is infinitely variable, but, by way of\nillustration, we would include within it situations in which\nappellants   claim   that  their   sentences   were   based   on\nconstitutionally impermissible factors (say, race or ethnicity),\nBrown, 232 F.3d at 403; United States v. Schmidt, 47 F.3d 188,\n190 (7th Cir. 1995), or that the plea proceedings were tainted\nby ineffective assistance of counsel, Hernandez, 242 F.3d at\n113-14; Jemison, 237 F.3d at 916 n.8.\n      10\n      To cite a few examples, we do not think that a waiver\nshould be construed to bar an appeal if the trial court imposes\na sentence exceeding the maximum penalty permitted by law,\nBlack, 201 F.3d at 1301; United States v. Attar, 38 F.3d 727,\n729-32 (4th Cir. 1994), or one that violates a material term of\nthe plea agreement, Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872; United States v.\nNavarro-Botello, 912 F.2d 318, 321 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                        -22-\n\fNevertheless, some of the considerations come readily to mind:\n\nthe clarity of the error, its gravity, its character (e.g.,\n\nwhether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing guideline, or a\n\nstatutory maximum), the impact of the error on the defendant,\n\nthe impact of correcting the error on the government, and the\n\nextent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.                           Other\n\nconsiderations doubtless will suggest themselves in specific\n\ncases.\n\n            We recognize, too, that this general reservation will,\n\nat least at the outset, lessen what the government sees as the\n\nprime benefit of its bargain:                  the automatic cutoff of debate\n\nand   the    opportunity         to     get    appeals        dismissed     on   motion.\n\nRealistically,       however,         the     outlook    is    not    entirely   bleak.\n\nWhile open-ended, the general reservation that we envision will\n\nbe applied sparingly and without undue generosity.                          Motions to\n\ndismiss     will    still    be    entertained          and,    by   appealing    after\n\npromising     not    to     do    so,    defendants       will       risk   giving   the\n\ngovernment an option to disclaim a plea agreement, if it wishes\n\nto do so.\n\n            We acknowledge that this approach represents a break\n\nwith precedent.        Although several of our sister circuits have\n\nmade clear, in approving presentence waivers, that there will be\n\nonly narrowly circumscribed exceptions, e.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d\n\n\n                                            -23-\n\fat 911; Brown, 232 F.3d at 403; Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872, we\n\ndo not feel comfortable adopting any rigid taxonomy without more\n\nexperience.     Relief from waivers has traditionally occurred on\n\na fact-specific basis.         We believe that the general reservation\n\nwhich we adopt today is sufficiently broad to capture any truly\n\ndeserving case but demanding enough to prevent defendants who\n\nhave agreed to waive their right to appeal from successfully\n\npursuing garden-variety claims of error.\n\n                      C.   Waiver in the Instant Case.\n\n            Having constructed a framework for determining when\n\nwaivers of appellate rights will be enforced, we ponder the\n\nwaiver   in    this    case.       The    following     language     appears    in\n\nparagraph five of the plea agreement:\n\n            The Defendant is aware that 18 U.S.C. §\n            3742(a) affords a defendant the right to\n            appeal the sentence imposed. Knowing that,\n            in exchange for the Government's concessions\n            made herein, the Defendant waives to the\n            full extent of the law any right to appeal .\n            . . the conviction and sentence, or the\n            manner in which it was determined . . . .\n\nThis explicit text is followed by a statement acknowledging the\n\nappellant's voluntary acceptance of the entire plea agreement\n\nand   confirming      that   she   has     read   and   understood    it.      The\n\nappellant     and   her    attorney      signed   the   document   immediately\n\nbeneath this acknowledgment.               These desiderata furnish prima\n\nfacie evidence of the appellant's knowledge and volition.\n\n                                         -24-\n\f           What    occurred    next    is    somewhat    more    problematic.\n\nDuring    the     change-of-plea       colloquy,   the     district      court\n\nquestioned the appellant concerning her overall understanding\n\nof, and acquiescence in, the terms of the plea agreement, but\n\ndid not direct her attention to the waiver provision.                   As we\n\nhave said, the validity of a waiver of appellate rights depends\n\non whether the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily undertaken.\n\nHere, the court — hampered, no doubt, by the newness of Rule\n\n11(c)(6) and the consequent lack of any precedential guidance —\n\nneither   directed     the    appellant's     attention     to    the   waiver\n\nprovision nor discussed it with her.           Compounding that problem,\n\nthe court, near the end of the Rule 11 colloquy, asked the\n\nappellant:      \"[D]o you also understand that both you and the\n\ngovernment will have a right to appeal any sentence I impose?\"\n\nThis unqualified query — to which the prosecutor (not the same\n\nperson who appears as counsel for the government in this court)\n\ninexplicably failed to take exception — drew an affirmative\n\nresponse from the appellant.             The premise of this question\n\ndirectly contradicted the tenor of the waiver provision.\n\n           Given the court's failure to make inquiry into the\n\nwaiver, its unfortunate contradiction of the waiver's terms, and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fthe lack of any correction, then or thereafter,11 we cannot say\n\nwith the requisite assurance that the appellant's surrender of\n\nher appellate rights was sufficiently informed.                  Accordingly, we\n\nfind that the district court transgressed Rule 11(c)(6).                         The\n\ngovernment    has     not    argued      that    this   error   was    other    than\n\nprejudicial.        We   think     that    the     proper    remedy,   given     the\n\ncircumstances, is to sever the waiver of appellate rights from\n\nthe    remainder    of      the   plea    agreement,        allowing   the     other\n\nprovisions to remain in force.              See Bushert, 997 F.2d at 1353-\n\n54.    Thus, we permit Teeter's appeal to proceed.\n\nIII.     THE MERITS\n\n            The    appellant      raises        three   substantive    issues     on\n\nappeal.     First, she argues that the lower court abused its\n\ndiscretion in accepting the stipulated cross-reference to the\n\nfirst-degree murder guideline.              Second, she asks us to reverse\n\nthe court's decision not to depart downward.                       Finally, she\n\ncomplains that the court committed clear error when evaluating\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      Indeed, immediately following the imposition of sentence,\nthe court exacerbated the problem, stating: \"I must advise you,\nMs. Teeter, that you have a right to appeal this sentence if you\nwish to do so.      Do you understand that?\"       Eliciting an\naffirmative response, the court proceeded to explain, in\nconsiderable detail, the requirements for filing an appeal. At\nno time did the court mention the limitations on the right to\nappeal ostensibly imposed by the plea agreement. Throughout,\nthe prosecutor stood mute.\n\n                                         -26-\n\fher role in the offenses of conviction.             We address these claims\n\nsequentially.\n\n                        A.   The Cross-Reference.\n\n            When sentences are imposed under the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines, the process encompasses certain mechanical aspects.\n\nFirst, the district court must determine the section of the\n\nguidelines that applies to the offense(s) of conviction.                   The\n\ncourt then must look to that guideline section to determine the\n\nBOL.    This is not as simple as it sounds because some guideline\n\nprovisions are not self-contained; they require (or, at least,\n\nsuggest) cross-referencing to other guideline sections to help\n\ndetermine the BOL.\n\n            In this case, the sentencing court determined that the\n\nappellant's conduct fell, in pertinent part, within the purview\n\nof   USSG   §2A6.2     (\"Stalking     or     Domestic   Violence\").      This\n\ndetermination was fully consistent with the plea agreement, and\n\nthe appellant does not contest it.               Moving forward, the court\n\nnoted that section 2A6.2(c) contains a cross-reference provision\n\nwhich   reads   as    follows:       \"If   the   offense   involved   conduct\n\ncovered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A\n\n(Offenses Against the Person), apply that offense guideline, if\n\nthe resulting offense level is greater than that determined\n\nabove.\"      The     court   found    that    the   pertinent   offenses   of\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fconviction fell within the scope of this language and cross-\n\nreferenced to the first-degree murder guideline (USSG §2A1.1).\n\nBecause that guideline yielded a higher BOL (43), the court\n\napplied it.\n\n            The appellant concedes that, in the plea agreement, she\n\nstipulated       both     to    this    very      cross-reference        and    to    the\n\nresultant     BOL   (43).        She    nonetheless        asseverates         that   the\n\nsentencing court erred in embracing this stipulation.                             Here,\n\nhowever, the appellant stipulated to the facts underlying the\n\ncross-reference, and those facts render the sentencing court's\n\nuse of the cross-reference plausible.                     No more is exigible to\n\nwarrant rejection of the appellant's asseveration.\n\n            We    have     analogized        plea    agreements     to    contracts,\n\nbinding upon the prosecution and the defense alike.                               E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   We have been scrupulous in holding the government to the\n\ndue performance of its obligations thereunder, e.g., United\n\nStates   v.      Clark,    55    F.3d       9,    12-13   (1st   Cir.     1995),      and\n\ndefendants       cannot    expect      to    be    treated   less   fastidiously.\n\nConsequently, defendants ordinarily should be held to plea-\n\nagreement terms that they knowingly and voluntarily accept.                           See\n\nUnited States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 185-86 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nBut there are caveats.             Stipulations about legal issues, for\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fexample, are problematic.              There is language in a number of\n\ncases indicating (correctly, we think) that such stipulations\n\nnormally are not binding on a court. E.g., Estate of Sanford v.\n\nCommissioner, 308 U.S. 39, 51 (1939); Weston v. Wash. Metro.\n\nArea Transit Auth., 78 F.3d 682, 685 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Gunn v.\n\nUnited States, 283 F.2d 358, 364 (8th Cir. 1960).                         Even when\n\nstipulations concern facts rather than law, courts traditionally\n\nretain the power to relieve parties from them on terms that are\n\njust.      E.g., TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n             Of course, except where the parties have entered into\n\na binding plea agreement under the aegis of Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C), the stipulations contained in\n\nthe   agreement,     even   if   factual       in   nature,    do   not    tie   the\n\ndistrict court's hands.          See United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d\n\n1, 4-8 (1st Cir. 2000); Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 149 n.2.\n\nThat the court has the power to deviate from such stipulations,\n\nhowever, does not obligate the court to do so.                 Should the court\n\ndecide      to   accept   and    act    upon    factual       stipulations       for\n\nsentencing purposes, the parties usually will be firmly bound.12\n\n\n\n      12\n      Conceivably, there may be a rare case in which relief from\nsuch a stipulation would be justified to avoid a miscarriage of\njustice or to correct a mutual mistake. But such cases will be\nfew and far between, and the case at hand is not one of them.\n\n                                       -29-\n\fThis general rule will apply when, for example, a defendant\n\nstipulates to a matter of fact or to the applicability of a\n\nsentencing guideline (the legal meaning of which is pellucid) to\n\nthe unique facts of her case.         After all, the defendant knows\n\nwhat she has done, and has little cause for complaint if the\n\ndistrict court takes her at her word.\n\n            It is much more difficult to justify binding effect for\n\na stipulation that purports to resolve a general issue of law\n\n(or one that turns out to do so without acknowledgment).             To\n\ncite an extreme example, it is difficult to see why a district\n\ncourt that misreads the effective date of a statute bearing on\n\na sentencing determination should automatically be insulated\n\nfrom appellate review because the parties stipulated to the\n\n(wrong) effective date.        That leaves stipulations as to mixed\n\nquestions    of   fact   and   law.      As   to   such   stipulations,\n\ngeneralizations are risky business.       The answer, in a particular\n\ncase, may depend on the extent to which the mixed question is\n\nfact-dominated, cf. In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320,\n\n1328 (1st Cir. 1993), or the extent to which the known facts\n\n(whether found by the court or stipulated by the parties) make\n\na given answer to the mixed question plausible.\n\n            This case involves a combination of these principles.\n\nThe appellant stipulated to the BOL – 43 – and to the propriety\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fof using the cross-reference to USSG §2A1.1 found in USSG §2A6.2\n\nto reach that BOL.               To that extent, her challenge to the\n\nstipulation       is    based    in    law,    and   thus   arguably    subject    to\n\nplenary review.              But there is more:            in the course of the\n\nproceedings below, the appellant pled guilty to counts five,\n\nsix, seven, and ten (among others).                   These counts charged her\n\nwith     aiding        and    abetting        interstate     domestic    violence,\n\ninterstate stalking, and interstate violation of a protection\n\norder.     18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2261(a)(1)-(2), 2261A, 2262(a)(1).                     She\n\nadmitted    to    certain       facts    through     her    plea   agreement,     the\n\nchange-of-plea         colloquy,       and    at   sentencing.      Those   factual\n\nadmissions are not now open to challenge — and they suffice to\n\njustify the sentencing court's use of the stipulated cross-\n\nreference.       We explain briefly.\n\n            The applicable sentencing guideline in this case is\n\nUSSG §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence).                       As said, this\n\nsection contains a cross-reference to the first-degree murder\n\nguideline, USSG §2A1.1.               This cross-reference arises by virtue\n\nof USSG §1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Relevant Conduct), which pertinently\n\nprovides that a defendant's BOL shall be determined \"in the case\n\nof jointly undertaken criminal activity [on the basis of] all\n\nreasonably       foreseeable          acts     and   omissions     of   others     in\n\nfurtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\foccurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.\"\n\nIn the district court, the appellant admitted to crossing state\n\nlines     to    commit    illegal       acts    against    Deborah      Brown,    a\n\nstipulation of fact unchallenged on appeal.                   Additionally, she\n\nadmitted to seeing and hearing Brown's vicious attack on Wood,\n\nyet nonetheless luring the next victim, Brouillard, into a place\n\nof maximum danger.          Given these conceded facts, the murder of\n\nthe   second      victim,   at    the    very    least,    was     \"a   reasonably\n\nforeseeable act\" in furtherance of the offenses of conviction.\n\nConsequently, the district court had a plausible factual basis\n\nfor cross-referencing to the first-degree murder guideline (as\n\nagreed by the parties) and employing a BOL of 43.\n\n               On this point, we find United States v. Robinson, 14\n\nF.3d 1200 (7th Cir. 1994), instructive.                   There, the defendant\n\nentered     into    a    plea    agreement      in   which    he    admitted     to\n\ndistributing specific quantities of drugs.                   The district court\n\nsentenced him in line with the stipulation.                        The defendant\n\nnonetheless appealed, claiming that the court erred by failing\n\nto make an independent drug-quantity determination.                        Id. at\n\n1206.     The Seventh Circuit quickly shut down this appeal:\n\n               Robinson pled guilty, and was sentenced\n               based on what he admitted in the plea\n               agreement, at the guideline level agreed\n               upon in the plea agreement. . . . Robinson\n               got what he bargained for, he waived any\n               right to challenge the contents of the plea\n\n                                        -32-\n\f         agreement when he signed it, and he has no\n         basis to challenge it now.\n\nId.   The same can be said for Teeter.      Having admitted the\n\nunderlying facts that supported the sentencing court's resort to\n\nthe stipulated cross-reference, she is unable to challenge that\n\ndecision on appeal.\n\n                   B.   The Downward Departure.\n\n         The appellant's fallback position is that, even if the\n\ndistrict court appropriately cross-referenced USSG §2A1.1, it\n\nnonetheless erred in failing to depart downward.    This argument\n\nstems from the fact that the heartland of the first-degree\n\nmurder guideline involves those who knowingly and intentionally\n\nparticipate in an act of homicide.    If, however, \"the defendant\n\ndid not cause the [victim's] death intentionally or knowingly,\"\n\nthe Sentencing Commission has raised the possibility that \"a\n\ndownward departure may be warranted.\"      USSG §2A1.1, comment.\n\n(n.1).   Such a departure was advisable here, the appellant\n\nsuggests, because she neither knowingly nor intentionally caused\n\nthe deaths of Wood and Brouillard.\n\n         We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument.      For\n\nthe most part, departure decisions are discretionary, and a\n\ndefendant cannot appeal from the sentencing court's refusal to\n\ngrant a downward departure.     Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 148;\n\nUnited States v.   Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                               -33-\n\fAlthough there is a narrow window of opportunity for cases in\n\nwhich the district court misapprehends its authority to depart,\n\nPierro, 32 F.3d at 619; United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288,\n\n292 (1st Cir. 1992), this case falls within the general rule,\n\nnot the long-odds exception to it.\n\n         Despite    the    appellant's     efforts      at     creative\n\ncharacterization,   this   assignment      of   error    involves      a\n\ndiscretionary departure decision, pure and simple.           Application\n\nNote 1 specifically refers to the possibility of a \"downward\n\ndeparture\" and leaves that possibility squarely in the hands of\n\nthe sentencing court.   Hence, we lack jurisdiction to review the\n\ncourt's refusal to invoke Application Note 1 unless there is\n\nsome reason to believe that the court misunderstood its options.\n\nUnited States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 674 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n         There is absolutely no basis for any such belief here:\n\nthe appellant points to nothing that would indicate that the\n\ncourt mistook its authority to depart, and the record makes\n\nmanifest that Judge Carter knew he had the power to depart but\n\ndeliberately chose not to do so.      Indeed, the judge stated, not\n\nonce but twice, that he was rejecting the appellant's request\n\nfor a downward departure based on the facts of record.            Under\n\nthese circumstances, we are foreclosed from second-guessing the\n\ncourt's discretionary decision not to depart from the GSR.\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f               C.    The Role-in-the-Offense Adjustment.\n\n            The final arrow in the appellant's quiver also misses\n\nthe mark.      She asserts that the district court incorrectly\n\nfailed to reduce her offense level given her unimportant role in\n\nthe crime spree.       Absent a mistake of law — and we discern none\n\nhere — we review such factbound status determinations for clear\n\nerror.   United States v.           Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n            The appellant says that the lower court should have\n\nclassified     her   as   a   \"minimal\"      or   \"minor\"   participant,   and\n\ndecreased her offense level accordingly.              A defendant who seeks\n\na   downward    role-in-the-offense          adjustment     must   prove   her\n\nentitlement to it.        See id.   To qualify as a minimal participant\n\nand obtain the concomitant four-level reduction, the appellant\n\nwould have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she\n\nwas, at most, a peripheral player in the criminal activity.\n\nSee, e.g., USSG §3B1.2, comment. (n.2) (giving, as an example of\n\na minimal participant, \"someone who played no other role in a\n\nvery large drug smuggling operation than to offload part of a\n\nsingle marihuana shipment\").          To qualify as a minor participant\n\nand obtain the concomitant two-level reduction, the appellant\n\nwould have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she\n\nwas \"less culpable than most other participants.\"              Id., comment.\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\f(n.3).     This means that she must be not only less culpable than\n\nher cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor, but also less\n\nculpable than the majority of those within the universe of\n\npersons participating in similar crimes.                   See United States v.\n\nMurphy, 193 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Ocasio,\n\n914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            Given     the    allocation    of    the       burden   of    proof,   a\n\ndefendant who seeks a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment\n\nusually faces an uphill climb in the                  nisi prius court.        The\n\ndeferential standard of review compounds the difficulty, so that\n\na defendant who fails to persuade at that level faces a much\n\nsteeper slope on appeal.          \"We have declared, with a regularity\n\nbordering       on   the    echolalic,    that    .    .    .   battles     over   a\n\ndefendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in\n\nthe district court.\"          United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85\n\n(1st     Cir.    1998)     (citations    and     internal       quotation    marks\n\nomitted).       This is such a case.\n\n            The court below determined that the appellant was\n\nconsiderably more than a bit player in the unfolding tragedy.\n\nThis determination is amply rooted in the record.                   The appellant\n\nfacilitated Brown's travel plans; went with him to Maine; helped\n\nhim track down his prey; lured the first victim (Wood) from the\n\ntrailer to a locus where Brown could more easily get to him,\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fknowing that Brown had incapacitation in mind; put the second\n\nvictim (Brouillard) in harm's way after seeing Brown brutally\n\nattack Wood; aided Brown in abducting and holding hostage his\n\nestranged wife; maintained her allegiance even after receiving\n\nirrefutable proof of the murders; and attempted to warn Brown\n\nwhen the police arrived.\n\n              To be sure, the facts can be marshaled in such a way\n\nas to put the appellant in a somewhat more sympathetic light.\n\nThe appellant's able counsel strives valiantly to transform the\n\ncase in this fashion:        he claims that the appellant agreed only\n\nto spend a romantic weekend holiday with her boyfriend in Maine,\n\nand    that    what   happened    thereafter      was   largely   beyond      her\n\ncontrol.      This spin does not carry the day, however, because the\n\nsentencing court was fully entitled to draw a different, more\n\nsinister, set of inferences from the largely undisputed facts.\n\nSee United States v. Santiago-Gonzalez, 66 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); Garcia, 954 F.2d at 18.                 Accordingly, we uphold the\n\ndistrict court's eschewal of a downward role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment.      See United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)    (explaining      that    \"where   there   is   more    than   one\n\nplausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's\n\nchoice     among      supportable   alternatives        cannot    be    clearly\n\nerroneous\").\n\n\n                                        -37-\n\fIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We   need   go   no   further.      Although   we   afford   the\n\nappellant a full right of appeal notwithstanding the waiver of\n\nappellate rights contained in her plea agreement, we reject each\n\nand all of her claims of error.              Her conviction and sentence\n\nmust, therefore, be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\f",

On the facts of this case, we hold that the district court did not commit reversible error in accepting and acting upon a stipulated cross-reference within the sentencing guidelines and, concomitantly, employing the stipulated base offense level (BOL) produced by the use of that cross-reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also raises other, more pedestrian issues. As to those issues, we hold that the district court's refusal to depart downward from the guideline sentencing range (GSR) did not constitute an appealable event; and that the court's assessment of the appellant's role in the offense was not clearly erroneous. Consequently, we affirm the substantial prison sentence imposed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Patricia A. Teeter is a forty-something-year-old woman whose story, insofar as relevant here, reflects misplaced affection, terrible judgment, and the gruesome depths of man's inhumanity to man. We recount the tale at some length.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's troubles began when she forged a close friendship with Steven Brown despite warnings from friends that Brown had a propensity for violence. On March 22, 1999, a matrimonial court found that Brown had physically abused his estranged wife, Deborah, and the couple's minor children. The court dealt Brown a series of heavy blows: it awarded custody to Deborah, sanctioned her departure from New York, and ordered Brown to refrain from any contact either with her or the children. Brown told the appellant of the court's decree, leaving no doubt about his perturbation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, Brown asked the appellant to accompany him on a \"vacation\" trip to Maine (during which he would retrieve his dog from Deborah). Although the appellant knew that Brown had threatened violence against Deborah if he lost custody of his offspring, she nonetheless agreed to the excursion. She then watched Brown pack her car with a small arsenal, including an SKS assault rifle, a .20 gauge shotgun, ammunition for the weapons, and a pair of knives. Brown also stowed duct tape, rope, and two hand-held radios aboard the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"vacationers\" departed from New York early the next morning. Once in New Hampshire, they temporarily abandoned the appellant's car, rented another vehicle, and proceeded to Lebanon, Maine. They eventually located the trailer occupied by Deborah, her children, her brother, her father, and her new swain. The new arrivals spent the afternoon and evening spying on the group while Brown formulated a plan for Deborah's abduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That night, Brown instructed the appellant to approach the trailer and attempt to lure one of the male occupants outside by claiming (falsely) that she was having car trouble. Brown told the appellant that if she succeeded, he would then incapacitate the good Samaritan. Following Brown's script, the appellant inveigled Deborah's brother, Donald Wood, Jr., to come outside. Brown hit him over the head with a piece of lead pipe as he approached the rental car. The blow made an \"eerie\" sound that the appellant later said she would never forget. Brown then dragged Wood into the woods - out of the appellant's sight - and stabbed him twice. As matters turned out, this last bit of mayhem was totally unnecessary, inasmuch as an autopsy later revealed that the blow to the head was fatal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Brown's request, the appellant returned to the trailer and, telling the same apocryphal tale, convinced Deborah's consort, Chris Brouillard, to inspect the car. When Brouillard approached, Brown forced him to the ground, questioned him about his relationship with Deborah, struck him with the pipe, dragged him into the copse, and stabbed him three times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not content with two murders, Brown instructed the appellant to fetch yet another victim from the trailer. Although the appellant attempted to comply, the third try did not go according to the script. Deborah - her suspicions aroused by the previous activity - insisted that she drive her own truck to the spot where the appellant's vehicle ostensibly had been stranded. As Deborah neared the rental car, she spied Brown lurking in the woods and drove away at high speed. After a short interval, she returned to the trailer. When she pulled into the driveway, Brown forced her into the rental car at gunpoint and drove to New Hampshire (with the appellant as an added passenger). The rental car was returned only after the appellant had wiped it down to obliterate her fingerprints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trio proceeded in the appellant's automobile to a motel in East Greenbush, New York. Acting on Brown's instructions, the appellant rented two adjoining rooms (one for herself, one for her fellow travelers). To prevent Deborah from calling for help, Brown removed the telephone from his room and gave it to the appellant. During the day, the appellant washed Brown's bloodstained clothes and ran errands for him. While away from the motel, she called a friend who informed her that Wood and Brouillard were dead, and that the police had mounted a manhunt for Brown. The appellant made no attempt either to flee or to contact the authorities. When the police raided the motel the next morning, she vainly attempted to warn Brown by giving a prearranged signal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her arrest, the appellant faced a plethora of federal and state charges. With respect to the federal charges, she eventually entered into a plea agreement and admitted her guilt as to one count of conspiracy, two counts anent the use of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, two counts of aiding and abetting interstate domestic violence, one count of aiding and abetting interstate stalking, and one count of aiding and abetting the interstate violation of a protection order. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 2, 371, 924(b)-(c), 2261(a), 2261A, 2262(a)-(1). The appellant also agreed not to contest certain of the state charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In return, the United States agreed to dismiss three other counts, including one for kidnapping. The parties stipulated, for federal sentencing purposes, to a BOL of 43 (a figure derived by cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline, USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1). Finally, the appellant waived her right to appeal any sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court convened a change-of-plea hearing on January 19, 2000. At that session, the court queried the appellant as to her overall understanding of the plea agreement, confirmed that no unexpressed promises had been made to her, and determined that she was changing her plea voluntarily. However, the court neglected to mention the waiver of appellate rights contained in the plea agreement. Instead, it told the appellant, without qualification and without any demurrer from the prosecutor, that she would have a right to appeal any sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing (which stretched over several days), the appellant asseverated that notwithstanding the terms of her plea agreement, the district court should renounce the suggested cross-reference and recalculate her BOL. As a fallback, she argued that even if the cross-reference endured, she was entitled to a downward departure because she had never intended that Wood or Brouillard perish. Lastly, she sought a role-in-the-offense adjustment on the ground that she was a minimal (or, at most, minor) participant in the criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court rejected each and all of these importunings. The court cross-referenced to the first-degree murder guideline to reach a BOL of 43, reduced the offense level to 40 because the appellant had both accepted responsibility for her actions and cooperated with the authorities, see USSG &#167;&#167;3E1.1, and used that figure in calculating her GSR (eschewing any role-in-the-offense discount). Given the absence of any significant criminal history, these computations yielded a GSR of 292-365 months. The court sentenced the appellant at the bottom of that range but added a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months on the firearm counts. The court then advised the appellant, without tailoring its comments to the contours of the plea-agreement waiver of appeal, \"that you have a right to appeal this sentence if you wish to do so.\" The prosecutor did not attempt to correct this apparent misstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This timely appeal ensued. In it, the appellant seeks to revisit the issues that she unsuccessfully advanced at the disposition hearing. Before discussing that proffer, however, we first must confront the government's contention that this appeal cannot go forward because Teeter should be held to the terms of the waiver embedded in her plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. PRESENTENCE WAIVERS OF APPELLATE RIGHTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide this portion of our opinion into three segments. First, we discuss the validity in general of presentence waivers of appellate rights. Next, we explore the specific criteria and conditions that must be met in order for such waivers to be effective, as well as the general power of appellate courts to override such waivers in the interests of justice. Finally, we assay the waiver at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Presentence Waivers of Appellate Rights: An Overview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic argument against presentence waivers of appellate rights is that such waivers are anticipatory: at the time the defendant signs the plea agreement, she does not have a clue as to the nature and magnitude of the sentencing errors that may be visited upon her. Her waiver typically embraces all determinations later made by the sentencing court - some of which may never have occurred either to her or to the government, and some of which may be quite different than either thought possible. In a certain sense, then - though not in the usual criminal law sense - a waiver of the right to appeal cannot be \"knowing.\" In the appellant's view, this is a fundamental defect - and one that distinguishes presentence waivers of appellate rights from other waivers contained in a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not unsympathetic to this argument. Withal, three reasons counsel persuasively in favor of a rule that accords general validity to presentence waivers of appellate rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> First, waivers are not inherently suspect in criminal cases any more than in civil cases. Criminal defendants typically may waive their rights, as long as they do so voluntarily and with knowledge of the general nature and consequences of the waiver. See Adams v. United States, 317 U.S. 269, 275 (1942) (discussing waiver of right to jury trial); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464-67 (1938) (discussing waiver of right to counsel). Indeed, guilty pleas are a staple of our criminal justice system - and a guilty plea inevitably entails a waiver of numerous rights. Although many of these waivers pertain to future events - a waiver of the right to trial by jury is a good example - their prospective nature has never been thought to place them off limits or to render the defendant's act \"unknowing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the idea of permitting presentence waivers of appellate rights seems relatively tame because the right to appeal in a criminal case is not of constitutional magnitude. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983). Since the Supreme Court repeatedly has ruled that a defendant may waive constitutional rights as part of a plea agreement, e.g., Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 393 (1987); Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 752-53 (1970), it follows logically that a defendant ought to be able to waive rights that are purely creatures of statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Criminal Rules themselves lend support to this conclusion. Effective December 1, 1999, the Supreme Court, with the approval of Congress, amended the Criminal Rules to provide specifically that, during a change-of-plea hearing, the presiding judge \"must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands . . . the terms of any provision in a plea agreement waiving the right to appeal.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(6). While the advisory committee, in its explanatory note, made clear that it took \"no position on the underlying validity of such waivers,\" it recognized that they had become an accepted part of federal plea-agreement practice. See id., advisory committee notes. This widespread acceptance of the practice is itself a clear indication that those who deal most frequently with criminal cases have come to conclude that presentence waivers of appellate rights are not forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considerations of public policy furnish a second pillar on which to rest a holding that breathes vitality into presentence waivers of appellate rights. Since criminal defendants are entitled to appeal convictions and sentences as a matter of statutory right, see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3742; 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1291, a defendant is unlikely to waive this right unless she believes that some feature of a proffered plea agreement makes it worth her while to do so. Allowing a criminal defendant to agree to a waiver of appeal gives her an additional bargaining chip in negotiations with the prosecution; she may, for example, be able to exchange this waiver for the government's assent to the dismissal of other charges. This benefit is very real; in some cases the government, without such a waiver, might not be willing to plea-bargain at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The benefit to the prosecution - conservation of resources -is obvious.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the same vein, presentence waivers of appellate rights also husband judicial resources by discouraging groundless sentencing appeals. With court-appointed counsel freely available and nothing to lose by trying, a defendant, unfettered by a waiver agreement, is quite likely to appeal on a wing and a prayer. Reducing the number of baseless appeals promotes both efficiency and finality in the adjudication of criminal cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These policy considerations properly factor into our assessment of presentence waivers of appellate rights. Cf. New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 117 (2000) (\"We allow waiver of numerous constitutional protections for criminal defendants that also serve broader social interests.\"). They indicate that the government, the defendant, and the judicial system all have something to gain from presentence waivers of appellate rights. This makes the device attractive: broadly speaking, plea agreements are in the best interests of the parties and the criminal justice system, United States v. Penta, 898 F.2d 815, 817 (1st Cir. 1990); Correale v. United States, 479 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir. 1973), and the more options that both sides have, the more likely it is that they will reach an accord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third reason supporting a rule that accords validity to presentence waivers of appellate rights is the sheer weight of authority. On a close question, where no obviously right or wrong answer exists, courts of appeals should strive to avoid creating needless conflicts. In this instance, presentence waivers of appellate rights have been accepted by all nine of the circuit courts which have passed upon their validity. See United States v. Hernandez, 242 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2001); United States v. Fleming, 239 F.3d 761, 763-64 (6th Cir. 2001); United States v. Jemison, 237 F.3d 911, 917 (7th Cir. 2001); United States v. Nguyen, 235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir. 2000); United States v. Cuevas-Andrade, 232 F.3d 440, 446 (5th Cir. 2000); United States v. Brown, 232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir. 2000); United States v. Black, 201 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir. 2000); United States v. Howle, 166 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Michelsen, 141 F.3d 867, 871 (8th Cir. 1998). While these courts set varying boundaries, they all agree that, under ordinary circumstances, a knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence, contained in a plea agreement, ought to be enforced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Absent some convincing countervailing argument - and we are aware of none - we are reluctant to brush aside this collective wisdom. Thus, this unanimity strongly suggests that such waivers, if appropriately drafted, asserted to, and explained, should be honored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. Given the general availability of waivers in criminal cases, the public policy gains to be reaped by allowing plea-agreement waivers of appellate rights, and the impressive body of precedent sanctioning such waivers, we hold that presentence waivers of appellate rights are valid in theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Criteria and Conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lend our imprimatur to such waivers indiscriminately. There are obvious dangers attendant to the practice. Sentences ultimately are imposed by the district courts, which must make sentencing determinations under controlling law. When a district court errs in sentencing, that error may be manifest on the record. Thus, in addition to concerns about fairness to the defendant, an institutional interest - public confidence in the judicial system - may be adversely affected if such errors go uncorrected. To ameliorate these risks, we deem it appropriate that such waivers meet stringent criteria. Even then, we think that limits must be set on the effect that can be given to them. It is to those criteria and conditions that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The baseline for any waiver of rights is that the defendant enter into it knowingly and voluntarily. Rumery, 480 U.S. at 394. In the plea-bargain context, the text of the plea agreement and the content of the change-of-plea colloquy are critically important to a determination of knowledge and volition. See, e.g., United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 373 (1st Cir. 1994) (examining both the text of the plea agreement and the change-of-plea colloquy to determine whether a guilty plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily). Like other courts, e.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 916-18; Nguyen, 235 F.3d at 1182-83, we will consult those sources in determining the validity of a particular presentence waiver of appellate rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look first to confirm that the written plea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope. E.g., Fleming, 239 F.3d at 762; Brown, 232 F.3d at 401. Mindful that Rule 11(c)(6), quoted supra at 22, specifically recognizes the importance of the change-of-plea hearing to any waiver of appellate rights, we next will examine the transcript of that hearing. The focus of this inquiry is to ascertain whether the court's interrogation suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to presentence waivers of appellate rights, several courts had held, without reference to the neoteric provisions of Rule 11(c)(6), that the district judge must question the defendant specifically about her understanding of the waiver provision and adequately inform her of its ramifications. E.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 917-18; Brown, 232 F.3d at 401-02, 405-06. While some courts previously had held waivers of appellate rights to be valid despite the absence of specific questioning during the change-of-plea colloquy, e.g., Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 871-72; United States v. Wenger, 58 F.3d 280, 282 (7th Cir. 1995), these decisions antedate the adoption of Rule 11(c)(6). That rule - which was in force when Teeter changed her plea - alters the decisional calculus. In explicating the rationale for adopting the rule, the advisory committee made it pellucid that such an inquiry, properly performed, offers considerable assurance of the defendant's knowledge and volition. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(6), advisory committee notes. Consequently, we hold that the district court must inquire specifically at the change-of-the-plea hearing into any waiver of appellate rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Neglecting this duty will constitute error and may serve to invalidate the waiver, depending upon what the record shows as to the defendants' knowledge (that is, whether the defendant, notwithstanding the absence of a particularized inquiry, understood the full significance of the waiver) and the existence vel non of prejudice. See United States v. Bushert, 997 F.2d 1343, 1351-52 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, courts ought to strive for consistency. While not necessarily a fatal error, a court can compromise an otherwise adequate change-of-plea colloquy by sending contradictory messages to the defendant. One potential source of confusion looms when the trial court, acting pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(5),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> tells the defendant at sentencing about her right to appeal. If a presentence waiver of appellate rights is in place, the court should be especially careful in its choice of words, taking pains to explain to the defendant that her right to appeal is circumscribed by her pre-existing waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One court has held that a blanket assurance about the right of appeal, delivered when sentence is pronounced, cancels a pre-existing waiver of appellate rights. United States v. Buchanan, 59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that the sentencing court's statement created \"a reasonable expectation\" on the defendant's part that he could appeal his sentence, notwithstanding the pre-existing waiver). Other courts have disagreed, e.g., United States v. Atterberry, 144 F.3d 1299, 1301 (10th Cir. 1998); Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872, and so do we. While broad assurances to a defendant who has waived her appellate rights (e.g., \"you have a right to appeal your sentence\") are to be avoided -they muddy the waters and tend to instill false hope - they do not effect a per se nullification of a plea-agreement waiver of appellate rights. Whether such assurances may constitute reversible error in particular cases, and if so when, are matters that may be left for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. We have endeavored to provide general guidance to the district courts and the bar concerning plea-agreement waivers of appellate rights. We caution, however, that because such waivers are made before any manifestation of sentencing error emerges, appellate courts must remain free to grant relief from them in egregious cases. When all is said and done, such waivers are meant to bring finality to proceedings conducted in the ordinary course, not to leave acquiescent defendants totally exposed to future vagaries (however harsh, unfair, or unforeseeable). Our basic premise, therefore, is that if denying a right of appeal would work a miscarriage of justice, the appellate court, in its sound discretion, may refuse to honor the waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As a subset of this premise, we think that the same flexibility ought to pertain when the district court plainly errs in sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that plea-agreement waivers of the right to appeal from imposed sentences are presumptively valid (if knowing and voluntary), but are subject to a general exception under which the court of appeals retains inherent power to relieve the defendant of the waiver, albeit on terms that are just to the government, where a miscarriage of justice occurs. In charting this course, we recognize that the term \"miscarriage of justice\" is more a concept than a constant. Nevertheless, some of the considerations come readily to mind: the clarity of the error, its gravity, its character (e.g., whether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing guideline, or a statutory maximum), the impact of the error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the error on the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result. Other considerations doubtless will suggest themselves in specific cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, too, that this general reservation will, at least at the outset, lessen what the government sees as the prime benefit of its bargain: the automatic cutoff of debate and the opportunity to get appeals dismissed on motion. Realistically, however, the outlook is not entirely bleak. While open-ended, the general reservation that we envision will be applied sparingly and without undue generosity. Motions to dismiss will still be entertained and, by appealing after promising not to do so, defendants will risk giving the government an option to disclaim a plea agreement, if it wishes to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that this approach represents a break with precedent. Although several of our sister circuits have made clear, in approving presentence waivers, that there will be only narrowly circumscribed exceptions, e.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 911; Brown, 232 F.3d at 403; Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872, we do not feel comfortable adopting any rigid taxonomy without more experience. Relief from waivers has traditionally occurred on a fact-specific basis. We believe that the general reservation which we adopt today is sufficiently broad to capture any truly deserving case but demanding enough to prevent defendants who have agreed to waive their right to appeal from successfully pursuing garden-variety claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Waiver in the Instant Case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having constructed a framework for determining when waivers of appellate rights will be enforced, we ponder the waiver in this case. The following language appears in paragraph five of the plea agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendant is aware that 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3742(a) affords a defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed. Knowing that, in exchange for the Government's concessions made herein, the Defendant waives to the full extent of the law any right to appeal . . . the conviction and sentence, or the manner in which it was determined . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This explicit text is followed by a statement acknowledging the appellant's voluntary acceptance of the entire plea agreement and confirming that she has read and understood it. The appellant and her attorney signed the document immediately beneath this acknowledgment. These desiderata furnish prima facie evidence of the appellant's knowledge and volition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What occurred next is somewhat more problematic. During the change-of-plea colloquy, the district court questioned the appellant concerning her overall understanding of, and acquiescence in, the terms of the plea agreement, but did not direct her attention to the waiver provision. As we have said, the validity of a waiver of appellate rights depends on whether the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily undertaken. Here, the court - hampered, no doubt, by the newness of Rule 11(c)(6) and the consequent lack of any precedential guidance -neither directed the appellant's attention to the waiver provision nor discussed it with her. Compounding that problem, the court, near the end of the Rule 11 colloquy, asked the appellant: \"[D]o you also understand that both you and the government will have a right to appeal any sentence I impose?\" This unqualified query - to which the prosecutor (not the same person who appears as counsel for the government in this court) inexplicably failed to take exception - drew an affirmative response from the appellant. The premise of this question directly contradicted the tenor of the waiver provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the court's failure to make inquiry into the waiver, its unfortunate contradiction of the waiver's terms, and the lack of any correction, then or thereafter,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> we cannot say with the requisite assurance that the appellant's surrender of her appellate rights was sufficiently informed. Accordingly, we find that the district court transgressed Rule 11(c)(6). The government has not argued that this error was other than prejudicial. We think that the proper remedy, given the circumstances, is to sever the waiver of appellate rights from the remainder of the plea agreement, allowing the other provisions to remain in force. See Bushert, 997 F.2d at 1353-54. Thus, we permit Teeter's appeal to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant raises three substantive issues on appeal. First, she argues that the lower court abused its discretion in accepting the stipulated cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline. Second, she asks us to reverse the court's decision not to depart downward. Finally, she complains that the court committed clear error when evaluating her role in the offenses of conviction. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Cross-Reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When sentences are imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines, the process encompasses certain mechanical aspects. First, the district court must determine the section of the guidelines that applies to the offense(s) of conviction. The court then must look to that guideline section to determine the BOL. This is not as simple as it sounds because some guideline provisions are not self-contained; they require (or, at least, suggest) cross-referencing to other guideline sections to help determine the BOL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the sentencing court determined that the appellant's conduct fell, in pertinent part, within the purview of USSG &#167;&#167;2A6.2 (\"Stalking or Domestic Violence\"). This determination was fully consistent with the plea agreement, and the appellant does not contest it. Moving forward, the court noted that section 2A6.2(c) contains a cross-reference provision which reads as follows: \"If the offense involved conduct covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that offense guideline, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\" The court found that the pertinent offenses of conviction fell within the scope of this language and cross-referenced to the first-degree murder guideline (USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1). Because that guideline yielded a higher BOL (43), the court applied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant concedes that, in the plea agreement, she stipulated both to this very cross-reference and to the resultant BOL (43). She nonetheless asseverates that the sentencing court erred in embracing this stipulation. Here, however, the appellant stipulated to the facts underlying the cross-reference, and those facts render the sentencing court's use of the cross-reference plausible. No more is exigible to warrant rejection of the appellant's asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have analogized plea agreements to contracts, binding upon the prosecution and the defense alike. E.g., United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir. 2000). We have been scrupulous in holding the government to the due performance of its obligations thereunder, e.g., United States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1995), and defendants cannot expect to be treated less fastidiously. Consequently, defendants ordinarily should be held to plea-agreement terms that they knowingly and voluntarily accept. See United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 185-86 (1st Cir. 1999). But there are caveats. Stipulations about legal issues, for example, are problematic. There is language in a number of cases indicating (correctly, we think) that such stipulations normally are not binding on a court. E.g., Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U.S. 39, 51 (1939); Weston v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 78 F.3d 682, 685 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Gunn v. United States, 283 F.2d 358, 364 (8th Cir. 1960). Even when stipulations concern facts rather than law, courts traditionally retain the power to relieve parties from them on terms that are just. E.g., TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, except where the parties have entered into a binding plea agreement under the aegis of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C), the stipulations contained in the agreement, even if factual in nature, do not tie the district court's hands. See United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 4-8 (1st Cir. 2000); Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 149 n.2. That the court has the power to deviate from such stipulations, however, does not obligate the court to do so. Should the court decide to accept and act upon factual stipulations for sentencing purposes, the parties usually will be firmly bound.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> This general rule will apply when, for example, a defendant stipulates to a matter of fact or to the applicability of a sentencing guideline (the legal meaning of which is pellucid) to the unique facts of her case. After all, the defendant knows what she has done, and has little cause for complaint if the district court takes her at her word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is much more difficult to justify binding effect for a stipulation that purports to resolve a general issue of law (or one that turns out to do so without acknowledgment). To cite an extreme example, it is difficult to see why a district court that misreads the effective date of a statute bearing on a sentencing determination should automatically be insulated from appellate review because the parties stipulated to the (wrong) effective date. That leaves stipulations as to mixed questions of fact and law. As to such stipulations, generalizations are risky business. The answer, in a particular case, may depend on the extent to which the mixed question is fact-dominated, cf. In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993), or the extent to which the known facts (whether found by the court or stipulated by the parties) make a given answer to the mixed question plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves a combination of these principles. The appellant stipulated to the BOL - 43 - and to the propriety of using the cross-reference to USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1 found in USSG &#167;&#167;2A6.2 to reach that BOL. To that extent, her challenge to the stipulation is based in law, and thus arguably subject to plenary review. But there is more: in the course of the proceedings below, the appellant pled guilty to counts five, six, seven, and ten (among others). These counts charged her with aiding and abetting interstate domestic violence, interstate stalking, and interstate violation of a protection order. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 2, 2261(a)(1)-(2), 2261A, 2262(a)(1). She admitted to certain facts through her plea agreement, the change-of-plea colloquy, and at sentencing. Those factual admissions are not now open to challenge -and they suffice to justify the sentencing court's use of the stipulated cross-reference. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable sentencing guideline in this case is USSG &#167;&#167;2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence). As said, this section contains a cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline, USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1. This cross-reference arises by virtue of USSG &#167;&#167;1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Relevant Conduct), which pertinently provides that a defendant's BOL shall be determined \"in the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity [on the basis of] all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.\" In the district court, the appellant admitted to crossing state lines to commit illegal acts against Deborah Brown, a stipulation of fact unchallenged on appeal. Additionally, she admitted to seeing and hearing Brown's vicious attack on Wood, yet nonetheless luring the next victim, Brouillard, into a place of maximum danger. Given these conceded facts, the murder of the second victim, at the very least, was \"a reasonably foreseeable act\" in furtherance of the offenses of conviction. Consequently, the district court had a plausible factual basis for cross-referencing to the first-degree murder guideline (as agreed by the parties) and employing a BOL of 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this point, we find United States v. Robinson, 14 F.3d 1200 (7th Cir. 1994), instructive. There, the defendant entered into a plea agreement in which he admitted to distributing specific quantities of drugs. The district court sentenced him in line with the stipulation. The defendant nonetheless appealed, claiming that the court erred by failing to make an independent drug-quantity determination. Id. at 1206. The Seventh Circuit quickly shut down this appeal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson pled guilty, and was sentenced based on what he admitted in the plea agreement, at the guideline level agreed upon in the plea agreement. . . . Robinson got what he bargained for, he waived any right to challenge the contents of the plea agreement when he signed it, and he has no basis to challenge it now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. The same can be said for Teeter. Having admitted the underlying facts that supported the sentencing court's resort to the stipulated cross-reference, she is unable to challenge that decision on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Downward Departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position is that, even if the district court appropriately cross-referenced USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1, it nonetheless erred in failing to depart downward. This argument stems from the fact that the heartland of the first-degree murder guideline involves those who knowingly and intentionally participate in an act of homicide. If, however, \"the defendant did not cause the [victim's] death intentionally or knowingly,\" the Sentencing Commission has raised the possibility that \"a downward departure may be warranted.\" USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1, comment. (n.1). Such a departure was advisable here, the appellant suggests, because she neither knowingly nor intentionally caused the deaths of Wood and Brouillard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument. For the most part, departure decisions are discretionary, and a defendant cannot appeal from the sentencing court's refusal to grant a downward departure. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 148; United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994). Although there is a narrow window of opportunity for cases in which the district court misapprehends its authority to depart, Pierro, 32 F.3d at 619; United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 1992), this case falls within the general rule, not the long-odds exception to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the appellant's efforts at creative characterization, this assignment of error involves a discretionary departure decision, pure and simple. Application Note 1 specifically refers to the possibility of a \"downward departure\" and leaves that possibility squarely in the hands of the sentencing court. Hence, we lack jurisdiction to review the court's refusal to invoke Application Note 1 unless there is some reason to believe that the court misunderstood its options. United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 674 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is absolutely no basis for any such belief here: the appellant points to nothing that would indicate that the court mistook its authority to depart, and the record makes manifest that Judge Carter knew he had the power to depart but deliberately chose not to do so. Indeed, the judge stated, not once but twice, that he was rejecting the appellant's request for a downward departure based on the facts of record. Under these circumstances, we are foreclosed from second-guessing the court's discretionary decision not to depart from the GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Role-in-the-Offense Adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final arrow in the appellant's quiver also misses the mark. She asserts that the district court incorrectly failed to reduce her offense level given her unimportant role in the crime spree. Absent a mistake of law - and we discern none here - we review such factbound status determinations for clear error. United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant says that the lower court should have classified her as a \"minimal\" or \"minor\" participant, and decreased her offense level accordingly. A defendant who seeks a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment must prove her entitlement to it. See id. To qualify as a minimal participant and obtain the concomitant four-level reduction, the appellant would have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was, at most, a peripheral player in the criminal activity. See, e.g., USSG &#167;&#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.2) (giving, as an example of a minimal participant, \"someone who played no other role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to offload part of a single marihuana shipment\"). To qualify as a minor participant and obtain the concomitant two-level reduction, the appellant would have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was \"less culpable than most other participants.\" Id., comment. (n.3). This means that she must be not only less culpable than her cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor, but also less culpable than the majority of those within the universe of persons participating in similar crimes. See United States v. Murphy, 193 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the allocation of the burden of proof, a defendant who seeks a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment usually faces an uphill climb in the nisi prius court. The deferential standard of review compounds the difficulty, so that a defendant who fails to persuade at that level faces a much steeper slope on appeal. \"We have declared, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that . . . battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below determined that the appellant was considerably more than a bit player in the unfolding tragedy. This determination is amply rooted in the record. The appellant facilitated Brown's travel plans; went with him to Maine; helped him track down his prey; lured the first victim (Wood) from the trailer to a locus where Brown could more easily get to him, knowing that Brown had incapacitation in mind; put the second victim (Brouillard) in harm's way after seeing Brown brutally attack Wood; aided Brown in abducting and holding hostage his estranged wife; maintained her allegiance even after receiving irrefutable proof of the murders; and attempted to warn Brown when the police arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the facts can be marshaled in such a way as to put the appellant in a somewhat more sympathetic light. The appellant's able counsel strives valiantly to transform the case in this fashion: he claims that the appellant agreed only to spend a romantic weekend holiday with her boyfriend in Maine, and that what happened thereafter was largely beyond her control. This spin does not carry the day, however, because the sentencing court was fully entitled to draw a different, more sinister, set of inferences from the largely undisputed facts. See United States v. Santiago-Gonzalez, 66 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 1995); Garcia, 954 F.2d at 18. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's eschewal of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment. See United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although we afford the appellant a full right of appeal notwithstanding the waiver of appellate rights contained in her plea agreement, we reject each and all of her claims of error. Her conviction and sentence must, therefore, be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have alluded to this issue in earlier cases, e.g., United States v. Ramirez, 252 F.3d 516, 518 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Hines, 196 F.3d 270, 272 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Springer, 28 F.3d 236, 237 (1st Cir. 1994), but we have yet to resolve it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In line with this aspect of the agreement, the appellant eventually pled guilty in a Maine state court to two counts of felony murder and one count of kidnapping. She received a twenty-year incarcerative sentence, to be served concurrently with the sentence previously imposed by the federal district court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note at the outset that the sort of waiver we are discussing differs from the waiver disapproved in Worcester v. Commissioner, 370 F.2d 713 (1st Cir. 1966). There, the Commissioner sought to estop the taxpayer by reference to a related criminal case. We rejected that effort, finding the criminal proceeding to have been tainted because the court had pressured the taxpayer-defendant into waiving his right to appeal in exchange for a lighter sentence. Id. at 718 (explaining that \"[t]he court was without right to bargain thus with the defendant, or to put a price on an appeal\"). We expressed concern that, if we permitted this sort of plea bargaining, a sentencing court might abuse its power in order to avoid appellate review, and the defendant, in an unequal bargaining position, would have little choice but to go along. Id. When, as now, the agreement is between the prosecution and the defense (and, thus, subject to the independent supervision of the trial court), the Worcester rationale is inapposite.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Less obvious, perhaps, is the protection against bait-and-switch tactics on the part of a defendant who makes concessions to the government and then seeks to keep what she got and withdraw what she gave. In the last analysis, it is up to the courts to keep this balance steady and true.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Finality is an especially important consideration in society's attempt to administer a zetetick criminal justice system. Its virtues have been extolled elsewhere, e.g., Daniels v. United States, 121 S. Ct. 1578, 1582 (2001); Lackawanna County Dist. Atty. v. Cross, 121 S. Ct. 1567, 1573-74 (2001), and it would be pleonastic to rehearse them here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although the courts of appeals have been consentient, we note that individual judges have demurred. E.g., United States v. Melancon, 972 F.2d 566, 570-80 (5th Cir. 1992) (Parker, J., concurring); United States v. Perez, 46 F. Supp. 2d 59, 64-72 (D. Mass. 1999); United States v. Johnson, 992 F. Supp. 437, 438-40 (D.D.C. 1997); United States v. Raynor, 989 F. Supp. 43, 43-49 (D.D.C. 1997). Some commentators also have argued against the validity of presentence waivers of appellate rights. E.g., Jack W. Campbell IV &amp; Gregory A. Castanias, Sentencing-Appeal Waivers: Recent Decisions Open the Door to Reinvigorated Challenges, The Champion, May 2000, at 34.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We refrain from prescribing any mandatory language for such an inquiry because the circumstances will vary from case to case, from defendant to defendant, and from plea agreement to plea agreement.

McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Boudin, Chief Judge, Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Selya, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this sentencing appeal, we address for the first time two important questions. The principal question concerns the validity of an advance waiver of appellate rights contained in a plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although we conclude that such waivers are not forbidden, we refuse to give effect to the waiver in this case because the record offers no sufficient assurance that it was tendered knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite winning this battle, the appellant ultimately loses the war. Entertaining her appeal, we reach the second main question -one that involves the effect to be given to a stipulation, contained in a plea agreement, as to how a specific sentencing issue should be resolved. On the facts of this case, we hold that the district court did not commit reversible error in accepting and acting upon a stipulated cross-reference within the sentencing guidelines and, concomitantly, employing the stipulated base offense level (BOL) produced by the use of that cross-reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also raises other, more pedestrian issues. As to those issues, we hold that the district court's refusal to depart downward from the guideline sentencing range (GSR) did not constitute an appealable event; and that the court's assessment of the appellant's role in the offense was not clearly erroneous. Consequently, we affirm the substantial prison sentence imposed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Patricia A. Teeter is a forty-something-year-old woman whose story, insofar as relevant here, reflects misplaced affection, terrible judgment, and the gruesome depths of man's inhumanity to man. We recount the tale at some length.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's troubles began when she forged a close friendship with Steven Brown despite warnings from friends that Brown had a propensity for violence. On March 22, 1999, a matrimonial court found that Brown had physically abused his estranged wife, Deborah, and the couple's minor children. The court dealt Brown a series of heavy blows: it awarded custody to Deborah, sanctioned her departure from New York, and ordered Brown to refrain from any contact either with her or the children. Brown told the appellant of the court's decree, leaving no doubt about his perturbation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, Brown asked the appellant to accompany him on a \"vacation\" trip to Maine (during which he would retrieve his dog from Deborah). Although the appellant knew that Brown had threatened violence against Deborah if he lost custody of his offspring, she nonetheless agreed to the excursion. She then watched Brown pack her car with a small arsenal, including an SKS assault rifle, a .20 gauge shotgun, ammunition for the weapons, and a pair of knives. Brown also stowed duct tape, rope, and two hand-held radios aboard the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"vacationers\" departed from New York early the next morning. Once in New Hampshire, they temporarily abandoned the appellant's car, rented another vehicle, and proceeded to Lebanon, Maine. They eventually located the trailer occupied by Deborah, her children, her brother, her father, and her new swain. The new arrivals spent the afternoon and evening spying on the group while Brown formulated a plan for Deborah's abduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That night, Brown instructed the appellant to approach the trailer and attempt to lure one of the male occupants outside by claiming (falsely) that she was having car trouble. Brown told the appellant that if she succeeded, he would then incapacitate the good Samaritan. Following Brown's script, the appellant inveigled Deborah's brother, Donald Wood, Jr., to come outside. Brown hit him over the head with a piece of lead pipe as he approached the rental car. The blow made an \"eerie\" sound that the appellant later said she would never forget. Brown then dragged Wood into the woods - out of the appellant's sight - and stabbed him twice. As matters turned out, this last bit of mayhem was totally unnecessary, inasmuch as an autopsy later revealed that the blow to the head was fatal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Brown's request, the appellant returned to the trailer and, telling the same apocryphal tale, convinced Deborah's consort, Chris Brouillard, to inspect the car. When Brouillard approached, Brown forced him to the ground, questioned him about his relationship with Deborah, struck him with the pipe, dragged him into the copse, and stabbed him three times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not content with two murders, Brown instructed the appellant to fetch yet another victim from the trailer. Although the appellant attempted to comply, the third try did not go according to the script. Deborah - her suspicions aroused by the previous activity - insisted that she drive her own truck to the spot where the appellant's vehicle ostensibly had been stranded. As Deborah neared the rental car, she spied Brown lurking in the woods and drove away at high speed. After a short interval, she returned to the trailer. When she pulled into the driveway, Brown forced her into the rental car at gunpoint and drove to New Hampshire (with the appellant as an added passenger). The rental car was returned only after the appellant had wiped it down to obliterate her fingerprints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trio proceeded in the appellant's automobile to a motel in East Greenbush, New York. Acting on Brown's instructions, the appellant rented two adjoining rooms (one for herself, one for her fellow travelers). To prevent Deborah from calling for help, Brown removed the telephone from his room and gave it to the appellant. During the day, the appellant washed Brown's bloodstained clothes and ran errands for him. While away from the motel, she called a friend who informed her that Wood and Brouillard were dead, and that the police had mounted a manhunt for Brown. The appellant made no attempt either to flee or to contact the authorities. When the police raided the motel the next morning, she vainly attempted to warn Brown by giving a prearranged signal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following her arrest, the appellant faced a plethora of federal and state charges. With respect to the federal charges, she eventually entered into a plea agreement and admitted her guilt as to one count of conspiracy, two counts anent the use of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, two counts of aiding and abetting interstate domestic violence, one count of aiding and abetting interstate stalking, and one count of aiding and abetting the interstate violation of a protection order. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 2, 371, 924(b)-(c), 2261(a), 2261A, 2262(a)-(1). The appellant also agreed not to contest certain of the state charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In return, the United States agreed to dismiss three other counts, including one for kidnapping. The parties stipulated, for federal sentencing purposes, to a BOL of 43 (a figure derived by cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline, USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1). Finally, the appellant waived her right to appeal any sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court convened a change-of-plea hearing on January 19, 2000. At that session, the court queried the appellant as to her overall understanding of the plea agreement, confirmed that no unexpressed promises had been made to her, and determined that she was changing her plea voluntarily. However, the court neglected to mention the waiver of appellate rights contained in the plea agreement. Instead, it told the appellant, without qualification and without any demurrer from the prosecutor, that she would have a right to appeal any sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing (which stretched over several days), the appellant asseverated that notwithstanding the terms of her plea agreement, the district court should renounce the suggested cross-reference and recalculate her BOL. As a fallback, she argued that even if the cross-reference endured, she was entitled to a downward departure because she had never intended that Wood or Brouillard perish. Lastly, she sought a role-in-the-offense adjustment on the ground that she was a minimal (or, at most, minor) participant in the criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court rejected each and all of these importunings. The court cross-referenced to the first-degree murder guideline to reach a BOL of 43, reduced the offense level to 40 because the appellant had both accepted responsibility for her actions and cooperated with the authorities, see USSG &#167;&#167;3E1.1, and used that figure in calculating her GSR (eschewing any role-in-the-offense discount). Given the absence of any significant criminal history, these computations yielded a GSR of 292-365 months. The court sentenced the appellant at the bottom of that range but added a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months on the firearm counts. The court then advised the appellant, without tailoring its comments to the contours of the plea-agreement waiver of appeal, \"that you have a right to appeal this sentence if you wish to do so.\" The prosecutor did not attempt to correct this apparent misstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This timely appeal ensued. In it, the appellant seeks to revisit the issues that she unsuccessfully advanced at the disposition hearing. Before discussing that proffer, however, we first must confront the government's contention that this appeal cannot go forward because Teeter should be held to the terms of the waiver embedded in her plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. PRESENTENCE WAIVERS OF APPELLATE RIGHTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide this portion of our opinion into three segments. First, we discuss the validity in general of presentence waivers of appellate rights. Next, we explore the specific criteria and conditions that must be met in order for such waivers to be effective, as well as the general power of appellate courts to override such waivers in the interests of justice. Finally, we assay the waiver at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Presentence Waivers of Appellate Rights: An Overview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic argument against presentence waivers of appellate rights is that such waivers are anticipatory: at the time the defendant signs the plea agreement, she does not have a clue as to the nature and magnitude of the sentencing errors that may be visited upon her. Her waiver typically embraces all determinations later made by the sentencing court - some of which may never have occurred either to her or to the government, and some of which may be quite different than either thought possible. In a certain sense, then - though not in the usual criminal law sense - a waiver of the right to appeal cannot be \"knowing.\" In the appellant's view, this is a fundamental defect - and one that distinguishes presentence waivers of appellate rights from other waivers contained in a plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not unsympathetic to this argument. Withal, three reasons counsel persuasively in favor of a rule that accords general validity to presentence waivers of appellate rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> First, waivers are not inherently suspect in criminal cases any more than in civil cases. Criminal defendants typically may waive their rights, as long as they do so voluntarily and with knowledge of the general nature and consequences of the waiver. See Adams v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></span>, 275 (1942) (discussing waiver of right to jury trial); Johnson v. Zerbst, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 464-67 (1938) (discussing waiver of right to counsel). Indeed, guilty pleas are a staple of our criminal justice system - and a guilty plea inevitably entails a waiver of numerous rights. Although many of these waivers pertain to future events - a waiver of the right to trial by jury is a good example - their prospective nature has never been thought to place them off limits or to render the defendant's act \"unknowing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the idea of permitting presentence waivers of appellate rights seems relatively tame because the right to appeal in a criminal case is not of constitutional magnitude. See Jones v. Barnes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111012\"><a href=\"/opinion/111012/jones-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, 751 (1983). Since the Supreme Court repeatedly has ruled that a defendant may waive constitutional rights as part of a plea agreement, e.g., Town of Newton v. Rumery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111837\"><a href=\"/opinion/111837/newton-v-rumery/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 393 (1987); Brady v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108137\"><a href=\"/opinion/108137/brady-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 752-53 (1970), it follows logically that a defendant ought to be able to waive rights that are purely creatures of statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Criminal Rules themselves lend support to this conclusion. Effective December 1, 1999, the Supreme Court, with the approval of Congress, amended the Criminal Rules to provide specifically that, during a change-of-plea hearing, the presiding judge \"must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands . . . the terms of any provision in a plea agreement waiving the right to appeal.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(6). While the advisory committee, in its explanatory note, made clear that it took \"no position on the underlying validity of such waivers,\" it recognized that they had become an accepted part of federal plea-agreement practice. See id., advisory committee notes. This widespread acceptance of the practice is itself a clear indication that those who deal most frequently with criminal cases have come to conclude that presentence waivers of appellate rights are not forbidden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considerations of public policy furnish a second pillar on which to rest a holding that breathes vitality into presentence waivers of appellate rights. Since criminal defendants are entitled to appeal convictions and sentences as a matter of statutory right, see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3742; 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1291, a defendant is unlikely to waive this right unless she believes that some feature of a proffered plea agreement makes it worth her while to do so. Allowing a criminal defendant to agree to a waiver of appeal gives her an additional bargaining chip in negotiations with the prosecution; she may, for example, be able to exchange this waiver for the government's assent to the dismissal of other charges. This benefit is very real; in some cases the government, without such a waiver, might not be willing to plea-bargain at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The benefit to the prosecution - conservation of resources -is obvious.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In the same vein, presentence waivers of appellate rights also husband judicial resources by discouraging groundless sentencing appeals. With court-appointed counsel freely available and nothing to lose by trying, a defendant, unfettered by a waiver agreement, is quite likely to appeal on a wing and a prayer. Reducing the number of baseless appeals promotes both efficiency and finality in the adjudication of criminal cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These policy considerations properly factor into our assessment of presentence waivers of appellate rights. Cf. New York v. Hill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118324\"><a href=\"/opinion/118324/new-york-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 117 (2000) (\"We allow waiver of numerous constitutional protections for criminal defendants that also serve broader social interests.\"). They indicate that the government, the defendant, and the judicial system all have something to gain from presentence waivers of appellate rights. This makes the device attractive: broadly speaking, plea agreements are in the best interests of the parties and the criminal justice system, United States v. Penta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538476\"><a href=\"/opinion/538476/united-states-v-richard-m-penta/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, 817 (1st Cir. 1990); Correale v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"311567\"><a href=\"/opinion/311567/anthony-correale-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 947 (1st Cir. 1973), and the more options that both sides have, the more likely it is that they will reach an accord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third reason supporting a rule that accords validity to presentence waivers of appellate rights is the sheer weight of authority. On a close question, where no obviously right or wrong answer exists, courts of appeals should strive to avoid creating needless conflicts. In this instance, presentence waivers of appellate rights have been accepted by all nine of the circuit courts which have passed upon their validity. See United States v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772330\"><a href=\"/opinion/772330/united-states-v-danilo-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 113 (2d Cir. 2001); United States v.

While these courts set varying boundaries, they all agree that, under ordinary circumstances, a knowing, voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence, contained in a plea agreement, ought to be enforced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Absent some convincing countervailing argument - and we are aware of none - we are reluctant to brush aside this collective wisdom. Thus, this unanimity strongly suggests that such waivers, if appropriately drafted, asserted to, and explained, should be honored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily. Given the general availability of waivers in criminal cases, the public policy gains to be reaped by allowing plea-agreement waivers of appellate rights, and the impressive body of precedent sanctioning such waivers, we hold that presentence waivers of appellate rights are valid in theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Criteria and Conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lend our imprimatur to such waivers indiscriminately. There are obvious dangers attendant to the practice. Sentences ultimately are imposed by the district courts, which must make sentencing determinations under controlling law. When a district court errs in sentencing, that error may be manifest on the record. Thus, in addition to concerns about fairness to the defendant, an institutional interest - public confidence in the judicial system - may be adversely affected if such errors go uncorrected. To ameliorate these risks, we deem it appropriate that such waivers meet stringent criteria. Even then, we think that limits must be set on the effect that can be given to them. It is to those criteria and conditions that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The baseline for any waiver of rights is that the defendant enter into it knowingly and voluntarily. Rumery, 480 U.S. at 394. In the plea-bargain context, the text of the plea agreement and the content of the change-of-plea colloquy are critically important to a determination of knowledge and volition. See, e.g., United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 373 (1st Cir. 1994) (examining both the text of the plea agreement and the change-of-plea colloquy to determine whether a guilty plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily). Like other courts, e.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 916-18; Nguyen, 235 F.3d at 1182-83, we will consult those sources in determining the validity of a particular presentence waiver of appellate rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look first to confirm that the written plea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope. E.g., Fleming, 239 F.3d at 762; Brown, 232 F.3d at 401. Mindful that Rule 11(c)(6), quoted supra at 22, specifically recognizes the importance of the change-of-plea hearing to any waiver of appellate rights, we next will examine the transcript of that hearing. The focus of this inquiry is to ascertain whether the court's interrogation suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to presentence waivers of appellate rights, several courts had held, without reference to the neoteric provisions of Rule 11(c)(6), that the district judge must question the defendant specifically about her understanding of the waiver provision and adequately inform her of its ramifications. E.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 917-18; Brown, 232 F.3d at 401-02, 405-06. While some courts previously had held waivers of appellate rights to be valid despite the absence of specific questioning during the change-of-plea colloquy, e.g., Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 871-72; United States v. Wenger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698399\"><a href=\"/opinion/698399/united-states-v-dennis-l-wenger/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 282 (7th Cir. 1995), these decisions antedate the adoption of Rule 11(c)(6). That rule - which was in force when Teeter changed her plea - alters the decisional calculus. In explicating the rationale for adopting the rule, the advisory committee made it pellucid that such an inquiry, properly performed, offers considerable assurance of the defendant's knowledge and volition. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(6), advisory committee notes. Consequently, we hold that the district court must inquire specifically at the change-of-the-plea hearing into any waiver of appellate rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Neglecting this duty will constitute error and may serve to invalidate the waiver, depending upon what the record shows as to the defendants' knowledge (that is, whether the defendant, notwithstanding the absence of a particularized inquiry, understood the full significance of the waiver) and the existence vel non of prejudice. See United States v. Bushert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610859\"><a href=\"/opinion/610859/united-states-v-james-bushert/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1351-52 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, courts ought to strive for consistency. While not necessarily a fatal error, a court can compromise an otherwise adequate change-of-plea colloquy by sending contradictory messages to the defendant. One potential source of confusion looms when the trial court, acting pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(5),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> tells the defendant at sentencing about her right to appeal. If a presentence waiver of appellate rights is in place, the court should be especially careful in its choice of words, taking pains to explain to the defendant that her right to appeal is circumscribed by her pre-existing waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One court has held that a blanket assurance about the right of appeal, delivered when sentence is pronounced, cancels a pre-existing waiver of appellate rights. United States v. Buchanan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699270\"><a href=\"/opinion/699270/united-states-v-lawrence-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 917-18 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that the sentencing court's statement created \"a reasonable expectation\" on the defendant's part that he could appeal his sentence, notwithstanding the pre-existing waiver). Other courts have disagreed, e.g., United States v. Atterberry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754622\"><a href=\"/opinion/754622/united-states-v-james-v-atterberry/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1301 (10th Cir. 1998); Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872, and so do we. While broad assurances to a defendant who has waived her appellate rights (e.g., \"you have a right to appeal your sentence\") are to be avoided -they muddy the waters and tend to instill false hope - they do not effect a per se nullification of a plea-agreement waiver of appellate rights. Whether such assurances may constitute reversible error in particular cases, and if so when, are matters that may be left for another day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. We have endeavored to provide general guidance to the district courts and the bar concerning plea-agreement waivers of appellate rights. We caution, however, that because such waivers are made before any manifestation of sentencing error emerges, appellate courts must remain free to grant relief from them in egregious cases. When all is said and done, such waivers are meant to bring finality to proceedings conducted in the ordinary course, not to leave acquiescent defendants totally exposed to future vagaries (however harsh, unfair, or unforeseeable). Our basic premise, therefore, is that if denying a right of appeal would work a miscarriage of justice, the appellate court, in its sound discretion, may refuse to honor the waiver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As a subset of this premise, we think that the same flexibility ought to pertain when the district court plainly errs in sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that plea-agreement waivers of the right to appeal from imposed sentences are presumptively valid (if knowing and voluntary), but are subject to a general exception under which the court of appeals retains inherent power to relieve the defendant of the waiver, albeit on terms that are just to the government, where a miscarriage of justice occurs. In charting this course, we recognize that the term \"miscarriage of justice\" is more a concept than a constant. Nevertheless, some of the considerations come readily to mind: the clarity of the error, its gravity, its character (e.g., whether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing guideline, or a statutory maximum), the impact of the error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the error on the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result. Other considerations doubtless will suggest themselves in specific cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, too, that this general reservation will, at least at the outset, lessen what the government sees as the prime benefit of its bargain: the automatic cutoff of debate and the opportunity to get appeals dismissed on motion. Realistically, however, the outlook is not entirely bleak. While open-ended, the general reservation that we envision will be applied sparingly and without undue generosity. Motions to dismiss will still be entertained and, by appealing after promising not to do so, defendants will risk giving the government an option to disclaim a plea agreement, if it wishes to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that this approach represents a break with precedent. Although several of our sister circuits have made clear, in approving presentence waivers, that there will be only narrowly circumscribed exceptions, e.g., Jemison, 237 F.3d at 911; Brown, 232 F.3d at 403; Michelsen, 141 F.3d at 872, we do not feel comfortable adopting any rigid taxonomy without more experience. Relief from waivers has traditionally occurred on a fact-specific basis. We believe that the general reservation which we adopt today is sufficiently broad to capture any truly deserving case but demanding enough to prevent defendants who have agreed to waive their right to appeal from successfully pursuing garden-variety claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Waiver in the Instant Case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having constructed a framework for determining when waivers of appellate rights will be enforced, we ponder the waiver in this case. The following language appears in paragraph five of the plea agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendant is aware that 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3742(a) affords a defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed. Knowing that, in exchange for the Government's concessions made herein, the Defendant waives to the full extent of the law any right to appeal . . . the conviction and sentence, or the manner in which it was determined . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This explicit text is followed by a statement acknowledging the appellant's voluntary acceptance of the entire plea agreement and confirming that she has read and understood it. The appellant and her attorney signed the document immediately beneath this acknowledgment. These desiderata furnish prima facie evidence of the appellant's knowledge and volition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What occurred next is somewhat more problematic. During the change-of-plea colloquy, the district court questioned the appellant concerning her overall understanding of, and acquiescence in, the terms of the plea agreement, but did not direct her attention to the waiver provision. As we have said, the validity of a waiver of appellate rights depends on whether the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily undertaken. Here, the court - hampered, no doubt, by the newness of Rule 11(c)(6) and the consequent lack of any precedential guidance -neither directed the appellant's attention to the waiver provision nor discussed it with her. Compounding that problem, the court, near the end of the Rule 11 colloquy, asked the appellant: \"[D]o you also understand that both you and the government will have a right to appeal any sentence I impose?\" This unqualified query - to which the prosecutor (not the same person who appears as counsel for the government in this court) inexplicably failed to take exception - drew an affirmative response from the appellant. The premise of this question directly contradicted the tenor of the waiver provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the court's failure to make inquiry into the waiver, its unfortunate contradiction of the waiver's terms, and the lack of any correction, then or thereafter,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> we cannot say with the requisite assurance that the appellant's surrender of her appellate rights was sufficiently informed. Accordingly, we find that the district court transgressed Rule 11(c)(6). The government has not argued that this error was other than prejudicial. We think that the proper remedy, given the circumstances, is to sever the waiver of appellate rights from the remainder of the plea agreement, allowing the other provisions to remain in force. See Bushert, 997 F.2d at 1353-54. Thus, we permit Teeter's appeal to proceed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant raises three substantive issues on appeal. First, she argues that the lower court abused its discretion in accepting the stipulated cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline. Second, she asks us to reverse the court's decision not to depart downward. Finally, she complains that the court committed clear error when evaluating her role in the offenses of conviction. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Cross-Reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When sentences are imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines, the process encompasses certain mechanical aspects. First, the district court must determine the section of the guidelines that applies to the offense(s) of conviction. The court then must look to that guideline section to determine the BOL. This is not as simple as it sounds because some guideline provisions are not self-contained; they require (or, at least, suggest) cross-referencing to other guideline sections to help determine the BOL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the sentencing court determined that the appellant's conduct fell, in pertinent part, within the purview of USSG &#167;&#167;2A6.2 (\"Stalking or Domestic Violence\"). This determination was fully consistent with the plea agreement, and the appellant does not contest it. Moving forward, the court noted that section 2A6.2(c) contains a cross-reference provision which reads as follows: \"If the offense involved conduct covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that offense guideline, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.\" The court found that the pertinent offenses of conviction fell within the scope of this language and cross-referenced to the first-degree murder guideline (USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1). Because that guideline yielded a higher BOL (43), the court applied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant concedes that, in the plea agreement, she stipulated both to this very cross-reference and to the resultant BOL (43). She nonetheless asseverates that the sentencing court erred in embracing this stipulation. Here, however, the appellant stipulated to the facts underlying the cross-reference, and those facts render the sentencing court's use of the cross-reference plausible. No more is exigible to warrant rejection of the appellant's asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have analogized plea agreements to contracts, binding upon the prosecution and the defense alike. E.g., United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198902\"><a href=\"/opinion/198902/united-states-v-ortiz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 151 (1st Cir. 2000). We have been scrupulous in holding the government to the due performance of its obligations thereunder, e.g., United States v. Clark, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196078\"><a href=\"/opinion/196078/united-states-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1995), and defendants cannot expect to be treated less fastidiously. Consequently, defendants ordinarily should be held to plea-agreement terms that they knowingly and voluntarily accept. See United States v. Alegria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198656\"><a href=\"/opinion/198656/united-states-v-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 185-86 (1st Cir. 1999). But there are caveats. Stipulations about legal issues, for example, are problematic. There is language in a number of cases indicating (correctly, we think) that such stipulations normally are not binding on a court. E.g., Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103232\"><a href=\"/opinion/103232/estate-of-sanford-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 51 (1939); Weston v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714791\"><a href=\"/opinion/714791/victoria-marie-weston-and-marie-beatrice-weston-v-washington-metropolitan/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span>, 685 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Gunn v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"252117\"><a href=\"/opinion/252117/cc-gunn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 364 (8th Cir. 1960). Even when stipulations concern facts rather than law, courts traditionally retain the power to relieve parties from them on terms that are just. E.g., TI Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196479\"><a href=\"/opinion/196479/t-i-v-delbonis/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span>, 928 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, except where the parties have entered into a binding plea agreement under the aegis of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C), the stipulations contained in the agreement, even if factual in nature, do not tie the district court's hands. See United States v. Saxena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199110\"><a href=\"/opinion/199110/united-states-v-saxena/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-8 (1st Cir. 2000); Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 149 n.2. That the court has the power to deviate from such stipulations, however, does not obligate the court to do so. Should the court decide to accept and act upon factual stipulations for sentencing purposes, the parties usually will be firmly bound.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> This general rule will apply when, for example, a defendant stipulates to a matter of fact or to the applicability of a sentencing guideline (the legal meaning of which is pellucid) to the unique facts of her case. After all, the defendant knows what she has done, and has little cause for complaint if the district court takes her at her word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is much more difficult to justify binding effect for a stipulation that purports to resolve a general issue of law (or one that turns out to do so without acknowledgment). To cite an extreme example, it is difficult to see why a district court that misreads the effective date of a statute bearing on a sentencing determination should automatically be insulated from appellate review because the parties stipulated to the (wrong) effective date. That leaves stipulations as to mixed questions of fact and law. As to such stipulations, generalizations are risky business. The answer, in a particular case, may depend on the extent to which the mixed question is fact-dominated, cf. In re Extradition of Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993), or the extent to which the known facts (whether found by the court or stipulated by the parties) make a given answer to the mixed question plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves a combination of these principles. The appellant stipulated to the BOL - 43 - and to the propriety of using the cross-reference to USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1 found in USSG &#167;&#167;2A6.2 to reach that BOL. To that extent, her challenge to the stipulation is based in law, and thus arguably subject to plenary review. But there is more: in the course of the proceedings below, the appellant pled guilty to counts five, six, seven, and ten (among others). These counts charged her with aiding and abetting interstate domestic violence, interstate stalking, and interstate violation of a protection order. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 2, 2261(a)(1)-(2), 2261A, 2262(a)(1). She admitted to certain facts through her plea agreement, the change-of-plea colloquy, and at sentencing. Those factual admissions are not now open to challenge -and they suffice to justify the sentencing court's use of the stipulated cross-reference. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable sentencing guideline in this case is USSG &#167;&#167;2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence). As said, this section contains a cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline, USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1. This cross-reference arises by virtue of USSG &#167;&#167;1B1.3(a)(1)(B) (Relevant Conduct), which pertinently provides that a defendant's BOL shall be determined \"in the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity [on the basis of] all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.\" In the district court, the appellant admitted to crossing state lines to commit illegal acts against Deborah Brown, a stipulation of fact unchallenged on appeal. Additionally, she admitted to seeing and hearing Brown's vicious attack on Wood, yet nonetheless luring the next victim, Brouillard, into a place of maximum danger. Given these conceded facts, the murder of the second victim, at the very least, was \"a reasonably foreseeable act\" in furtherance of the offenses of conviction. Consequently, the district court had a plausible factual basis for cross-referencing to the first-degree murder guideline (as agreed by the parties) and employing a BOL of 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this point, we find United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661504\"><a href=\"/opinion/661504/united-states-v-ervin-j-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span> (7th Cir. 1994), instructive. There, the defendant entered into a plea agreement in which he admitted to distributing specific quantities of drugs. The district court sentenced him in line with the stipulation. The defendant nonetheless appealed, claiming that the court erred by failing to make an independent drug-quantity determination. Id. at 1206. The Seventh Circuit quickly shut down this appeal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson pled guilty, and was sentenced based on what he admitted in the plea agreement, at the guideline level agreed upon in the plea agreement. . . . Robinson got what he bargained for, he waived any right to challenge the contents of the plea agreement when he signed it, and he has no basis to challenge it now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. The same can be said for Teeter. Having admitted the underlying facts that supported the sentencing court's resort to the stipulated cross-reference, she is unable to challenge that decision on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Downward Departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position is that, even if the district court appropriately cross-referenced USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1, it nonetheless erred in failing to depart downward. This argument stems from the fact that the heartland of the first-degree murder guideline involves those who knowingly and intentionally participate in an act of homicide. If, however, \"the defendant did not cause the [victim's] death intentionally or knowingly,\" the Sentencing Commission has raised the possibility that \"a downward departure may be warranted.\" USSG &#167;&#167;2A1.1, comment. (n.1). Such a departure was advisable here, the appellant suggests, because she neither knowingly nor intentionally caused the deaths of Wood and Brouillard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument. For the most part, departure decisions are discretionary, and a defendant cannot appeal from the sentencing court's refusal to grant a downward departure. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 148; United States v. Pierro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 619 (1st Cir. 1994). Although there is a narrow window of opportunity for cases in which the district court misapprehends its authority to depart, Pierro, 32 F.3d at 619; United States v. Amparo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581358\"><a href=\"/opinion/581358/united-states-v-luz-maria-amparo-aka-luz-maria-amparo-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir. 1992), this case falls within the general rule, not the long-odds exception to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the appellant's efforts at creative characterization, this assignment of error involves a discretionary departure decision, pure and simple. Application Note 1 specifically refers to the possibility of a \"downward departure\" and leaves that possibility squarely in the hands of the sentencing court. Hence, we lack jurisdiction to review the court's refusal to invoke Application Note 1 unless there is some reason to believe that the court misunderstood its options. United States v. Shea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768605\"><a href=\"/opinion/768605/united-states-v-anthony-m-shea-united-states-of-america-v-michael-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 674 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is absolutely no basis for any such belief here: the appellant points to nothing that would indicate that the court mistook its authority to depart, and the record makes manifest that Judge Carter knew he had the power to depart but deliberately chose not to do so. Indeed, the judge stated, not once but twice, that he was rejecting the appellant's request for a downward departure based on the facts of record. Under these circumstances, we are foreclosed from second-guessing the court's discretionary decision not to depart from the GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Role-in-the-Offense Adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final arrow in the appellant's quiver also misses the mark. She asserts that the district court incorrectly failed to reduce her offense level given her unimportant role in the crime spree. Absent a mistake of law - and we discern none here - we review such factbound status determinations for clear error. United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant says that the lower court should have classified her as a \"minimal\" or \"minor\" participant, and decreased her offense level accordingly. A defendant who seeks a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment must prove her entitlement to it. See id. To qualify as a minimal participant and obtain the concomitant four-level reduction, the appellant would have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was, at most, a peripheral player in the criminal activity. See, e.g., USSG &#167;&#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.2) (giving, as an example of a minimal participant, \"someone who played no other role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to offload part of a single marihuana shipment\"). To qualify as a minor participant and obtain the concomitant two-level reduction, the appellant would have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was \"less culpable than most other participants.\" Id., comment. (n.3). This means that she must be not only less culpable than her cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor, but also less culpable than the majority of those within the universe of persons participating in similar crimes. See United States v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198658\"><a href=\"/opinion/198658/united-states-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Ocasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the allocation of the burden of proof, a defendant who seeks a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment usually faces an uphill climb in the nisi prius court. The deferential standard of review compounds the difficulty, so that a defendant who fails to persuade at that level faces a much steeper slope on appeal. \"We have declared, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that . . . battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.\" United States v. Conley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198112\"><a href=\"/opinion/198112/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below determined that the appellant was considerably more than a bit player in the unfolding tragedy. This determination is amply rooted in the record. The appellant facilitated Brown's travel plans; went with him to Maine; helped him track down his prey; lured the first victim (Wood) from the trailer to a locus where Brown could more easily get to him, knowing that Brown had incapacitation in mind; put the second victim (Brouillard) in harm's way after seeing Brown brutally attack Wood; aided Brown in abducting and holding hostage his estranged wife; maintained her allegiance even after receiving irrefutable proof of the murders; and attempted to warn Brown when the police arrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the facts can be marshaled in such a way as to put the appellant in a somewhat more sympathetic light. The appellant's able counsel strives valiantly to transform the case in this fashion: he claims that the appellant agreed only to spend a romantic weekend holiday with her boyfriend in Maine, and that what happened thereafter was largely beyond her control. This spin does not carry the day, however, because the sentencing court was fully entitled to draw a different, more sinister, set of inferences from the largely undisputed facts. See United States v. Santiago-Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196311\"><a href=\"/opinion/196311/united-states-v-santiago-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 1995); Garcia, 954 F.2d at 18. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's eschewal of a downward role-in-the-offense adjustment. See United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although we afford the appellant a full right of appeal notwithstanding the waiver of appellate rights contained in her plea agreement, we reject each and all of her claims of error. Her conviction and sentence must, therefore, be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have alluded to this issue in earlier cases, e.g., United States v. Ramirez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199440\"><a href=\"/opinion/199440/united-states-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Hines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198707\"><a href=\"/opinion/198707/united-states-v-hines/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 272 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.

She received a twenty-year incarcerative sentence, to be served concurrently with the sentence previously imposed by the federal district court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note at the outset that the sort of waiver we are discussing differs from the waiver disapproved in Worcester v.

There, the Commissioner sought to estop the taxpayer by reference to a related criminal case. We rejected that effort, finding the criminal proceeding to have been tainted because the court had pressured the taxpayer-defendant into waiving his right to appeal in exchange for a lighter sentence. Id. at 718 (explaining that \"[t]he court was without right to bargain thus with the defendant, or to put a price on an appeal\"). We expressed concern that, if we permitted this sort of plea bargaining, a sentencing court might abuse its power in order to avoid appellate review, and the defendant, in an unequal bargaining position, would have little choice but to go along. Id. When, as now, the agreement is between the prosecution and the defense (and, thus, subject to the independent supervision of the trial court), the Worcester rationale is inapposite.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Less obvious, perhaps, is the protection against bait-and-switch tactics on the part of a defendant who makes concessions to the government and then seeks to keep what she got and withdraw what she gave. In the last analysis, it is up to the courts to keep this balance steady and true.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Finality is an especially important consideration in society's attempt to administer a zetetick criminal justice system. Its virtues have been extolled elsewhere, e.g., Daniels v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620704\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620704/daniels-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
