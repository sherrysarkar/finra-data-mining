The  kidnapping at  knife point\r                                       \r\n\nof a young New  Hampshire woman by defendant Craig  Clark and\r\n\nothers resulted  in Clark  ultimately pleading guilty  to two\r\n\nfederal  charges:     conspiracy   to   interfere  with   and\r\n\ninterference with interstate commerce by threats of violence,\r\n\nboth  in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1951.   This  is Clark's\r\n\nsecond trip to this court on his sentence.  He was successful\r\n\nbefore,  and now finds, to his chagrin, that his new sentence\r\n\nis  higher  than the  one that  was  overturned in  his first\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n      In United States v.  Clark, 55 F.3d 9 (1st  Cir. 1995),\r                                            \r\n\nthis court  vacated Clark's  original 188 month  sentence and\r\n\nremanded for resentencing before a new judge on grounds  that\r\n\nthe  government had not kept  its end of  the plea agreement.\r\n\nClark  now appeals  from  the 223  month sentence  imposed on\r\n\nresentencing by the second sentencing judge after remand.\r\n\n      Relying  on  the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in  North\r                                                                         \r\n\nCarolina v.  Pearce, 395 U.S.  711 (1969), Clark  argues that\r                               \r\n\nthe  district   court's  imposition  of  a   prison  term  on\r\n\nresentencing that  was more severe than  the sentence vacated\r\n\non appeal  effectively punishes him for  exercising his right\r\n\nto  appeal and violates his right to  due process of law.  He\r\n\nalso contends that the district  court erred in enhancing his\r\n\nsentence  based on  a  determination that  he had  obstructed\r\n\njustice by  suborning perjury and making  false statements to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nhis probation officer.   The decisions  of the Supreme  Court\r\n\nand  this  court  interpreting  the holding  of  Pearce  doom\r                                                                   \r\n\nClark's  first attack.  His second attack is without merit on\r\n\nthe law and the facts.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n      In  Pearce,  the  Supreme  Court   held  that  a  court\r                            \r\n\nviolates the  Due Process  Clause when  it imposes  a heavier\r\n\nsentence  upon a  reconvicted  defendant for  the purpose  of\r\n\npenalizing the  defendant  for having  successfully  appealed\r\n\nfrom his  original conviction.   See  id. at  723-24.   As  a\r                                                     \r\n\nprophylactic measure, the  Court created  a \"'presumption  of\r\n\nvindictiveness'  . . . which is  triggered whenever  the same\r\n\njudge imposes a more  severe sentence upon a defendant  after\r\n\nretrial.\"  Johnson v. Vose,  927 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir.  1991)\r                                      \r\n\n(quoting United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 374 (1982)).\r                                             \r\n\nHowever, the  \"presumption of vindictiveness\" does  not arise\r\n\nin  every  case  in  which  a  defendant  receives  a greater\r\n\nsentence the  second time around.   Texas v.  McCullough, 475\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  134,  138 (1986).   As  the  Court said  in McCullough,\r                                                                        \r\n\n\"vindictiveness  of a sentencing judge  is the evil the Court\r\n\nsought to prevent rather than simply enlarged sentences after\r\n\na new trial.\"   Id.  Thus, the presumption  of vindictiveness\r                               \r\n\ncreated by Pearce  arises only when  \"there is a  'reasonable\r                             \r\n\nlikelihood'  . . .  that  the  increase in  sentence  is  the\r\n\nproduct  of   actual  vindictiveness  on  the   part  of  the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsentencing authority.\"  Alabama  v. Smith, 490 U.S.  794, 799\r                                                     \r\n\n(1989) (citation omitted).\r\n\n      The Pearce presumption does not arise where  \"different\r                                                 \r\n\nsentencers  assessed the  varying sentences  that [defendant]\r\n\nreceived.\"  McCullough, 475 U.S. at 140; see also Hurlburt v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCunningham,  996 F.2d  1273,  1275 n.2  (1st Cir.  1993) (per\r                      \r\n\ncuriam)  (\"Our  research  indicates  that  decisions  by  the\r\n\ncircuit  courts  of appeals  after McCullough  have uniformly\r                                                         \r\n\nheld that the Pearce  presumption does not apply to  the two-\r                                \r\n\nsentencer situation.\").  In this case, the defendant's second\r\n\nsentence  was  imposed  by  a  different  judge.    Thus,  no\r\n\npresumption  of  vindictiveness  arises.     Absent  such   a\r\n\npresumption, the defendant cannot  prevail on his due process\r\n\nclaim   unless   he  demonstrates   \"actual  vindictiveness.\"\r\n\nJohnson, 927 F.2d at 11.\r                   \r\n\n      Clark falls far  short.  He argues  that vindictiveness\r\n\nshould be inferred because the New Hampshire federal district\r\n\ncourt  has only four  judges and is  a small court.   Neither\r\n\nlogic nor  experience warrants any such  inference.  Further,\r\n\nhe says,  an increased  sentence may not  be imposed  without\r\n\nadditional findings to support  the increase.  Pearce implies\r                                                                 \r\n\nno such requirement.  The second trial judge heard all of the\r\n\nsentencing  evidence  anew  and  made  findings  adequate  to\r\n\nsupport  the sentence  imposed,  which was  within the  range\r\n\nprescribed  by  the Guidelines.    The length  of  a sentence\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nvacated on appeal does not automatically function as a cap on\r\n\nthe term of imprisonment that can be imposed on resentencing.\r\n\nOne of the risks of appealing  a sentence is that a different\r\n\njudge, on remand, may take a different view of the  facts (or\r\n\nthe law) relevant to the required Guidelines findings, a view\r\n\nless favorable to the defendant.  We note that Clark makes no\r\n\nargument  that the  second  sentencing  judge misapplied  the\r\n\nGuidelines (aside  from  his assertion  of  error as  to  the\r\n\nobstruction-of-justice enhancement, which  we reject  below).\r\n\nThere   is  no  basis  in   the  record  for   a  finding  of\r\n\nvindictiveness.    Cf.  McCullough,   475  U.S.  at  140  (no\r                                              \r\n\nvindictiveness  where \"second  sentencer provides  an on-the-\r\n\nrecord,   wholly  logical,   nonvindictive  reason   for  the\r\n\nsentence\").\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n      Under   3C1.1  of the Guidelines, the  sentencing judge\r\n\nis  directed to increase the  offense level by  two \"[i]f the\r\n\ndefendant willfully obstructed  or impeded,  or attempted  to\r\n\nobstruct or impede, the  administration of justice during the\r\n\ninvestigation,  prosecution, or  sentencing  of  the  instant\r\n\noffense.\"  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 (Nov. 1993).1   Clark argues that\r\n\nthe district court erroneously enhanced his sentence based on\r\n\nthis provision.  A brief description  of the facts underlying\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The district court apparently applied the 1993 version of\r\nthe Guidelines.  The current version of   3C1.1 is the same.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe district court's obstruction  of justice finding sets the\r\n\nstage for resolution of Clark's claim.\r\n\n      After his  arrest and prior  to his  arraignment, Clark\r\n\napparently  hatched the  thought that  if the  district court\r\n\ncould be persuaded that the  victim herself had been involved\r\n\nin  the scheme  to  kidnap  and  hold  her  for  ransom,  the\r\n\ndefendants  would either  receive more  lenient sentences  or\r\n\n\"all walk away scott [sic] free.\"  In order to make the story\r\n\n-- which  had no basis in  fact -- stick, he  had to convince\r\n\nhis  co-defendants  to  keep  to  the story  line  when  they\r\n\ntestified.   That is exactly what he tried to do while in the\r\n\nU.S.  Marshal's  lockup.    Clark's  co-defendants,  however,\r\n\nrefused  to  go  along  with  his  fabrication  and  told the\r\n\nprobation officer of Clark's efforts to induce them to lie to\r\n\nthe  court.  When the probation officer asked Clark about the\r\n\nscheme, he denied  it and claimed that his co-defendants must\r\n\nhave misunderstood him or were lying.   The probation officer\r\n\nincluded  this  information in  the  Pre-Sentence Report  and\r\n\nrecommended  that Clark's  conduct  be  found  to  constitute\r\n\nobstruction of justice and  that he be denied any  credit for\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility.\r\n\n      After hearing  testimony from Clark's two co-defendants\r\n\nthat Clark  had tried to induce them to lie to the court, the\r\n\ndistrict court increased Clark's offense level from 34  to 36\r\n\npursuant  to  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.   This  enhancement  had the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\neffect  of  increasing his  Guidelines sentencing  range from\r\n\n151-188  months to 188-235  months.  Clark  contends that the\r\n\ndistrict court committed three  errors: that the court should\r\n\nnot have applied  the preponderance-of-the-evidence  standard\r\n\nwith respect  to its  finding that Clark  obstructed justice;\r\n\nthat the court failed to view his testimony in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to him; and that (in light of the first two points)\r\n\nthe court's finding of obstruction was clearly erroneous.\r\n\n      On the first point,  Clark appears to argue that  if he\r\n\nhad  been  separately charged  with  the  crime of  suborning\r\n\nperjury  and been  convicted of  that crime  (as well  as the\r                                        \r\n\ncrimes  of which he was actually convicted) by proof beyond a\r\n\nreasonable doubt,  he would  have received a  lesser sentence\r\n\nthan  he received as a  result of the  obstruction of justice\r\n\nbeing considered at sentencing.  From this, he  contends that\r\n\ndue  process  required  the  government to  prove  the  facts\r\n\nunderlying the   3C1.1 enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\nThe  argument is  doubly flawed.   First, Clark's  premise is\r\n\npresented without any effort to elaborate its basis under the\r\n\nGuidelines and is far from obviously true.  Second, precedent\r\n\ndisposes of  his argument that anything  but a preponderance-\r\n\nof-the-evidence   standard   governs  the   district  court's\r\n\nfactfinding  at  sentencing.   See,  e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nLombard,  72 F.3d 170, 175-76 (1st  Cir. 1995); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nv.

Thatapplication note provides:\r\n\n      In  applying  [  3C1.1]  in  respect  to  alleged\r\n      false testimony or statements  by the  defendant,\r\n      such testimony or statements  should be evaluated\r\n      in a light most favorable to the defendant.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1, comment.  (n.1).   Clark argues  that this\r\n\ninstruction  required the  district court  to  credit Clark's\r\n\nversion of the  events (that his co-defendants  were lying or\r\n\nmisunderstood him) over the testimony of the co-defendants as\r\n\ndescribed in the PSR and given at the sentencing hearing.\r\n\n      But   the  application  note   cannot  mean,  as  Clark\r\n\napparently  would have  it, that  the court must  resolve all\r\n\nfactual or  testimonial disputes  in favor of  the defendant.\r\n\nNor does it  require the district court, in  deciding whether\r\n\nan obstruction  of justice occurred, to  accept a defendant's\r\n\nself-serving denials over the testimony of other witnesses it\r\n\nfinds more credible.   See  United States v.  Tracy, 36  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n199,  203-04 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.

This is Clark's second trip to this court on his sentence.   He was successful before, and now finds, to his chagrin, that his new sentence is higher than the one that was overturned in his first appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.1995), this court vacated Clark's original 188 month sentence and remanded for resentencing before a new judge on grounds that the government had not kept its end of the plea agreement.   Clark now appeals from the 223 month sentence imposed on resentencing by the second sentencing judge after remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), Clark argues that the district court's imposition of a prison term on resentencing that was more severe than the sentence vacated on appeal effectively punishes him for exercising his right to appeal and violates his right to due process of law.   He also contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on a determination that he had obstructed justice by suborning perjury and making false statements to his probation officer.   The decisions of the Supreme Court and this court interpreting the holding of Pearce doom Clark's first attack.   His second attack is without merit on the law and the facts.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* In Pearce, the Supreme Court held that a court violates the Due Process Clause when it imposes a heavier sentence upon a reconvicted defendant for the purpose of penalizing the defendant for having successfully appealed from his original conviction.   See id. at 723-24, 89 S.Ct. at 2079-80.   As a prophylactic measure, the Court created a \" 'presumption of vindictiveness' ... which is triggered whenever the same judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after retrial.\"  Johnson v. Vose, 927 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 374, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2489, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982)).   However, the \"presumption of vindictiveness\" does not arise in every case in which a defendant receives a greater sentence the second time around.  Texas v. McCullough, 475 U.S. 134, 138, 106 S.Ct. 976, 978-79, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986).   As the Court said in McCullough, \"vindictiveness of a sentencing judge is the evil the Court sought to prevent rather than simply enlarged sentences after a new trial.\"  Id.  Thus, the presumption of vindictiveness created by Pearce arises only when \"there is a 'reasonable likelihood' ... that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.\"  Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 799, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 2204, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pearce presumption does not arise where \"different sentencers assessed the varying sentences that [defendant] received.\"  McCullough, 475 U.S. at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 979;  see also Hurlburt v. Cunningham, 996 F.2d 1273, 1275 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (\"Our research indicates that decisions by the circuit courts of appeals after McCullough have uniformly held that the Pearce presumption does not apply to the two-sentencer situation.\").   In this case, the defendant's second sentence was imposed by a different judge.   Thus, no presumption of vindictiveness arises.   Absent such a presumption, the defendant cannot prevail on his due process claim unless he demonstrates \"actual vindictiveness.\"  Johnson, 927 F.2d at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clark falls far short.   He argues that vindictiveness should be inferred because the New Hampshire federal district court has only four judges and is a small court.   Neither logic nor experience warrants any such inference.   Further, he says, an increased sentence may not be imposed without additional findings to support the increase.  Pearce implies no such requirement.   The second trial judge heard all of the sentencing evidence anew and made findings adequate to support the sentence imposed, which was within the range prescribed by the Guidelines.   The length of a sentence vacated on appeal does not automatically function as a cap on the term of imprisonment that can be imposed on resentencing.   One of the risks of appealing a sentence is that a different judge, on remand, may take a different view of the facts (or the law) relevant to the required Guidelines findings, a view less favorable to the defendant.   We note that Clark makes no argument that the second sentencing judge misapplied the Guidelines (aside from his assertion of error as to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, which we reject below).   There is no basis in the record for a finding of vindictiveness.   Cf. McCullough, 475 U.S. at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 980 (no vindictiveness where \"second sentencer provides an on-the-record, wholly logical, nonvindictive reason for the sentence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 3C1.1 of the Guidelines, the sentencing judge is directed to increase the offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 (Nov.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Clark argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his sentence based on this provision.   A brief description of the facts underlying the district court's obstruction of justice finding sets the stage for resolution of Clark's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest and prior to his arraignment, Clark apparently hatched the thought that if the district court could be persuaded that the victim herself had been involved in the scheme to kidnap and hold her for ransom, the defendants would either receive more lenient sentences or \"all walk away scott [sic] free.\"   In order to make the story--which had no basis in fact--stick, he had to convince his co-defendants to keep to the story line when they testified.   That is exactly what he tried to do while in the U.S. Marshal's lockup.   Clark's co-defendants, however, refused to go along with his fabrication and told the probation officer of Clark's efforts to induce them to lie to the court.   When the probation officer asked Clark about the scheme, he denied it and claimed that his co-defendants must have misunderstood him or were lying.   The probation officer included this information in the Pre-Sentence Report and recommended that Clark's conduct be found to constitute obstruction of justice and that he be denied any credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing testimony from Clark's two co-defendants that Clark had tried to induce them to lie to the court, the district court increased Clark's offense level from 34 to 36 pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.   This enhancement had the effect of increasing his Guidelines sentencing range from 151-188 months to 188-235 months.   Clark contends that the district court committed three errors:  that the court should not have applied the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard with respect to its finding that Clark obstructed justice;  that the court failed to view his testimony in the light most favorable to him;  and that (in light of the first two points) the court's finding of obstruction was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first point, Clark appears to argue that if he had been separately charged with the crime of suborning perjury and been convicted of that crime (as well as the crimes of which he was actually convicted) by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, he would have received a lesser sentence than he received as a result of the obstruction of justice being considered at sentencing.   From this, he contends that due process required the government to prove the facts underlying the &#167; 3C1.1 enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt.   The argument is doubly flawed.   First, Clark's premise is presented without any effort to elaborate its basis under the Guidelines and is far from obviously true.   Second, precedent disposes of his argument that anything but a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard governs the district court's factfinding at sentencing.   See, e.g., United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170, 175-76 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 17 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clark's second argument rests on his reading of application note 1 to &#167; 3C1.1.   That application note provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In applying [&#167; 3C1.1] in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant, such testimony or statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.1).   Clark argues that this instruction required the district court to credit Clark's version of the events (that his co-defendants were lying or misunderstood him) over the testimony of the co-defendants as described in the PSR and given at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the application note cannot mean, as Clark apparently would have it, that the court must resolve all factual or testimonial disputes in favor of the defendant.   Nor does it require the district court, in deciding whether an obstruction of justice occurred, to accept a defendant's self-serving denials over the testimony of other witnesses it finds more credible.   See United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199, 203-04 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 609, 130 L.Ed.2d 518 (1994);  see also United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 228 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Were that so, the safeguard [of application note 1] would swallow the rule in a single gulp.\");  United States v. Franco-Torres, 869 F.2d 797, 801 (5th Cir.1989) (such a reading \"would effectively enable every defendant to nullify its application by self-serving testimony\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the plain language of the application note is not nearly so broad as to permit Clark's reading.   The note's instruction is specifically limited to the application of &#167; 3C1.1 \"in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant\" and provides that only \"such testimony or statements \" should receive the benefit of a defendant-favorable light.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.1) (emphases added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We understand this language to mean that if the defendant is alleged to have obstructed justice by means of false testimony or statements, and if such testimony or statements encompass genuine ambiguities that plausibly suggest that the testimony or statements were innocent as opposed to obstructive, then those ambiguities may have to be resolved in favor of the innocent reading.   See Tracy, 36 F.3d at 204 (quoting United States v. Crousore, 1 F.3d 382, 385 (6th Cir.1993)).   As this court has recently said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>[The] interpretive principle [contained in application note 1] only applies to the construction of allegedly perjurious language, not the determination of credibility of fact witnesses....

Kelley, 76 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Tracy, 36 F.3d at 204).   In sum, application note 1 requires at most that the district court indulge \"lenitive interpretations\" of the defendant's allegedly obstructive statements to the extent plausible, and only if those statements are ambiguous.   See Tracy, 36 F.3d at 204.   It does not require the district court to avoid a finding of obstruction by contriving doubt as to the defendant's conduct where the evidence is otherwise clear, merely because the defendant denies he did anything obstructive.   See id. at 203-04;  United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959, 969 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there were two aspects of Clark's conduct that the court found constituted obstruction of justice:  his attempts to induce his co-defendants to lie to the court, and his statements to the probation officer denying any such attempts.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(b) &amp; 3(h)).   We review the district court's factual findings underlying the &#167; 3C1.1 enhancement only for clear error.

He also contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on a determination that he had obstructed justice by suborning perjury and making false statements to his probation officer.   The decisions of the Supreme Court and this court interpreting the holding of Pearce doom Clark's first attack.   His second attack is without merit on the law and the facts.

See id. at 723-24, 89 S.Ct. at 2079-80.

However, the \"presumption of vindictiveness\" does not arise in every case in which a defendant receives a greater sentence the second time around.  Texas v. McCullough, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111602\"><a href=\"/opinion/111602/texas-v-mccullough/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 138, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111602\"><a href=\"/opinion/111602/texas-v-mccullough/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the Court said in McCullough, \"vindictiveness of a sentencing judge is the evil the Court sought to prevent rather than simply enlarged sentences after a new trial.\"  Id.  Thus, the presumption of vindictiveness created by Pearce arises only when \"there is a 'reasonable likelihood' ... that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.\"  Alabama v.

Cunningham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610546\"><a href=\"/opinion/610546/robert-c-hurlburt-v-michael-j-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></a></span>, 1275 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993) (per curiam) (\"Our research indicates that decisions by the circuit courts of appeals after McCullough have uniformly held that the Pearce presumption does not apply to the two-sentencer situation.\").   In this case, the defendant's second sentence was imposed by a different judge.   Thus, no presumption of vindictiveness arises.   Absent such a presumption, the defendant cannot prevail on his due process claim unless he demonstrates \"actual vindictiveness.\"  Johnson, 927 F.2d at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clark falls far short.   He argues that vindictiveness should be inferred because the New Hampshire federal district court has only four judges and is a small court.   Neither logic nor experience warrants any such inference.   Further, he says, an increased sentence may not be imposed without additional findings to support the increase.  Pearce implies no such requirement.   The second trial judge heard all of the sentencing evidence anew and made findings adequate to support the sentence imposed, which was within the range prescribed by the Guidelines.   The length of a sentence vacated on appeal does not automatically function as a cap on the term of imprisonment that can be imposed on resentencing.   One of the risks of appealing a sentence is that a different judge, on remand, may take a different view of the facts (or the law) relevant to the required Guidelines findings, a view less favorable to the defendant.   We note that Clark makes no argument that the second sentencing judge misapplied the Guidelines (aside from his assertion of error as to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, which we reject below).   There is no basis in the record for a finding of vindictiveness.   Cf. McCullough, 475 U.S. at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 980 (no vindictiveness where \"second sentencer provides an on-the-record, wholly logical, nonvindictive reason for the sentence\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 3C1.1 of the Guidelines, the sentencing judge is directed to increase the offense level by two \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 (Nov.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Clark argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his sentence based on this provision.   A brief description of the facts underlying the district court's obstruction of justice finding sets the stage for resolution of Clark's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest and prior to his arraignment, Clark apparently hatched the thought that if the district court could be persuaded that the victim herself had been involved in the scheme to kidnap and hold her for ransom, the defendants would either receive more lenient sentences or \"all walk away scott [sic] free.\"   In order to make the story--which had no basis in fact--stick, he had to convince his co-defendants to keep to the story line when they testified.   That is exactly what he tried to do while in the U.S. Marshal's lockup.   Clark's co-defendants, however, refused to go along with his fabrication and told the probation officer of Clark's efforts to induce them to lie to the court.   When the probation officer asked Clark about the scheme, he denied it and claimed that his co-defendants must have misunderstood him or were lying.   The probation officer included this information in the Pre-Sentence Report and recommended that Clark's conduct be found to constitute obstruction of justice and that he be denied any credit for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing testimony from Clark's two co-defendants that Clark had tried to induce them to lie to the court, the district court increased Clark's offense level from 34 to 36 pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.   This enhancement had the effect of increasing his Guidelines sentencing range from 151-188 months to 188-235 months.   Clark contends that the district court committed three errors:  that the court should not have applied the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard with respect to its finding that Clark obstructed justice;  that the court failed to view his testimony in the light most favorable to him;  and that (in light of the first two points) the court's finding of obstruction was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first point, Clark appears to argue that if he had been separately charged with the crime of suborning perjury and been convicted of that crime (as well as the crimes of which he was actually convicted) by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, he would have received a lesser sentence than he received as a result of the obstruction of justice being considered at sentencing.   From this, he contends that due process required the government to prove the facts underlying the &#167; 3C1.1 enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt.   The argument is doubly flawed.   First, Clark's premise is presented without any effort to elaborate its basis under the Guidelines and is far from obviously true.   Second, precedent disposes of his argument that anything but a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard governs the district court's factfinding at sentencing.   See, e.g., United States v. Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196476\"><a href=\"/opinion/196476/united-states-v-lombard/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 175-76 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

That application note provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In applying [&#167; 3C1.1] in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant, such testimony or statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.1).   Clark argues that this instruction required the district court to credit Clark's version of the events (that his co-defendants were lying or misunderstood him) over the testimony of the co-defendants as described in the PSR and given at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the application note cannot mean, as Clark apparently would have it, that the court must resolve all factual or testimonial disputes in favor of the defendant.   Nor does it require the district court, in deciding whether an obstruction of justice occurred, to accept a defendant's self-serving denials over the testimony of other witnesses it finds more credible.

The note's instruction is specifically limited to the application of &#167; 3C1.1 \"in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant\" and provides that only \"such testimony or statements \" should receive the benefit of a defendant-favorable light.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.1) (emphases added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We understand this language to mean that if the defendant is alleged to have obstructed justice by means of false testimony or statements, and if such testimony or statements encompass genuine ambiguities that plausibly suggest that the testimony or statements were innocent as opposed to obstructive, then those ambiguities may have to be resolved in favor of the innocent reading.   See Tracy, 36 F.3d at 204 (quoting United States v. Crousore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"627372\"><a href=\"/opinion/627372/united-states-v-david-a-crousore/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 385 (6th Cir.1993)).   As this court has recently said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>[The] interpretive principle [contained in application note 1] only applies to the construction of allegedly perjurious language, not the determination of credibility of fact witnesses....

In sum, application note 1 requires at most that the district court indulge \"lenitive interpretations\" of the defendant's allegedly obstructive statements to the extent plausible, and only if those statements are ambiguous.   See Tracy, 36 F.3d at 204.   It does not require the district court to avoid a finding of obstruction by contriving doubt as to the defendant's conduct where the evidence is otherwise clear, merely because the defendant denies he did anything obstructive.   See id. at 203-04;  United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568494\"><a href=\"/opinion/568494/united-states-v-alvaro-rojo-alvarez-united-states-v-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span>, 969 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there were two aspects of Clark's conduct that the court found constituted obstruction of justice:  his attempts to induce his co-defendants to lie to the court, and his statements to the probation officer denying any such attempts.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(b) &amp; 3(h)).   We review the district court's factual findings underlying the &#167; 3C1.1 enhancement only for clear error.   See Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 229.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Clark's attempt to suborn perjury, the lenitive interpretive principle of application note 1 is inapposite, as that conduct did not strictly consist of the making of false statements.
