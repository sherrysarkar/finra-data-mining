We  have   carefully  reviewed  the\r                                 \r\r\n\nparties' briefs  and the record, including  the transcript of\r\n\nthe  May 5,  1995 hearing,  and  affirm the  district court's\r\n\njudgment denying  appellant John J. Sullivan's  request for a\r\n\npreliminary injunction.   We rely on  essentially the reasons\r\n\nset forth  in the court's Order, dated July 11, 1995.  We add\r\n\nthe two following comments.\r\n\n          1.   The  district court  has \"broad  authority\" in\r\n\napplying  to a given  case the  four factors  for determining\r\n\nwhether  to   grant   a  preliminary   injunction.     United\r                                                                         \r\n\nSteelworkers v. Textron, Inc., 836 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                                         \r\n\nAppellant argues that the court here abused its discretion by\r\n\nonly considering  whether appellant was likely  to succeed in\r\n\ndemonstrating that \"but for\" the unconstitutional retaliatory\r\n\nmotive,  he would not have been transferred.  See McDonald v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHall, 610 F.2d 16, 18 (1st  Cir. 1979).  We disagree.  Where,\r                \r\n\nas  here, the court's factual findings in this regard are not\r\n\nclearly erroneous,  Roselli v.  Affleck, 508 F.2d  1277, 1280\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1974) (tentative  findings of fact on a  motion for\r\n\npreliminary  injunction are  entitled to  the  normal, strong\r\n\npresumption of  correctness), there  is no reason  for it  to\r\n\nproceed to consider public  interest or the risks of  harm to\r\n\neither party.  Cf. Jackson v. Fair, 846 F.2d 811, 815, 820-21\r                                              \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (affirming the  denial of an injunction based\r\n\nonly on likelihood of success on the merits).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          2.  Appellant claims that the district court should\r\n\nhave determined whether he likely would succeed on the merits\r\n\nof  all of  his  claims, not  only  the retaliatory  transfer\r                   \r\n\nclaim.  However,  appellant does not  explain, and we  cannot\r\n\nsee, how  consideration of  all the  claims could  change the\r\n\nresult  the district  court reached.   That  is, even  if the\r\n\ncourt found appellant  likely to  succeed on one  or more  of\r\n\nthese  claims,  he  still  would  not  be   entitled  to  the\r\n\ninjunction he seeks.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  Local Rule 27.1.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
