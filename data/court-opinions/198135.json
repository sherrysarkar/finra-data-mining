Having carefully reviewed the parties'\r\nappellate submissions and having determined that oral argument\r\nwould not advance the decisional process, we summarily affirm the\r\njudgment below in all respects.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1\r\nFirst, even if we assume arguendo that there was\r\nsufficient evidence for the jury to have concluded that appellee\r\nGarcia had supervisory authority over the other defendant officers,\r\nthe evidence was insufficient to ground a sustainable conclusion\r\nthat Garcia's inaction prior to the execution of the warrant\r\namounted to the type of  reckless or callous indifference to\r\nplaintiffs' constitutional rights that gives rise to supervisory\r\nliability.  See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 562\r\n(1st Cir. 1989).  Second, even if we assume arguendo that the\r\ndistrict court clearly erred in denying plaintiffs' motion to\r\ncompel production of the defendant officers' internal affairs\r\ndepartment files, plaintiffs' failure even to attempt to explain \r\nhow the ruling resulted in a \"manifest injustice, that is, . . .\r\nsubstantial prejudice to the aggrieved party,\" Mack v. Great\r\nAtlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, Inc., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir.\r\n1989) (setting forth standard of review for challenges to discovery\r\norders) (citations omitted), constitutes a waiver of any argument\r\nfor a new trial on the basis of this alleged error, see, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990); Fed. R.\r\nApp. P. 28(a)(6) (an appellant's brief must include both \"a concise\r\nstatement of the applicable standard of review\" and an argument\r\n\"with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the\r\nrecord relied on\").  Third, we remain firm in our conviction that\r\nappellants are not entitled to the costs of preparing the\r\ntranscript under 28 U.S.C.  753(f).\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.  \n",
