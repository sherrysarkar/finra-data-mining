Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 24, 2002\n\f      Per   Curiam.     Angel    O.    Irizarry-Centeno          challenges     his\n\nconviction    for     conspiracy      to   possess      with     the   intent    to\n\ndistribute heroin and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841\n\nand 846.    Specifically, Irizarry-Centeno claims that he received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed\n\nto advise him that he faced a              mandatory life sentence if he\n\nrejected the government’s plea offer and was convicted after a\n\njury trial.    According to Irizarry-Centeno, if he had been aware\n\nof the potential for life imprisonment he would have accepted\n\nthe   government’s      plea    offer.        In    a     supplemental    brief,\n\nIrizarry-Centeno       also    contends     that     he    was    sentenced     in\n\nviolation of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and\n\nfurther that his sentence is defective because the judge failed\n\nto adhere to the strict procedural requirements of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n851(b).\n\n      To the extent that Irizarry-Centeno’s claim that he was\n\nsentenced in violation of Apprendi rests on the fact that his\n\ntwo   prior   felony    convictions        were    neither     charged    in    the\n\nindictment nor presented to the jury, it is without merit.\n\nApprendi applies only to facts other than prior convictions that\n\nare used to increase a sentence beyond the statutory maximum\n\nUnited States v.       Gomez-Estrada, 273 F.3d 400, 402 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                       2\n\f2001).    To the extent that his Apprendi claim is founded on the\n\nfact that the drug quantity used to enhance his sentence was not\n\npresented to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, we\n\nconclude that there was no plain error, given the evidence that\n\ndefendant was part of a multi-kilo drug operation and further\n\nthat he never contested the quantity of drugs.             See generally\n\nUnited States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 2001). Nor is\n\nthere any evidence in the record to support Irizarry-Centeno’s\n\nclaim that the district judge failed to follow the procedural\n\nrequirements set forth in § 851(b).\n\n    As to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, this\n\ncircuit has held “with a regularity bordering on monotonous that\n\nfact-specific claims of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot\n\nmake their debut on direct appeal of criminal convictions, but,\n\nrather must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the\n\ntrial court.” United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    Although    we   have    occasionally   reviewed      ineffective\n\nassistance claims on direct appeal, “we travel this route only\n\nwhen the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is\n\nsufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the\n\nclaim.”     Id.\n\n    Notwithstanding        Irizarry-Centeno’s      assertions      to    the\n\ncontrary,     the    evidentiary    record   before   us   is    far    from\n\n\n                                      3\n\fsufficiently developed.     Other than Irizarry-Centeno’s bare\n\nallegations during the sentencing hearing that he had not been\n\nadvised of the information filed by the government nor the\n\npotential impact of the information on his sentence, the record\n\nis devoid of probative evidence bearing on his allegations.\n\nConsequently,   any   consideration   of   defendant’s   ineffective\n\nassistance claim by this court would be premature.       Accordingly,\n\nwe reject the claim, without prejudice to Irizarry-Centeno’s\n\nright to raise it in a collateral proceeding.        See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§2255.\n\n    Based on the foregoing, Irizarry-Centeno’s conviction and\n\nsentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f",
