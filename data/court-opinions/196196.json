Factual Background\r            A.  Factual Background\r                                  \r\n\n          On June 28, 1993, pursuant to  a prior plan, Pierce\r\n\nand a fellow Maine resident, codefendant David Leland Maddox,\r\n\ndrove to  Lawrence, Massachusetts, in order  to purchase four\r\n\nounces of cocaine.  Paul Abraham, an acquaintance of Pierce's\r\n\nwho  was  to \"middle\"  the  deal,  informed drug  enforcement\r\n\npersonnel  of the arrangements.  The sale did not go through.\r\n\nPierce  and  Maddox were  arrested  on Interstate  95  in New\r\n\nHampshire while  returning to Maine.   The arresting officers\r\n\nseized  $3,333.50  from Pierce;  they  also confiscated  drug\r\n\nparaphernalia  and  a  loaded  gun  from  the  car.    Maddox\r\n\nsubsequently pleaded guilty and became a cooperating witness.\r\n\nB.  Procedural History\r            B.  Procedural History\r                                  \r\n\n          On October 12, 1993, Pierce was arraigned on a two-\r\n\ncount indictment charging him  with the crimes of conviction.\r\n\nOn that same day, Magistrate-Judge Beaulieu appointed Gary M.\r\n\nGrowe to  represent him.   In the  ensuing month and  a half,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nproblems developed between Growe and Pierce, and, on November\r\n\n30, 1993, the day before jury selection was to commence,\r\n\nGrowe filed a motion  to withdraw as counsel.   Pierce joined\r\n\nin  the  motion.   The  government  opposed Growe's  request,\r\n\npointing  out  that Pierce  already  had  been provided  with\r\n\nJencks discovery  material and arguing that  Pierce might use\r\n\nthe material to create problems for potential witnesses.  The\r\n\ndistrict court  heard argument on Growe's  motion on December\r\n\n1, 1993.\r\n\n          At the hearing, Growe maintained that a personality\r\n\nconflict was compromising his ability to evaluate objectively\r\n\ncertain defense theories proposed  by Pierce.  After spending\r\n\nsome time inquiring into the particulars of the problem,  the\r\n\ncourt  denied the motion.   In so doing,  the court described\r\n\nthe conflict as \"not so great that it results in a total lack\r\n\nof communication preventing an  adequate defense.\"  That same\r\n\nday, the court also empaneled the jury for the case.\r\n\n          On  December  6,  1993,  two  days  before  opening\r\n\nstatements  were scheduled  to  be delivered,  Growe filed  a\r\n\nsecond motion  to  withdraw.   Again,  Pierce joined  in  the\r\n\nmotion.    On December  7, 1993,  the  district court  held a\r\n\nhearing to address the motion.  The essence of Growe's second\r\n\nwithdrawal request was that  his relationship with Pierce had\r\n\ndeteriorated  to  the point  where  (1)  Pierce was  ignoring\r\n\nGrowe's advice and talking  to the press about the  case; and\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n(2)  Pierce  believed  Growe  was  wrongfully  providing  the\r\n\ngovernment with  \"vital  information.\"   After inquiring  for\r\n\nsome time into  the basis  for the second  motion, the  court\r\n\ndenied it.  In so doing, the court pointed out  that the case\r\n\nwas \"literally  on the eve of  trial.\"  It also  stated:  \"At\r\n\nsome point, the Court has to take the position that the whole\r\n\nsystem just cannot be  -- come down  to its knees because  of\r\n\nthe inability of the  defendant and counsel to agree on -- on\r\n\nhow their case  should be  tried.\"  The  court did,  however,\r\n\ngrant Growe's motion to  withdraw from representing Pierce in\r\n\nanother  matter  that  was  scheduled  to  go  to  trial  the\r\n\nfollowing month.\r\n\n          The  next  day,  the   jury  was  sworn  and  trial\r\n\ncommenced.  On December  10, 1993,  the jury  returned guilty\r\n\nverdicts on both counts  of the indictment.  On  February 25,\r\n\n1994, Pierce  moved for  the appointment  of new counsel  for\r\n\nsentencing, and  on  March 16,  1994, the  court granted  the\r\n\nmotion, appointing Pierce's present counsel to replace Growe.\r\n\nMeanwhile,  on  February 24,  1994,  the  government filed  a\r\n\ncomplaint seeking  civil forfeiture  of the  $3,333.50 seized\r\n\nfrom  Pierce at  the time  of his  arrest.   See 21  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n881(a)(6)  (subjecting to  civil forfeiture  \"[m]oneys .  . .\r\n\nintended  to be  furnished by  any person  in exchange  for a\r\n\ncontrolled substance\").   On April  5, 1994, Pierce  filed an\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nanswer  to  the  complaint.    Subsequently,  the  government\r\n\nwithdrew its claim as to $1,000.\r\n\n          On October 20, 1994, Magistrate-Judge Beaulieu held\r\n\na  bench trial on the  forfeiture action, and  on October 25,\r\n\n1994,  he  issued an  order of  forfeiture  in the  amount of\r\n\n$2,333.50.   Judgment entered on October 31, 1994.  That same\r\n\nday,  Pierce filed a motion  to dismiss the  criminal case on\r\n\ndouble jeopardy  grounds.   On  November 1,  1994, the  court\r\n\norally denied the motion to dismiss and proceeded to sentence\r\n\nPierce.\r\n\n          The  court  first  determined  that  Pierce's  base\r\n\noffense level was 18 for  the conspiracy conviction.  Relying\r\n\non a 1984 Florida \"withheld adjudication\" in which Pierce had\r\n\npleaded nolo  contendere to a charge  of delivering cannabis,\r                                    \r\n\nand a 1985 Florida sexual battery conviction, the  court then\r\n\nadjusted  this level to 32  because it determined that Pierce\r\n\nwas a \"career offender\" under U.S.S.G.   4B1.1 (1994) (person\r\n\nwho  is more than eighteen  years old, stands  convicted of a\r\n\ncrime of violence or a controlled  substance offense, and has\r\n\ntwo prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or\r\n\ncontrolled substance offenses is a career offender subject to\r\n\nan  upward adjustment  of his base  offense level).   Because\r\n\nPierce's  criminal  history category  was  VI,  see id.  (all\r                                                                   \r\n\ncareer offenders have criminal history categories of VI), the\r\n\napplicable guideline  range was 210 to  the statutory maximum\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nof 240 months.  The court then sentenced Pierce to 210 months\r\n\non  his conspiracy conviction, and to the mandatory 60 months\r\n\nconsecutive sentence on his firearm conviction, see 18 U.S.C.\r                                                               \r\n\n   924(c)(1) (firearm  sentence  must be  consecutive to  the\r\n\nunderlying  sentence), for  a total  sentence of  270 months'\r\n\nimprisonment.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n          Pierce  makes five  arguments on  appeal:   (1) the\r\n\nentry  of judgment  in the  civil forfeiture action  bars the\r\n\ninstant  criminal prosecution  under  the  Fifth  Amendment's\r\n\nDouble  Jeopardy Clause; (2) the denial of the two motions to\r\n\nwithdraw  constituted an  abuse of  discretion and  led to  a\r\n\nviolation of his Sixth Amendment rights; (3) the 1984 Florida\r\n\nwithheld adjudication was not a \"conviction\" cognizable under\r\n\nthe  career offender  provisions of  the guidelines;  (4) the\r\n\n1985 Florida sexual  battery conviction was  not a \"crime  of\r\n\nviolence\" as  that  term is  defined by  the career  offender\r\n\nprovisions;  and (5) a conspiracy conviction cannot predicate\r\n\na finding that a  defendant is a career offender.  We discuss\r\n\neach in turn.\r\n\nA.  Double Jeopardy\r            A.  Double Jeopardy\r                               \r\n\n          Pierce  first contends  that  the  Double  Jeopardy\r\n\nClause precluded  the  government from  further pursuing  his\r\n\ncriminal  prosecution  once  judgment  entered  in  the civil\r\n\nforfeiture action.   In Pierce's view, the civil and criminal\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nactions  were separate  proceedings arising  out of  the same\r\n\ncriminal acts  and instituted  by the federal  government for\r\n\npenal  purposes.    See  United States  v.  $405,089.23  U.S.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCurrency,  33  F.3d 1210,  1216-22  (9th  Cir. 1994)  (Double\r                    \r\n\nJeopardy Clause is violated where the same criminal acts give\r\n\nrise to  both a criminal  prosecution and  a separate,  civil\r\n\nforfeiture  action   under  21  U.S.C.      881(a)(6);  civil\r\n\nforfeiture under   881(a)(6) is \"punishment\"); but see United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

Ct. 573  (1994); United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Besides arguing  that we should  reject $405,089.23\r                                                                         \r\n\nand  adopt  the  reasoning   of  Tilley,  One  Single  Family\r                                                                         \r\n\nResidence,  and Millan,  the  government  responds  that  the\r                                  \r\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause, if violated, would bar only the civil\r\n\nforfeiture proceeding, and not Pierce's criminal prosecution.\r\n\nBecause we agree with this last argument, we reject  Pierce's\r\n\ndouble  jeopardy  challenge  without  deciding   whether  the\r\n\nforfeiture action was a separate penal proceeding.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          In relevant part,  the Fifth Amendment states  that\r\n\nno person  shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice\r\n\nput in  jeopardy of life  or limb.\"   It is  well established\r\n\nthat  this  Double  Jeopardy  Clause  protects  against  both\r\n\nsuccessive  punishments and  successive prosecutions  for the\r\n\nsame  criminal offense.  E.g., United States v. Dixon, 113 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt.  2849, 2855 (1993).  The Clause does not even potentially\r\n\ncome into play, however, until  the defendant has first  been\r\n\nput  into jeopardy.    Crist v.  Bretz,  437 U.S.  28,  32-33\r                                                  \r\n\n(1978).  And even then, it is only the second proceeding that\r                                                         \r\n\nis constitutionally endangered, for the Clause's basic design\r\n\nis  \"to protect  an individual  from being  subjected to  the\r\n\nhazards of  trial and possible conviction more  than once for\r                                                                     \r\n\nan alleged offense.\"   Green v. United States, 355  U.S. 184,\r                                                         \r\n\n187 (1957) (emphasis supplied).\r\n\n          Our inquiry therefore reduces to whether Pierce was\r\n\nfirst subjected  to jeopardy for the  conduct underlying this\r\n\naction prior  to jeopardy attaching in this action.  Plainly,\r                            \r\n\nhe  was  not.   It is  settled  that jeopardy  attaches  in a\r\n\ncriminal  jury case  when the  jury  is empaneled  and sworn.\r\n\nE.g.,  Crist, 437  U.S. at  35.   Pierce's criminal  jury was\r                        \r\n\nempaneled on December 1, 1993, and sworn on December 8, 1993,\r\n\nseveral months prior to the inception of the civil forfeiture\r\n\nproceeding.  Thus, any double jeopardy problem arising out of\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe institution  of the civil forfeiture  proceeding can only\r\n\nbe seen as imperiling that proceeding.\r\n\n          Pierce  does   not  challenge  any   of  the  legal\r\n\nprinciples  we have  set  forth;  nor  does he  dispute  that\r\n\njeopardy first attached in the criminal proceeding.  Instead,\r\n\nhe  disagrees with  our mode  of analysis.   Focusing  on the\r\n\nDouble  Jeopardy  Clause's  prohibition   against  successive\r\n\npunishments, Pierce contends  that the  moment of  punishment\r                       \r\n\ncontrols, asserting  that \"the  issue is  not  so much  which\r\n\njeopardy attaches first as which jeopardy is first complete.\"\r\n\nBecause  jeopardy first \"became complete,\" and punishment was\r\n\nfirst  imposed   (in  the  form  of   the  judgment  ordering\r\n\nforfeiture) in  the civil proceeding, Pierce  argues that his\r\n\nsentence in this case  is a \"successive punishment\" precluded\r\n\nby the Clause.  We are not persuaded.\r\n\n          Pierce's argument that the \"completion\" of jeopardy\r\n\ntriggers  the Clause's protections  completely disregards the\r\n\nfact  that  the  Clause   protects  against  more  than  just\r\n\nsuccessive punishments; it  also protects against  successive\r\n\nprosecutions.    To  illustrate, if  Pierce's  argument  were\r\n\ncorrect, he would not have been entitled to assert the double\r\n\njeopardy bar in the  civil forfeiture action because jeopardy\r\n\nhad  not yet  been \"completed\"  in this  criminal proceeding.\r\n\nPatently,  however, Pierce  was  so entitled  (presuming,  of\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ncourse,  that the  forfeiture  action was  both separate  and\r\n\npunitive).  The Supreme Court has made quite clear that \r\n\n          the  State  with  all its  resources  and\r\n          power  should  not  be  allowed  to  make\r\n          repeated    attempts   to    convict   an\r\n          individual   for   an  alleged   offense,\r\n          thereby subjecting  him to embarrassment,\r\n          expense  and ordeal and compelling him to\r\n          live in a continuing state of anxiety and\r\n          insecurity,  as  well  as  enhancing  the\r\n          possibility that even though  innocent he\r\n          may be found guilty.\r\n\nGreen,  355  U.S. at  187.   This  sentiment, along  with the\r                 \r\n\naccused's interest  in retaining a chosen  jury, has fostered\r\n\nthe view that jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury\r\n\nis empaneled  and sworn.  See  Crist, 437 U.S. at  35-36.  It\r                                                \r\n\nalso  has led  to the  rule that  the denial  of a  motion to\r\n\ndismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable.\r\n\nAbney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 661-62 (1977).    \r                                  \r\n\n          Although  he  does  not say  so  explicitly, Pierce\r\n\nimplies that  a criminal defendant  should have the  right to\r\n\nwithhold objection to a  forbidden successive prosecution and\r\n\nraise a double jeopardy  argument only in the event  that the\r\n\nsecond  prosecution   leads  to  a  prior   and  less  severe\r\n\npunishment than that  meted out  in the original  case.   Put\r\n\nanother way, a defendant  ought to have the option  to endure\r\n\nan  unconstitutional second  trial in  the hope that  it will\r\n\nboth conclude first  and lead  to a  more lenient  punishment\r\n\nthan  that eventually imposed in the first trial, and then to\r\n\nobject to the punishment imposed in the first trial on double\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\njeopardy grounds.  We cannot locate  any authority to support\r\n\nthis proposition, and we reject it out of hand.\r\n\n          The Double Jeopardy Clause  is a shield against the\r\n\noppression inherent in a duplicative, punitive proceeding; it\r\n\nis not a tool by which a defendant can avoid the consequences\r\n\nof  the proceeding in which jeopardy first attached.  The law\r\n\nof double jeopardy is quite complicated, and often (as here),\r\n\nthe question whether a  second proceeding violates the Clause\r\n\nis  a close one.   Because, under Article  III of the Federal\r\n\nConstitution,  the  question  can  only be  answered  in  the\r\n\ncontext  of an actual case  or controversy, the  public has a\r\n\nstrong interest in the government being able to institute the\r\n\nsecond proceeding without risking the first.  After all,  the\r\n\ngovernment should  not be dissuaded from  bringing legitimate\r\n\npenal  proceedings,  and  opposing  counsel  and  the  courts\r\n\n(including the appellate  courts, see Abney, 431 U.S. at 661-\r                                                       \r\n\n62)  are  there  to  protect the  defendant's  rights  if the\r\n\ngovernment has miscalculated.  This simply is not a situation\r\n\nwhere  the price to society of allowing a defendant to parlay\r\n\nthe government's miscalculation into a \"get out of jail free\"\r\n\ncard is worth the deterrent effect such a regime might have.\r\n\n          Pierce's   theory   of  completed   jeopardy  would\r\n\neffectively trade away some  of the most valuable protections\r\n\nof the Double Jeopardy  Clause for rather dubious gains.   We\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ntherefore reject it,  and overrule  Pierce's double  jeopardy\r\n\nchallenge to the penalty imposed in this proceeding.\r\n\nB.

To  the extent that Pierce is  taking issue with the\r\n\nadequacy  of  his  representation  after the  denial  of  the\r\n\nmotions, we  think that his fact-specific  argument should be\r\n\nmore fully developed and  presented to the district  court in\r\n\nthe first instance.  Accordingly, we decline to address it at\r\n\nthis  time.  See, e.g.,  United States v.  Jadusingh, 12 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1162,  1169-70 (1st  Cir.  1994)  (fact-specific  ineffective\r\n\nassistance claims ordinarily ought  first be presented to the\r\n\ndistrict court in a 28 U.S.C.   2255 petition).  We therefore\r\n\nlimit our  focus to  whether, in  light of the  then-existing\r                                                                         \r\n\ncircumstances,  the court erred  in denying the  motion.

We detect no error.\r\n\n          In the analogous context of a challenge to a denial\r\n\nof a defendant's motion to substitute counsel, we have stated\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nthat  we  will  \"consider  several   factors,  including  the\r\n\ntimeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court's inquiry\r\n\ninto  the defendant's  complaint,  and whether  the  conflict\r\n\nbetween  the defendant and his  counsel was so  great that it\r\n\nresulted  in  a total  lack  of  communication preventing  an\r\n\nadequate defense.\"  United  States v.

Of course, we\r                                    \r\n\nare aware that the  trial court has a superior  vantage point\r\n\nfor  evaluating  matters such  as  these;  we therefore  will\r\n\nreverse  only if we perceive an abuse of discretion.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nWe also are  mindful that when, as here, the  granting of the\r\n\ndefendant's  request  would  almost certainly  necessitate  a\r\n\nlast-minute   continuance,  the  trial  judge's  actions  are\r\n\nentitled to  extraordinary deference.   As the  Supreme Court\r\n\nhas stated:\r\n\n          Trial judges necessarily require  a great\r\n          deal  of  latitude in  scheduling trials.\r\n          Not the  least of their  problems is that\r\n          of assembling the witnesses, lawyers, and\r\n          jurors  at  the same  place  at the  same\r\n          time,  and  this burden  counsels against\r\n          continuances   except   for    compelling\r\n          reasons.   Consequently, broad discretion\r\n          must  be granted trial  courts on matters\r\n          of continuances; only an  unreasoning and\r\n          arbitrary         \"insistence        upon\r\n          expeditiousness   in   the   face  of   a\r\n          justifiable  request for  delay\" violates\r\n          the right to assistance of counsel.\r\n\nMorris v. Slappy,  461 U.S. 1,  11-12 (1983) (quoting  Ungar,\r                                                                        \r\n\n376 U.S. at 589).\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          In  view  of all  these  considerations,  the trial\r\n\ncourt's  decisions pass muster.  Taking first the final Allen\r                                                                         \r\n\nfactor, we note that, while Pierce has adduced proof that his\r\n\nrelationship with  Growe was beset with problems,  he has not\r\n\nestablished  a total  lack  of  communication  preventing  an\r\n\nadequate  defense.  The record reveals  that Growe and Pierce\r\n\nwere conversing  with one  another and had  some appreciation\r\n\nfor  the other's opinions  and sensibilities at  the time the\r\n\nmotions were filed.   We therefore have no basis  to conclude\r\n\nthat the district  court clearly  erred in  finding that  the\r\n\ncommunication between the  counsel and client  was sufficient\r\n\nto  allow a satisfactory defense.   Cf. Allen, 793 F.2d at 92\r                                                         \r\n\n(noting the discretion afforded to trial court determinations\r\n\nregarding substitution of counsel).   \r\n\n          Furthermore, when  presented with the  motions, the\r\n\ncourt  held hearings at which  it questioned Growe and Pierce\r\n\nat  some length regarding  the nature of  their problems with\r\n\neach other.  We  have read the transcripts of  these hearings\r\n\nand  find  the  court's  inquiries  to have  been  more  than\r\n\nadequate.   If  there  is  a  relative  lack  of  specificity\r\n\nregarding  the exact  reasons  for  the difficulties  between\r\n\nGrowe and Pierce, it is a result of a lack  of elaboration on\r\n\ntheir part.   It certainly  is not a  result of  insufficient\r\n\nquestioning by the court.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          Finally,   the  motions   were,  by   any  measure,\r\n\nuntimely.    Although we  appreciate  that  the docket  moves\r\n\nquickly in the District of Maine, the fact remains that Growe\r\n\nwaited until the day  before empanelment before notifying the\r\n\ncourt  that there was a  problem.  More  importantly, a quick\r\n\ndocket does not alleviate  the logistical problems engendered\r\n\nby a last-minute continuance.  See Morris, 461 U.S. at 11-12.\r                                                     \r\n\nNor  can  it  allay  the legitimate  concerns  about  witness\r\n\nintimidation   the  government  may   have  when  a  criminal\r\n\ndefendant is in possession of Jencks material well before the\r\n\ninception of trial.  \r\n\n          In  sum, because  the circumstances  here  were not\r\n\nsufficiently compelling, the district court acted well within\r\n\nits discretion  in declining  to bring  the proceedings  to a\r\n\nhalt  on  the eve  of trial.    We therefore  reject Pierce's\r\n\nargument  that the district  court committed reversible error\r\n\nin denying the two motions to withdraw.\r\n\nC.  The 1984 Florida Withheld Adjudication\r            C.  The 1984 Florida Withheld Adjudication\r                                                      \r\n\n          Pierce  argues  that  the district  court  erred in\r\n\nconcluding  that the  1984 Florida  withheld adjudication  in\r\n\nwhich he  had pleaded nolo contendere  to delivering cannabis\r                                                 \r\n\nconstitutes a cognizable predicate conviction for purposes of\r\n\nthe  relevant \"career  offender\" guideline.   See  U.S.S.G.  \r                                                             \r\n\n4B1.1.   In  Pierce's  view, a  withheld adjudication  simply\r\n\ncannot  be regarded  as a  \"conviction\" under  this guideline\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nbecause the term  \"conviction\" necessarily implies the  entry\r\n\nof a  final  adjudicatory judgment.    A careful  reading  of\r\n\nrelevant guideline language and commentary persuades us  that\r\n\nPierce's argument is incorrect.\r\n\n          Although there  is surface  appeal to the  argument\r\n\nthat  there can be no  \"conviction\" unless and  until a final\r\n\nadjudicatory judgment is  entered, the sentencing  guidelines\r\n\nclearly  construe  the term  differently.   Section 4B1.2(3),\r\n\nwhich defines the terms used  in   4B1.1, states:  \"The  date\r\n\nthat a defendant has sustained a conviction shall be the date\r\n\nthat the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether\r                          \r\n\nby guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\" (emphasis\r                                                             \r\n\nsupplied).   Thus,  there is  a textual  basis in  the career\r\n\noffender guidelines for concluding that  a guilt-establishing\r\n\nevent (such  as a plea where a  defendant states that he does\r\n\nnot wish to contest the charges), and not the formal entry of\r\n\nan adjudicatory  judgment, determines whether  and when there\r\n\nhas been a countable \"conviction.\" \r\n\n          This view  is borne  out by the  relevant guideline\r\n\ncommentary.    Application note  4  to     4B1.2 directs  the\r\n\nsentencing  court  to  utilize  the  provisions  of     4A1.2\r\n\n(captioned  \"Definitions  and   Instructions  for   Computing\r\n\nCriminal History\")  in \"the  counting of convictions  under  \r\n\n4B1.1.\"  Two provisions of   4A1.2 compel the conclusion that\r\n\nwithheld adjudications following pleas of nolo contendere are\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ncountable convictions  under    4B1.2.  First,    4A1.2(a)(4)\r\n\ndrives  home the point that there can be a \"conviction\" prior\r\n\nto,   and  therefore   without,  the   formal  entry   of  an\r\n\nadjudicatory  judgment:    \"`Convicted  of  an  offense'  for\r\n\npurposes  of this  provision,  means that  the  guilt of  the\r\n\ndefendant  has  been  established, whether  by  guilty  plea,\r\n\ntrial,  or plea of nolo  contendere.\"  And    4A1.2(f), which\r                                               \r\n\ngoverns     diversionary    dispositions     like    withheld\r\n\nadjudications, is  quite clear  that admissions of  guilt (or\r\n\npleas  formally  declining  to  contest  guilt),  rather than\r\n\nformal entries of judgment, control countability:  \r\n\n          Diversion   from  the   judicial  process\r\n          without   a   finding  of   guilt  (e.g.,\r                                                              \r\n          deferred prosecution) is not  counted [as\r\n          a  prior  sentence].

This reflects a policy that defendants\r\n\nwho  receive the  benefit  of a  rehabilitative sentence  and\r\n\ncontinue  to commit crimes should not be treated with further\r\n\nleniency.\"    4A1.2, comment.

The difference between \"counting\" and \"defining\"\r\n\nconvictions  in  this  context is,  however,  only  semantic.\r\n\nSection 4B1.1 directs that \"convictions\" of a certain type be\r\n\ncounted, and other guidelines and  commentary which elaborate\r\n\nupon the events to  be counted essentially define that  which\r\n\nis  a conviction.  In other words, the sentencing court is to\r\n\n\"count\"  whatever is \"defined\" as a conviction (so long as it\r\n\nis  for  a  crime  of  violence  or  a  controlled  substance\r\n\noffense).\r\n\n          When     4A1.2(a)(4)  and  (f) are  applied to  the\r\n\nquestion presented (as    4B1.2, comment. (n.4) dictates), it\r\n\nbecomes clear that the diversionary disposition at issue here\r\n\n--  the  1984  Florida  withheld adjudication  --  should  be\r\n\ncounted as a  conviction under   4B1.1   See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nJones,  910  F.2d  760, 761  (11th  Cir.  1990) (per  curiam)\r                                                                        \r\n\n(withheld  adjudication  following  a  nolo  contendere  plea\r                                                                   \r\n\nconstitutes  a conviction  for career  offender status).   We\r\n\ntherefore reject Pierce's  argument that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in  counting the  withheld adjudication as  a predicate\r\n\nconviction for purposes of the career offender guideline.\r\n\nD.

Central to his\r\n\nargument  is  an  assertion  that the  statute  defining  the\r\n\noffense  for  which  he  was  convicted,  Fla.  Stat. Ann.   \r\n\n794.011(5), does  not, inter  alia, have  as an element  \"the\r                                              \r\n\nuse,  attempted  use  or  threatened use  of  physical  force\r\n\nagainst  the person  of another.\"   See    4B1.2(1) (defining\r                                                   \r\n\nphrase  \"crime  of  violence\"   for  purposes  of     4B1.1).\r\n\nRegardless  of whether  Pierce is  correct about  the current\r                                                                         \r\n\nversion  of  the statute  (a matter  on  which we  express no\r\n\nopinion), a  plain reading of the statute  under which Pierce\r\n\nwas convicted reveals that, in 1985,  the use of force was an\r                                                                      \r\n\nelement of the  offense.   See Fla. Stat.  Ann.    794.011(5)\r                                          \r\n\n(West  1984) (\"A  person who  commits sexual  battery  upon a\r\n\nperson  12  years  of  age or  older,  without  that person's\r\n\nconsent, and in the  process thereof uses physical force  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nviolence  not  likely to  cause  serious  personal injury  is\r                    \r\n\nguilty of  a  felony .  .  . .\")  (emphasis supplied).    And\r\n\nbecause the statutory formulation of the predicate crime, and\r\n\nnot the actual facts of the case itself, dictates whether the\r\n\noffense  is a crime of  violence for purposes  of the federal\r\n\nsentencing guidelines,  see United States v.  DeLuca, 17 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n6, 8 (1st Cir. 1994), our inquiry is at an end.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n          The  1985 Florida  sexual  battery was  a crime  of\r\n\nviolence  under    4B1.2(1).   We  therefore reject  Pierce's\r\n\nargument that the district court erred in counting the sexual\r\n\nbattery as a predicate conviction for purposes of the  career\r\n\noffender guideline.\r\n\nE.

Sec. 846, and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).  After carefully considering Pierce's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1993, pursuant to a prior plan, Pierce and a fellow Maine resident, codefendant David Leland Maddox, drove to Lawrence, Massachusetts, in order to purchase four ounces of cocaine.  Paul Abraham, an acquaintance of Pierce's who was to \"middle\" the deal, informed drug enforcement personnel of the arrangements.  The sale did not go through.  Pierce and Maddox were arrested on Interstate 95 in New Hampshire while returning to Maine.  The arresting officers seized $3,333.50 from Pierce;  they also confiscated drug paraphernalia and a loaded gun from the car.  Maddox subsequently pleaded guilty and became a cooperating witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1993, Pierce was arraigned on a two-count indictment charging him with the crimes of conviction.  On that same day, Magistrate-Judge Beaulieu appointed Gary M. Growe to represent him.  In the ensuing month and a half, problems developed between Growe and Pierce, and, on November 30, 1993, the day before jury selection was to commence, Growe filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.  Pierce joined in the motion.  The government opposed Growe's request, pointing out that Pierce already had been provided with Jencks discovery material and arguing that Pierce might use the material to create problems for potential witnesses.  The district court heard argument on Growe's motion on December 1, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, Growe maintained that a personality conflict was compromising his ability to evaluate objectively certain defense theories proposed by Pierce.  After spending some time inquiring into the particulars of the problem, the court denied the motion.  In so doing, the court described the conflict as \"not so great that it results in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\"   That same day, the court also empaneled the jury for the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 6, 1993, two days before opening statements were scheduled to be delivered, Growe filed a second motion to withdraw.  Again, Pierce joined in the motion.  On December 7, 1993, the district court held a hearing to address the motion.  The essence of Growe's second withdrawal request was that his relationship with Pierce had deteriorated to the point where (1) Pierce was ignoring Growe's advice and talking to the press about the case;  and (2) Pierce believed Growe was wrongfully providing the government with \"vital information.\"   After inquiring for some time into the basis for the second motion, the court denied it.  In so doing, the court pointed out that the case was \"literally on the eve of trial.\"   It also stated:  \"At some point, the Court has to take the position that the whole system just cannot be--come down to its knees because of the inability of the defendant and counsel to agree on--on how their case should be tried.\"   The court did, however, grant Growe's motion to withdraw from representing Pierce in another matter that was scheduled to go to trial the following month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the jury was sworn and trial commenced.  On December 10, 1993, the jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts of the indictment.  On February 25, 1994, Pierce moved for the appointment of new counsel for sentencing, and on March 16, 1994, the court granted the motion, appointing Pierce's present counsel to replace Growe.  Meanwhile, on February 24, 1994, the government filed a complaint seeking civil forfeiture of the $3,333.50 seized from Pierce at the time of his arrest.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a)(6) (subjecting to civil forfeiture \"[m]oneys ... intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance\").  On April 5, 1994, Pierce filed an answer to the complaint.  Subsequently, the government withdrew its claim as to $1,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1994, Magistrate-Judge Beaulieu held a bench trial on the forfeiture action, and on October 25, 1994, he issued an order of forfeiture in the amount of $2,333.50.  Judgment entered on October 31, 1994.  That same day, Pierce filed a motion to dismiss the criminal case on double jeopardy grounds.  On November 1, 1994, the court orally denied the motion to dismiss and proceeded to sentence Pierce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court first determined that Pierce's base offense level was 18 for the conspiracy conviction.  Relying on a 1984 Florida \"withheld adjudication\" in which Pierce had pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of delivering cannabis, and a 1985 Florida sexual battery conviction, the court then adjusted this level to 32 because it determined that Pierce was a \"career offender\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 (1994) (person who is more than eighteen years old, stands convicted of a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and has two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses is a career offender subject to an upward adjustment of his base offense level).  Because Pierce's criminal history category was VI, see id.  (all career offenders have criminal history categories of VI), the applicable guideline range was 210 to the statutory maximum of 240 months.  The court then sentenced Pierce to 210 months on his conspiracy conviction, and to the mandatory 60 months consecutive sentence on his firearm conviction, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) (firearm sentence must be consecutive to the underlying sentence), for a total sentence of 270 months' imprisonment.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce makes five arguments on appeal:  (1) the entry of judgment in the civil forfeiture action bars the instant criminal prosecution under the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause;  (2) the denial of the two motions to withdraw constituted an abuse of discretion and led to a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights;  (3) the 1984 Florida withheld adjudication was not a \"conviction\" cognizable under the career offender provisions of the guidelines;  (4) the 1985 Florida sexual battery conviction was not a \"crime of violence\" as that term is defined by the career offender provisions;  and (5) a conspiracy conviction cannot predicate a finding that a defendant is a career offender.  We discuss each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce first contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the government from further pursuing his criminal prosecution once judgment entered in the civil forfeiture action.  In Pierce's view, the civil and criminal actions were separate proceedings arising out of the same criminal acts and instituted by the federal government for penal purposes.  See United States v. $405,089.23 U.S. Currency, 33 F.3d 1210, 1216-22 (9th Cir.1994) (Double Jeopardy Clause is violated where the same criminal acts give rise to both a criminal prosecution and a separate, civil forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a)(6);  civil forfeiture under Sec. 881(a)(6) is \"punishment\");  but see United States v. Tilley, 18 F.3d 295, 297-300 (5th Cir.)  (deeming a particular civil forfeiture brought under Sec. 881(a)(6) not to be punishment), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 573, 130 L.Ed.2d 490 (1994);  United States v. One Single Family Residence, 13 F.3d 1493, 1499 (11th Cir.1994) (viewing a criminal prosecution and an overlapping forfeiture action to be part of \"a single, coordinated prosecution\");  United States v. Millan, 2 F.3d 17, 19-21 (2d Cir.1993) (same), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 922, 127 L.Ed.2d 215 (1994).  Besides arguing that we should reject $405,089.23 and adopt the reasoning of Tilley, One Single Family Residence, and Millan, the government responds that the Double Jeopardy Clause, if violated, would bar only the civil forfeiture proceeding, and not Pierce's criminal prosecution.  Because we agree with this last argument, we reject Pierce's double jeopardy challenge without deciding whether the forfeiture action was a separate penal proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relevant part, the Fifth Amendment states that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   It is well established that this Double Jeopardy Clause protects against both successive punishments and successive prosecutions for the same criminal offense.  E.g., United States v. Dixon, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2855, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993).  The Clause does not even potentially come into play, however, until the defendant has first been put into jeopardy.  Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 32-33, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 2159-60, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978).  And even then, it is only the second proceeding that is constitutionally endangered, for the Clause's basic design is \"to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.\"  Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry therefore reduces to whether Pierce was first subjected to jeopardy for the conduct underlying this action prior to jeopardy attaching in this action.  Plainly, he was not.  It is settled that jeopardy attaches in a criminal jury case when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  E.g., Crist, 437 U.S. at 35, 98 S.Ct. at 2160-61.   Pierce's criminal jury was empaneled on December 1, 1993, and sworn on December 8, 1993, several months prior to the inception of the civil forfeiture proceeding.  Thus, any double jeopardy problem arising out of the institution of the civil forfeiture proceeding can only be seen as imperiling that proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce does not challenge any of the legal principles we have set forth;  nor does he dispute that jeopardy first attached in the criminal proceeding.  Instead, he disagrees with our mode of analysis.  Focusing on the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against successive punishments, Pierce contends that the moment of punishment controls, asserting that \"the issue is not so much which jeopardy attaches first as which jeopardy is first complete.\"   Because jeopardy first \"became complete,\" and punishment was first imposed (in the form of the judgment ordering forfeiture) in the civil proceeding, Pierce argues that his sentence in this case is a \"successive punishment\" precluded by the Clause.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's argument that the \"completion\" of jeopardy triggers the Clause's protections completely disregards the fact that the Clause protects against more than just successive punishments;  it also protects against successive prosecutions.  To illustrate, if Pierce's argument were correct, he would not have been entitled to assert the double jeopardy bar in the civil forfeiture action because jeopardy had not yet been \"completed\" in this criminal proceeding.  Patently, however, Pierce was so entitled (presuming, of course, that the forfeiture action was both separate and punitive).  The Supreme Court has made quite clear that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Green, 355 U.S. at 187, 78 S.Ct. at 223.   This sentiment, along with the accused's interest in retaining a chosen jury, has fostered the view that jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  See Crist, 437 U.S. at 35-36, 98 S.Ct. at 2160-61.   It also has led to the rule that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable.  Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 661-62, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2041-42, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although he does not say so explicitly, Pierce implies that a criminal defendant should have the right to withhold objection to a forbidden successive prosecution and raise a double jeopardy argument only in the event that the second prosecution leads to a prior and less severe punishment than that meted out in the original case.  Put another way, a defendant ought to have the option to endure an unconstitutional second trial in the hope that it will both conclude first and lead to a more lenient punishment than that eventually imposed in the first trial, and then to object to the punishment imposed in the first trial on double jeopardy grounds.  We cannot locate any authority to support this proposition, and we reject it out of hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause is a shield against the oppression inherent in a duplicative, punitive proceeding;  it is not a tool by which a defendant can avoid the consequences of the proceeding in which jeopardy first attached.  The law of double jeopardy is quite complicated, and often (as here), the question whether a second proceeding violates the Clause is a close one.  Because, under Article III of the Federal Constitution, the question can only be answered in the context of an actual case or controversy, the public has a strong interest in the government being able to institute the second proceeding without risking the first.  After all, the government should not be dissuaded from bringing legitimate penal proceedings, and opposing counsel and the courts (including the appellate courts, see Abney, 431 U.S. at 661-62, 97 S.Ct. at 2041-42) are there to protect the defendant's rights if the government has miscalculated.  This simply is not a situation where the price to society of allowing a defendant to parlay the government's miscalculation into a \"get out of jail free\" card is worth the deterrent effect such a regime might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's theory of completed jeopardy would effectively trade away some of the most valuable protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause for rather dubious gains.  We therefore reject it, and overrule Pierce's double jeopardy challenge to the penalty imposed in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Denial of Motions to Withdraw</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce next asserts that the district court's denial of the two motions to withdraw constituted an abuse of discretion and led to a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.  To the extent that Pierce is taking issue with the adequacy of his representation after the denial of the motions, we think that his fact-specific argument should be more fully developed and presented to the district court in the first instance.  Accordingly, we decline to address it at this time.  See, e.g., United States v. Jadusingh, 12 F.3d 1162, 1169-70 (1st Cir.1994) (fact-specific ineffective assistance claims ordinarily ought first be presented to the district court in a 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 petition).  We therefore limit our focus to whether, in light of the then-existing circumstances, the court erred in denying the motion.  Cf. United States v. Torres, 793 F.2d 436, 440 (1st Cir.1986) (in evaluating the denial of a motion for a continuance to obtain new counsel, \"we must pay particular attention to 'the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied ' \") (quoting Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849-50, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964)) (emphasis supplied).  We detect no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the analogous context of a challenge to a denial of a defendant's motion to substitute counsel, we have stated that we will \"consider several factors, including the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and whether the conflict between the defendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\"  United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 846, 107 S.Ct. 164, 93 L.Ed.2d 103 (1986).  Of course, we are aware that the trial court has a superior vantage point for evaluating matters such as these;  we therefore will reverse only if we perceive an abuse of discretion.  See id.   We also are mindful that when, as here, the granting of the defendant's request would almost certainly necessitate a last-minute continuance, the trial judge's actions are entitled to extraordinary deference.  As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Trial judges necessarily require a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials.  Not the least of their problems is that of assembling the witnesses, lawyers, and jurors at the same place at the same time, and this burden counsels against continuances except for compelling reasons.  Consequently, broad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances;  only an unreasoning and arbitrary \"insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\" violates the right to assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 1615-17, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (quoting Ungar, 376 U.S. at 589, 84 S.Ct. at 849-50).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of all these considerations, the trial court's decisions pass muster.  Taking first the final Allen factor, we note that, while Pierce has adduced proof that his relationship with Growe was beset with problems, he has not established a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.  The record reveals that Growe and Pierce were conversing with one another and had some appreciation for the other's opinions and sensibilities at the time the motions were filed.  We therefore have no basis to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the communication between the counsel and client was sufficient to allow a satisfactory defense.  Cf. Allen, 789 F.2d at 92 (noting the discretion afforded to trial court determinations regarding substitution of counsel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, when presented with the motions, the court held hearings at which it questioned Growe and Pierce at some length regarding the nature of their problems with each other.  We have read the transcripts of these hearings and find the court's inquiries to have been more than adequate.  If there is a relative lack of specificity regarding the exact reasons for the difficulties between Growe and Pierce, it is a result of a lack of elaboration on their part.  It certainly is not a result of insufficient questioning by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the motions were, by any measure, untimely.  Although we appreciate that the docket moves quickly in the District of Maine, the fact remains that Growe waited until the day before empanelment before notifying the court that there was a problem.  More importantly, a quick docket does not alleviate the logistical problems engendered by a last-minute continuance.  See Morris, 461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616-17.   Nor can it allay the legitimate concerns about witness intimidation the government may have when a criminal defendant is in possession of Jencks material well before the inception of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because the circumstances here were not sufficiently compelling, the district court acted well within its discretion in declining to bring the proceedings to a halt on the eve of trial.  We therefore reject Pierce's argument that the district court committed reversible error in denying the two motions to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The 1984 Florida Withheld Adjudication</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce argues that the district court erred in concluding that the 1984 Florida withheld adjudication in which he had pleaded nolo contendere to delivering cannabis constitutes a cognizable predicate conviction for purposes of the relevant \"career offender\" guideline.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  In Pierce's view, a withheld adjudication simply cannot be regarded as a \"conviction\" under this guideline because the term \"conviction\" necessarily implies the entry of a final adjudicatory judgment.  A careful reading of relevant guideline language and commentary persuades us that Pierce's argument is incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is surface appeal to the argument that there can be no \"conviction\" unless and until a final adjudicatory judgment is entered, the sentencing guidelines clearly construe the term differently.  Section 4B1.2(3), which defines the terms used in Sec. 4B1.1, states:  \"The date that a defendant has sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\"  (emphasis supplied).  Thus, there is a textual basis in the career offender guidelines for concluding that a guilt-establishing event (such as a plea where a defendant states that he does not wish to contest the charges), and not the formal entry of an adjudicatory judgment, determines whether and when there has been a countable \"conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view is borne out by the relevant guideline commentary.  Application note 4 to Sec. 4B1.2 directs the sentencing court to utilize the provisions of Sec. 4A1.2 (captioned \"Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History\") in \"the counting of convictions under Sec. 4B1.1.\"   Two provisions of Sec. 4A1.2 compel the conclusion that withheld adjudications following pleas of nolo contendere are countable convictions under Sec. 4B1.2.  First, Sec. 4A1.2(a)(4) drives home the point that there can be a \"conviction\" prior to, and therefore without, the formal entry of an adjudicatory judgment:  \" 'Convicted of an offense' for purposes of this provision, means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\"   And Sec. 4A1.2(f), which governs diversionary dispositions like withheld adjudications, is quite clear that admissions of guilt (or pleas formally declining to contest guilt), rather than formal entries of judgment, control countability:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>Diversion from the judicial process without a finding of guilt (e.g., deferred prosecution) is not counted [as a prior sentence].  A diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under Sec. 4A1.1(c) [of the criminal history guidelines] even if a conviction is not formally entered, except that diversion from juvenile court is not counted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application note corresponding to the provision is explanatory of its purposes:  \"Section 4A1.2(f) requires counting prior adult diversionary dispositions if they involved a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt in open court.  This reflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.\"  Sec.  4A1.2, comment.  (n. 9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employing an extremely literal reading, Pierce suggests that these guideline provisions are relevant only to the \"counting\" of convictions, and that they have no bearing on whether a particular event should be \"defined\" as a conviction.  The difference between \"counting\" and \"defining\" convictions in this context is, however, only semantic.  Section 4B1.1 directs that \"convictions\" of a certain type be counted, and other guidelines and commentary which elaborate upon the events to be counted essentially define that which is a conviction.  In other words, the sentencing court is to \"count\" whatever is \"defined\" as a conviction (so long as it is for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Secs. 4A1.2(a)(4) and (f) are applied to the question presented (as Sec. 4B1.2, comment.  (n. 4) dictates), it becomes clear that the diversionary disposition at issue here--the 1984 Florida withheld adjudication--should be counted as a conviction under Sec. 4B1.1.  See United States v. Jones, 910 F.2d 760, 761 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam ) (withheld adjudication following a nolo contendere plea constitutes a conviction for career offender status).  We therefore reject Pierce's argument that the district court erred in counting the withheld adjudication as a predicate conviction for purposes of the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The 1985 Florida Sexual Battery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's fourth argument is that the district court erred in deciding that his 1985 Florida conviction for sexual battery is a \"crime of violence\" and therefore a cognizable predicate conviction for purposes of Sec. 4B1.1.  Central to his argument is an assertion that the statute defining the offense for which he was convicted, Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 794.011(5), does not, inter alia, have as an element \"the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"   See Sec. 4B1.2(1) (defining phrase \"crime of violence\" for purposes of Sec. 4B1.1).  Regardless of whether Pierce is correct about the current version of the statute (a matter on which we express no opinion), a plain reading of the statute under which Pierce was convicted reveals that, in 1985, the use of force was an element of the offense.  See Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 794.011(5) (West 1984) (\"A person who commits sexual battery upon a person 12 years of age or older, without that person's consent, and in the process thereof uses physical force and violence not likely to cause serious personal injury is guilty of a felony....\") (emphasis supplied).  And because the statutory formulation of the predicate crime, and not the actual facts of the case itself, dictates whether the offense is a crime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines, see United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1994), our inquiry is at an end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1985 Florida sexual battery was a crime of violence under Sec. 4B1.2(1).  We therefore reject Pierce's argument that the district court erred in counting the sexual battery as a predicate conviction for purposes of the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Conspiracy and Career Offender Status</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's final claim, made solely to preserve the issue for further appeal, is that a conspiracy conviction cannot serve as a triggering or predicate offense for purposes of the career offender guideline.  Pierce acknowledges that we recently decided this issue against him, see United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 616-19 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995), and that this panel is duty-bound to follow Piper, see, e.g., Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935, 939 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993) (\"in a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels, generally speaking, are bound by prior decisions on point\").  We therefore reject the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the convictions and sentence of defendant Frederick Alan Pierce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Sec. 846, and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).  After carefully considering Pierce's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1993, pursuant to a prior plan, Pierce and a fellow Maine resident, codefendant David Leland Maddox, drove to Lawrence, Massachusetts, in order to purchase four ounces of cocaine.  Paul Abraham, an acquaintance of Pierce's who was to \"middle\" the deal, informed drug enforcement personnel of the arrangements.  The sale did not go through.  Pierce and Maddox were arrested on Interstate 95 in New Hampshire while returning to Maine.  The arresting officers seized $3,333.50 from Pierce;  they also confiscated drug paraphernalia and a loaded gun from the car.  Maddox subsequently pleaded guilty and became a cooperating witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1993, Pierce was arraigned on a two-count indictment charging him with the crimes of conviction.  On that same day, Magistrate-Judge Beaulieu appointed Gary M. Growe to represent him.  In the ensuing month and a half, problems developed between Growe and Pierce, and, on November 30, 1993, the day before jury selection was to commence, Growe filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.  Pierce joined in the motion.  The government opposed Growe's request, pointing out that Pierce already had been provided with Jencks discovery material and arguing that Pierce might use the material to create problems for potential witnesses.  The district court heard argument on Growe's motion on December 1, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, Growe maintained that a personality conflict was compromising his ability to evaluate objectively certain defense theories proposed by Pierce.  After spending some time inquiring into the particulars of the problem, the court denied the motion.  In so doing, the court described the conflict as \"not so great that it results in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\"   That same day, the court also empaneled the jury for the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 6, 1993, two days before opening statements were scheduled to be delivered, Growe filed a second motion to withdraw.  Again, Pierce joined in the motion.  On December 7, 1993, the district court held a hearing to address the motion.  The essence of Growe's second withdrawal request was that his relationship with Pierce had deteriorated to the point where (1) Pierce was ignoring Growe's advice and talking to the press about the case;  and (2) Pierce believed Growe was wrongfully providing the government with \"vital information.\"   After inquiring for some time into the basis for the second motion, the court denied it.  In so doing, the court pointed out that the case was \"literally on the eve of trial.\"   It also stated:  \"At some point, the Court has to take the position that the whole system just cannot be--come down to its knees because of the inability of the defendant and counsel to agree on--on how their case should be tried.\"   The court did, however, grant Growe's motion to withdraw from representing Pierce in another matter that was scheduled to go to trial the following month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the jury was sworn and trial commenced.  On December 10, 1993, the jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts of the indictment.  On February 25, 1994, Pierce moved for the appointment of new counsel for sentencing, and on March 16, 1994, the court granted the motion, appointing Pierce's present counsel to replace Growe.  Meanwhile, on February 24, 1994, the government filed a complaint seeking civil forfeiture of the $3,333.50 seized from Pierce at the time of his arrest.  See 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a)(6) (subjecting to civil forfeiture \"[m]oneys ... intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance\").  On April 5, 1994, Pierce filed an answer to the complaint.  Subsequently, the government withdrew its claim as to $1,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 20, 1994, Magistrate-Judge Beaulieu held a bench trial on the forfeiture action, and on October 25, 1994, he issued an order of forfeiture in the amount of $2,333.50.  Judgment entered on October 31, 1994.  That same day, Pierce filed a motion to dismiss the criminal case on double jeopardy grounds.  On November 1, 1994, the court orally denied the motion to dismiss and proceeded to sentence Pierce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court first determined that Pierce's base offense level was 18 for the conspiracy conviction.  Relying on a 1984 Florida \"withheld adjudication\" in which Pierce had pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of delivering cannabis, and a 1985 Florida sexual battery conviction, the court then adjusted this level to 32 because it determined that Pierce was a \"career offender\" under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1 (1994) (person who is more than eighteen years old, stands convicted of a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and has two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses is a career offender subject to an upward adjustment of his base offense level).  Because Pierce's criminal history category was VI, see id.  (all career offenders have criminal history categories of VI), the applicable guideline range was 210 to the statutory maximum of 240 months.  The court then sentenced Pierce to 210 months on his conspiracy conviction, and to the mandatory 60 months consecutive sentence on his firearm conviction, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1) (firearm sentence must be consecutive to the underlying sentence), for a total sentence of 270 months' imprisonment.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce makes five arguments on appeal:  (1) the entry of judgment in the civil forfeiture action bars the instant criminal prosecution under the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause;  (2) the denial of the two motions to withdraw constituted an abuse of discretion and led to a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights;  (3) the 1984 Florida withheld adjudication was not a \"conviction\" cognizable under the career offender provisions of the guidelines;  (4) the 1985 Florida sexual battery conviction was not a \"crime of violence\" as that term is defined by the career offender provisions;  and (5) a conspiracy conviction cannot predicate a finding that a defendant is a career offender.  We discuss each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce first contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the government from further pursuing his criminal prosecution once judgment entered in the civil forfeiture action.  In Pierce's view, the civil and criminal actions were separate proceedings arising out of the same criminal acts and instituted by the federal government for penal purposes.  See United States v. $405,089.23 U.S. Currency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677135\"><a href=\"/opinion/677135/united-states-v-40508923-us-currency-charles-arlt-james-wren-payback/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span>, 1216-22 (9th Cir.1994) (Double Jeopardy Clause is violated where the same criminal acts give rise to both a criminal prosecution and a separate, civil forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C.

Besides arguing that we should reject $405,089.23 and adopt the reasoning of Tilley, One Single Family Residence, and Millan, the government responds that the Double Jeopardy Clause, if violated, would bar only the civil forfeiture proceeding, and not Pierce's criminal prosecution.  Because we agree with this last argument, we reject Pierce's double jeopardy challenge without deciding whether the forfeiture action was a separate penal proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In relevant part, the Fifth Amendment states that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   It is well established that this Double Jeopardy Clause protects against both successive punishments and successive prosecutions for the same criminal offense.  E.g., United States v. Dixon, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And even then, it is only the second proceeding that is constitutionally endangered, for the Clause's basic design is \"to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.\"  Green v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105594\"><a href=\"/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 187, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105594\"><a href=\"/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Plainly, he was not.  It is settled that jeopardy attaches in a criminal jury case when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  E.g., Crist, 437 U.S. at 35, 98 S.Ct. at 2160-61.   Pierce's criminal jury was empaneled on December 1, 1993, and sworn on December 8, 1993, several months prior to the inception of the civil forfeiture proceeding.  Thus, any double jeopardy problem arising out of the institution of the civil forfeiture proceeding can only be seen as imperiling that proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce does not challenge any of the legal principles we have set forth;  nor does he dispute that jeopardy first attached in the criminal proceeding.  Instead, he disagrees with our mode of analysis.  Focusing on the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against successive punishments, Pierce contends that the moment of punishment controls, asserting that \"the issue is not so much which jeopardy attaches first as which jeopardy is first complete.\"   Because jeopardy first \"became complete,\" and punishment was first imposed (in the form of the judgment ordering forfeiture) in the civil proceeding, Pierce argues that his sentence in this case is a \"successive punishment\" precluded by the Clause.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's argument that the \"completion\" of jeopardy triggers the Clause's protections completely disregards the fact that the Clause protects against more than just successive punishments;  it also protects against successive prosecutions.  To illustrate, if Pierce's argument were correct, he would not have been entitled to assert the double jeopardy bar in the civil forfeiture action because jeopardy had not yet been \"completed\" in this criminal proceeding.  Patently, however, Pierce was so entitled (presuming, of course, that the forfeiture action was both separate and punitive).  The Supreme Court has made quite clear that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Green, 355 U.S. at 187, 78 S.Ct. at 223.   This sentiment, along with the accused's interest in retaining a chosen jury, has fostered the view that jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is empaneled and sworn.  See Crist, 437 U.S. at 35-36, 98 S.Ct. at 2160-61.   It also has led to the rule that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable.  Abney v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 661-62, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span> (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although he does not say so explicitly, Pierce implies that a criminal defendant should have the right to withhold objection to a forbidden successive prosecution and raise a double jeopardy argument only in the event that the second prosecution leads to a prior and less severe punishment than that meted out in the original case.  Put another way, a defendant ought to have the option to endure an unconstitutional second trial in the hope that it will both conclude first and lead to a more lenient punishment than that eventually imposed in the first trial, and then to object to the punishment imposed in the first trial on double jeopardy grounds.  We cannot locate any authority to support this proposition, and we reject it out of hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause is a shield against the oppression inherent in a duplicative, punitive proceeding;  it is not a tool by which a defendant can avoid the consequences of the proceeding in which jeopardy first attached.  The law of double jeopardy is quite complicated, and often (as here), the question whether a second proceeding violates the Clause is a close one.  Because, under Article III of the Federal Constitution, the question can only be answered in the context of an actual case or controversy, the public has a strong interest in the government being able to institute the second proceeding without risking the first.  After all, the government should not be dissuaded from bringing legitimate penal proceedings, and opposing counsel and the courts (including the appellate courts, see Abney, 431 U.S. at 661-62, 97 S.Ct. at 2041-42) are there to protect the defendant's rights if the government has miscalculated.  This simply is not a situation where the price to society of allowing a defendant to parlay the government's miscalculation into a \"get out of jail free\" card is worth the deterrent effect such a regime might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's theory of completed jeopardy would effectively trade away some of the most valuable protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause for rather dubious gains.  We therefore reject it, and overrule Pierce's double jeopardy challenge to the penalty imposed in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Denial of Motions to Withdraw</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce next asserts that the district court's denial of the two motions to withdraw constituted an abuse of discretion and led to a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.  To the extent that Pierce is taking issue with the adequacy of his representation after the denial of the motions, we think that his fact-specific argument should be more fully developed and presented to the district court in the first instance.  Accordingly, we decline to address it at this time.  See, e.g., United States v. Jadusingh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195129\"><a href=\"/opinion/195129/united-states-v-jadusingh/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1169-70 (1st Cir.1994) (fact-specific ineffective assistance claims ordinarily ought first be presented to the district court in a 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 petition).  We therefore limit our focus to whether, in light of the then-existing circumstances, the court erred in denying the motion.  Cf. United States v. Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471763\"><a href=\"/opinion/471763/united-states-v-gilbert-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 440 (1st Cir.1986) (in evaluating the denial of a motion for a continuance to obtain new counsel, \"we must pay particular attention to 'the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied ' \") (quoting Ungar v.

We detect no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the analogous context of a challenge to a denial of a defendant's motion to substitute counsel, we have stated that we will \"consider several factors, including the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and whether the conflict between the defendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\"  United States v.

Of course, we are aware that the trial court has a superior vantage point for evaluating matters such as these;  we therefore will reverse only if we perceive an abuse of discretion.  See id.   We also are mindful that when, as here, the granting of the defendant's request would almost certainly necessitate a last-minute continuance, the trial judge's actions are entitled to extraordinary deference.  As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Trial judges necessarily require a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials.  Not the least of their problems is that of assembling the witnesses, lawyers, and jurors at the same place at the same time, and this burden counsels against continuances except for compelling reasons.  Consequently, broad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances;  only an unreasoning and arbitrary \"insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\" violates the right to assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morris v. Slappy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110914\"><a href=\"/opinion/110914/morris-v-slappy/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110914\"><a href=\"/opinion/110914/morris-v-slappy/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Taking first the final Allen factor, we note that, while Pierce has adduced proof that his relationship with Growe was beset with problems, he has not established a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.  The record reveals that Growe and Pierce were conversing with one another and had some appreciation for the other's opinions and sensibilities at the time the motions were filed.  We therefore have no basis to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the communication between the counsel and client was sufficient to allow a satisfactory defense.  Cf. Allen, 789 F.2d at 92 (noting the discretion afforded to trial court determinations regarding substitution of counsel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, when presented with the motions, the court held hearings at which it questioned Growe and Pierce at some length regarding the nature of their problems with each other.  We have read the transcripts of these hearings and find the court's inquiries to have been more than adequate.  If there is a relative lack of specificity regarding the exact reasons for the difficulties between Growe and Pierce, it is a result of a lack of elaboration on their part.  It certainly is not a result of insufficient questioning by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the motions were, by any measure, untimely.  Although we appreciate that the docket moves quickly in the District of Maine, the fact remains that Growe waited until the day before empanelment before notifying the court that there was a problem.  More importantly, a quick docket does not alleviate the logistical problems engendered by a last-minute continuance.  See Morris, 461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616-17.   Nor can it allay the legitimate concerns about witness intimidation the government may have when a criminal defendant is in possession of Jencks material well before the inception of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, because the circumstances here were not sufficiently compelling, the district court acted well within its discretion in declining to bring the proceedings to a halt on the eve of trial.  We therefore reject Pierce's argument that the district court committed reversible error in denying the two motions to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The 1984 Florida Withheld Adjudication</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce argues that the district court erred in concluding that the 1984 Florida withheld adjudication in which he had pleaded nolo contendere to delivering cannabis constitutes a cognizable predicate conviction for purposes of the relevant \"career offender\" guideline.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1.  In Pierce's view, a withheld adjudication simply cannot be regarded as a \"conviction\" under this guideline because the term \"conviction\" necessarily implies the entry of a final adjudicatory judgment.  A careful reading of relevant guideline language and commentary persuades us that Pierce's argument is incorrect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there is surface appeal to the argument that there can be no \"conviction\" unless and until a final adjudicatory judgment is entered, the sentencing guidelines clearly construe the term differently.  Section 4B1.2(3), which defines the terms used in Sec. 4B1.1, states:  \"The date that a defendant has sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\"  (emphasis supplied).  Thus, there is a textual basis in the career offender guidelines for concluding that a guilt-establishing event (such as a plea where a defendant states that he does not wish to contest the charges), and not the formal entry of an adjudicatory judgment, determines whether and when there has been a countable \"conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This view is borne out by the relevant guideline commentary.  Application note 4 to Sec. 4B1.2 directs the sentencing court to utilize the provisions of Sec. 4A1.2 (captioned \"Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History\") in \"the counting of convictions under Sec. 4B1.1.\"   Two provisions of Sec. 4A1.2 compel the conclusion that withheld adjudications following pleas of nolo contendere are countable convictions under Sec. 4B1.2.  First, Sec. 4A1.2(a)(4) drives home the point that there can be a \"conviction\" prior to, and therefore without, the formal entry of an adjudicatory judgment:  \" 'Convicted of an offense' for purposes of this provision, means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\"   And Sec. 4A1.2(f), which governs diversionary dispositions like withheld adjudications, is quite clear that admissions of guilt (or pleas formally declining to contest guilt), rather than formal entries of judgment, control countability:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>Diversion from the judicial process without a finding of guilt (e.g., deferred prosecution) is not counted [as a prior sentence].  A diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under Sec. 4A1.1(c) [of the criminal history guidelines] even if a conviction is not formally entered, except that diversion from juvenile court is not counted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application note corresponding to the provision is explanatory of its purposes:  \"Section 4A1.2(f) requires counting prior adult diversionary dispositions if they involved a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt in open court.  This reflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.\"  Sec.  4A1.2, comment.  (n. 9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employing an extremely literal reading, Pierce suggests that these guideline provisions are relevant only to the \"counting\" of convictions, and that they have no bearing on whether a particular event should be \"defined\" as a conviction.  The difference between \"counting\" and \"defining\" convictions in this context is, however, only semantic.  Section 4B1.1 directs that \"convictions\" of a certain type be counted, and other guidelines and commentary which elaborate upon the events to be counted essentially define that which is a conviction.  In other words, the sentencing court is to \"count\" whatever is \"defined\" as a conviction (so long as it is for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Secs. 4A1.2(a)(4) and (f) are applied to the question presented (as Sec. 4B1.2, comment.  (n. 4) dictates), it becomes clear that the diversionary disposition at issue here--the 1984 Florida withheld adjudication--should be counted as a conviction under Sec. 4B1.1.  See United States v. Jones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546194\"><a href=\"/opinion/546194/united-states-v-eddie-l-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 761 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam ) (withheld adjudication following a nolo contendere plea constitutes a conviction for career offender status).  We therefore reject Pierce's argument that the district court erred in counting the withheld adjudication as a predicate conviction for purposes of the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The 1985 Florida Sexual Battery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's fourth argument is that the district court erred in deciding that his 1985 Florida conviction for sexual battery is a \"crime of violence\" and therefore a cognizable predicate conviction for purposes of Sec. 4B1.1.  Central to his argument is an assertion that the statute defining the offense for which he was convicted, Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 794.011(5), does not, inter alia, have as an element \"the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"   See Sec. 4B1.2(1) (defining phrase \"crime of violence\" for purposes of Sec. 4B1.1).  Regardless of whether Pierce is correct about the current version of the statute (a matter on which we express no opinion), a plain reading of the statute under which Pierce was convicted reveals that, in 1985, the use of force was an element of the offense.  See Fla.Stat.Ann. Sec. 794.011(5) (West 1984) (\"A person who commits sexual battery upon a person 12 years of age or older, without that person's consent, and in the process thereof uses physical force and violence not likely to cause serious personal injury is guilty of a felony....\") (emphasis supplied).  And because the statutory formulation of the predicate crime, and not the actual facts of the case itself, dictates whether the offense is a crime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines, see United States v. DeLuca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195223\"><a href=\"/opinion/195223/united-states-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994), our inquiry is at an end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1985 Florida sexual battery was a crime of violence under Sec. 4B1.2(1).  We therefore reject Pierce's argument that the district court erred in counting the sexual battery as a predicate conviction for purposes of the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Conspiracy and Career Offender Status</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pierce's final claim, made solely to preserve the issue for further appeal, is that a conspiracy conviction cannot serve as a triggering or predicate offense for purposes of the career offender guideline.  Pierce acknowledges that we recently decided this issue against him, see United States v. Piper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195585\"><a href=\"/opinion/195585/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 616-19 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
