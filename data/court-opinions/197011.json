We  have  reviewed de  novo  the district\r                                                           \r\n\ncourt's  grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff-\r\n\nappellee.   We conclude  that that determination  was correct\r\n\nand  see no need to write separately.  We, therefore, affirm,\r                                                                        \r\n\nessentially for  the reasons  stated in the  district court's\r\n\nmemorandum and order, dated  April 8, 1996.  We add  only the\r\n\nfollowing comments.\r\n\n     At page  6  of its  memorandum and  order, the  district\r\n\ncourt made  a  slip of  the  pen.   In reciting  the  summary\r\n\njudgment standard, the  court stated  that it  must view  the\r\n\nentire record in the light most favorable to the \"plaintiffs\"\r\n\nand indulge  all reasonable  inferences in  their favor.   In\r\n\nthis case, the  government was the  plaintiff and the  moving\r\n\nparty.  Obviously, the  district court meant to refer  to the\r\n\n\"defendants\",  as the non-moving party.  It is clear from the\r\n\nnext  paragraph and  the remainder  of the  opinion  that the\r\n\ndistrict court understood the  relative burdens of the moving\r\n\nand  non-moving parties, understood which party carried which\r\n\nburden  in  this  case,  and applied  the  correct  standard.\r\n\nContrary to the  appellants' attempt to create an  issue that\r\n\ndoes not  exist, the  district court  did not  \"reverse[] the\r\n\nrule for inferences.\"  Brief at p. 35.\r\n\n     In addition,  we note  that the government  has conceded\r\n\nthat, because  it has already applied  the appellants' income\r\n\ntax  overpayments  for the  tax years  1991  and 1992  to the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nbalance  it  claimed that  appellants owed  for the  tax year\r\n\n1987, the amount of  these overpayments was properly credited\r\n\nto the amount owed by the taxpayers.\r\n\n     Appellants' request  for oral  argument is denied.   The\r                                                                  \r\n\nalternate  request that  we accept  supplemental  material in\r\n\nlieu  of oral argument is denied.   The supplemental material\r                                            \r\n\nshould  have been  included  within the  permitted number  of\r\n\npages in the  reply brief.   In any  event, we have  reviewed\r\n\nthis  supplemental  material  and  it  does  not  change  our\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n     The \"emergency motion\" is denied as moot.\r                                                         \r\n\n     Affirmed.
