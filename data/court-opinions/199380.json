McCloskey, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\f                        April 17, 2001\n\n         LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Kieu Minh Nguyen was convicted\n\nof violating the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, by conspiring to\n\nobstruct commerce by means of robbery, as well as by aiding\n\nand abetting that crime.1    He appeals his conviction and\n\nsentence of 109 months imprisonment.        We affirm.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n         We review the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the verdict.\n\n         Between February and May 1998, Nguyen worked for\n\nNail Time, a nail salon in Portland, Maine.       While employed\n\nthere, he lived at the home of the shop's owner, Monica Tran.\n\n         Nail Time was strictly a cash business with gross\n\nreceipts of $800 to $1,000 a day.      The shop was small, such\n\nthat at the end of every workday employees could see Monica\n\nput the day's receipts into a purse and walk home with it.\n\nMoreover, because Nguyen was living at Monica's apartment, he\n\n\n\n\n    1\n          Nguyen was acquitted on a second count charging that\nhe had used and carried a firearm in relation to a crime of\nviolence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n                                 -2-\n\fwas able to see Monica store the purse in a closet when she\n\narrived home.\n\n           Eventually, personal problems developed between\n\nMonica and Nguyen, resulting in the termination of his\n\nemployment at Nail Time.   Nguyen then moved to North Carolina.\n\n           In June 1998, Nguyen had a group of people stay at\n\nhis home for several nights; among them were four individuals,\n\nnamed Cong, Thong, Nam, and Quyen.    Nguyen told the group\n\nabout Monica and how she kept her business earnings in a black\n\nbag stored in her apartment closet.   Nguyen recruited the four\n\nto go to Maine and steal the contents of the bag.   He had\n\nsomeone give the group directions to Monica's apartment and\n\ngave Nam a key to the front door of the apartment building.\n\nNguyen also gave the group $300 to cover traveling expenses.\n\nDuring this planning period, Nguyen observed Cong with a\n\nhandgun.\n\n           On June 23, 1998, the four men sent by Nguyen burst\n\ninto Monica's apartment; one of them, Cong, was armed.   The\n\nfour bound and gagged Monica's two young daughters, who were\n\nalone inside, and ransacked the apartment in search of the\n\nblack bag containing the earnings of Nail Time.   Unable to\n\n                               -3-\n\ffind the bag, the robbers left with personal belongings -- a\n\nstereo and some jewelry.     The four returned to North Carolina\n\nwithin several days of the robbery and stayed overnight with\n\nNguyen.\n\n                 II.    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Nguyen argues that the evidence at trial was\n\ninsufficient to support a Hobbs Act conviction in two\n\nrespects.    First, he argues that there was insufficient\n\nevidence of any interstate commerce nexus.     Second, he argues\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence that he conspired to\n\ncommit robbery, as opposed to the lesser offense of theft.\n\nA.   Commerce\n\n            The Hobbs Act prohibits robbery or conspiracy to rob\n\nwhere such crime \"in any way or degree, obstructs, delays, or\n\naffects commerce.\"     18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).   Nguyen concedes, as\n\nhe must, that if a robbery even minimally depletes the assets\n\nof an entity doing business in interstate commerce, like Nail\n\nTime,2 then that suffices to meet the Hobbs Act's interstate\n\ncommerce element.      See, e.g., United States v. DiGregorio, 605\n\n\n     2    The evidence showed that Nail Time ordered                a\nsubstantial proportion of its products from out of state.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fF.2d 1184, 1190-91 (1st Cir. 1979).    But he makes two attempts\n\nto distinguish that principle from this case.\n\n           First, he argues that, although the conspirators had\n\nhoped to steal the earnings of Nail Time stored in Monica's\n\npurse, the only articles they actually stole were a stereo and\n\njewelry.   But this distinction is of no avail in the context\n\nof a conspiracy charge.   All that matters is that Nguyen\n\nentered a conspiracy whose objective was to steal the assets\n\nof an entity in interstate commerce.   That the conspiracy\n\nfailed to accomplish such objective is irrelevant.   E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. DiCarlantonio, 870 F.2d 1058, 1061 (6th Cir.\n\n1989); United States v. Brantley, 777 F.2d 159, 162 (4th Cir.\n\n1985).\n\n           Second, Nguyen argues that the conspirators did not\n\nnecessarily know whether the money in the black bag they\n\nplanned to steal constituted Nail Time's operating cash (used\n\nby the business to purchase items in interstate commerce) or\n\nmerely Monica's take-home profits.    But the interstate\n\ncommerce element does not turn on such accounting niceties.\n\nCf., e.g., United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 293-94 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (considering it inconsequential, in Hobbs Act\n\n                               -5-\n\fextortion case, that extorted funds came from business owner's\n\npersonal funds rather than from corporate funds, because jury\n\ncould infer that depletion of former ultimately effects a\n\ndepletion of latter) (citing DiGregorio, 605 F.2d at 1191-92).\n\nThe evidence need only support a \"realistic probability\" that\n\nthe contemplated robbery would have \"some slight impact\" on\n\ninterstate commerce.   Id. at 293.    Such probability is easily\n\nestablished here, as the evidence clearly shows that the\n\nconspirators planned to steal the earnings of a business in\n\ninterstate commerce.   Proof beyond that, e.g., that the\n\nprecise funds stolen were certain to be used in future\n\nbusiness purchases, is not required.\n\nB. Robbery\n\n         As defined in the Hobbs Act, \"[t]he term 'robbery'\n\nmeans the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property .\n\n. . in the presence of another, against his will, by means of\n\nactual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(1).    Nguyen does not contest that his co-\n\nconspirators committed robbery.      Rather, he argues that it was\n\nnot foreseeable to him that they would commit robbery as\n\nopposed to simple theft.        But the evidence was not\n\n                               -6-\n\finsufficient on this point.    Nguyen knowingly dispatched his\n\nco-conspirators to break into Monica's home and steal her\n\nblack bag.   He knew that at least one member of this\n\nunwholesome crew carried a gun.      He also knew, from living\n\nwith Monica, that her apartment was frequently occupied by\n\nfamily members and house guests.     Indeed, Monica specifically\n\ntestified that she rarely would leave her black bag at the\n\napartment when it was not occupied; rather, she would only\n\nleave it at home if her mother was there to look after it.\n\nFurther, there was evidence that one of Nguyen's motives in\n\nforming the conspiracy was to follow through on a grudge he\n\nheld against Monica's brother, Kevin, who lived in the\n\napartment: Nguyen stated, in reference to the planned crime,\n\nthat Kevin would \"get what is coming to him\";3 and the robbers\n\nspecifically asked for Kevin on entering the apartment.     On\n\nthese facts, a jury could easily find that robbery was a\n\nforeseeable outcome of the conspiracy.\n\n                        III.   Sentencing\n\n\n    3\n       Nguyen's suggestion that this statement was intended to\nmean only that \"Kevin's life could be beset by bad karma as a\nresult of some evil deed attributed to him\" is inventive, but is\nhardly the only conclusion a rational jury could reach.\n\n                               -7-\n\f           Nguyen also appeals his sentence, specifically the\n\nfive-level increase the district court imposed under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) on the ground that a firearm was possessed\n\nduring the commission of the robbery.   He appeals on two\n\ngrounds.\n\n           First, Nguyen argues that the court committed clear\n\nerror in finding that Nguyen should have foreseen that a co-\n\nconspirator would carry a firearm in the course of the\n\nrobbery.   See United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34 F.3d 33,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying clear error review to similar\n\nclaim).    The district court erred, Nguyen contends, by relying\n\non testimony struck during trial for lack of foundation.\n\n           But this contention is wholly inaccurate.   The\n\ndistrict court relied on the testimony of Cong, who testified\n\nboth that Nguyen saw him with a firearm while he was at\n\nNguyen's house as the robbery was being planned, and also that\n\nhe thought Nguyen knew that he would take the firearm with him\n\nto use in the robbery.   Only the latter testimony was struck\n\nfor lack of foundation during trial, and it was only the\n\nformer testimony that the district court relied on in imposing\n\nthe firearm enhancement.   In ruling on the issue, the court\n\n                               -8-\n\fnoted that all that mattered was whether Nguyen should have\n\nforeseen (rather than whether he knew) that a firearm would be\n\npossessed during the offense,4 and it concluded that:\n\n          the testimony of Cong was clear that he saw, he, the\n          defendant, saw Cong with the weapon in advance and\n          therefore . . . it was certainly foreseeable that\n          Cong would be in possession of the firearm during\n          the offense.\n\nThus the district court did not commit the error alleged by\n\nNguyen.\n\n          Second, Nguyen argues that under Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the facts underlying a potential\n\nsentencing enhancement should have been pled in the\n\nindictment.   We decline to rule on whether Apprendi requires\n\nsuch facts to be pled in the indictment, for Apprendi does not\n\napply here in any event, as Nguyen's sentence did not exceed\n\nthe 20-year statutory maximum.   See United States v. Robinson,\n\n241 F.3d 115, 120-22 (1st Cir. 2001) (Apprendi applies only\n\n\n    4     U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) provides for a five-level\nenhancement \"if a firearm was brandished, displayed, or\npossessed\" during the offense.      U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B)\nfurther provides that in a conspiracy case, specific offense\ncharacteristics such as this are determined not only on the\nbasis of the defendant's own conduct, but also on the basis of\n\"all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in\nfurtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\"\n\n                              -9-\n\fwhere defendant's actual sentence exceeds default statutory\n\nmaximum).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f",

Sentencing\n\n\n    3\n       Nguyen's suggestion that this statement was intended to\nmean only that \"Kevin's life could be beset by bad karma as a\nresult of some evil deed attributed to him\" is inventive, but is\nhardly the only conclusion a rational jury could reach.\n\n                               -7-\n\f           Nguyen also appeals his sentence, specifically the\n\nfive-level increase the district court imposed under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) on the ground that a firearm was possessed\n\nduring the commission of the robbery.   He appeals on two\n\ngrounds.\n\n           First, Nguyen argues that the court committed clear\n\nerror in finding that Nguyen should have foreseen that a co-\n\nconspirator would carry a firearm in the course of the\n\nrobbery.   See United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195598\"><a href=\"/opinion/195598/united-states-v-carrillo-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying clear error review to similar\n\nclaim).    The district court erred, Nguyen contends, by relying\n\non testimony struck during trial for lack of foundation.\n\n           But this contention is wholly inaccurate.   The\n\ndistrict court relied on the testimony of Cong, who testified\n\nboth that Nguyen saw him with a firearm while he was at\n\nNguyen's house as the robbery was being planned, and also that\n\nhe thought Nguyen knew that he would take the firearm with him\n\nto use in the robbery.   Only the latter testimony was struck\n\nfor lack of foundation during trial, and it was only the\n\nformer testimony that the district court relied on in imposing\n\nthe firearm enhancement.   In ruling on the issue, the court\n\n                               -8-\n\fnoted that all that mattered was whether Nguyen should have\n\nforeseen (rather than whether he knew) that a firearm would be\n\npossessed during the offense,4 and it concluded that:\n\n          the testimony of Cong was clear that he saw, he, the\n          defendant, saw Cong with the weapon in advance and\n          therefore . . . it was certainly foreseeable that\n          Cong would be in possession of the firearm during\n          the offense.\n\nThus the district court did not commit the error alleged by\n\nNguyen.\n\n          Second, Nguyen argues that under Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), the facts underlying a potential\n\nsentencing enhancement should have been pled in the\n\nindictment.   We decline to rule on whether Apprendi requires\n\nsuch facts to be pled in the indictment, for Apprendi does not\n\napply here in any event, as Nguyen's sentence did not exceed\n\nthe 20-year statutory maximum.

Robinson,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199304\"><a href=\"/opinion/199304/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120-22 (1st Cir. 2001) (Apprendi applies only\n\n\n    4     U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) provides for a five-level\nenhancement \"if a firearm was brandished, displayed, or\npossessed\" during the offense.
