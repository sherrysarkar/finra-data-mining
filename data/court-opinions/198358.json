Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Alfonso Cardona Arrendondo on brief pro se.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernandez,\r\nChief, Civil Division, and Jacqueline D. Novas, Assistant United\r\nStates Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMARCH 4, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Claimant Cardona-Arredondo appeals from\r\nthe denial of his motion to reconsider or amend the judgment to\r\ninclude an award of interest.  Below, the government had argued\r\nthat interest was not recoverable in this case under the\r\ngoverning caselaw; but in this court the government concedes\r\nthat the relevant caselaw does not bar an award of interest.\r\n          Instead, the government argues here that the denial\r\nof interest should be affirmed because, (1) claimant's motion\r\nto reconsider or amend the judgment was untimely, or (2)\r\nclaimant is estopped from demanding interest by the doctrine of\r\n\"accord and satisfaction.\"\r\n          Having carefully reviewed the briefs in light of the\r\nentire record on appeal, we reject the government's arguments. \r\nFirst, the doctrine of \"accord and satisfaction\" is inapposite\r\nto the facts of this case.  Second, the motion for\r\nreconsideration or to amend the judgment was timely filed.  The\r\nten-day time for the filing of the motion ran from entry of the\r\ncourt's judgment on February 25, 1998.  It did not run from \r\nthe June 10, 1997 entry of the order dismissing the\r\ngovernment's claim on limitations grounds, as the government\r\ncontends.  The June 10, 1997, judgment was not \"final\" because\r\nit did not resolve all issues still pending between the\r\nparties.  \r\n          Since the government has conceded the only legal\r\nissue raised in this appeal, and argues no supportable\r\nalternative basis for an affirmance, the order denying an award\r\n                              -2-\r\nof interest is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\r\ndistrict court for a determination of the amount of interest\r\nowed to the claimant.\r\n          Vacated and remanded for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this decision. \n",
