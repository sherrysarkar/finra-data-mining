Meade,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per Curiam.   We have  reviewed the record  and the\r                                \r\r\n\nparties'  briefs  and  affirm  the dismissal  of  the  habeas\r\n\npetition, filed pursuant  to 28 U.S.C.   2254,  of petitioner\r\n\nDavid L. Wells.  We rely essentially on the reasons set forth\r\n\nin the district court's  Memorandum and Order.  See  Wells v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMarshall,  885 F.Supp.  314  (D. Mass.  1995).   We  add  the\r                    \r\n\nfollowing comments.\r\n\n          1.  Petitioner is not excused from exhausting state\r\n\nremedies  merely because he  claims that his  state trial was\r\n\nunconstitutional  and   that  the  allegedly   altered  trial\r\n\ntranscript prevents  him from challenging  his conviction  in\r\n\nany  state proceeding.  A  new superior court  judge has been\r\n\nassigned  to   petitioner's  motion  for  a   new  trial  and\r\n\npetitioner  has  presented  no  evidence  that  he  has  been\r\n\nthwarted in  proceeding before  this judge.   Indeed,  at the\r\n\nApril 26, 1995 hearing, the judge stated that he was ready to\r\n\nhear petitioner's claims and, when petitioner  indicated that\r\n\nhe would rather proceed in federal court,  left to petitioner\r\n\nthe  decision when to reactivate  the state action.   In this\r\n\nsituation,  it  hardly  can  be  said that  resort  to  state\r\n\nremedies would be futile.   See Gagne v. Fair, 835 F.2d  6, 9\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st  Cir.   1987)  (unless  the  state   remedy  is  clearly\r\n\ndeficient,  resort to  the state process  will not  be deemed\r\n\nfutile).  Comity  therefore mandates that the  state be given\r\n\nthe first  opportunity to rule  on petitioner's claims.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid.;  Layne v. Gunter, 559  F.2d 850, 851-52  (1st Cir. 1977)\r                                 \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n(where the state process was \"revived\" after petitioner filed\r\n\na  federal  habeas  petition  and  therefore   currently  was\r\n\navailable  to  him,  exhaustion   of  the  state  process  is\r\n\nappropriate), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1038 (1978).\r                                      \r\n\n          2.    We do  not  see  what relevance  the  problem\r\n\npetitioner  is  experiencing  with  his  vision  has  to  the\r\n\nexhaustion question.  That is, petitioner would face the same\r\n\ndifficulties no  matter  in which  court  he proceeded.    If\r\n\npetitioner  requires  accommodations   --  such  as  extended\r\n\ndeadlines for the filing of pleadings -- he can ask the state\r\n\ncourt for such adjustments.\r\n\n          3.  In  closing, we remind petitioner  that he must\r\n\npresent  to the  state court  all the  grounds for  relief he\r\n\nintends to raise  in the federal court.  See  Gagne, 835 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 7 (in order to meet the exhaustion requirement, petitioner\r\n\n\"must  have fairly  presented  the substance  of his  federal\r\n\nhabeas  claim  to  the  state court  before  seeking  federal\r\n\nreview\").\r\n\n          Affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
