William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Jennifer A. Appleyard on brief for appellant.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Patrick M.\r\nHamilton, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\r\nDisposition for appellee.\r\n\nMay 7, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Defendant appeals a sentence imposed\r\nupon his guilty plea to a five count indictment charging him\r\nwith conspiracy and attempt to possess cocaine with intent to\r\ndistribute the drug.  He claims that the court erred in\r\nimposing a two level role-in-the-offense increase under USSG \r\n3B1.1(c), and a two level increase for obstruction of justice\r\nunder USSG  3C1.1.  The government has moved for a summary\r\naffirmance.\r\n          Defendant did not object at sentencing to the\r\nenhancement under  3B1.1(c), despite notice that it was\r\nrecommended in the probation services report (\"PSR\"), and the\r\ncourt's announced intention to impose it, so our review is for\r\n\"plain error.\"  See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\r\n(1993).  There was no plain error. \r\n          The PSR contained detailed, clear and uncontradicted\r\nevidence that during one of the charged transactions defendant\r\n\"superintend[ed] the activities of\" at least one other person, \r\nhis pregnant teenage girlfriend.  United States v. Cruz, 120\r\nF.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct.\r\n729 (1998).  This transaction was specifically referenced in\r\nthe PSR's recommendation, and the supporting proof was\r\nsufficiently weighty to trigger the enhancement.  See id.; see\r\nalso United States v. Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 359 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n(holding that a court may accept the PSR facts as true and\r\naccurate in the absence of objection).  Any failure by the\r\ncourt to expressly intone its adoption-by-reference of the\r\nPSR's facts had no affect on defendant's \"substantial rights,\"\r\nsince the record on which the increase is based \"speaks\r\neloquently for itself.\"  United States v. Akitoy, 923 F.2d 221,\r\n229 (1st Cir. 1991).     \r\n          We also apprehend no \"clear error\" in the decision to\r\nimpose the mandatory two point increase under USSG 3C1.1,\r\nsince defendant admittedly provided the pretrial services\r\nofficer and the magistrate with a false name, false address and\r\nfalse information about his place of birth and next of kin.\r\nDefendant's argument that an \"actual\" obstruction of justice\r\nwas prevented by his attorney's later disclosure of the truth,\r\nis beside the point, as the sentencing judge held.  See United\r\nStates v. Restrepo, 53 F.3d 396 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\n          Defendant's fallback position that his falsehoods \r\nultimately did not affect, or were not \"material\" to the\r\n\"sentencing decision,\" also is beside the point.  The\r\nfalsehoods were material to the \"issue under determination\"\r\nwhen defendant uttered them.  See USSG  3C1.1 comment, n.5\r\n(providing that a statement is \"material\" if it may influence\r\nthe issue \"under determination\").  Contrary to defendant's\r\nargument, too, the hearing transcript shows that the court made\r\nthe necessary \"findings\" to support the enhancement.   \r\n          The government's motion for summary disposition is\r\ngranted.  The judgment is affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
