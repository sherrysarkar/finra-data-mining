KLONOSKI, M.D., ET AL.,\r\n\n                Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n             BENJAMIN MAHLAB, M.D., ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n    [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n            Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJoan A. Lukey, with whom Hale and Dorr LLP, Michael G.\r\nBongiorno, and John T. Gutkoski were on brief for appellants.\r\nRonald L. Snow, with whom Orr &amp; Reno, P.A., James P. Bassett,\r\nand Cordell A. Johnston were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 23, 1998\r\n\n                             BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal from a\r\njury verdict of no liability in a medical malpractice case. \r\nPlaintiff-appellant is Richard K. Klonoski, M.D., who brought suit\r\non his own behalf for loss of consortium, as administrator of the\r\nestate of his wife Jolanta, and on behalf of their three children. \r\nDefendants-appellees are Benjamin Mahlab, M.D., Mary Hitchcock\r\nMemorial Hospital, Inc., and Hitchcock Clinic, Inc.\r\nWe address only one of the three issues raised by\r\nappellant because it is dispositive.  On the thirteenth day of\r\ntrial during cross-examination of Dr. Klonoski, the last witness in\r\nplaintiff's case, defendants disclosed for the first time and used\r\nletters written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister in Poland.  Excerpts\r\nfrom the letters were allowed in evidence.  Neither Dr. Klonoski\r\nnor his attorneys knew of the existence of the letters prior to\r\nthis time, despite a court order requiring disclosure of such\r\ninformation prior to trial.  We find that this constituted trial by\r\nambush.  We vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial.\r\n                           I.\r\n                       BACKGROUND\r\n\nJolanta Klonoski and her husband, Dr. Klonoski, were the\r\nparents of two children:  Brian, born in Poland, and Karina, born\r\nin the United States.  Dr. Klonoski was born and raised in\r\nConnecticut.  He received his medical training in Poland where he\r\nmet and married his wife.  After he finished his medical training,\r\nhe, his wife, and their son, Brian, moved to the United States. \r\nMrs. Klonoski became pregnant with their third child in September\r\nor October of 1992.  At that time Dr. Klonoski was employed by Mary \r\nHitchcock Memorial Hospital as a cardiologist.  On Saturday, May 8,\r\n1993, at approximately 11:15 a.m., Mrs. Klonoski went to the\r\nBirthing Pavilion of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center because\r\nof vaginal spotting.  She was sent home in the afternoon.  Mrs.\r\nKlonoski returned to the Birthing Pavilion that night about 9:00\r\np.m. complaining of severe epigastric pain.  She remained in the\r\nhospital until her death on Monday, May 10, of a massive cerebral\r\nhemorrhage.  Prior to Mrs. Klonoski's death she was delivered of a\r\nhealthy baby girl, subsequently named Caroline.  \r\nDr. Klonoski was in San Diego at a medical meeting of\r\ncardiologists on Saturday, May 8.  He was notified late Saturday of\r\nhis wife's admission to the hospital.  He flew home on Sunday,\r\narriving at the hospital late in the day.  His wife was comatose\r\nand did not recognize him.  After conducting his own investigation\r\ninto the cause of his wife's death, Dr. Klonoski consulted with an\r\nobstetrician in Connecticut and then brought suit.\r\n                   PRETRIAL DISCOVERY\r\nAs is usual in a well prepared medical malpractice case,\r\nboth sides engaged in extensive pretrial discovery and, as is also\r\nusual, the parties squabbled about what information should or\r\nshould not be disclosed.  Over a year prior to trial, plaintiff\r\ndisclosed, as part of the discovery process, the address in Poland\r\nwhere Mrs. Klonoski's father and sister lived, the address to which\r\nher letters (the evidence in dispute) were sent.\r\nThe district court issued a nineteen-page discovery order\r\non July 19, 1996, covering disputes between the parties.  In part\r\nof its order, the court stated: \r\ndefendants shall produce a list of all persons\r\nknown by them to possess discoverable\r\ninformation related to:  (1) marital discord\r\nbetween Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski; and (2) the\r\npaternity of Dr. Klonoski's youngest daughter. \r\nTo the extent defendants can more persuasively\r\nsupport their assertion that such a list (or\r\nthe names of particular people which would\r\notherwise appear on such a list) is protected\r\nby the work product doctrine (i.e., with\r\nreferences to precedent and/or scholarly\r\nwritings on the subject), they shall provide\r\nplaintiffs with a privilege log as\r\ncontemplated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5) and a\r\nlist of cases and/or scholarly writings which\r\nspecifically support their claim of privilege. \r\nPlaintiffs will, of course, then be free to\r\nfile an appropriate motion to compel. \r\n\nIn its conclusion the court ordered:\r\nDefendants shall produce a list of the names\r\nof individuals having knowledge of\r\ndiscoverable information relating to the\r\nissues of marital discord and paternity and a\r\ngeneral description of the nature of that\r\ninformation on or before August 14, 1996.  To\r\nthe extent that defendants are able, in good\r\nfaith, to legally support an assertion of\r\nprivilege with regard to some or all of those\r\nnames, they shall produce a privilege log as\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\nA final pretrial order was issued on December 19, 1996. \r\nIt provided that a jury would be drawn on January 7, 1997, and the\r\npresentation of evidence would commence on January 13.  The order\r\nnoted that both parties had submitted requests for jury\r\ninstructions.  After noting that some motions in limine had been\r\nfiled, the court gave the parties until December 31, 1996 to file\r\nadditional motions in limine, with objections to be filed not later\r\nthan January 10, 1997.  Exhibits were to be premarked and\r\nsubmitted, along with any objections, not later than January 7,\r\n1997.  Defendants were ordered to \"disclose all documents ordered\r\ndisclosed after close of business on December 27, 1996, forthwith\r\n[sic].\" \r\nThe penultimate paragraph stated in pertinent part:  \r\n     All counsel and the court anticipate\r\nconducting a brief Daubert hearing prior to\r\nthe testimony of plaintiffs' psychological\r\nexpert, who is expected to testify as to the\r\nloss of enjoyment of life, or hedonic damage,\r\naspect of the estate's wrongful death claim. \r\nThe court expects that that hearing will be\r\nheld at some point during the first week of\r\ntrial as is convenient to counsel, and the\r\nparties agree that one hour should be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\nThe order also required a \"final will-call witness list.\"  The\r\nfinal paragraph exhorted the parties to try to settle the case.  It\r\nwould appear from the order that all discovery had been completed\r\nand the case was ready for trial.\r\n           DIRECT EXAMINATION OF DR. KLONOSKI\r\nWe next set forth the pertinent parts of Dr. Klonoski's\r\ntestimony.\r\nAfter moving from Poland to the United States, Mrs.\r\nKlonoski wrote frequently to her family in Poland and sent packages\r\nto them.  Her father visited her and Dr. Klonoski, and stayed for\r\nsix months.  She was quite happy when he was there, but felt lonely\r\nwhen he went back to Poland.  Dr. Klonoski was working long hours\r\nat the hospital in Connecticut where he was training. \r\nConsequently, he was not spending much time at home with his\r\nfamily.  His wife complained about the long hours he had to spend\r\nat the hospital.  Mrs. Klonoski was thirty-five years of age.  She\r\ndid not have a driver's license and was \"house-bound\" with their\r\ntwo small children. \r\nIn early 1990 there was a period of stress in the\r\nmarriage.  Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski \"had some strong discussions.\" \r\n\"[T]here was a lot of stress between us.\"  The problem was that\r\nMrs. Klonoski wanted her husband to spend more time at home with\r\nthe family.  He could not accommodate her because he was in the\r\nresidency program at the hospital which required that he spend a\r\ngreat deal of time there.\r\nDr. Klonoski became angry at his wife and filed for\r\ndivorce.  The divorce proceedings remained pending for four or five\r\nweeks.  The couple did not stop living together during this period. \r\nThere was more stress in the house, \"but everything typically went\r\non.\"  At the end of the five-week period Dr. Klonoski and his wife\r\ntalked things out and decided that they did not want a divorce, so\r\nthe divorce proceeding was dropped.  In May of every year, Dr.\r\nKlonoski gave his wife one rose for each year that had passed since\r\ntheir first meeting in Poland.  In May of 1990 the doctor followed\r\nthis ritual.\r\nThings eventually changed \"tremendously\" for the better. \r\nDr. Klonoski completed his residency program in June of 1990 and he\r\nwent on to a sub-specialty program.  This enabled him to spend more\r\ntime with his family.  Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant in June of\r\n1990.\r\nDr. Klonoski had been accepted into the cardiology\r\nprogram at the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital and the Hitchcock\r\nClinic in 1989.  The family moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, in\r\nJune of 1990.  Mrs. Klonoski was excited about the move.  It was \"a\r\nnew stage in [their] lives.\"  When the Klonoskis relocated to\r\nLebanon, Mrs. Klonoski was pregnant, their oldest child, Brian, was\r\nsix, and their daughter Karina was three.  A short time later, in\r\nJuly 1990, Mrs. Klonoski had a miscarriage.  She was treated by\r\ndoctors at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic.\r\nMrs. Klonoski could not reconcile herself to the fact\r\nthat her husband had to work harder than Polish doctors.  She did\r\nnot like his going to medical conferences because he was away from\r\nthe family too much.  Outside of this, things were \"going great\"\r\nbetween Dr. Klonoski and his wife.  She \"blossomed\" and became very\r\nself-confident and self-reliant.  She obtained a driver's license\r\njust before she left Connecticut for New Hampshire.  This helped a\r\nlot because she could go places with the children and do things.\r\nIn October of 1990 she obtained a job as a bank teller. \r\nShe also attended Lebanon College.  After she had been there a\r\ntime, she was offered a position teaching Polish but refused\r\nbecause she did not want to take too much time away from the\r\nfamily.  She was devoted to the children.\r\nMrs. Klonoski became pregnant again in the fall of 1991. \r\nShe suffered another miscarriage.  Both spouses were devastated. \r\nRoutine testing was advised and Dr. Klonoski encouraged his wife to\r\ntake the tests.  She did not, however, take all of the tests.\r\nGenerally speaking, Mrs. Klonoski was healthy.  She exercised by\r\ndoing calisthenics and running.\r\nMrs. Klonoski made a lot of friends in Lebanon.  She was\r\nebullient, very outgoing, very effervescent.  Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski\r\nsocialized occasionally, but were not party people.  They preferred\r\nto spend their leisure time together as a family.\r\nMrs. Klonoski became pregnant again in September or\r\nOctober of 1992.  Both spouses were worried because of the prior\r\nmiscarriages.  This was the pregnancy that ended in the birth of a\r\ndaughter, Caroline, and Mrs. Klonoski's death.\r\nThere was considerable testimony about Mrs. Klonoski's \r\nphysical condition during the pregnancy.  She did not complain to\r\nher husband excessively.  In early spring, 1993, Dr. Klonoski\r\naccepted a fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \r\nHis wife was concerned about moving to Boston.  \r\nThe family attended Dr. Klonoski's brother's wedding on\r\nApril 24, 1993.  He was an usher and his son, Brian, was the ring\r\nbearer.  A videotape taken at the wedding showing his wife and\r\ndaughter was presented to the jury.  This was a good period during\r\ntheir marriage marred only by the worries both had about the\r\npregnancy and the move to Boston.\r\nDr. Klonoski was away at a medical conference in San\r\nDiego the week his wife was admitted to the hospital.  The\r\nconference was important to his career because of the knowledge he\r\nwould get in his specialty and as a job forum.  He had skipped two\r\nprior conferences, once because his wife had asked him not to go\r\nand another time because she had recently had a miscarriage.  Mrs.\r\nKlonoski was \"not thrilled\" about his going to the conference, but\r\nshe did not ask him not to go.  Other doctors and some nurses from\r\nthe Hitchcock Hospital-Clinic establishment also attended the\r\nconference in San Diego.  Dr. Klonoski left for the conference on\r\nMay 5; his return was scheduled for May 9.  His wife's due date was\r\nMay 28.  Before he left he bought her a bouquet of her favorite\r\nflowers for Mother's Day on May 9.  At the time Dr. Klonoski left,\r\nMrs. Klonoski had not exhibited any signs of serious problems.  He\r\nwas not even aware that his wife was ill when he left.\r\nDr. Klonoski called home on Friday evening.  His wife\r\ntold him that everything went fine at her prenatal visit, but that\r\nshe did not feel well and if she continued to feel badly, she would\r\ngo to the doctor the next day.  She called the next day and told\r\nhim that she continued to feel poorly and was going to the\r\nhospital.  She did not mention vaginal bleeding.  We have already\r\nrelated the essentials of what happened at the hospital when Dr.\r\nKlonoski visited his wife.  She was comatose by the time he arrived\r\nat the hospital and did not recognize him.  He was informed by a\r\nneurosurgeon that his wife was brain-dead due to a massive\r\nhemorrhage of her brain.  He was with her when the life supports\r\nwere disconnected and she died. \r\nDirect examination of Dr. Klonoski drew to a close with\r\nhis statement, \"I loved my wife without reservation, and I still\r\nlove her.\"\r\n           CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DR. KLONOSKI\r\nOn cross-examination, it was established that Dr.\r\nKlonoski was suing, inter alia, as administrator of his wife's\r\nestate.  He acknowledged that his wife did not have a will and he\r\nknew he would receive the first $100,000 of his wife's estate.\r\nIt was brought out that initially after their marriage\r\nhis wife stayed in Poland for a time while he was in the United\r\nStates working as a medical clerk.  During this time he and his\r\nwife corresponded regularly.  All of his wife's letters to him were\r\nwritten in Polish.  In response to questions he stated that his\r\nwife had an older sister, named Marta. \r\nDr. Klonoski testified, as he had on direct examination,\r\nthat his wife's father had visited in the fall and winter of 1989-\r\n90.  Other than Christmas cards, he had not stayed in touch with\r\nhis wife's family and had not sent them photographs of the children\r\nsubsequent to his wife's death.\r\nThere was a series of questions about his wife's plans\r\nfor the future.  He testified that he had no specific information\r\nabout his wife's future plans.  He did not know any of his wife's\r\nfriends who worked at the same bank as she did.  He had never met\r\nany of his wife's work-colleagues. \r\nDr. Klonoski testified that he and his wife planned the\r\npregnancy that resulted in her death and the birth of their third\r\nchild, Caroline.  He testified that everybody in the cardiology\r\ndepartment was very helpful and supportive after his wife's death. \r\nMoney was collected for his family and food was prepared for the\r\nchildren and himself.  All of this was very helpful and he\r\nappreciated what was done.\r\nThen followed a series of questions setting the stage for\r\nthe use of the letters that are the heart of this appeal.  Dr.\r\nKlonoski acknowledged that he was seeking damages for injury to the\r\nmarital relationship with his wife and damages for his wife's loss\r\nof enjoyment of life.  In answer to a question, Dr. Klonoski agreed\r\nthat the quality of the marital relationship would be an important\r\nfactor in the enjoyment of life.  He also agreed that a good\r\nmarriage would improve the quality of life.  Dr. Klonoski\r\ntestified, as he had on direct examination, that by the time he and\r\nhis wife and their two children moved to Lebanon, the marriage was\r\ngetting along much better; the primary ongoing issue was the time\r\nhe spent away from the house and family.\r\nIn answer to a question, Dr. Klonoski testified that he\r\nknew that his wife corresponded with her father and sister, Marta,\r\nin Poland.  Dr. Klonoski was then asked:  \"[I]f I were to show you\r\na letter, you'd certainly be able to recognize your wife's\r\nhandwriting; is that right?\"  The answer was \"Yes, I would.\"  After\r\nDr. Klonoski testified that his wife's sister lived in Krakow,\r\ndefense counsel began to show the witness a document marked for\r\nidentification.  At this point, plaintiff's counsel requested a\r\nbench conference.  The request was granted.\r\nWe feel it necessary to quote at length the bench\r\nconference.\r\n     MS. LUKEY:  I don't have a clue what this\r\nis, but it's never been produced in discovery,\r\nand there is absolutely no question that we\r\nrequested anything that they intend to use in\r\nthis case.  I have no idea where it came from\r\nor what it might be.  And I assume it's in\r\nPolish, so I can't read it, but really this is\r\nunfair.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  What is it?\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  It's impeachment.  This is\r\na letter written by Mrs. Klonoski to her\r\nsister Marta in Poland.  And this letter\r\nhappens to have been written in late April of\r\n1993 and early May of 1993, and it contains in\r\nit a description of a number of things, most\r\nprominently the marital relationship and the\r\nsignificant problems that Mrs. Klonoski\r\nbelieved existed at that time, and I don't\r\nbelieve   we actually just got that letter\r\nlast night.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, we had, as you\r\nrecall, a court-ordered disclosure from them\r\npertaining to anything to do with alleged\r\nmarital discord.  This was not disclosed to\r\nus.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't\r\nknow what he's doing, but it obviously doesn't\r\ngive me the opportunity to speak, for example,\r\nto his sister   her sister, if that's the\r\nrecipient.  I really think this is litigation\r\nby ambush and totally inappropriate.  This is\r\na situation with an actual court order.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  Your Honor, it's legitimate\r\ncross-examination.  We just got that last\r\nnight based on the testimony that we had heard\r\nin this case, and it's legitimate cross-\r\nexamination.  We are not required to disclose\r\nwhat we are going to use on cross-examination. \r\nWe specifically brought it up with the Court,\r\nand you said for impeachment and credibility,\r\nwe did not have to disclose it, and we didn't\r\nhave it until last night.  But in any event,\r\nwe want to use it for that purpose, and I\r\nthink Attorney Lukey is entitled to go into\r\nthose issues on reexamination.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, he may not have\r\nto disclose it on a trial exhibit list, but in\r\ndiscovery he certainly has to disclose it if\r\nhe has knowledge of it, and we actually had to\r\nget a court order to get their evidence on\r\nmarital discord.  That was the reason we asked\r\nfor it.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  But he didn't have it.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  Didn't have it until last\r\nnight.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  He should have had it, and\r\nwhat is it that they're contending justifies\r\nambushing us with it at this moment in time.\r\n\n....\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  We, frankly, haven't had\r\nthe entire thing translated yet because it was\r\nreceived   this one was received this morning\r\nactually.  All we have had is a skeletal\r\ntranslation of it, your Honor, but I think at\r\nthis point it's an admission by a party\r\nopponent.  It's her letter, and that's how it\r\nwould come into evidence.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  What does it say?\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  Well, it says quite a few\r\nthings.  He can translate it for us.\r\n\n     THE COURT: I can't determine the\r\nrelevance of \"quite a few things.\"  That's not\r\nrelevant.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  I'll read you my\r\nunderstanding of it, but it's   this is the\r\nlast letter from Jola.  This is a paraphrasing\r\nof it right now, your Honor.  We would ask him\r\nto read it because he can read Polish and he\r\ncan translate it.\r\n\n     She goes on to the subject of his   of\r\nthe pregnancy:  I'm afraid of what's going to\r\nhappen.  He cares only about his career.  I\r\nwas surprised by his announcement that he was\r\nleaving for California and for a business\r\ntrip.\r\n\n     There are problems with her spending\r\nhabits.  He doesn't like it.  I bought a baby\r\nstroller, and he screamed at the top of his\r\nlungs.  I think we should get a divorce.\r\n\n     She mentions that Richard is working so\r\nhard to become a cardiologist.  She doesn't\r\nsay her situation will improve directly, but\r\nintimation is she has a stake   I don't\r\nunderstand what all that is.  I don't,\r\nfrankly, know what everything is in there, but\r\njust the fact that she says she thinks we\r\nshould get a divorce is enough, your Honor. \r\nAnd he can translate it.\r\n\n     And its an admission. . . .  This is a\r\nparty-opponent admission.  And just as we're\r\nentitled to make the arguments that outweigh\r\nit, so, too, Attorney Lukey can.\r\n\n     There are three more   four more of\r\nthose.  That's the first of the ones that I\r\nintend to offer in evidence.\r\n\n     MS LUKEY:  I would like to know how long\r\nthey've known of the existence of these\r\nletters regardless of when they may have\r\nreceived this one.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:   I'll make a\r\nrepresentation of that.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  How long have you known?\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  We've known about them,\r\nit's no more than two days.  We received the\r\nfirst of them   \r\n\n     THE COURT:  No, no.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  How did you know they were\r\nthere?\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  We found Marta this week. \r\nWe found her three days ago.  We looked for\r\nher father.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  He's dead.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  And he's dead; that's\r\nright.  He died last winter.  That's who we\r\nwere trying to find.  Instead we found Marta\r\nthis week, and I can certainly get somebody to\r\nprepare an affidavit to say that she was not\r\nspoken to until two days ago, and in fact we\r\ndidn't get the first transcript of these\r\nletters until yesterday afternoon.  They were\r\nfaxed from Poland last night.  The meeting\r\nwith Marta took place last night in Poland. \r\nThey were faxed to us, and I spent most of the\r\nnight up with these letters, and translators\r\nspent most of the night with the letters, too. \r\nWe have the other letters translated.  This\r\none we just received within two hours.  So we\r\nhaven't had it fully translated.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  I have a serious issue with\r\nthis, your Honor.  It's a little bit like\r\nspringing Dawn Rafferty on us right after\r\nChristmas when she turns out to be Linda\r\nBowers' niece, and they've known about her\r\nright along.  There's nothing that I heard to\r\nsuggest this is not something they could have\r\ndetermined earlier if they intended to use it. \r\nThis is truly an ambush.  They knew about her\r\nsister. That's not new.  I don't know what it\r\nis they think is new about this.  But the fact\r\nthat they choose to wait until three and a\r\nhalf weeks into a trial and then spring it on\r\nus as purported impeachment I find extremely\r\ntroubling and inconsistent with the rules.\r\n\n     I also have a very strong suspicion that\r\nthe reason that they made a point with you in\r\nour pretrial conference some months ago of\r\nsaying we don't have to show any impeachment,\r\nright, is because they knew exactly what they\r\nintended to do.\r\n\n     I don't know what Jola wrote, and it's\r\nclear that Dr. Klonoski doesn't know what Jola\r\nwrote.  I find it very upsetting and extremely\r\ninconsistent with the open disclosure rules of\r\ncurrent litigation that this would occur. \r\nThis is the kind of thing that occurred 25\r\nyears ago and was the whole reason the Rules\r\nof  Civil Procedure were adopted.  I mean I've\r\nbuilt a whole case obviously, and they're\r\nsuddenly coming in and trying to spring\r\nsomething on me about what the wife supposedly\r\nfelt.  She's dead.  I can't ask her.\r\n\n     But I do not feel this is appropriate.  I\r\nhave heard nothing from Mr. Bassett that\r\nsuggests why he couldn't have come up with\r\nthis earlier if it was something they intended\r\nto use.  You don't keep investigating the case\r\nwhen the trial is in process.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  Yes, you do.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  A lot of people do.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  But it's inappropriate.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  Based on the type of\r\ntestimony we got in this case   \r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  What in this case has\r\njustified this that you didn't know before?\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  We couldn't find them, and\r\nwe found them now, your Honor.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  All you had to do was ask for\r\nthe address.\r\n\n....\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, my problem is the\r\nmethod that they've done this.  \r\n\n     THE COURT:  Your problem is you don't\r\naccept that they just knew about it.  I do\r\naccept that they did just find out as he's\r\nrepresented to me.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  It isn't just whether they\r\njust knew about it.  You're right.  I do not\r\nbelieve that they just found out about it. \r\nYou're absolutely correct.\r\n\n     But quite apart from that is the fact\r\nthat what one is supposed to do is to do one's\r\ndiscovery and so forth for trial by the\r\ndiscovery disclosure date in order to ensure\r\nunder the Rules of Civil Procedure, the\r\ninformation you come up with is shared if\r\nappropriately requested by the other party. \r\nIn this case it was not only requested, we had\r\nto get a court order.  We got the court order\r\nregarding all evidence they had on the subject\r\nof alleged marital discord.\r\n\n     MR. BASSETT:  That was to identify the\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  Take the next step.  Then you\r\nhave all the evidence they had on marital\r\ndiscord.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  And, frankly, that evidence\r\ndoesn't trouble me.  Then they come up with\r\nthis.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  That's a different test.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  I understand, your Honor.  My\r\npoint is if it were in fact the case that it\r\nwas okay to send your investigator out while\r\nthe trial was in progress, what everyone would\r\ndo in order to avoid the necessity of\r\ndisclosing materials that are particularly\r\ngood for ambushing the other side is not do\r\ntheir investigation until the time of trial.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  Well, I hear you, but I don't\r\nagree with you.  You took the initiative to\r\nput on the evidence of a good marriage, stable\r\nmarriage.  Everything's hunky-dory and\r\nwonderful.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  As far as he knew.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  Well, as far as he knew.  But\r\nto the extent that's relevant, I've already  \r\nmy view, I don't think it's particularly\r\nrelevant one way or the other.  But both of\r\nyou think it is, and once you do that, they\r\nhave a right to then challenge whether that\r\nwas the case.  If they just got this and\r\nthey're going to use it for impeachment, I\r\nthink they have a right to do it.\r\n\n....\r\n\n     THE COURT:  All right.  I'll allow their\r\nuse, Mr. Bassett. They'll be admissible under\r\nRule 801(d)(2).\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, there's one other\r\nissue that I think   \r\n\n     THE COURT:  Not yet.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  There is one other issue that\r\nI think   I'm a little troubled about here\r\nthat I would raise to you.  This doesn't give\r\nme the opportunity to find out from the sister\r\nwhether there's more to the story, more\r\nletters, another side, an explanation,\r\nwhatever.  I mean I cannot imagine, short of\r\npaying out large sums of money, what would\r\ncause a sister to turn over these letters,\r\nwhich has me a bit troubled, and I would like\r\nto know if there is more.  I can't do that in\r\nthe middle of trial.  I'm about to close in  \r\nyou know, ten minutes after he finishes his\r\ncross.\r\n\n     So I do remind the Court again, he placed\r\nme in an impossible position in that regard\r\nbecause I don't know whether there's more out\r\nthere, another side to the story or some\r\nexplanation.  Nor do I know whether money has\r\nchanged hands.  I don't know anything.  I\r\ncannot imagine why a sister would turn these\r\nover to be used against her sister's estate.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  I'm not sure that's relevant. \r\nThe only question is are they legitimate\r\ndocuments.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  But my ability to examine\r\nMarta is essentially nonexistent because of\r\nthe fact that  \r\n\n     THE COURT:  Well, I'm not sure Marta\r\nmakes a difference.\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  Well she might make a\r\ndifference if it turns out that there are\r\nother letters, ones that came after, ones that\r\ncame before, explanatory letters, phone\r\nconversations, none of which I can possibly\r\nknow.  I don't know if this is complete.  I\r\ndon't know if   \r\n\n     THE COURT:  Are you asking for a\r\ncontinuance?\r\n\n     MS. LUKEY:  No, I'm not asking for a\r\ncontinuance.  I'm asking to have these\r\ndocuments excluded, your Honor, on the basis\r\nthat it's litigation by ambush.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  Yeah.  That objection has\r\nbeen overruled.  All right.\r\n\nAfter Dr. Klonoski identified the letters as being in his\r\nwife's handwriting, the court held an extended hearing on their\r\nadmissibility.  After considering the arguments of counsel it\r\nissued rulings accompanied by comments:\r\nI think these letters pose a substantial risk\r\nof unfair prejudice that would outweigh their\r\nprobative value.  I think their probative\r\nvalue, to the extent they have any probative\r\nvalue, lies on the fact of whether or not\r\nthere was marital discord, whether a divorce\r\nwas impending, whether she was happy or not in\r\nthe marriage, why she was unhappy, and the\r\ndegree of her unhappiness, as expressed in\r\nsome of these statements, I think might be\r\ntangentially relevant.  But to present that\r\nevidence in this form to the jury poses a very\r\ngrave risk that they would start to be\r\ninflamed or distracted onto issues that aren't\r\nrelevant in the case; that is, was Jolanta\r\nKlonoski a good or bad person?  More\r\nimportantly, was Dr. Klonoski a good or bad\r\nperson?  And factor that into their award, if\r\nthere is an award, and they shouldn't.  I\r\nthink we all agree they shouldn't be factoring\r\nthat into their award.\r\n\n     Now, they're probably cumulative anyway,\r\nbecause you put in   in fact, your case seems\r\nto be three experts and everybody says there's\r\na bad marriage.  So in a sense it's\r\ncumulative.  So I agree it's better to have\r\nwords in the decedent's mouth, so I'm willing\r\nto cut you some slack in that regard.  And\r\ndespite Attorney Lukey's, I think, well-taken\r\nposition that these are pretty late in the\r\nball game and she doesn't really have a great\r\nopportunity to deal with that, but I'm not\r\ngoing to give you the ruling, Attorney Lukey. \r\nWhat I'm going to do is give you some relief\r\nby limiting the admissibility of these\r\nstatements to those statements that directly\r\nspeak about her unhappiness in the marriage,\r\nbut not in histrionic terms and not in terms\r\nthat pose a risk of appealing to the passion,\r\nprejudice of the jury, and not in terms that\r\npose a risk of putting Dr. Klonoski in such a\r\nbad light that that might affect an award in\r\nthis case.  Like I said, I'll give you a\r\nchance to rebut, if you can and want to, just\r\nas to these statements, but I can't imagine\r\nyou will want to.\r\n\n....\r\n\n     In my judgment   well, as I think about\r\nit, it's probably an inconsistent view myself,\r\nbut having read these documents, the four\r\ndocuments you presented, it's my conclusion\r\nthat   certainly to the extent that you claim\r\nanything is relevant in there, most of it is\r\nnot relevant.  Material statements that are\r\nmade in these documents that might be relevant\r\nthat seem to portray the former plaintiff, Dr.\r\nKlonoski, in a very poor light are not\r\nrelevant to the issue of Mrs. Klonoski's\r\nfuture hedonic damages.  To the extent they\r\nare relevant, or one might argue that they are\r\nrelevant as a predictor or prognostication of\r\nher future happiness, I find that those\r\nstatements, though relevant in that respect,\r\nwould, nevertheless, be excluded.  I do\r\nexclude them on grounds that their probative\r\nvalue is far outweighed by the risk of unfair\r\nprejudice in that those statements would tend\r\nto, in my judgment, distract the jury and\r\nconfuse the jury and inflame the passions and\r\nprejudice of the jury, such that they may be\r\nat risk of focusing on the nature of Dr.\r\nKlonoski as a person in calculating a damages\r\naward for the estate, which we all agree would\r\nnot be proper.\r\n\n     To the extent   to the limiting [sic]\r\nextent it gives a marriage view different than\r\nthis   than Dr. Klonoski and others portrayed,\r\nI think they are relevant.  And I think by\r\ngoing through the letters and allowing you to\r\nadmit those portions of the letters that give\r\nthat contrary view, without the inflammatory\r\nbaggage of the other statements and comments\r\nin the letters, I think your interests are\r\nfairly protected.\r\n\n     So that's my ruling, I acknowledge that\r\nAttorney Lukey makes a very good point about\r\nlate discovery, not that you've violated my\r\norder of disclosure.  I find that you've not. \r\nAnd not that you had the document in a   in a\r\ntimely fashion that you could have delivered\r\nthem to the plaintiffs in a meaningful timely\r\nway.  I find you didn't.  But she is somewhat\r\nat a prejudicial point in that there are other\r\nletters that may present a different view\r\naltogether of this.\r\n\n     But again, we're at the point where I\r\nthink we're cumulative anyway on the item of\r\nwas there discord or not discord in the\r\nmarriage, and   that's not a very major issue\r\nin the case, in any event.  So here is what\r\nthe potentially inconsistent part, I suppose,\r\nwith respect to all of those other statements\r\nin these letters that I have not agreed to\r\nallow you to read to the jury or present to\r\nthe jury.  I would   I also exclude those on\r\ngrounds that, to the extent they are\r\ninflammatory but fall below the line of\r\nproposing an unfair risk of substantial\r\nprejudice, outweighing their probative value,\r\nI would exclude them on the additional\r\nindependent grounds that Attorney Lukey does\r\nnot have the opportunity to have those other\r\nnine letters translated and examined for the\r\npossibility that they may have equally\r\npraiseworthy and laudatory comments about Dr.\r\nKlonoski in them.  So who knows.  Maybe they\r\nwould balance them off.  So that's just\r\nanother independent reason why I wouldn't\r\nallow the statements to be denigrating of Dr.\r\nKlonoski or certainly his relatives into\r\nevidence.  All right.\r\n\nThe court allowed the following excerpts in evidence. \r\nThey were read to the jury by the defendants' translator:\r\nDespite the fact that I want to save this\r\nmarriage very much, I cannot stand being\r\ntreated as a moron, but that's how Richard\r\nlikes to behave.  I think he will never\r\nappreciate me as a person and will always\r\nexpect from me obedience and approval of\r\nanything he proposes.  This does not satisfy\r\nme and does not provide even a bit of\r\nhappiness.\r\n\nExcerpt from letter of May 20, 1990 (Ex. LLL, RA 4487; RA 3854).\r\n\nNow I am with him not for myself but for the\r\nchildren and I know that the day will come\r\nwhen we separate because I will not stand\r\nbeing with him to the end of my life.\r\n\nExcerpt from letter of August 27, 1990 (Ex. LLL, RA 4488; RA 3855).\r\n\nAnd I knew that something was wrong.  I did\r\nnot have to wait long because in the evening\r\nhe came to my bed and graciously informed me\r\nthat on May 5, 6 and 7 he flies to California,\r\nSan Diego, for another conference.  I could\r\nnot believe it but he said nobody was going to\r\nchange his plans.  After that last conference\r\nI told him I do not want him to ever fly\r\nwithout me.\r\n\nExcerpts from letter of April 27 and May 1993 (Ex. LLL, RA 4489; RA \r\n3856).\r\n\nAs you can see, I think we should get a\r\ndivorce because we are tormenting each other\r\nand no good will come between us.  I only pity\r\nthis yet to be born child because it will\r\nnever see love between its parents.  Sooner or\r\nlater both I and he will not be able to stand\r\nthis tension and misery between us any more.\r\n\nExcerpt from letter of April and May, 1993 (Ex. LLL, RA 4489; RA \r\n3856-3857).\r\n\nPrior to reading the letter excerpts and marking them as\r\nexhibits, defendants put on the following witnesses whose testimony\r\nwe summarize.  Joan Conrad worked in the cardiology department and\r\nbecame acquainted with Dr. Klonoski.  When she congratulated him on\r\nthe coming birth of another child, he said:  \"It wasn't my idea. \r\nThis wasn't planned.\"  When Conrad asked Dr. Klonoski about his\r\nwife, he replied:  \"She's always complaining, lots of aches and\r\npains.  Always complaining about headaches, and I don't pay\r\nattention to that anymore.\"  Conrad testified that there was no\r\npositive feedback from Dr. Klonoski about his wife.\r\nThe next witness was Dr. John Robb, a cardiologist, who\r\nworked with Dr. Klonoski.  Accompanied by Dr. Klonoski's parents,\r\nhe met Dr. Klonoski at the Lebanon Airport on his return from the\r\nmeeting in San Diego, and drove him to the hospital. Dr. Robb\r\ntestified that Dr. Klonoski was crying when Dr. Robb picked him up\r\nat the airport, that he was \"very distraught and upset\" and\r\n\"grieving.\"\r\nEllen Fullington was a medical secretary at the Hitchcock\r\nHospital.  She worked for Dr. Klonoski as well as other doctors. \r\nShe testified that Dr. Klonoski's comments about his marriage were\r\nnegative.\r\nDr. Douglas H. James was director of the fellowship\r\nprogram at the Hitchcock Hospital.  Dr. Klonoski discussed his\r\nmarriage with him during a review of his performance.  Dr. Klonoski\r\nfelt that his performance was adversely affected by stress at home.\r\nDawn Rafferty worked with Mrs. Klonoski at the bank.  She\r\ntestified that Mrs. Klonoski was not happy with her marriage.  She\r\nwas considering a divorce, but was afraid that the children would\r\nbe taken away from her.  Mrs. Klonoski complained that her husband\r\nwas only interested in money.  He worked extremely long hours and\r\ndid not pay attention to her or the children.  She wanted to have\r\nanother child when she became pregnant again.  Dr. Klonoski was not\r\nhappy about her pregnancy.  She felt that he wanted her to have an\r\nabortion.\r\nThe final witness for defendants was the translator who\r\nread the letter excerpts to the jury.\r\nDr. Klonoski was recalled as a rebuttal witness.  He\r\ntestified as follows:\r\n     Q.  Were you aware before this weekend\r\nthat your wife had written thoughts of divorce\r\nto her family?\r\n\n     A.  No, I was not.\r\n\n     Q.  Did you have any idea that she felt\r\nthat way?\r\n\n     A.  No, I did not.\r\n\n     Q.  When you learned about her feelings,\r\nat least as contained at these points in time\r\nin these letters, what steps did you take?\r\n\n     A.  I was very stunned and distressed\r\nthat her perception of things was so vastly\r\ndifferent from what she represented to me and\r\nwas distressing her at the same time and that\r\nshe thought that she could get more answers or\r\nmore comfort by writing to her family in\r\nPoland and not discussing it with me.\r\n\n     When I found that out, I instructed the\r\nattorney in Connecticut who is handling the\r\nprobate of her estate that I waive any right\r\nto the proceeds of the estate, and I\r\nestablished an irrevocable trust in the names\r\nof our children equally and relinquished all\r\nrights to them with the trustee, that is not\r\nmyself, and that is the trustee's attorney,\r\nJennifer Snyder, from Hale and Dorr in Boston.\r\n\n     Q.  And what is your understanding as to\r\nwhether you now have any claim to the proceeds\r\nof the estate?\r\n\n     A.  I understand that with the execution\r\nof the trust, I have no claim to any of the\r\nproceeds in her estate.\r\n\n     Q.  One final question, Doctor.  We heard\r\ntestimony on the defense case that you did not\r\nwant the pregnancy that resulted in Caroline's\r\nbirth.  Is that true?\r\n\n     A.  No, that's not true.\r\n\nOn cross-examination there were questions about when the\r\nirrevocable trust was established, which were answered ambiguously. \r\nThere was also a series of questions relative to the testimony by\r\ndefendants' witnesses.\r\nDr. Klonoski having withdrawn his own claims, the case\r\nwent to the jury on only one claim, that of Mrs. Klonoski's estate. \r\nThe jury returned a defendant's verdict, and the plaintiff\r\nappealed.\r\n                          II.\r\n              APPLYING THE DISCOVERY RULES\r\n\nWe begin our analysis with a brief review of the\r\npertinent rules of discovery.  Rule 26(a)(3)(C) requires each\r\nparty to disclose to other parties, without awaiting a discovery\r\nrequest, the following information:\r\n     (C) an appropriate identification of each\r\ndocument or other exhibit, including summaries\r\nof other evidence, separately identifying\r\nthose which the party expects to offer and\r\nthose which the party may offer if the need\r\narises.\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3)(C).\r\n\nThis rule requires that:  \"[u]nless otherwise directed by\r\nthe court, these disclosures shall be made at least 30 days before\r\ntrial.\"  Id.  It is obvious that defendants did not follow the\r\nstrictures of Rule 26(a)(3)(C) with respect to the letters from\r\nMrs. Klonoski to her sister.\r\nIn addition to the mandatory pretrial disclosures,\r\nparties may obtain discovery of further matter by various methods. \r\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(5).  Rule 26(b)(1) defines the scope and\r\nlimits of discovery:\r\n     (b) Discovery Scope and Limits.  Unless\r\notherwise limited by order of the court in\r\naccordance with these rules, the scope of\r\ndiscovery is as follows:\r\n\n        (1) In General.  Parties may obtain\r\ndiscovery regarding any matter, not\r\nprivileged, which is relevant to the subject\r\nmatter involved in the pending action, whether\r\nit relates to the claim or defense of the\r\nparty seeking discovery or to the claim or\r\ndefense of any other party, including the\r\nexistence, description, nature, custody,\r\ncondition, and location of any books,\r\ndocuments, or other tangible things and the\r\nidentity and location of persons having\r\nknowledge of any discoverable matter.  The\r\ninformation sought need not be admissible at\r\nthe trial if the information sought appears\r\nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\r\nof admissible evidence.\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  Like Rule 26(a)(3)(C), Rule 26(b)(1)\r\nprovides no exception for documents found during belated\r\ninvestigation that takes place after the trial has begun.  On the\r\ncontrary, the plain language of this Rule 26(b)(1) contemplates\r\nwide-ranging discovery to the fullest possible extent.\r\nSuch a broad reading is supported by leading Supreme\r\nCourt precedent.  As the Court stated in Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v.\r\nSanders, 437 U.S. 340 (1978), the word \"relevant\" encompasses \r\nany matter that bears on, or that reasonably\r\ncould lead to other matter that could bear on,\r\nany issue that is or may be in the case. . . .\r\n[D]iscovery is not limited to issues raised by\r\nthe pleadings, for discovery itself is\r\ndesigned to help define and clarify the\r\nissues.  Nor is discovery limited to the\r\nmerits of a case, for a variety of fact-\r\noriented issues may arise during litigation\r\nthat are not related to the merits.\r\n\nId. at 351 (citing Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 501 (1947)).\r\nIn Hickman, the Court characterized the \"pre-trial\r\ndeposition-discovery mechanism established by Rules 26 to 37 [as]\r\none of the most significant innovations of the Federal Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure.\"  Hickman, 329 U.S. at 500.  The Court went on to\r\ndiscuss the purpose of the discovery rules:\r\nUnder the prior federal practice, the pre-\r\ntrial functions of notice-giving, issue-\r\nformulation and fact-revelation were performed\r\nprimarily and inadequately by the pleadings. \r\nInquiry into the issues and the facts before\r\ntrial was narrowly confined and was often\r\ncumbersome in method.  The new rules, however,\r\nrestrict the pleadings to the task of general\r\nnotice-giving and invest the deposition-\r\ndiscovery process with a vital role in the\r\npreparation for trial.  The various\r\ninstruments of discovery now serve (1) as a\r\ndevice, along with the pre-trial hearing under\r\nRule 16, to narrow and clarify the basic\r\nissues between the parties, and (2) as a\r\ndevice for ascertaining the facts, or\r\ninformation as to the existence or whereabouts\r\nof facts, relative to those issues.  Thus\r\ncivil trials in the federal courts no longer\r\nneed be carried on in the dark.  The way is\r\nnow clear, consistent with recognized\r\nprivileges, for the parties to obtain the\r\nfullest possible knowledge of the issues and\r\nfacts before trial.  \r\n\nId. at 500-01 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).  The Court added\r\nthat the \"deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and\r\nliberal treatment.\"  Id. at 507.  This is because\r\n[m]utual knowledge of all the relevant facts\r\ngathered by both parties is essential to\r\nproper litigation.  To that end, either party\r\nmay compel the other to disgorge whatever\r\nfacts he has in his possession.  The\r\ndeposition-discovery procedure simply advances\r\nthe stage at which the disclosure can be\r\ncompelled from the time of trial to the period\r\npreceding it, thus reducing the possibility of\r\nsurprise. \r\n\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 356\r\nU.S. 677 (1958), the Court stated that \"[m]odern instruments of\r\ndiscovery serve a useful purpose . . . .  They together with\r\npretrial procedures make a trial less a game of blindman's bluff\r\nand more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed\r\nto the fullest practicable extent.  Only strong public policies\r\nweigh against disclosure.\"  Id. at 682 (emphasis added; citation\r\nomitted).\r\nBased on the plain language of Rule 26 and the broad\r\nscope that it has been given, it would appear that Mrs. Klonoski's\r\nletters fit well within the rule's reach.  The letters plainly\r\ncontain information \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\r\nof admissible evidence.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  As noted,\r\nRule 26 provides no exception for documents found after discovery\r\ndeadlines have passed.\r\nTo the extent the rules contemplate additional material\r\nthat a party finds after it has provided discovery to the other\r\nside, the rules require prompt supplementation of its additional\r\nmaterial so the opposing party is not misled by the original\r\ndiscovery responses as the opposing party prepares its case for\r\ntrial.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).  Rule 26(e) provides in\r\npertinent part:\r\n     (e) Supplementation of Disclosures and\r\nResponses.  A party who has made a disclosure\r\nunder subdivision (a) or responded to a\r\nrequest for discovery with a disclosure or\r\nresponse is under a duty to supplement or\r\ncorrect the disclosure or response to include\r\ninformation thereafter acquired if ordered by\r\nthe court or in the following circumstances:\r\n\n        (1) A party is under a duty to\r\n     supplement at appropriate intervals its\r\n     disclosures under subdivision (a) if the\r\n     party learns that in some material\r\n     respect the information disclosed is\r\n     incomplete or incorrect and if the\r\n     additional or corrective information has\r\n     not otherwise been made known to the\r\n     other parties during the discovery\r\n     process or in writing.\r\n\n          (2) A party is under a duty\r\n     seasonably to amend a prior response to\r\n     an interrogatory, request for production,\r\n     or request for admission if the party\r\n     learns that the response is in some\r\n     material respect incomplete or incorrect\r\n     and if the additional or corrective\r\n     information has not otherwise been made\r\n     known to the other parties during the\r\n     discovery process or in writing.\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).  In the instant case, the defendants\r\nprovided no supplementation of their prior disclosures by adding\r\nthe letters in question to the list of evidence to be offered at\r\ntrial.  \r\nIn 1993, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were\r\nsignificantly amended, particularly Rules 26(e) and 37(c)(1).  The\r\nchanges to Rule 26(e) substantially expanded the duty to\r\nsupplement.  Under the pre-1993 version of Rule 26(e),\r\nsupplementation was required only in a few, limited circumstances. \r\nThe current version of the rule, as quoted supra, imposes a broad\r\nrequirement on parties to update their earlier disclosures and\r\ndiscovery responses.  See 8 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal\r\nPractice and Procedure  2049.1 (2d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 1998) (\"Wright\r\n&amp; Miller\").  Thus, even if the defendants could argue that the pre-\r\n1993 rule might not have required them to disclose the letters to\r\nthe plaintiff, they have no such argument under the 1993 amendments\r\nto the supplementation requirement.  \r\n         IS PRECLUSION THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY?\r\nThe 1993 amendments to the Federal Rules also added\r\nRule 37(c)(1) which provides:\r\n     (c) Failure to Disclose; False or  Misleading Disclosure; Refusal to  Admit.\r\n\n        (1)  A party that without substantial\r\n     justification fails to disclose\r\n     information required by Rule 26(a) or\r\n     26(e)(1) shall not, unless such failure\r\n     is harmless, be permitted to use as\r\n     evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on\r\n     a motion any witness or information not\r\n     so disclosed.  In addition to or in lieu\r\n     of this sanction, the court, on motion\r\n     and after affording an opportunity to be\r\n     heard, may impose other appropriate\r\n     sanctions.  In addition to requiring\r\n     payment of reasonable expenses, including\r\n     attorney's fees, caused by the failure,\r\n     these sanctions may include any of the\r\n     actions authorized under subparagraphs\r\n     (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2)\r\n     of this rule and may include informing\r\n     the jury of the failure to make the\r\n     disclosure.\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\r\n\nPrior to adoption of Rule 37(c)(1), no rule specifically\r\nprovided sanctions for the failure to supplement discovery.  Courts\r\nwere free to apply their discretion in sanctioning Rule 26(e)\r\nviolations.  The new rule is mandatory: a party that fails to make\r\nthe required disclosures \"shall not, unless such failure is\r\nharmless, be permitted to use [undisclosed] evidence at a trial.\" \r\nId.  To be sure, the rule somewhat tempers this mandate by\r\npermitting courts to excuse failures to disclose to some degree\r\n(i.e., to impose other sanctions \"in lieu of this sanction\").  Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).  But the new rule clearly contemplates\r\nstricter adherence to discovery requirements, and harsher sanctions\r\nfor breaches of this rule, and the required sanction in the\r\nordinary case is mandatory preclusion.\r\nEven before the 1993 amendments, in National Hockey\r\nLeague v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639 (1976) (per\r\ncuriam), the Supreme Court stressed the policy reasons for\r\nenforcing the discovery rules.  The most severe sanctions provided\r\nby the rules, the Court explained, \"must be available to the\r\ndistrict court in appropriate cases, not merely to penalize those\r\nwhose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to\r\ndeter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of\r\nsuch a deterrent.\"  Id. at 643.  While a warning alone might have\r\nmade the plaintiffs in that case comply with all future discovery\r\norders, \"other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we\r\nthink Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other\r\ndiscovery orders of other district courts.\"  Id.  Thus, enforcement\r\nof discovery rules and orders is necessary, the Court concluded, to\r\nprevent abuse by future litigants.  Id.\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the letters in question were\r\ncovered by the disclosure requirements of Rule 26, including the\r\nduty to supplement, and that defendants' failure to disclose them\r\nprior to trial precluded defendants from using the letters at\r\ntrial.  The district court did not take this position because it\r\nfound the letters to fall within an exception to the discovery\r\nrules for material that is presented \"solely for impeachment\r\npurposes.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3).\r\n        DO THE LETTERS FALL WITHIN AN EXCEPTION\r\n                TO THE DISCOVERY RULES? \r\n\nRule 26(a)(3) provides:\r\n     Pretrial Disclosures.  In addition to the\r\ndisclosures required in the preceding\r\nparagraphs, a party shall provide to other\r\nparties [certain delineated] information\r\nregarding the evidence that it may present at\r\ntrial other than solely for impeachment\r\npurposes: . . . .\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3) (emphasis added).  \r\nNeither the Rule itself nor the advisory notes define\r\nimpeachment evidence.  The federal cases that have decided whether\r\nevidence falls within the impeachment exception to the discovery\r\nrules are, for the most part, personal injury cases.  They\r\nfrequently deal with two kinds of evidence:  video surveillance\r\ntapes of a plaintiff's activities subsequent to the injury giving\r\nrise to the suit; and information that a defendant has of the\r\nplaintiff's prior medical history.  Although some district courts\r\nhave found video surveillance tapes to be \"solely\" impeachment\r\nevidence, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3), the weight of authority\r\nseems to be that such evidence is both impeaching and substantive\r\nand should be disclosed.  See Wegner v. Cliff Viessman, Inc., 153\r\nF.R.D. 154, 157-59 (N.D. Iowa 1994).\r\nAnd this approach makes evidentiary sense.  As the Wright\r\nand Miller treatise put it, after reviewing the case law:\r\nIf a party plans to testify to one version of\r\nthe facts, and the opponent has evidence\r\nsupporting a different version of the facts,\r\nthe opponent's evidence will tend to impeach\r\nthe party by contradiction, but if discovery\r\nof this kind of evidence is not permitted the\r\ndiscovery rules might as well be repealed. \r\nEven those who have been most concerned about\r\nprotecting impeachment material recognize that\r\nsubstantive evidence must be subject to\r\ndiscovery even though it also tends to\r\ncontradict evidence of the discovering party. \r\n\n8 Wright &amp; Miller, supra,  2015, at 212 (footnote omitted).\r\nThe only circuit court that directly addresses this\r\nsubject is Chiasson v. Zapata Gulf Marine Corp., 988 F.2d 513 (5th\r\nCir. 1993).  In holding that a video surveillance tape was not\r\n\"solely\" impeachment evidence, the court defined substantive\r\nevidence as \"that which is offered to establish the truth of a\r\nmatter to be determined by the trier of fact.\"  Id. at 517.  It\r\nthen stated:  \"Impeachment evidence, on the other hand, is that\r\nwhich is offered to 'discredit a witness . . . to reduce the\r\neffectiveness of [her] testimony by bringing forth evidence which\r\nexplains why the jury should not put faith in [her] . . .\r\ntestimony.'\"  Id.  (alterations in original) (quoting John P.\r\nFrank, Pretrial Conferences and Discovery - Disclosure or\r\nSurprise?, 1965 Ins. Law J. 661, 664 (1965)).  \r\nThe court recognized that some evidence serves both\r\nfunctions, and, because such evidence is not \"solely offered for\r\nimpeachment,\" it is not covered by the exception to the Rule 26\r\ndiscovery requirements.  The court held:  \"Because the tape is, at\r\nthe very least, in part substantive, it should have been disclosed\r\nprior to trial, regardless of its impeachment value.\"  Id. at 517-\r\n18.\r\nThe same is true of the disputed evidence here.  The\r\nexcerpts from the letters written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister\r\nwere at least in part substantive, and therefore they did not fall\r\nwithin the \"solely for impeachment\" exception of Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n26(a)(3).  The letter excerpts constituted substantive evidence\r\nbecause, separate and apart from whether they contradicted Dr.\r\nKlonoski's testimony, they tended \"to establish the truth of a\r\nmatter to be determined by the trier of fact.\"  Chiasson, 988 F.2d\r\nat 518.  This is true even though, in addition to their substantive\r\ncontent, the excerpts tended to contradict Dr. Klonoski's testimony\r\nregarding the state of his marriage.  We hold, therefore, that the\r\ndistrict court erred, as a matter of law, in finding the letter\r\nexcerpts to fall within the exception to the discovery rules for\r\nevidence introduced \"solely for impeachment purposes\" of Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 26(a)(3).\r\nNor do we think that Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) opens the\r\nevidence door to the excerpts because they are admissions against\r\na party opponent, as defendants argue.  The question is not the\r\nadmissibility of the excerpts under the Federal Rules of Evidence\r\nbut whether they were barred because their introduction violated\r\nthe pretrial discovery orders of the district court and federal\r\ndiscovery rules.  The rules of evidence do not trump the discovery\r\nrules contained in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The\r\npurpose of the discovery rules is to provide for the \"fullest\r\npossible\" pretrial disclosure of admissible evidence, to \"reduc[e]\r\nthe possibility of surprise,\" Hickman, 329 U.S. at 500-01, and to\r\ninsure \"a fair contest,\" Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. at 682.\r\nAs we have discussed, supra, absent some unusual\r\nextenuating circumstances not present here, the appropriate\r\nsanction when a party fails to provide certain evidence to the\r\nopposing party as required in the discovery rules is preclusion of\r\nthat evidence from the trial.\r\nWe have recently condemned trial by ambush tactics and\r\nfor this reason vacated a verdict returned for the defendant. \r\nLicciardi v. TIG Ins. Group, 140 F.3d 357 (1st Cir. 1998), centered\r\non the testimony of a medical expert who:\r\nchanged course 180 degrees from his report in\r\nhis testimony on a key topic at the heart of\r\nplaintiff's case.  Further, he went into a new\r\narea of testimony.  There was no prior\r\ndisclosure of the coming volte face; indeed\r\nthere was a misrepresentation in the\r\nsupplemental answer to interrogatories filed\r\ntwo days after the jury was impaneled that the\r\nexpert's testimony would be the same as in his\r\ninitial report.\r\n\nId. at 359 (footnote omitted).  We found this \"volte face\" to be\r\n\"highly prejudicial to plaintiff's case.\"  Id.\r\nWe recognize that the focus of Licciardi was on the\r\ndivergence between the pretrial disclosure of the testimony of a\r\nparty's expert witness and his trial testimony.  This court's\r\nforthright condemnation of trial by ambush, however, applies to\r\nwhat happened in the case before us.\r\nLabadie Coal Co. v. Black, 672 F.2d 92 (D.C. Cir. 1982),\r\nis factually closer to the situation before us.  In Labadie, the\r\nD.C. Circuit found that the district court's admission of documents\r\nwas erroneous and prejudicial because plaintiff was not given\r\nnotice of the documents until after it had rested its case on the\r\nlast day of trial.  The court noted that \"when the documents were\r\nfinally produced, [plaintiff] had little, if any, time effectively\r\nto . . . cross-examine [defendant] as to their content.\"  Id. at\r\n94-95.  In the present case, plaintiff was even more prejudiced by\r\nthe lack of discovery.  He had virtually finished presenting his\r\nentire case to the jury; Dr. Klonoski's direct testimony had been\r\ncompleted.  His depiction of the state of the marriage was very\r\ndifferent from the way he would have characterized it if his late\r\nwife's letters had been disclosed to him prior to his testifying.\r\nWe cannot help being impressed by the exquisite timing of\r\nthe injection of the letters into the trial.  Dr. Klonoski, the\r\nlast witness in the plaintiff's case, had finished his direct\r\ntestimony.  The plaintiff's case had been completed.  Cross-\r\nexamination started with some innocuous questions.  This was\r\nfollowed by what clearly were questions setting up Dr. Klonoski for\r\nthe introduction of the letters.  Whether by design or accident the\r\ntiming could not have been better for defendants.\r\nPolicy reasons also militate against the district court's\r\nruling that the letters are exceptions to the discovery rule.  If\r\nletters or other documents are allowed in evidence after a trial\r\nstarts for the sole reason that they were not obtained sooner by\r\nthe party offering them, the rules of discovery and court orders\r\npertaining thereto would become empty phrases signifying nothing. \r\nTrial by ambush would be re-born.  Enforcement of discovery rules\r\nand orders is necessary to prevent abuse by future litigants.  SeeNational Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643.\r\n        THE ADEQUACY OF DEFENDANTS' EXPLANATIONS\r\nDefense counsel argued successfully to the district court\r\nthat the reason the letters had not been disclosed was that counsel\r\nhad not received them until two days prior to the start of their\r\ncross-examination and did not have an opportunity prior to their\r\nuse at trial to have them translated from Polish to English.  This\r\nexplanation was accepted by the district judge.  But it is beside\r\nthe point.  The fact that a party had not actually obtained certain\r\ndocuments before the discovery deadline does not excuse a\r\nviolation. \r\nThe belated appearance of the letters violated the plain\r\nmeaning and the intent of the discovery rules.  It also ignored the\r\nspecific requirements of the court's pretrial discovery orders. \r\nThe contents of Mrs. Klonoski's letters were not disclosed prior to\r\ntrial, as they should have been under the July 16, 1996 discovery\r\norder which provided specifically:  \"defendants shall produce a\r\nlist of all persons known by them to possess discoverable\r\ninformation related to:  (1) marital discord between Dr. and Mrs.\r\nKlonoski . . . and a general description of the nature of that\r\ninformation.\"  The final pretrial order was based on the parties'\r\nrepresentations that discovery had been completed and the case was\r\nready for trial.  \r\nNor can the defendants be excused for their failure to\r\ncomply.  That defense counsel did not obtain the letters until two\r\ndays before their use at trial on cross-examination does not make\r\nthem admissible.  Defendants had been furnished with the address of\r\nMrs. Klonoski's father in Poland more than a full year before\r\ntrial.  Her father and sister lived at the same address.  The\r\ndefendants could, at that time, have undertaken the same\r\ninvestigation that for some unexplained reason did not come to\r\nfruition until the trial was near completion.  They have offered no\r\nlegitimate explanation for why they waited as long as they did,\r\nknowing that the federal rules and the court had required them to\r\ndisclose potential trial exhibits and all relevant responses to\r\ndiscovery requests well before the trial began.  This suggests\r\nthat the defendants may have been, at best, either lax or negligent\r\nin pursuing pretrial discovery.\r\nFinally, defense counsel admitted that they at least knew\r\nabout the letters and the general outlines of their contents two\r\ndays earlier than they disclosed them, i.e., they knew about them\r\nbefore Dr. Klonoski testified on direct.  Counsel could have put\r\nplaintiff on notice that certain new and hitherto undisclosed\r\nevidence was on the verge of becoming available on the issue of\r\nmarital discord.  If such notice had been given at that point,\r\nprior to Dr. Klonoski's testimony on direct, then undoubtedly his\r\ntestimony would have been different and the present problem would\r\nmost likely never have arisen.\r\n              THE DISTRICT COURT'S RULING\r\nAfter reading the district court's rulings and comments,\r\nwe have difficulty understanding the basis of its decision to allow\r\nexcerpts from the letters to be read to the jury.  The first\r\nparagraph of the court's order states:  \"I think these letters pose\r\na substantial risk of unfair prejudice that would outweigh their\r\nprobative value.\"  Despite this pronouncement, the court admitted\r\nexcerpts from the letters into evidence.  With due respect, we do\r\nnot think that the prejudice was reduced appreciably by limiting\r\nthe court's ruling to the excerpts read to the jury.  In fact, by\r\nshortening lengthy letters and allowing into evidence only the\r\ninflammatory portions, their prejudicial impact was probably\r\nheightened.\r\nWe are also puzzled by the statement:  \"I acknowledge\r\nthat Attorney Lukey makes a very good point about late discovery,\r\nnot that you've violated my order of disclosure.  I find that\r\nyou've not.\"  The only basis for this finding was that the court\r\nbelieved the letter fell within the impeachment exception\r\nprovisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3).  We have found, supra, that\r\nthe exception does not apply.  Clearly the introduction of the\r\nletters without prior notice to plaintiff violated the pretrial\r\ndiscovery order of July 19 and the final pretrial order.\r\nWe agree with the court's statement that Attorney Lukey\r\n\"is somewhat at a prejudicial point in that there are other letters\r\nthat may present a different view altogether of this.\"  We believe\r\nthis greatly understated the predicament in which plaintiff's\r\nattorney found herself.  First, Attorney Lukey was correct that,\r\nbecause of the defendants' failure to provide these letters during\r\nthe discovery process, plaintiff's counsel was unable to conduct\r\nher own investigation which might uncover other letters from Mrs.\r\nKlonoski explaining what she wrote in the letters introduced by\r\ndefendants, or which might demonstrate that Mrs. Klonoski's anger\r\nwas a passing feeling that did not reflect her overall view of the\r\nmarriage.  But more critically, plaintiff had already planned and\r\nexecuted his trial strategy based on the evidence available to the\r\nparties through discovery.  He had presented his entire case,\r\nincluding the direct examination of his lead witness.  To spring\r\nthese letters   hitherto unknown by plaintiff and his attorneys  \r\nupon the plaintiff at that stage of the litigation was a lot more\r\nthan \"somewhat . . . prejudicial.\"  Realistically, it was\r\ndevastating to his ability to succeed with the jury.\r\n           A CONTINUANCE AS A POSSIBLE REMEDY\r\nThe district court asked plaintiff's counsel at least\r\ntwice if she wanted a continuance.  She said she did not want one\r\nbecause she did not think it would do any good.  It is true, as\r\ndefendants argue, that in some cases we have found that surprise\r\nevidence could be combated by granting a continuance to the\r\nsurprised party.  See Newell Puerto Rico, Ltd. v. Rubbermaid, Inc.,\r\n20 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 1994).  In Licciardi we discussed at\r\nlength the effectiveness of a continuance as an antidote to\r\nsurprise evidence.  140 F.3d at 366-67.  As we stated there: \r\nIt is true that, where effective to counteract\r\nthe surprise to one party wrought by the other\r\nparty's failure to abide by Rule 26, a\r\ncontinuance or the calling of a rebuttal\r\nwitness is preferable to terminating the trial\r\nand beginning anew.  However, a continuance is\r\nnot effective in every circumstance to\r\ncounteract the unfair surprise.  See Thibeault[v. Square D Co.], 960 F.2d [239,] 246 [(1st\r\nCir. 1992)] (\"[A] continuance is often\r\nineffectual as a sanction and unfair to both\r\nthe court and the opposing party.\").\r\n\nLicciardi, 140 F.3d at 366.  We found no practical way for the\r\nplaintiff to remedy the surprise; any solution would have\r\nprejudiced the plaintiff even more.  Id. at 366.  We thought it\r\nimportant to consider the policy behind the discovery rules. \r\nDirectly contrary to this policy, granting a continuance, we found,\r\nwould create greater incentives for attorneys to violate\r\nRule 26(e).  Id.; see also National Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643\r\n(Strict sanctions are necessary \"to deter those who might be\r\ntempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\"). \r\n\"Such conduct should not be rewarded.\"  Licciardi, 140 F.3d at 367. \r\nAnd as we also noted in Thibeault:  \"If continuances were granted\r\nas a matter of course for violations of Rule 26(e), the rule could\r\nalways be disregarded with impunity.\"  Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 246;\r\nsee also Freund, 956 F.2d at 359.\r\nWe think this rationale applies with equal force to the\r\ninstant case.  We fail to see how a continuance could have\r\naccomplished anything in this case.  As plaintiff's counsel pointed\r\nout orally at the hearing on the admissibility of the letters, the\r\nonly thing she could have done was to take the deposition of Dr.\r\nKlonoski's sister-in-law to find out as much as she could about the\r\nletters.  Because of the distances involved and the language\r\nproblems, this would have necessitated a lengthy continuance.  A\r\ncontinuance was not a practical alternative.\r\nMoreover, short of a new trial, a continuance would have\r\naccomplished nothing at all to mitigate the prejudice caused to\r\nplaintiff's case by defendants' having waited until after Dr.\r\nKlonoski had finished his direct testimony before disclosing the\r\nletters to the plaintiff.  As noted supra, defense counsel knew\r\nabout the letters prior to Dr. Klonoski's testimony.  If counsel\r\nhad notified the plaintiff at that point, then perhaps a\r\ncontinuance might have been the appropriate remedy.\r\nA continuance would have been an inadequate remedy in\r\nthis case also because of the policy concerns regarding incentives\r\nfor parties to comply with discovery rules.  See National Hockey\r\nLeague, 427 U.S. at 643 (Absent strict sanctions, \"other parties to\r\nother lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates\r\nthey should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district\r\ncourts.\").  As plaintiff's counsel told the district court, if we\r\nwere to condone the procedure followed by the defendants in this\r\ncase, then \"what everyone would do in order to avoid the necessity\r\nof disclosing materials that are particularly good for ambushing\r\nthe other side is not do their investigation until the time of\r\ntrial.\"\r\n                IS A NEW TRIAL REQUIRED?\r\nFinally, the defendants argue that, even if the district\r\ncourt erred by admitting the letter excerpts into evidence and\r\nallowing the defendants to use them in cross-examining Dr.\r\nKlonoski, a new trial is not warranted because the letter excerpts\r\ncould have had no effect on the jury's verdict of no liability. \r\nTheir contention can be summarized as follows.  In his jury\r\ninstructions, the district court judge told the jury to consider\r\nthe letter excerpts only in its determination of hedonic damages. \r\nBecause the jury found that the defendants were not liable, it\r\nnever reached the damages issue.  Therefore, the admission of the\r\nletter excerpts were, at the most, harmless error.\r\nThis argument has surface appeal but we reject it.  We\r\nnote that the cases cited by defendants in support of their\r\nposition are not cases involving the breach of discovery orders and\r\nthe discovery rules.  Defendants' precedential support consists of\r\ncases that focus on the judge's instructions after the admission or\r\nexclusion of evidence.  See Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Paria, 922\r\nF.2d 926 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nWhere there has been, as there was here, an egregious\r\nbreach of discovery orders and the discovery rules, we think that\r\nthe controlling case is Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).  The plaintiffs in Anderson sued for personal\r\ninjuries allegedly sustained because of toxic contamination to\r\nwater wells.  The jury found that the defendants were not\r\nresponsible for the pollution.  Shortly after the trial, the\r\nplaintiffs learned that the defendants had failed to disclose a\r\ngroundwater study during pretrial discovery.  Id. at 922.  The\r\nplaintiffs moved to set aside the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n60(b).  Id. at 923.  The district court denied the motion because\r\nthe \"plaintiffs had not been prevented from fully and fairly\r\npresenting their case.\"  Id. \r\nWe reviewed the district court's ruling for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  We noted that under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), \"the court\r\nmay relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or\r\nproceeding for . . . (3) fraud . . . (4) misrepresentation, or\r\nother misconduct of an adverse party.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)\r\n(emphasis added).  We held that the \"[f]ailure to disclose or\r\nproduce materials requested in discovery can constitute\r\n'misconduct' within the purview of this subsection.\"  Anderson at\r\n923 (citing Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1339 (5th Cir.\r\n1978)).\r\nWe defined misconduct as follows:\r\n\"Misconduct\" does not demand proof of\r\nnefarious intent or purpose as a prerequisite\r\nto redress.  For the term to have meaning in\r\nthe Rule 60(b)(3) context, it must differ from\r\nboth \"fraud\" and \"misrepresentation.\" \r\nDefinition of this difference requires us to\r\ntake an expansive view of \"misconduct.\"  The\r\nterm can cover even accidental omissions--\r\nelsewise it would be pleonastic, because\r\n\"fraud\" and \"misrepresentation\" would likely\r\nsubsume it.  Cf. United States v. One Douglas\r\nA-26B Aircraft, 662 F.2d 1372, 1374-75 n.6\r\n(11th Cir. 1981) (to avoid redundancy,\r\n\"misrepresentation\" in Rule 60(b)(3) must\r\nencompass more than false statements made with\r\nintent to deceive).  We think such a\r\nconstruction not overly harsh; it takes scant\r\nimagination to conjure up discovery responses\r\nwhich, though made in good faith, are so\r\nineptly researched or lackadaisical that they\r\ndeny the opposing party a fair trial. \r\nAccidents--at least avoidable ones--should not\r\nbe immune from the reach of the rule.  Thus,\r\nwe find ourselves in agreement with the Fifth\r\nCircuit that, depending upon the\r\ncircumstances, relief on the ground of\r\nmisconduct may be justified \"whether there was\r\nevil, innocent or careless, purpose.\"  Bros\r\nInc. v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 351 F.2d 208,\r\n211 (5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S.\r\n936, 86 S. Ct. 1065, 15 L. Ed. 2d 852 (1966).\r\n\nId. at 923.\r\n\nAnderson holds that any \"uncertainties attending the\r\napplication of hindsight in this area\" should favor the party that\r\nwas denied discovery because \"parties ought not to benefit from\r\ntheir own mis-, mal-, or nonfeasance.\"  862 F.2d at 924.\r\nWe concluded:\r\nTo summarize, in motions for a new trial\r\nunder the misconduct prong of Rule 60(b)(3),\r\nthe movant must show the opponent's misconduct\r\nby clear and convincing evidence.  Next, the\r\nmoving party must show that the misconduct\r\nsubstantially interfered with its ability\r\nfully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed\r\nat, trial.  This burden may be shouldered\r\neither by establishing the material's likely\r\nworth as trial evidence or by elucidating its\r\nvalue as a tool for obtaining meaningful\r\ndiscovery.  The burden can also be met by\r\npresumption or inference, if the movant can\r\nsuccessfully demonstrate that the misconduct\r\nwas knowing or deliberate.  Once a presumption\r\nof substantial interference arises, it can\r\nalone carry the day, unless defeated by a\r\nclear and convincing demonstration that the\r\nconsequences of the misconduct were nugacious. \r\nAlternatively, if unaided by a presumption--\r\nthat is, if the movant is unable to prove that\r\nthe misconduct was knowing or deliberate--it\r\nmay still prevail as long as it proves by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence that the\r\nnondisclosure worked some substantial\r\ninterference with the full and fair\r\npreparation or presentation of the case.\r\n\nId. at 926 (emphasis added).\r\nWe think this case falls well within the parameters of\r\nAnderson.  As already noted, there was, intentional or otherwise,\r\nan egregious breach of the discovery orders and the discovery rules\r\nwhich resulted in \"substantial interference with the full and fair\r\npreparation\" of plaintiff's case.  We cannot know with certainty\r\nwhat impact the letter excerpts had on the jury, but to dismiss\r\nwhat happened as harmless error would render the discovery rules\r\nand orders issued thereunder useless.  Moreover, where, as in this\r\ncase, undisclosed evidence is introduced at a key point in the\r\ntrial, it would be unrealistic to say that it had no effect on the\r\njury's determination as to liability.  If the jury decided that Dr.\r\nKlonoski was a tyrant as a husband and a liar, his chances of\r\nobtaining a favorable and fair verdict were destroyed.  We find\r\nthat the district court erred as a matter of law in allowing the\r\nletter excerpts into evidence and, as in Anderson, abused its\r\ndiscretion in not granting plaintiff's motion for a new trial.  \r\nIn Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d\r\n281 (1st Cir. 1993), we applied the Anderson misconduct test to a\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59 motion for a new trial.  Here, the plaintiff\r\nsought damages for emotional distress sustained because of her\r\nsister's death.  She alleged that one defendant drove into the\r\nsister while she was walking on the side of the road.  During the\r\ntrial, the plaintiff used a previously-undisclosed expert witness. \r\nId. at 286.  Prior to trial, the plaintiff never suggested that the\r\ndefendant's eyesight was at issue.  Id.  During the defendant's\r\ndirect examination, his lawyer noted he wore glasses and asked one\r\nquestion about them.  Id.  The plaintiff's lawyer focused on the\r\ndefendant's eyesight during cross-examination.  Id.  Following this\r\ntestimony, the plaintiff's lawyer sought to introduce an eye doctor\r\nas a \"rebuttal witness.\"  Id.  Despite contacting the doctor four\r\nmonths prior to trial, the plaintiff's lawyer never listed the\r\ndoctor as a potential witness.  Id.\r\nIn its decision to allow the doctor to testify, the\r\ndistrict court stated that \"there was 'no excuse as to why\r\n[counsel] kept [Dr. Kleis' testimony] under [his] sleeve until this\r\nmoment;' and . . . the proffered testimony changed the theory of\r\nthe case.\"  Id. at 287 (alterations in original).  Noting, however,\r\nthat this misconduct was not the plaintiff's fault, but rather her\r\ncounsel's, the district court admitted the testimony as an \"act of\r\njustice.\"  Id.\r\nWe found that this decision was an abuse of discretion. \r\nIn response to the district court's \"act of justice\" reason for\r\nadmitting the evidence, we stated that the court\r\nis aware of the difficulty of excluding highly\r\nrelevant and perhaps dispositive testimony\r\nwhich apparent substantive justice requires\r\nshould be considered by the jury.  Apparent\r\nsubstantive justice may be illusory, however,\r\nif the purportedly dispositive evidence is not\r\nsubject to a fair testing in an even-handed\r\nprocess.\r\n\nId. at 287 n.4.  Applying the analysis of Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a)\r\nused in Conway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 687 F.2d 108,\r\n111-12 (5th Cir. 1982), the Perez-Perez panel found that the\r\nundisclosed eye doctor \"exactly comports with\" the Fifth Circuit's\r\ndefinition of \"unfair surprise\" and prejudiced the defendants'\r\ncase.  Id. at 287.  Because the doctor's testimony introduced a\r\n\"novel theory of liability,\" defense counsel could not \"design an\r\nintelligent litigation strategy to address the charge of visual\r\nimpairment and . . . effectively cross-examine [him].\"  Id.  In\r\naddition, we found that the criteria for \"misconduct\" set forth in\r\nAnderson \"apply equally to this motion under Rule 59.\"  Id. at 288. \r\nThe same reasoning applies to the case before us.  We\r\nconclude that the district court's error in admitting Mrs.\r\nKlonoski's letters was prejudicial, not harmless. \r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\nWe find that the district court abused its discretion in\r\nallowing the excerpts from the letters in evidence.  There was a\r\nclear violation of the court's pretrial discovery orders and the\r\nrequirements of the discovery rules.  It follows that the court\r\nalso abused its discretion in denying plaintiff's motion for a new\r\ntrial.\r\nIn fairness to the district court, we must explain that\r\nour findings of abuse of discretion were not based on any arbitrary\r\nrefusal by the court to require compliance with its pretrial orders\r\nand the discovery rules.  Rather, the court's findings stemmed from\r\nits legally incorrect ruling that the letters fell within the\r\nimpeachment exception of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(3).  This does not\r\nmean that there was no abuse of discretion.  As the Supreme Court\r\nhas stated, \"[a] district court by definition abuses its discretion\r\nwhen it makes an error of law.\"  Koon v.

Plaintiff-appellant is Richard K.

On the thirteenth day of trial during cross-examination of Dr. Klonoski, the last witness in plaintiff's case, defendants disclosed for the first time and used letters written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister in Poland.  Excerpts from the letters were allowed in evidence.  Neither Dr. Klonoski nor his attorneys knew of the existence of the letters prior to this time, despite a court order requiring disclosure of such information prior to trial.  We find that this constituted trial by ambush.  We vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jolanta Klonoski and her husband, Dr. Klonoski, were the parents of two children:  Brian, born in Poland, and Karina, born in the United States.  Dr. Klonoski was born and raised in Connecticut.  He received his medical training in Poland where he met and married his wife.  After he finished his medical training, he, his wife, and their son, Brian, moved to the United States.  Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant with their third child in September or October of 1992.  At that time Dr. Klonoski was employed by Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital as a cardiologist.  On Saturday, May 8, 1993, at approximately 11:15 a.m., Mrs. Klonoski went to the Birthing Pavilion of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center because of vaginal spotting.  She was sent home in the afternoon.  Mrs. Klonoski returned to the Birthing Pavilion that night about 9:00 p.m. complaining of severe epigastric pain.  She remained in the hospital until her death on Monday, May 10, of a massive cerebral hemorrhage.  Prior to Mrs. Klonoski's death she was delivered of a healthy baby girl, subsequently named Caroline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski was in San Diego at a medical meeting of cardiologists on Saturday, May 8. He was notified late Saturday of his wife's admission to the hospital.  He flew home on Sunday, arriving at the hospital late in the day.  His wife was comatose and did not recognize him.  After conducting his own investigation into the cause of his wife's death, Dr. Klonoski consulted with an obstetrician in Connecticut and then brought suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>PRETRIAL DISCOVERY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is usual in a well prepared medical malpractice case, both sides engaged in extensive pretrial discovery and, as is also usual, the parties squabbled about what information should or should not be disclosed.  Over a year prior to trial, plaintiff disclosed, as part of the discovery process, the address in Poland where Mrs. Klonoski's father and sister lived, the address to which her letters (the evidence in dispute) were sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued a nineteen-page discovery order on July 19, 1996, covering disputes between the parties.  In part of its order, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>defendants shall produce a list of all persons known by them to possess discoverable information related to:  (1) marital discord between Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski; and (2) the paternity of Dr. Klonoski's youngest daughter.  To the extent defendants can more persuasively support their assertion that such a list (or the names of particular people which would otherwise appear on such a list) is protected by the work product doctrine (i.e., with references to precedent and/or scholarly writings on the subject), they shall provide plaintiffs with a privilege log as contemplated by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(5) and a list of cases and/or scholarly writings which specifically support their claim of privilege.  Plaintiffs will, of course, then be free to file an appropriate motion to compel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In its conclusion the court ordered:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Defendants shall produce a list of the names of individuals having knowledge of discoverable information relating to the issues of marital discord and paternity and a general description of the nature of that information on or before August 14, 1996.  To the extent that defendants are able, in good faith, to legally support an assertion of privilege with regard to some or all of those names, they shall produce a privilege log as described above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A final pretrial order was issued on December 19, 1996.  It provided that a jury would be drawn on January 7, 1997, and the presentation of evidence would commence on January 13.  The order noted that both parties had submitted requests for jury instructions.  After noting that some motions in limine had been filed, the court gave the parties until December 31, 1996 to file additional motions in limine, with objections to be filed not later than January 10, 1997.  Exhibits were to be premarked and submitted, along with any objections, not later than January 7, 1997.  Defendants were ordered to \"disclose all documents ordered disclosed after close of business on December 27, 1996, forthwith [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The penultimate paragraph stated in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All counsel and the court anticipate conducting a brief Daubert hearing prior to the testimony of plaintiffs' psychological expert, who is expected to testify as to the loss of enjoyment of life, or hedonic damage, aspect of the estate's wrongful death claim.  The court expects that that hearing will be held at some point during the first week of trial as is convenient to counsel, and the parties agree that one hour should be sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order also required a \"final will-call witness list.\"   The final paragraph exhorted the parties to try to settle the case.  It would appear from the order that all discovery had been completed and the case was ready for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DIRECT EXAMINATION OF DR. KLONOSKI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next set forth the pertinent parts of Dr. Klonoski's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After moving from Poland to the United States, Mrs. Klonoski wrote frequently to her family in Poland and sent packages to them.  Her father visited her and Dr. Klonoski, and stayed for six months.  She was quite happy when he was there, but felt lonely when he went back to Poland.  Dr. Klonoski was working long hours at the hospital in Connecticut where he was training.  Consequently, he was not spending much time at home with his family.  His wife complained about the long hours he had to spend at the hospital.  Mrs. Klonoski was thirty-five years of age.  She did not have a driver's license and was \"house-bound\" with their two small children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990 there was a period of stress in the marriage.  Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski \"had some strong discussions.\"  \"[T]here was a lot of stress between us.\"   The problem was that Mrs. Klonoski wanted her husband to spend more time at home with the family.  He could not accommodate her because he was in the residency program at the hospital which required that he spend a great deal of time there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski became angry at his wife and filed for divorce.  The divorce proceedings remained pending for four or five weeks.  The couple did not stop living together during this period.  There was more stress in the house, \"but everything typically went on.\"   At the end of the five-week period Dr. Klonoski and his wife talked things out and decided that they did not want a divorce, so the divorce proceeding was dropped.  In May of every year, Dr. Klonoski gave his wife one rose for each year that had passed since their first meeting in Poland.  In May of 1990 the doctor followed this ritual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Things eventually changed \"tremendously\" for the better.  Dr. Klonoski completed his residency program in June of 1990 and he went on to a sub-specialty program.  This enabled him to spend more time with his family.  Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant in June of 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski had been accepted into the cardiology program at the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital and the Hitchcock Clinic in 1989.  The family moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, in June of 1990.  Mrs. Klonoski was excited about the move.  It was \"a new stage in [their] lives.\"   When the Klonoskis relocated to Lebanon, Mrs. Klonoski was pregnant, their oldest child, Brian, was six, and their daughter Karina was three.  A short time later, in July 1990, Mrs. Klonoski had a miscarriage.  She was treated by doctors at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had to work harder than Polish doctors.  She did not like his going to medical conferences because he was away from the family too much.  Outside of this, things were \"going great\" between Dr. Klonoski and his wife.  She \"blossomed\" and became very self-confident and self-reliant.  She obtained a driver's license just before she left Connecticut for New Hampshire.  This helped a lot because she could go places with the children and do things.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1990 she obtained a job as a bank teller.  She also attended Lebanon College.  After she had been there a time, she was offered a position teaching Polish but refused because she did not want to take too much time away from the family.  She was devoted to the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant again in the fall of 1991.  She suffered another miscarriage.  Both spouses were devastated.  Routine testing was advised and Dr. Klonoski encouraged his wife to take the tests.  She did not, however, take all of the tests.  Generally speaking, Mrs. Klonoski was healthy.  She exercised by doing calisthenics and running.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski made a lot of friends in Lebanon.  She was ebullient, very outgoing, very effervescent.  Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski socialized occasionally, but were not party people.  They preferred to spend their leisure time together as a family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant again in September or October of 1992.  Both spouses were worried because of the prior miscarriages.  This was the pregnancy that ended in the birth of a daughter, Caroline, and Mrs. Klonoski's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was considerable testimony about Mrs. Klonoski's physical condition during the pregnancy.  She did not complain to her husband excessively.  In early spring, 1993, Dr. Klonoski accepted a fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  His wife was concerned about moving to Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The family attended Dr. Klonoski's brother's wedding on April 24, 1993.  He was an usher and his son, Brian, was the ring bearer.  A videotape taken at the wedding showing his wife and daughter was presented to the jury.  This was a good period during their marriage marred only by the worries both had about the pregnancy and the move to Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski was away at a medical conference in San Diego the week his wife was admitted to the hospital.  The conference was important to his career because of the knowledge he would get in his specialty and as a job forum.  He had skipped two prior conferences, once because his wife had asked him not to go and another time because she had recently had a miscarriage.  Mrs. Klonoski was \"not thrilled\" about his going to the conference, but she did not ask him not to go.  Other doctors and some nurses from the Hitchcock Hospital-Clinic establishment also attended the conference in San Diego.  Dr. Klonoski left for the conference on May 5;  his return was scheduled for May 9. His wife's due date was May 28.  Before he left he bought her a bouquet of her favorite flowers for Mother's Day on May 9. At the time Dr. Klonoski left, Mrs. Klonoski had not exhibited any signs of serious problems.  He was not even aware that his wife was ill when he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski called home on Friday evening.  His wife told him that everything went fine at her prenatal visit, but that she did not feel well and if she continued to feel badly, she would go to the doctor the next day.  She called the next day and told him that she continued to feel poorly and was going to the hospital.  She did not mention vaginal bleeding.  We have already related the essentials of what happened at the hospital when Dr. Klonoski visited his wife.  She was comatose by the time he arrived at the hospital and did not recognize him.  He was informed by a neurosurgeon that his wife was brain-dead due to a massive hemorrhage of her brain.  He was with her when the life supports were disconnected and she died.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct examination of Dr. Klonoski drew to a close with his statement, \"I loved my wife without reservation, and I still love her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DR. KLONOSKI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, it was established that Dr. Klonoski was suing, inter alia, as administrator of his wife's estate.  He acknowledged that his wife did not have a will and he knew he would receive the first $100,000 of his wife's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was brought out that initially after their marriage his wife stayed in Poland for a time while he was in the United States working as a medical clerk.  During this time he and his wife corresponded regularly.  All of his wife's letters to him were written in Polish.  In response to questions he stated that his wife had an older sister, named Marta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski testified, as he had on direct examination, that his wife's father had visited in the fall and winter of 1989-90.  Other than Christmas cards, he had not stayed in touch with his wife's family and had not sent them photographs of the children subsequent to his wife's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a series of questions about his wife's plans for the future.  He testified that he had no specific information about his wife's future plans.  He did not know any of his wife's friends who worked at the same bank as she did.  He had never met any of his wife's work-colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski testified that he and his wife planned the pregnancy that resulted in her death and the birth of their third child, Caroline.  He testified that everybody in the cardiology department was very helpful and supportive after his wife's death.  Money was collected for his family and food was prepared for the children and himself.  All of this was very helpful and he appreciated what was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then followed a series of questions setting the stage for the use of the letters that are the heart of this appeal.  Dr. Klonoski acknowledged that he was seeking damages for injury to the marital relationship with his wife and damages for his wife's loss of enjoyment of life.  In answer to a question, Dr. Klonoski agreed that the quality of the marital relationship would be an important factor in the enjoyment of life.  He also agreed that a good marriage would improve the quality of life.  Dr. Klonoski testified, as he had on direct examination, that by the time he and his wife and their two children moved to Lebanon, the marriage was getting along much better;  the primary ongoing issue was the time he spent away from the house and family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to a question, Dr. Klonoski testified that he knew that his wife corresponded with her father and sister, Marta, in Poland.  Dr. Klonoski was then asked:  \"[I]f I were to show you a letter, you'd certainly be able to recognize your wife's handwriting;  is that right?\"   The answer was \"Yes, I would.\"   After Dr. Klonoski testified that his wife's sister lived in Krakow, defense counsel began to show the witness a document marked for identification.  At this point, plaintiff's counsel requested a bench conference.  The request was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We feel it necessary to quote at length the bench conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  I don't have a clue what this is, but it's never been produced in discovery, and there is absolutely no question that we requested anything that they intend to use in this case.  I have no idea where it came from or what it might be. And I assume it's in Polish, so I can't read it, but really this is unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  What is it?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  It's impeachment.  This is a letter written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister Marta in Poland.  And this letter happens to have been written in late April of 1993 and early May of 1993, and it contains in it a description of a number of things, most prominently the marital relationship and the significant problems that Mrs. Klonoski believed existed at that time, and I don't believe--we actually just got that letter last night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, we had, as you recall, a court-ordered disclosure from them pertaining to anything to do with alleged marital discord.  This was not disclosed to us.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't know what he's doing, but it obviously doesn't give me the opportunity to speak, for example, to his sister--her sister, if that's the recipient.  I really think this is litigation by ambush and totally inappropriate.  This is a situation with an actual court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Your Honor, it's legitimate cross-examination.  We just got that last night based on the testimony that we had heard in this case, and it's legitimate cross-examination.  We are not required to disclose what we are going to use on cross-examination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We specifically brought it up with the Court, and you said for impeachment and credibility, we did not have to disclose it, and we didn't have it until last night.  But in any event, we want to use it for that purpose, and I think Attorney Lukey is entitled to go into those issues on reexamination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, he may not have to disclose it on a trial exhibit list, but in discovery he certainly has to disclose it if he has knowledge of it, and we actually had to get a court order to get their evidence on marital discord.  That was the reason we asked for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  But he didn't have it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

LUKEY:  He should have had it, and what is it that they're contending justifies ambushing us with it at this moment in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  We, frankly, haven't had the entire thing translated yet because it was received--this one was received this morning actually.  All we have had is a skeletal translation of it, your Honor, but I think at this point it's an admission by a party opponent.  It's her letter, and that's how it would come into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  What does it say?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Well, it says quite a few things.  He can translate it for us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  I can't determine the relevance of \"quite a few things.\"   That's not relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  I'll read you my understanding of it, but it's--this is the last letter from Jola.  This is a paraphrasing of it right now, your Honor.  We would ask him to read it because he can read Polish and he can translate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She goes on to the subject of his--of the pregnancy:  I'm afraid of what's going to happen.  He cares only about his career.  I was surprised by his announcement that he was leaving for California and for a business trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are problems with her spending habits.  He doesn't like it.  I bought a baby stroller, and he screamed at the top of his lungs.  I think we should get a divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She mentions that Richard is working so hard to become a cardiologist.  She doesn't say her situation will improve directly, but intimation is she has a stake--I don't understand what all that is.  I don't, frankly, know what everything is in there, but just the fact that she says she thinks we should get a divorce is enough, your Honor.  And he can translate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And its an admission....  This is a party-opponent admission.  And just as we're entitled to make the arguments that outweigh it, so, too, Attorney Lukey can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three more--four more of those.  That's the first of the ones that I intend to offer in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS LUKEY:  I would like to know how long they've known of the existence of these letters regardless of when they may have received this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT: I'll make a representation of that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  How long have you known?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  We've known about them, it's no more than two days.  We received the first of them--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  No, no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  How did you know they were there?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  We found Marta this week.  We found her three days ago.  We looked for her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  He's dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  And he's dead;  that's right.  He died last winter.  That's who we were trying to find.  Instead we found Marta this week, and I can certainly get somebody to prepare an affidavit to say that she was not spoken to until two days ago, and in fact we didn't get the first transcript of these letters until yesterday afternoon.  They were faxed from Poland last night.  The meeting with Marta took place last night in Poland.  They were faxed to us, and I spent most of the night up with these letters, and translators spent most of the night with the letters, too.  We have the other letters translated.  This one we just received within two hours.  So we haven't had it fully translated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  I have a serious issue with this, your Honor.  It's a little bit like springing Dawn Rafferty on us right after Christmas when she turns out to be Linda Bowers' niece, and they've known about her right along.  There's nothing that I heard to suggest this is not something they could have determined earlier if they intended to use it.  This is truly an ambush.  They knew about her sister.  That's not new.  I don't know what it is they think is new about this.  But the fact that they choose to wait until three and a half weeks into a trial and then spring it on us as purported impeachment I find extremely troubling and inconsistent with the rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also have a very strong suspicion that the reason that they made a point with you in our pretrial conference some months ago of saying we don't have to show any impeachment, right, is because they knew exactly what they intended to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't know what Jola wrote, and it's clear that Dr. Klonoski doesn't know what Jola wrote.  I find it very upsetting and extremely inconsistent with the open disclosure rules of current litigation that this would occur.  This is the kind of thing that occurred 25 years ago and was the whole reason the Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted.  I mean I've built a whole case obviously, and they're suddenly coming in and trying to spring something on me about what the wife supposedly felt.  She's dead.  I can't ask her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I do not feel this is appropriate.  I have heard nothing from Mr. Bassett that suggests why he couldn't have come up with this earlier if it was something they intended to use.  You don't keep investigating the case when the trial is in process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Yes, you do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  A lot of people do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  But it's inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Based on the type of testimony we got in this case--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  What in this case has justified this that you didn't know before?MR. BASSETT:  We couldn't find them, and we found them now, your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  All you had to do was ask for the address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, my problem is the method that they've done this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Your problem is you don't accept that they just knew about it.  I do accept that they did just find out as he's represented to me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  It isn't just whether they just knew about it.  You're right.  I do not believe that they just found out about it.  You're absolutely correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But quite apart from that is the fact that what one is supposed to do is to do one's discovery and so forth for trial by the discovery disclosure date in order to ensure under the Rules of Civil Procedure, the information you come up with is shared if appropriately requested by the other party.  In this case it was not only requested, we had to get a court order.  We got the court order regarding all evidence they had on the subject of alleged marital discord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  That was to identify the witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Take the next step.  Then you have all the evidence they had on marital discord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  And, frankly, that evidence doesn't trouble me.  Then they come up with this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  That's a different test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  I understand, your Honor.  My point is if it were in fact the case that it was okay to send your investigator out while the trial was in progress, what everyone would do in order to avoid the necessity of disclosing materials that are particularly good for ambushing the other side is not do their investigation until the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, I hear you, but I don't agree with you.  You took the initiative to put on the evidence of a good marriage, stable marriage.  Everything's hunky-dory and wonderful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  As far as he knew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, as far as he knew.  But to the extent that's relevant, I've already--my view, I don't think it's particularly relevant one way or the other.  But both of you think it is, and once you do that, they have a right to then challenge whether that was the case.  If they just got this and they're going to use it for impeachment, I think they have a right to do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  All right.  I'll allow their use, Mr. Bassett.  They'll be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, there's one other issue that I think--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Not yet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  There is one other issue that I think--I'm a little troubled about here that I would raise to you.  This doesn't give me the opportunity to find out from the sister whether there's more to the story, more letters, another side, an explanation, whatever.  I mean I cannot imagine, short of paying out large sums of money, what would cause a sister to turn over these letters, which has me a bit troubled, and I would like to know if there is more.  I can't do that in the middle of trial.  I'm about to close in--you know, ten minutes after he finishes his cross.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I do remind the Court again, he placed me in an impossible position in that regard because I don't know whether there's more out there, another side to the story or some explanation.  Nor do I know whether money has changed hands.  I don't know anything.  I cannot imagine why a sister would turn these over to be used against her sister's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  I'm not sure that's relevant.  The only question is are they legitimate documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  But my ability to examine Marta is essentially nonexistent because of the fact that--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, I'm not sure Marta makes a difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Well she might make a difference if it turns out that there are other letters, ones that came after, ones that came before, explanatory letters, phone conversations, none of which I can possibly know.  I don't know if this is complete.  I don't know if--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Are you asking for a continuance?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  No, I'm not asking for a continuance.  I'm asking to have these documents excluded, your Honor, on the basis that it's litigation by ambush.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Yeah.  That objection has been overruled.  All right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Dr. Klonoski identified the letters as being in his wife's handwriting, the court held an extended hearing on their admissibility.  After considering the arguments of counsel it issued rulings accompanied by comments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p>I think these letters pose a substantial risk of unfair prejudice that would outweigh their probative value.  I think their probative value, to the extent they have any probative value, lies on the fact of whether or not there was marital discord, whether a divorce was impending, whether she was happy or not in the marriage, why she was unhappy, and the degree of her unhappiness, as expressed in some of these statements, I think might be tangentially relevant.  But to present that evidence in this form to the jury poses a very grave risk that they would start to be inflamed or distracted onto issues that aren't relevant in the case;  that is, was Jolanta Klonoski a good or bad person?   More importantly, was Dr. Klonoski a good or bad person?   And factor that into their award, if there is an award, and they shouldn't.  I think we all agree they shouldn't be factoring that into their award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, they're probably cumulative anyway, because you put in--in fact, your case seems to be three experts and everybody says there's a bad marriage.  So in a sense it's cumulative.  So I agree it's better to have words in the decedent's mouth, so I'm willing to cut you some slack in that regard.  And despite Attorney Lukey's, I think, well-taken position that these are pretty late in the ball game and she doesn't really have a great opportunity to deal with that, but I'm not going to give you the ruling, Attorney Lukey.  What I'm going to do is give you some relief by limiting the admissibility of these statements to those statements that directly speak about her unhappiness in the marriage, but not in histrionic terms and not in terms that pose a risk of appealing to the passion, prejudice of the jury, and not in terms that pose a risk of putting Dr. Klonoski in such a bad light that that might affect an award in this case.  Like I said, I'll give you a chance to rebut, if you can and want to, just as to these statements, but I can't imagine you will want to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my judgment--well, as I think about it, it's probably an inconsistent view myself, but having read these documents, the four documents you presented, it's my conclusion that--certainly to the extent that you claim anything is relevant in there, most of it is not relevant.  Material statements that are made in these documents that might be relevant that seem to portray the former plaintiff, Dr. Klonoski, in a very poor light are not relevant to the issue of Mrs. Klonoski's future hedonic damages.  To the extent they are relevant, or one might argue that they are relevant as a predictor or prognostication of her future happiness, I find that those statements, though relevant in that respect, would, nevertheless, be excluded.  I do exclude them on grounds that their probative value is far outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice in that those statements would tend to, in my judgment, distract the jury and confuse the jury and inflame the passions and prejudice of the jury, such that they may be at risk of focusing on the nature of Dr. Klonoski as a person in calculating a damages award for the estate, which we all agree would not be proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent--to the limiting [sic] extent it gives a marriage view different than this--than Dr. Klonoski and others portrayed, I think they are relevant.  And I think by going through the letters and allowing you to admit those portions of the letters that give that contrary view, without the inflammatory baggage of the other statements and comments in the letters, I think your interests are fairly protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So that's my ruling, I acknowledge that Attorney Lukey makes a very good point about late discovery, not that you've violated my order of disclosure.  I find that you've not.  And not that you had the document in a--in a timely fashion that you could have delivered them to the plaintiffs in a meaningful timely way.  I find you didn't.  But she is somewhat at a prejudicial point in that there are other letters that may present a different view altogether of this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But again, we're at the point where I think we're cumulative anyway on the item of was there discord or not discord in the marriage, and--that's not a very major issue in the case, in any event.  So here is what the potentially inconsistent part, I suppose, with respect to all of those other statements in these letters that I have not agreed to allow you to read to the jury or present to the jury.  I would--I also exclude those on grounds that, to the extent they are inflammatory but fall below the line of proposing an unfair risk of substantial prejudice, outweighing their probative value, I would exclude them on the additional independent grounds that Attorney Lukey does not have the opportunity to have those other nine letters translated and examined for the possibility that they may have equally praiseworthy and laudatory comments about Dr. Klonoski in them.  So who knows.  Maybe they would balance them off.  So that's just another independent reason why I wouldn't allow the statements to be denigrating of Dr. Klonoski or certainly his relatives into evidence.  All right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court allowed the following excerpts in evidence.

Joan Conrad worked in the cardiology department and became acquainted with Dr. Klonoski.  When she congratulated him on the coming birth of another child, he said:  \"It wasn't my idea.  This wasn't planned.\"   When Conrad asked Dr. Klonoski about his wife, he replied:  \"She's always complaining, lots of aches and pains.

Accompanied by Dr. Klonoski's parents, he met Dr. Klonoski at the Lebanon Airport on his return from the meeting in San Diego, and drove him to the hospital.  Dr. Robb testified that Dr. Klonoski was crying when Dr. Robb picked him up at the airport, that he was \"very distraught and upset\" and \"grieving.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellen Fullington was a medical secretary at the Hitchcock Hospital.

Mrs. Klonoski complained that her husband was only interested in money.  He worked extremely long hours and did not pay attention to her or the children.

It is obvious that defendants did not follow the strictures of Rule 26(a)(3)(C) with respect to the letters from Mrs. Klonoski to her sister.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the mandatory pretrial disclosures, parties may obtain discovery of further matter by various methods.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(5).  Rule 26(b)(1) defines the scope and limits of discovery:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Discovery Scope and Limits.  Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) In General.  Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.  The information sought need not be admissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).  Like Rule 26(a)(3)(C), Rule 26(b)(1) provides no exception for documents found during belated investigation that takes place after the trial has begun.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  On the contrary, the plain language of this Rule 26(b)(1) contemplates wide-ranging discovery to the fullest possible extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a broad reading is supported by leading Supreme Court precedent.  As the Court stated in Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 98 S.Ct. 2380, 57 L.Ed.2d 253 (1978), the word \"relevant\" encompasses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p>any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that could bear on, any issue that is or may be in the case....  [D]iscovery is not limited to issues raised by the pleadings, for discovery itself is designed to help define and clarify the issues.  Nor is discovery limited to the merits of a case, for a variety of fact-oriented issues may arise during litigation that are not related to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 351, 98 S.Ct. 2380 (citing Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 501, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hickman, the Court characterized the \"pre-trial deposition-discovery mechanism established by Rules 26 to 37[as] one of the most significant innovations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"  Hickman, 329 U.S. at 500, 67 S.Ct. 385.   The Court went on to discuss the purpose of the discovery rules:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p>Under the prior federal practice, the pre-trial functions of notice-giving, issue-formulation and fact-revelation were performed primarily and inadequately by the pleadings.  Inquiry into the issues and the facts before trial was narrowly confined and was often cumbersome in method.  The new rules, however, restrict the pleadings to the task of general notice-giving and invest the deposition-discovery process with a vital role in the preparation for trial.  The various instruments of discovery now serve (1) as a device, along with the pre-trial hearing under Rule 16, to narrow and clarify the basic issues between the parties, and (2) as a device for ascertaining the facts, or information as to the existence or whereabouts of facts, relative to those issues.  Thus civil trials in the federal courts no longer need be carried on in the dark.  The way is now clear, consistent with recognized privileges, for the parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts before trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 500-01, 67 S.Ct. 385 (emphasis added;  footnotes omitted).  The Court added that the \"deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment.\"  Id. at 507, 67 S.Ct. 385.   This is because[m]utual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation.  To that end, either party may compel the other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession.  The deposition-discovery procedure simply advances the stage at which the disclosure can be compelled from the time of trial to the period preceding it, thus reducing the possibility of surprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in United States v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 78 S.Ct. 983, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958), the Court stated that \"[m]odern instruments of discovery serve a useful purpose....  They together with pretrial procedures make a trial less a game of blindman's bluff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practicable extent.   Only strong public policies weigh against disclosure.\"  Id. at 682, 78 S.Ct. 983 (emphasis added;  citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the plain language of Rule 26 and the broad scope that it has been given, it would appear that Mrs. Klonoski's letters fit well within the rule's reach.  The letters plainly contain information \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1).  As noted, Rule 26 provides no exception for documents found after discovery deadlines have passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent the rules contemplate additional material that a party finds after it has provided discovery to the other side, the rules require prompt supplementation of its additional material so the opposing party is not misled by the original discovery responses as the opposing party prepares its case for trial.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e).  Rule 26(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) Supplementation of Disclosures and Responses.  A party who has made a disclosure under subdivision (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the following circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals its disclosures under subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e).  In the instant case, the defendants provided no supplementation of their prior disclosures by adding the letters in question to the list of evidence to be offered at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were significantly amended, particularly Rules 26(e) and 37(c)(1).  The changes to Rule 26(e) substantially expanded the duty to supplement.  Under the pre-1993 version of Rule 26(e), supplementation was required only in a few, limited circumstances.  The current version of the rule, as quoted supra, imposes a broad requirement on parties to update their earlier disclosures and discovery responses.  See 8 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2049.1 (2d ed.  1994 &amp; Supp.1998) (\"Wright &amp; Miller\").  Thus, even if the defendants could argue that the pre-1993 rule might not have required them to disclose the letters to the plaintiff, they have no such argument under the 1993 amendments to the supplementation requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p>IS PRECLUSION THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1993 amendments to the Federal Rules also added Rule 37(c)(1) which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Failure to Disclose;  False or Misleading Disclosure;  Refusal to Admit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(1) shall not, unless such failure is harmless, be permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.  In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions.  In addition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, these sanctions may include any of the actions authorized under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule and may include informing the jury of the failure to make the disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to adoption of Rule 37(c)(1), no rule specifically provided sanctions for the failure to supplement discovery.  Courts were free to apply their discretion in sanctioning Rule 26(e) violations.  The new rule is mandatory:  a party that fails to make the required disclosures \"shall not, unless such failure is harmless, be permitted to use [undisclosed] evidence at a trial.\"  Id. To be sure, the rule somewhat tempers this mandate by permitting courts to excuse failures to disclose to some degree (i.e., to impose other sanctions \"in lieu of this sanction\").  Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).  But the new rule clearly contemplates stricter adherence to discovery requirements, and harsher sanctions for breaches of this rule, and the required sanction in the ordinary case is mandatory preclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before the 1993 amendments, in National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976) (per curiam), the Supreme Court stressed the policy reasons for enforcing the discovery rules.  The most severe sanctions provided by the rules, the Court explained, \"must be available to the district court in appropriate cases, not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\"  Id. at 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778.   While a warning alone might have made the plaintiffs in that case comply with all future discovery orders, \"other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts.\"  Id. Thus, enforcement of discovery rules and orders is necessary, the Court concluded, to prevent abuse by future litigants.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears, therefore, that the letters in question were covered by the disclosure requirements of Rule 26, including the duty to supplement, and that defendants' failure to disclose them prior to trial precluded defendants from using the letters at trial.  The district court did not take this position because it found the letters to fall within an exception to the discovery rules for material that is presented \"solely for impeachment purposes.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DO THE LETTERS FALL WITHIN AN EXCEPTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p>TO THE DISCOVERY RULES?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26(a)(3) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial Disclosures.   In addition to the disclosures required in the preceding paragraphs, a party shall provide to other parties [certain delineated] information regarding the evidence that it may present at trial other than solely for impeachment purposes: ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Rule itself nor the advisory notes define impeachment evidence.  The federal cases that have decided whether evidence falls within the impeachment exception to the discovery rules are, for the most part, personal injury cases.  They frequently deal with two kinds of evidence:  video surveillance tapes of a plaintiff's activities subsequent to the injury giving rise to the suit;  and information that a defendant has of the plaintiff's prior medical history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Although some district courts have found video surveillance tapes to be \"solely\" impeachment evidence, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3), the weight of authority seems to be that such evidence is both impeaching and substantive and should be disclosed.  See Wegner v. Cliff Viessman, Inc., 153 F.R.D. 154, 157-59 (N.D.Iowa 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And this approach makes evidentiary sense.  As the Wright and Miller treatise put it, after reviewing the case law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p>If a party plans to testify to one version of the facts, and the opponent has evidence supporting a different version of the facts, the opponent's evidence will tend to impeach the party by contradiction, but if discovery of this kind of evidence is not permitted the discovery rules might as well be repealed.  Even those who have been most concerned about protecting impeachment material recognize that substantive evidence must be subject to discovery even though it also tends to contradict evidence of the discovering party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 Wright &amp; Miller, supra, &#167; 2015, at 212 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only circuit court that directly addresses this subject is Chiasson v. Zapata Gulf Marine Corp., 988 F.2d 513 (5th Cir.1993).  In holding that a video surveillance tape was not \"solely\" impeachment evidence, the court defined substantive evidence as \"that which is offered to establish the truth of a matter to be determined by the trier of fact.\"  Id. at 517.   It then stated:  \"Impeachment evidence, on the other hand, is that which is offered to 'discredit a witness ... to reduce the effectiveness of [her] testimony by bringing forth evidence which explains why the jury should not put faith in [her] ... testimony.' \"  Id. (alterations in original) (quoting John P. Frank, Pretrial Conferences and Discovery--Disclosure or Surprise?, 1965 Ins. Law J. 661, 664 (1965)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court recognized that some evidence serves both functions, and, because such evidence is not \"solely offered for impeachment,\" it is not covered by the exception to the Rule 26 discovery requirements.  The court held:  \"Because the tape is, at the very least, in part substantive, it should have been disclosed prior to trial, regardless of its impeachment value.\"  Id. at 517-18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true of the disputed evidence here.  The excerpts from the letters written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister were at least in part substantive, and therefore they did not fall within the \"solely for impeachment\" exception of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).  The letter excerpts constituted substantive evidence because, separate and apart from whether they contradicted Dr. Klonoski's testimony, they tended \"to establish the truth of a matter to be determined by the trier of fact.\"  Chiasson, 988 F.2d at 518.   This is true even though, in addition to their substantive content, the excerpts tended to contradict Dr. Klonoski's testimony regarding the state of his marriage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We hold, therefore, that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in finding the letter excerpts to fall within the exception to the discovery rules for evidence introduced \"solely for impeachment purposes\" of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think that Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2) opens the evidence door to the excerpts because they are admissions against a party opponent, as defendants argue.  The question is not the admissibility of the excerpts under the Federal Rules of Evidence but whether they were barred because their introduction violated the pretrial discovery orders of the district court and federal discovery rules.  The rules of evidence do not trump the discovery rules contained in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The purpose of the discovery rules is to provide for the \"fullest possible\" pretrial disclosure of admissible evidence, to \"reduc[e] the possibility of surprise,\" Hickman, 329 U.S. at 500-01, 67 S.Ct. 385, and to insure \"a fair contest,\" Procter &amp; Gamble, 356 U.S. at 682, 78 S.Ct. 983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have discussed, supra, absent some unusual extenuating circumstances not present here, the appropriate sanction when a party fails to provide certain evidence to the opposing party as required in the discovery rules is preclusion of that evidence from the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recently condemned trial by ambush tactics and for this reason vacated a verdict returned for the defendant.  Licciardi v. TIG Ins. Group, 140 F.3d 357 (1st Cir.1998), centered on the testimony of a medical expert who:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p>changed course 180 degrees from his report in his testimony on a key topic at the heart of plaintiff's case.  Further, he went into a new area of testimony.  There was no prior disclosure of the coming volte face;  indeed there was a misrepresentation in the supplemental answer to interrogatories filed two days after the jury was impaneled that the expert's testimony would be the same as in his initial report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 359 (footnote omitted).  We found this \"volte face\" to be \"highly prejudicial to plaintiff's case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the focus of Licciardi was on the divergence between the pretrial disclosure of the testimony of a party's expert witness and his trial testimony.  This court's forthright condemnation of trial by ambush, however, applies to what happened in the case before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Labadie Coal Co. v. Black, 672 F.2d 92 (D.C.Cir.1982), is factually closer to the situation before us.  In Labadie, the D.C. Circuit found that the district court's admission of documents was erroneous and prejudicial because plaintiff was not given notice of the documents until after it had rested its case on the last day of trial.  The court noted that \"when the documents were finally produced, [plaintiff] had little, if any, time effectively to ... cross-examine [defendant] as to their content.\"  Id. at 94-95.   In the present case, plaintiff was even more prejudiced by the lack of discovery.  He had virtually finished presenting his entire case to the jury;  Dr. Klonoski's direct testimony had been completed.  His depiction of the state of the marriage was very different from the way he would have characterized it if his late wife's letters had been disclosed to him prior to his testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot help being impressed by the exquisite timing of the injection of the letters into the trial.  Dr. Klonoski, the last witness in the plaintiff's case, had finished his direct testimony.  The plaintiff's case had been completed.  Cross-examination started with some innocuous questions.  This was followed by what clearly were questions setting up Dr. Klonoski for the introduction of the letters.  Whether by design or accident the timing could not have been better for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Policy reasons also militate against the district court's ruling that the letters are exceptions to the discovery rule.  If letters or other documents are allowed in evidence after a trial starts for the sole reason that they were not obtained sooner by the party offering them, the rules of discovery and court orders pertaining thereto would become empty phrases signifying nothing.  Trial by ambush would be re-born.  Enforcement of discovery rules and orders is necessary to prevent abuse by future litigants.  See National Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE ADEQUACY OF DEFENDANTS' EXPLANATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel argued successfully to the district court that the reason the letters had not been disclosed was that counsel had not received them until two days prior to the start of their cross-examination and did not have an opportunity prior to their use at trial to have them translated from Polish to English.  This explanation was accepted by the district judge.  But it is beside the point.  The fact that a party had not actually obtained certain documents before the discovery deadline does not excuse a violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The belated appearance of the letters violated the plain meaning and the intent of the discovery rules.  It also ignored the specific requirements of the court's pretrial discovery orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The contents of Mrs. Klonoski's letters were not disclosed prior to trial, as they should have been under the July 16, 1996 discovery order which provided specifically:  \"defendants shall produce a list of all persons known by them to possess discoverable information related to:  (1) marital discord between Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski ... and a general description of the nature of that information.\"   The final pretrial order was based on the parties' representations that discovery had been completed and the case was ready for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the defendants be excused for their failure to comply.  That defense counsel did not obtain the letters until two days before their use at trial on cross-examination does not make them admissible.  Defendants had been furnished with the address of Mrs. Klonoski's father in Poland more than a full year before trial.  Her father and sister lived at the same address.  The defendants could, at that time, have undertaken the same investigation that for some unexplained reason did not come to fruition until the trial was near completion.  They have offered no legitimate explanation for why they waited as long as they did, knowing that the federal rules and the court had required them to disclose potential trial exhibits and all relevant responses to discovery requests well before the trial began.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  This suggests that the defendants may have been, at best, either lax or negligent in pursuing pretrial discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defense counsel admitted that they at least knew about the letters and the general outlines of their contents two days earlier than they disclosed them, i.e., they knew about them before Dr. Klonoski testified on direct.  Counsel could have put plaintiff on notice that certain new and hitherto undisclosed evidence was on the verge of becoming available on the issue of marital discord.  If such notice had been given at that point, prior to Dr. Klonoski's testimony on direct, then undoubtedly his testimony would have been different and the present problem would most likely never have arisen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE DISTRICT COURT'S RULING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reading the district court's rulings and comments, we have difficulty understanding the basis of its decision to allow excerpts from the letters to be read to the jury.  The first paragraph of the court's order states:  \"I think these letters pose a substantial risk of unfair prejudice that would outweigh their probative value.\"   Despite this pronouncement, the court admitted excerpts from the letters into evidence.  With due respect, we do not think that the prejudice was reduced appreciably by limiting the court's ruling to the excerpts read to the jury.  In fact, by shortening lengthy letters and allowing into evidence only the inflammatory portions, their prejudicial impact was probably heightened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also puzzled by the statement:  \"I acknowledge that Attorney Lukey makes a very good point about late discovery, not that you've violated my order of disclosure.  I find that you've not.\"   The only basis for this finding was that the court believed the letter fell within the impeachment exception provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).  We have found, supra, that the exception does not apply.  Clearly the introduction of the letters without prior notice to plaintiff violated the pretrial discovery order of July 19 and the final pretrial order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the court's statement that Attorney Lukey \"is somewhat at a prejudicial point in that there are other letters that may present a different view altogether of this.\"   We believe this greatly understated the predicament in which plaintiff's attorney found herself.  First, Attorney Lukey was correct that, because of the defendants' failure to provide these letters during the discovery process, plaintiff's counsel was unable to conduct her own investigation which might uncover other letters from Mrs. Klonoski explaining what she wrote in the letters introduced by defendants, or which might demonstrate that Mrs. Klonoski's anger was a passing feeling that did not reflect her overall view of the marriage.  But more critically, plaintiff had already planned and executed his trial strategy based on the evidence available to the parties through discovery.  He had presented his entire case, including the direct examination of his lead witness.  To spring these letters--hitherto unknown by plaintiff and his attorneys--upon the plaintiff at that stage of the litigation was a lot more than \"somewhat ... prejudicial.\"   Realistically, it was devastating to his ability to succeed with the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A CONTINUANCE AS A POSSIBLE REMEDY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court asked plaintiff's counsel at least twice if she wanted a continuance.  She said she did not want one because she did not think it would do any good.  It is true, as defendants argue, that in some cases we have found that surprise evidence could be combated by granting a continuance to the surprised party.  See Newell Puerto Rico, Ltd. v. Rubbermaid, Inc., 20 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir.1994).  In Licciardi we discussed at length the effectiveness of a continuance as an antidote to surprise evidence.  140 F.3d at 366-67.   As we stated there:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p>It is true that, where effective to counteract the surprise to one party wrought by the other party's failure to abide by Rule 26, a continuance or the calling of a rebuttal witness is preferable to terminating the trial and beginning anew.  However, a continuance is not effective in every circumstance to counteract the unfair surprise.  See Thibeault [v. Square D Co.], 960 F.2d [239,] 246 [ (1st Cir.1992) ] (\"[A] continuance is often ineffectual as a sanction and unfair to both the court and the opposing party.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Licciardi, 140 F.3d at 366.   We found no practical way for the plaintiff to remedy the surprise;  any solution would have prejudiced the plaintiff even more.  Id. at 366.   We thought it important to consider the policy behind the discovery rules.  Directly contrary to this policy, granting a continuance, we found, would create greater incentives for attorneys to violate Rule 26(e).  Id.;  see also National Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778 (Strict sanctions are necessary \"to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\").  \"Such conduct should not be rewarded.\"  Licciardi, 140 F.3d at 367.   And as we also noted in Thibeault:  \"If continuances were granted as a matter of course for violations of Rule 26(e), the rule could always be disregarded with impunity.\"  Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 246;  see also Freund, 956 F.2d at 359.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this rationale applies with equal force to the instant case.  We fail to see how a continuance could have accomplished anything in this case.  As plaintiff's counsel pointed out orally at the hearing on the admissibility of the letters, the only thing she could have done was to take the deposition of Dr. Klonoski's sister-in-law to find out as much as she could about the letters.  Because of the distances involved and the language problems, this would have necessitated a lengthy continuance.  A continuance was not a practical alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, short of a new trial, a continuance would have accomplished nothing at all to mitigate the prejudice caused to plaintiff's case by defendants' having waited until after Dr. Klonoski had finished his direct testimony before disclosing the letters to the plaintiff.  As noted supra, defense counsel knew about the letters prior to Dr. Klonoski's testimony.  If counsel had notified the plaintiff at that point, then perhaps a continuance might have been the appropriate remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A continuance would have been an inadequate remedy in this case also because of the policy concerns regarding incentives for parties to comply with discovery rules.  See National Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778 (Absent strict sanctions, \"other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts.\").  As plaintiff's counsel told the district court, if we were to condone the procedure followed by the defendants in this case, then \"what everyone would do in order to avoid the necessity of disclosing materials that are particularly good for ambushing the other side is not do their investigation until the time of trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p>IS A NEW TRIAL REQUIRED?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants argue that, even if the district court erred by admitting the letter excerpts into evidence and allowing the defendants to use them in cross-examining Dr. Klonoski, a new trial is not warranted because the letter excerpts could have had no effect on the jury's verdict of no liability.  Their contention can be summarized as follows.  In his jury instructions, the district court judge told the jury to consider the letter excerpts only in its determination of hedonic damages.  Because the jury found that the defendants were not liable, it never reached the damages issue.  Therefore, the admission of the letter excerpts were, at the most, harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has surface appeal but we reject it.  We note that the cases cited by defendants in support of their position are not cases involving the breach of discovery orders and the discovery rules.  Defendants' precedential support consists of cases that focus on the judge's instructions after the admission or exclusion of evidence.  See Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Pavia, 922 F.2d 926 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where there has been, as there was here, an egregious breach of discovery orders and the discovery rules, we think that the controlling case is Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910 (1st Cir.1988).  The plaintiffs in Anderson sued for personal injuries allegedly sustained because of toxic contamination to water wells.  The jury found that the defendants were not responsible for the pollution.  Shortly after the trial, the plaintiffs learned that the defendants had failed to disclose a groundwater study during pretrial discovery.  Id. at 922.   The plaintiffs moved to set aside the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).  Id. at 923.   The district court denied the motion because the \"plaintiffs had not been prevented from fully and fairly presenting their case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reviewed the district court's ruling for abuse of discretion.  We noted that under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), \"the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for ... (3) fraud ... (4) misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) (emphasis added).  We held that the \"[f]ailure to disclose or produce materials requested in discovery can constitute 'misconduct' within the purview of this subsection.\"  Anderson at 923 (citing Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1339 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We defined misconduct as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p>\"Misconduct\" does not demand proof of nefarious intent or purpose as a prerequisite to redress.  For the term to have meaning in the Rule 60(b)(3) context, it must differ from both \"fraud\" and \"misrepresentation.\"   Definition of this difference requires us to take an expansive view of \"misconduct.\"   The term can cover even accidental omissions--elsewise it would be pleonastic, because \"fraud\" and \"misrepresentation\" would likely subsume it.  Cf. United States v. One Douglas A-26B Aircraft, 662 F.2d 1372, 1374-75 n. 6 (11th Cir.1981) (to avoid redundancy, \"misrepresentation\" in Rule 60(b)(3) must encompass more than false statements made with intent to deceive).  We think such a construction not overly harsh;  it takes scant imagination to conjure up discovery responses which, though made in good faith, are so ineptly researched or lackadaisical that they deny the opposing party a fair trial.  Accidents--at least avoidable ones--should not be immune from the reach of the rule.  Thus, we find ourselves in agreement with the Fifth Circuit that, depending upon the circumstances, relief on the ground of misconduct may be justified \"whether there was evil, innocent or careless, purpose.\"  Bros Inc. v. W.E. Grace Mfg. Co., 351 F.2d 208, 211 (5th Cir.1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 936, 86 S.Ct. 1065, 15 L.Ed.2d 852 (1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 923.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson holds that any \"uncertainties attending the application of hindsight in this area\" should favor the party that was denied discovery because \"parties ought not to benefit from their own mis-, mal-, or nonfeasance.\"  862 F.2d at 924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, in motions for a new trial under the misconduct prong of Rule 60(b)(3), the movant must show the opponent's misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.

This burden may be shouldered either by establishing the material's likely worth as trial evidence or by elucidating its value as a tool for obtaining meaningful discovery.  The burden can also be met by presumption or inference, if the movant can successfully demonstrate that the misconduct was knowing or deliberate.  Once a presumption of substantial interference arises, it can alone carry the day, unless defeated by a clear and convincing demonstration that the consequences of the misconduct were nugacious.  Alternatively, if unaided by a presumption--that is, if the movant is unable to prove that the misconduct was knowing or deliberate--it may still prevail as long as it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the nondisclosure worked some substantial interference with the full and fair preparation or presentation of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 926 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this case falls well within the parameters of Anderson.   As already noted, there was, intentional or otherwise, an egregious breach of the discovery orders and the discovery rules which resulted in \"substantial interference with the full and fair preparation\" of plaintiff's case.  We cannot know with certainty what impact the letter excerpts had on the jury, but to dismiss what happened as harmless error would render the discovery rules and orders issued thereunder useless.  Moreover, where, as in this case, undisclosed evidence is introduced at a key point in the trial, it would be unrealistic to say that it had no effect on the jury's determination as to liability.  If the jury decided that Dr. Klonoski was a tyrant as a husband and a liar, his chances of obtaining a favorable and fair verdict were destroyed.  We find that the district court erred as a matter of law in allowing the letter excerpts into evidence and, as in Anderson, abused its discretion in not granting plaintiff's motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Perez-Perez v. Popular Leasing Rental, Inc., 993 F.2d 281 (1st Cir.1993), we applied the Anderson misconduct test to a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 motion for a new trial.  Here, the plaintiff sought damages for emotional distress sustained because of her sister's death.  She alleged that one defendant drove into the sister while she was walking on the side of the road.  During the trial, the plaintiff used a previously-undisclosed expert witness.  Id. at 286.   Prior to trial, the plaintiff never suggested that the defendant's eyesight was at issue.  Id. During the defendant's direct examination, his lawyer noted he wore glasses and asked one question about them.  Id. The plaintiff's lawyer focused on the defendant's eyesight during cross-examination.  Id. Following this testimony, the plaintiff's lawyer sought to introduce an eye doctor as a \"rebuttal witness.\"  Id. Despite contacting the doctor four months prior to trial, the plaintiff's lawyer never listed the doctor as a potential witness.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its decision to allow the doctor to testify, the district court stated that \"there was 'no excuse as to why [counsel] kept [Dr. Kleis' testimony] under [his] sleeve until this moment;' and ... the proffered testimony changed the theory of the case.\"  Id. at 287 (alterations in original).  Noting, however, that this misconduct was not the plaintiff's fault, but rather her counsel's, the district court admitted the testimony as an \"act of justice.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We found that this decision was an abuse of discretion.  In response to the district court's \"act of justice\" reason for admitting the evidence, we stated that the court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p>is aware of the difficulty of excluding highly relevant and perhaps dispositive testimony which apparent substantive justice requires should be considered by the jury.  Apparent substantive justice may be illusory, however, if the purportedly dispositive evidence is not subject to a fair testing in an even-handed process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 287 n. 4. Applying the analysis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a) used in Conway v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 687 F.2d 108, 111-12 (5th Cir.1982), the Perez-Perez panel found that the undisclosed eye doctor \"exactly comports with\" the Fifth Circuit's definition of \"unfair surprise\" and prejudiced the defendants' case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Id. at 287.   Because the doctor's testimony introduced a \"novel theory of liability,\" defense counsel could not \"design an intelligent litigation strategy to address the charge of visual impairment and ... effectively cross-examine [him].\"  Id.  In addition, we found that the criteria for \"misconduct\" set forth in Anderson \"apply equally to this motion under Rule 59.\"  Id. at 288.   The same reasoning applies to the case before us.  We conclude that the district court's error in admitting Mrs. Klonoski's letters was prejudicial, not harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the excerpts from the letters in evidence.  There was a clear violation of the court's pretrial discovery orders and the requirements of the discovery rules.  It follows that the court also abused its discretion in denying plaintiff's motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairness to the district court, we must explain that our findings of abuse of discretion were not based on any arbitrary refusal by the court to require compliance with its pretrial orders and the discovery rules.  Rather, the court's findings stemmed from its legally incorrect ruling that the letters fell within the impeachment exception of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).  This does not mean that there was no abuse of discretion.  As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[a] district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\"  Koon v.

See RA at 3657-58.\"  Id. at 34 n. 19.  We have read the record pages cited and cannot find any concession by the plaintiff's attorney that the asserted off-the-record ruling was ever made.  Defendants' citation to the record on appeal contains the material in the text, and Attorney Lukey's response to it.  The cited pages show defense counsel, not Attorney Lukey, making such a claim.  We note, too, that any such ruling by the court would have exempted considerably more material from disclosure than the discovery rules provide.

It is not uncommon for one spouse's view of the marriage to differ from that of the other spouse.  Moreover, it is undisputed that Dr. Klonoski was not aware of the letters, prior to being asked to read them on cross-examination at trial.  He did not know that letters containing such statements even existed.  Perhaps if these had been letters written by Dr. Klonoski himself, they might be deemed \"solely for impeachment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We are aware, of course, that the district court found that the letters did not violate its pretrial discovery orders.  We assume, absent any explanation from the district court as to its reasoning, that this conclusion was based on the court's incorrect ruling that the letters were excepted from discovery under the \"solely for impeachment\" provision of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).

Plaintiff-appellant is Richard K.

Excerpts from the letters were allowed in evidence.  Neither Dr. Klonoski nor his attorneys knew of the existence of the letters prior to this time, despite a court order requiring disclosure of such information prior to trial.

Dr. Klonoski was born and raised in Connecticut.  He received his medical training in Poland where he met and married his wife.  After he finished his medical training, he, his wife, and their son, Brian, moved to the United States.  Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant with their third child in September or October of 1992.  At that time Dr. Klonoski was employed by Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital as a cardiologist.  On Saturday, May 8, 1993, at approximately 11:15 a.m., Mrs. Klonoski went to the Birthing Pavilion of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center because of vaginal spotting.  She was sent home in the afternoon.  Mrs. Klonoski returned to the Birthing Pavilion that night about 9:00 p.m. complaining of severe epigastric pain.  She remained in the hospital until her death on Monday, May 10, of a massive cerebral hemorrhage.  Prior to Mrs. Klonoski's death she was delivered of a healthy baby girl, subsequently named Caroline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski was in San Diego at a medical meeting of cardiologists on Saturday, May 8. He was notified late Saturday of his wife's admission to the hospital.  He flew home on Sunday, arriving at the hospital late in the day.  His wife was comatose and did not recognize him.  After conducting his own investigation into the cause of his wife's death, Dr. Klonoski consulted with an obstetrician in Connecticut and then brought suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>PRETRIAL DISCOVERY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is usual in a well prepared medical malpractice case, both sides engaged in extensive pretrial discovery and, as is also usual, the parties squabbled about what information should or should not be disclosed.  Over a year prior to trial, plaintiff disclosed, as part of the discovery process, the address in Poland where Mrs. Klonoski's father and sister lived, the address to which her letters (the evidence in dispute) were sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued a nineteen-page discovery order on July 19, 1996, covering disputes between the parties.  In part of its order, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>defendants shall produce a list of all persons known by them to possess discoverable information related to:  (1) marital discord between Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski; and (2) the paternity of Dr. Klonoski's youngest daughter.  To the extent defendants can more persuasively support their assertion that such a list (or the names of particular people which would otherwise appear on such a list) is protected by the work product doctrine (i.e., with references to precedent and/or scholarly writings on the subject), they shall provide plaintiffs with a privilege log as contemplated by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(5) and a list of cases and/or scholarly writings which specifically support their claim of privilege.  Plaintiffs will, of course, then be free to file an appropriate motion to compel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In its conclusion the court ordered:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Defendants shall produce a list of the names of individuals having knowledge of discoverable information relating to the issues of marital discord and paternity and a general description of the nature of that information on or before August 14, 1996.  To the extent that defendants are able, in good faith, to legally support an assertion of privilege with regard to some or all of those names, they shall produce a privilege log as described above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A final pretrial order was issued on December 19, 1996.  It provided that a jury would be drawn on January 7, 1997, and the presentation of evidence would commence on January 13.  The order noted that both parties had submitted requests for jury instructions.  After noting that some motions in limine had been filed, the court gave the parties until December 31, 1996 to file additional motions in limine, with objections to be filed not later than January 10, 1997.  Exhibits were to be premarked and submitted, along with any objections, not later than January 7, 1997.  Defendants were ordered to \"disclose all documents ordered disclosed after close of business on December 27, 1996, forthwith [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The penultimate paragraph stated in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All counsel and the court anticipate conducting a brief Daubert hearing prior to the testimony of plaintiffs' psychological expert, who is expected to testify as to the loss of enjoyment of life, or hedonic damage, aspect of the estate's wrongful death claim.  The court expects that that hearing will be held at some point during the first week of trial as is convenient to counsel, and the parties agree that one hour should be sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order also required a \"final will-call witness list.\"   The final paragraph exhorted the parties to try to settle the case.  It would appear from the order that all discovery had been completed and the case was ready for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DIRECT EXAMINATION OF DR. KLONOSKI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next set forth the pertinent parts of Dr. Klonoski's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After moving from Poland to the United States, Mrs. Klonoski wrote frequently to her family in Poland and sent packages to them.  Her father visited her and Dr. Klonoski, and stayed for six months.  She was quite happy when he was there, but felt lonely when he went back to Poland.  Dr. Klonoski was working long hours at the hospital in Connecticut where he was training.  Consequently, he was not spending much time at home with his family.  His wife complained about the long hours he had to spend at the hospital.  Mrs. Klonoski was thirty-five years of age.  She did not have a driver's license and was \"house-bound\" with their two small children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990 there was a period of stress in the marriage.  Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski \"had some strong discussions.\"  \"[T]here was a lot of stress between us.\"   The problem was that Mrs. Klonoski wanted her husband to spend more time at home with the family.  He could not accommodate her because he was in the residency program at the hospital which required that he spend a great deal of time there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski became angry at his wife and filed for divorce.  The divorce proceedings remained pending for four or five weeks.  The couple did not stop living together during this period.  There was more stress in the house, \"but everything typically went on.\"   At the end of the five-week period Dr. Klonoski and his wife talked things out and decided that they did not want a divorce, so the divorce proceeding was dropped.  In May of every year, Dr. Klonoski gave his wife one rose for each year that had passed since their first meeting in Poland.  In May of 1990 the doctor followed this ritual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Things eventually changed \"tremendously\" for the better.  Dr. Klonoski completed his residency program in June of 1990 and he went on to a sub-specialty program.  This enabled him to spend more time with his family.  Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant in June of 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski had been accepted into the cardiology program at the Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital and the Hitchcock Clinic in 1989.  The family moved to Lebanon, New Hampshire, in June of 1990.  Mrs. Klonoski was excited about the move.  It was \"a new stage in [their] lives.\"   When the Klonoskis relocated to Lebanon, Mrs. Klonoski was pregnant, their oldest child, Brian, was six, and their daughter Karina was three.  A short time later, in July 1990, Mrs. Klonoski had a miscarriage.  She was treated by doctors at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had to work harder than Polish doctors.  She did not like his going to medical conferences because he was away from the family too much.  Outside of this, things were \"going great\" between Dr. Klonoski and his wife.  She \"blossomed\" and became very self-confident and self-reliant.  She obtained a driver's license just before she left Connecticut for New Hampshire.  This helped a lot because she could go places with the children and do things.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1990 she obtained a job as a bank teller.  She also attended Lebanon College.  After she had been there a time, she was offered a position teaching Polish but refused because she did not want to take too much time away from the family.  She was devoted to the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant again in the fall of 1991.  She suffered another miscarriage.  Both spouses were devastated.  Routine testing was advised and Dr. Klonoski encouraged his wife to take the tests.  She did not, however, take all of the tests.  Generally speaking, Mrs. Klonoski was healthy.  She exercised by doing calisthenics and running.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski made a lot of friends in Lebanon.  She was ebullient, very outgoing, very effervescent.  Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski socialized occasionally, but were not party people.  They preferred to spend their leisure time together as a family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Klonoski became pregnant again in September or October of 1992.  Both spouses were worried because of the prior miscarriages.  This was the pregnancy that ended in the birth of a daughter, Caroline, and Mrs. Klonoski's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was considerable testimony about Mrs. Klonoski's physical condition during the pregnancy.  She did not complain to her husband excessively.  In early spring, 1993, Dr. Klonoski accepted a fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  His wife was concerned about moving to Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The family attended Dr. Klonoski's brother's wedding on April 24, 1993.  He was an usher and his son, Brian, was the ring bearer.  A videotape taken at the wedding showing his wife and daughter was presented to the jury.  This was a good period during their marriage marred only by the worries both had about the pregnancy and the move to Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski was away at a medical conference in San Diego the week his wife was admitted to the hospital.  The conference was important to his career because of the knowledge he would get in his specialty and as a job forum.  He had skipped two prior conferences, once because his wife had asked him not to go and another time because she had recently had a miscarriage.  Mrs. Klonoski was \"not thrilled\" about his going to the conference, but she did not ask him not to go.  Other doctors and some nurses from the Hitchcock Hospital-Clinic establishment also attended the conference in San Diego.  Dr. Klonoski left for the conference on May 5;  his return was scheduled for May 9. His wife's due date was May 28.  Before he left he bought her a bouquet of her favorite flowers for Mother's Day on May 9. At the time Dr. Klonoski left, Mrs. Klonoski had not exhibited any signs of serious problems.  He was not even aware that his wife was ill when he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski called home on Friday evening.  His wife told him that everything went fine at her prenatal visit, but that she did not feel well and if she continued to feel badly, she would go to the doctor the next day.  She called the next day and told him that she continued to feel poorly and was going to the hospital.  She did not mention vaginal bleeding.  We have already related the essentials of what happened at the hospital when Dr. Klonoski visited his wife.  She was comatose by the time he arrived at the hospital and did not recognize him.  He was informed by a neurosurgeon that his wife was brain-dead due to a massive hemorrhage of her brain.  He was with her when the life supports were disconnected and she died.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct examination of Dr. Klonoski drew to a close with his statement, \"I loved my wife without reservation, and I still love her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DR. KLONOSKI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, it was established that Dr. Klonoski was suing, inter alia, as administrator of his wife's estate.  He acknowledged that his wife did not have a will and he knew he would receive the first $100,000 of his wife's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was brought out that initially after their marriage his wife stayed in Poland for a time while he was in the United States working as a medical clerk.  During this time he and his wife corresponded regularly.  All of his wife's letters to him were written in Polish.  In response to questions he stated that his wife had an older sister, named Marta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski testified, as he had on direct examination, that his wife's father had visited in the fall and winter of 1989-90.  Other than Christmas cards, he had not stayed in touch with his wife's family and had not sent them photographs of the children subsequent to his wife's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a series of questions about his wife's plans for the future.  He testified that he had no specific information about his wife's future plans.  He did not know any of his wife's friends who worked at the same bank as she did.  He had never met any of his wife's work-colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Klonoski testified that he and his wife planned the pregnancy that resulted in her death and the birth of their third child, Caroline.  He testified that everybody in the cardiology department was very helpful and supportive after his wife's death.  Money was collected for his family and food was prepared for the children and himself.  All of this was very helpful and he appreciated what was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then followed a series of questions setting the stage for the use of the letters that are the heart of this appeal.  Dr. Klonoski acknowledged that he was seeking damages for injury to the marital relationship with his wife and damages for his wife's loss of enjoyment of life.  In answer to a question, Dr. Klonoski agreed that the quality of the marital relationship would be an important factor in the enjoyment of life.  He also agreed that a good marriage would improve the quality of life.  Dr. Klonoski testified, as he had on direct examination, that by the time he and his wife and their two children moved to Lebanon, the marriage was getting along much better;  the primary ongoing issue was the time he spent away from the house and family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to a question, Dr. Klonoski testified that he knew that his wife corresponded with her father and sister, Marta, in Poland.  Dr. Klonoski was then asked:  \"[I]f I were to show you a letter, you'd certainly be able to recognize your wife's handwriting;  is that right?\"   The answer was \"Yes, I would.\"   After Dr. Klonoski testified that his wife's sister lived in Krakow, defense counsel began to show the witness a document marked for identification.  At this point, plaintiff's counsel requested a bench conference.  The request was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We feel it necessary to quote at length the bench conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  I don't have a clue what this is, but it's never been produced in discovery, and there is absolutely no question that we requested anything that they intend to use in this case.  I have no idea where it came from or what it might be. And I assume it's in Polish, so I can't read it, but really this is unfair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  What is it?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  It's impeachment.  This is a letter written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister Marta in Poland.  And this letter happens to have been written in late April of 1993 and early May of 1993, and it contains in it a description of a number of things, most prominently the marital relationship and the significant problems that Mrs. Klonoski believed existed at that time, and I don't believe--we actually just got that letter last night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, we had, as you recall, a court-ordered disclosure from them pertaining to anything to do with alleged marital discord.  This was not disclosed to us.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't know what he's doing, but it obviously doesn't give me the opportunity to speak, for example, to his sister--her sister, if that's the recipient.  I really think this is litigation by ambush and totally inappropriate.  This is a situation with an actual court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Your Honor, it's legitimate cross-examination.  We just got that last night based on the testimony that we had heard in this case, and it's legitimate cross-examination.  We are not required to disclose what we are going to use on cross-examination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We specifically brought it up with the Court, and you said for impeachment and credibility, we did not have to disclose it, and we didn't have it until last night.  But in any event, we want to use it for that purpose, and I think Attorney Lukey is entitled to go into those issues on reexamination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  Your Honor, he may not have to disclose it on a trial exhibit list, but in discovery he certainly has to disclose it if he has knowledge of it, and we actually had to get a court order to get their evidence on marital discord.  That was the reason we asked for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  But he didn't have it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Didn't have it until last night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  He should have had it, and what is it that they're contending justifies ambushing us with it at this moment in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  We, frankly, haven't had the entire thing translated yet because it was received--this one was received this morning actually.  All we have had is a skeletal translation of it, your Honor, but I think at this point it's an admission by a party opponent.  It's her letter, and that's how it would come into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  What does it say?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  Well, it says quite a few things.  He can translate it for us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  I can't determine the relevance of \"quite a few things.\"   That's not relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  I'll read you my understanding of it, but it's--this is the last letter from Jola.  This is a paraphrasing of it right now, your Honor.  We would ask him to read it because he can read Polish and he can translate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She goes on to the subject of his--of the pregnancy:  I'm afraid of what's going to happen.  He cares only about his career.  I was surprised by his announcement that he was leaving for California and for a business trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are problems with her spending habits.  He doesn't like it.  I bought a baby stroller, and he screamed at the top of his lungs.  I think we should get a divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She mentions that Richard is working so hard to become a cardiologist.  She doesn't say her situation will improve directly, but intimation is she has a stake--I don't understand what all that is.  I don't, frankly, know what everything is in there, but just the fact that she says she thinks we should get a divorce is enough, your Honor.  And he can translate it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And its an admission....  This is a party-opponent admission.  And just as we're entitled to make the arguments that outweigh it, so, too, Attorney Lukey can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three more--four more of those.  That's the first of the ones that I intend to offer in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS LUKEY:  I would like to know how long they've known of the existence of these letters regardless of when they may have received this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT: I'll make a representation of that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  How long have you known?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  We've known about them, it's no more than two days.  We received the first of them--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  No, no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  How did you know they were there?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. BASSETT:  We found Marta this week.  We found her three days ago.  We looked for her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

He died last winter.  That's who we were trying to find.  Instead we found Marta this week, and I can certainly get somebody to prepare an affidavit to say that she was not spoken to until two days ago, and in fact we didn't get the first transcript of these letters until yesterday afternoon.  They were faxed from Poland last night.  The meeting with Marta took place last night in Poland.  They were faxed to us, and I spent most of the night up with these letters, and translators spent most of the night with the letters, too.  We have the other letters translated.  This one we just received within two hours.  So we haven't had it fully translated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  I have a serious issue with this, your Honor.  It's a little bit like springing Dawn Rafferty on us right after Christmas when she turns out to be Linda Bowers' niece, and they've known about her right along.  There's nothing that I heard to suggest this is not something they could have determined earlier if they intended to use it.  This is truly an ambush.  They knew about her sister.  That's not new.  I don't know what it is they think is new about this.  But the fact that they choose to wait until three and a half weeks into a trial and then spring it on us as purported impeachment I find extremely troubling and inconsistent with the rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also have a very strong suspicion that the reason that they made a point with you in our pretrial conference some months ago of saying we don't have to show any impeachment, right, is because they knew exactly what they intended to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't know what Jola wrote, and it's clear that Dr. Klonoski doesn't know what Jola wrote.  I find it very upsetting and extremely inconsistent with the open disclosure rules of current litigation that this would occur.  This is the kind of thing that occurred 25 years ago and was the whole reason the Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted.  I mean I've built a whole case obviously, and they're suddenly coming in and trying to spring something on me about what the wife supposedly felt.  She's dead.  I can't ask her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I do not feel this is appropriate.  I have heard nothing from Mr. Bassett that suggests why he couldn't have come up with this earlier if it was something they intended to use.  You don't keep investigating the case when the trial is in process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

LUKEY:  What in this case has justified this that you didn't know before?MR. BASSETT:  We couldn't find them, and we found them now, your Honor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

I do accept that they did just find out as he's represented to me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  It isn't just whether they just knew about it.  You're right.  I do not believe that they just found out about it.  You're absolutely correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But quite apart from that is the fact that what one is supposed to do is to do one's discovery and so forth for trial by the discovery disclosure date in order to ensure under the Rules of Civil Procedure, the information you come up with is shared if appropriately requested by the other party.  In this case it was not only requested, we had to get a court order.  We got the court order regarding all evidence they had on the subject of alleged marital discord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

LUKEY:  I understand, your Honor.  My point is if it were in fact the case that it was okay to send your investigator out while the trial was in progress, what everyone would do in order to avoid the necessity of disclosing materials that are particularly good for ambushing the other side is not do their investigation until the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Well, I hear you, but I don't agree with you.  You took the initiative to put on the evidence of a good marriage, stable marriage.  Everything's hunky-dory and wonderful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

But to the extent that's relevant, I've already--my view, I don't think it's particularly relevant one way or the other.  But both of you think it is, and once you do that, they have a right to then challenge whether that was the case.

LUKEY:  There is one other issue that I think--I'm a little troubled about here that I would raise to you.  This doesn't give me the opportunity to find out from the sister whether there's more to the story, more letters, another side, an explanation, whatever.  I mean I cannot imagine, short of paying out large sums of money, what would cause a sister to turn over these letters, which has me a bit troubled, and I would like to know if there is more.  I can't do that in the middle of trial.  I'm about to close in--you know, ten minutes after he finishes his cross.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I do remind the Court again, he placed me in an impossible position in that regard because I don't know whether there's more out there, another side to the story or some explanation.  Nor do I know whether money has changed hands.  I don't know anything.  I cannot imagine why a sister would turn these over to be used against her sister's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  I'm not sure that's relevant.  The only question is are they legitimate documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

LUKEY:  Well she might make a difference if it turns out that there are other letters, ones that came after, ones that came before, explanatory letters, phone conversations, none of which I can possibly know.  I don't know if this is complete.  I don't know if--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Are you asking for a continuance?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. LUKEY:  No, I'm not asking for a continuance.  I'm asking to have these documents excluded, your Honor, on the basis that it's litigation by ambush.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  Yeah.  That objection has been overruled.  All right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Dr. Klonoski identified the letters as being in his wife's handwriting, the court held an extended hearing on their admissibility.  After considering the arguments of counsel it issued rulings accompanied by comments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p>I think these letters pose a substantial risk of unfair prejudice that would outweigh their probative value.  I think their probative value, to the extent they have any probative value, lies on the fact of whether or not there was marital discord, whether a divorce was impending, whether she was happy or not in the marriage, why she was unhappy, and the degree of her unhappiness, as expressed in some of these statements, I think might be tangentially relevant.  But to present that evidence in this form to the jury poses a very grave risk that they would start to be inflamed or distracted onto issues that aren't relevant in the case;  that is, was Jolanta Klonoski a good or bad person?   More importantly, was Dr. Klonoski a good or bad person?   And factor that into their award, if there is an award, and they shouldn't.  I think we all agree they shouldn't be factoring that into their award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, they're probably cumulative anyway, because you put in--in fact, your case seems to be three experts and everybody says there's a bad marriage.  So in a sense it's cumulative.  So I agree it's better to have words in the decedent's mouth, so I'm willing to cut you some slack in that regard.  And despite Attorney Lukey's, I think, well-taken position that these are pretty late in the ball game and she doesn't really have a great opportunity to deal with that, but I'm not going to give you the ruling, Attorney Lukey.  What I'm going to do is give you some relief by limiting the admissibility of these statements to those statements that directly speak about her unhappiness in the marriage, but not in histrionic terms and not in terms that pose a risk of appealing to the passion, prejudice of the jury, and not in terms that pose a risk of putting Dr. Klonoski in such a bad light that that might affect an award in this case.  Like I said, I'll give you a chance to rebut, if you can and want to, just as to these statements, but I can't imagine you will want to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my judgment--well, as I think about it, it's probably an inconsistent view myself, but having read these documents, the four documents you presented, it's my conclusion that--certainly to the extent that you claim anything is relevant in there, most of it is not relevant.  Material statements that are made in these documents that might be relevant that seem to portray the former plaintiff, Dr. Klonoski, in a very poor light are not relevant to the issue of Mrs. Klonoski's future hedonic damages.  To the extent they are relevant, or one might argue that they are relevant as a predictor or prognostication of her future happiness, I find that those statements, though relevant in that respect, would, nevertheless, be excluded.  I do exclude them on grounds that their probative value is far outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice in that those statements would tend to, in my judgment, distract the jury and confuse the jury and inflame the passions and prejudice of the jury, such that they may be at risk of focusing on the nature of Dr. Klonoski as a person in calculating a damages award for the estate, which we all agree would not be proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent--to the limiting [sic] extent it gives a marriage view different than this--than Dr. Klonoski and others portrayed, I think they are relevant.  And I think by going through the letters and allowing you to admit those portions of the letters that give that contrary view, without the inflammatory baggage of the other statements and comments in the letters, I think your interests are fairly protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So that's my ruling, I acknowledge that Attorney Lukey makes a very good point about late discovery, not that you've violated my order of disclosure.  I find that you've not.  And not that you had the document in a--in a timely fashion that you could have delivered them to the plaintiffs in a meaningful timely way.  I find you didn't.  But she is somewhat at a prejudicial point in that there are other letters that may present a different view altogether of this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But again, we're at the point where I think we're cumulative anyway on the item of was there discord or not discord in the marriage, and--that's not a very major issue in the case, in any event.  So here is what the potentially inconsistent part, I suppose, with respect to all of those other statements in these letters that I have not agreed to allow you to read to the jury or present to the jury.  I would--I also exclude those on grounds that, to the extent they are inflammatory but fall below the line of proposing an unfair risk of substantial prejudice, outweighing their probative value, I would exclude them on the additional independent grounds that Attorney Lukey does not have the opportunity to have those other nine letters translated and examined for the possibility that they may have equally praiseworthy and laudatory comments about Dr. Klonoski in them.  So who knows.  Maybe they would balance them off.  So that's just another independent reason why I wouldn't allow the statements to be denigrating of Dr. Klonoski or certainly his relatives into evidence.

Joan Conrad worked in the cardiology department and became acquainted with Dr. Klonoski.  When she congratulated him on the coming birth of another child, he said:  \"It wasn't my idea.  This wasn't planned.\"   When Conrad asked Dr. Klonoski about his wife, he replied:  \"She's always complaining, lots of aches and pains.

Accompanied by Dr. Klonoski's parents, he met Dr. Klonoski at the Lebanon Airport on his return from the meeting in San Diego, and drove him to the hospital.  Dr. Robb testified that Dr. Klonoski was crying when Dr. Robb picked him up at the airport, that he was \"very distraught and upset\" and \"grieving.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ellen Fullington was a medical secretary at the Hitchcock Hospital.

The Court went on to discuss the purpose of the discovery rules:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p>Under the prior federal practice, the pre-trial functions of notice-giving, issue-formulation and fact-revelation were performed primarily and inadequately by the pleadings.  Inquiry into the issues and the facts before trial was narrowly confined and was often cumbersome in method.  The new rules, however, restrict the pleadings to the task of general notice-giving and invest the deposition-discovery process with a vital role in the preparation for trial.  The various instruments of discovery now serve (1) as a device, along with the pre-trial hearing under Rule 16, to narrow and clarify the basic issues between the parties, and (2) as a device for ascertaining the facts, or information as to the existence or whereabouts of facts, relative to those issues.  Thus civil trials in the federal courts no longer need be carried on in the dark.  The way is now clear, consistent with recognized privileges, for the parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues and facts before trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 500-01, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104357\"><a href=\"/opinion/104357/hickman-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e).  Rule 26(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) Supplementation of Disclosures and Responses.  A party who has made a disclosure under subdivision (a) or responded to a request for discovery with a disclosure or response is under a duty to supplement or correct the disclosure or response to include information thereafter acquired if ordered by the court or in the following circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) A party is under a duty to supplement at appropriate intervals its disclosures under subdivision (a) if the party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e).

The changes to Rule 26(e) substantially expanded the duty to supplement.  Under the pre-1993 version of Rule 26(e), supplementation was required only in a few, limited circumstances.  The current version of the rule, as quoted supra, imposes a broad requirement on parties to update their earlier disclosures and discovery responses.  See 8 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2049.1 (2d ed.  1994 &amp; Supp.1998) (\"Wright &amp; Miller\").  Thus, even if the defendants could argue that the pre-1993 rule might not have required them to disclose the letters to the plaintiff, they have no such argument under the 1993 amendments to the supplementation requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p>IS PRECLUSION THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1993 amendments to the Federal Rules also added Rule 37(c)(1) which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) Failure to Disclose;  False or Misleading Disclosure;  Refusal to Admit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) A party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by Rule 26(a) or 26(e)(1) shall not, unless such failure is harmless, be permitted to use as evidence at a trial, at a hearing, or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.  In addition to or in lieu of this sanction, the court, on motion and after affording an opportunity to be heard, may impose other appropriate sanctions.  In addition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, these sanctions may include any of the actions authorized under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule and may include informing the jury of the failure to make the disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to adoption of Rule 37(c)(1), no rule specifically provided sanctions for the failure to supplement discovery.

The new rule is mandatory:  a party that fails to make the required disclosures \"shall not, unless such failure is harmless, be permitted to use [undisclosed] evidence at a trial.\"  Id. To be sure, the rule somewhat tempers this mandate by permitting courts to excuse failures to disclose to some degree (i.e., to impose other sanctions \"in lieu of this sanction\").  Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).  But the new rule clearly contemplates stricter adherence to discovery requirements, and harsher sanctions for breaches of this rule, and the required sanction in the ordinary case is mandatory preclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before the 1993 amendments, in National Hockey League v.

The most severe sanctions provided by the rules, the Court explained, \"must be available to the district court in appropriate cases, not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\"  Id. at 643, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109527\"><a href=\"/opinion/109527/national-hockey-league-v-metropolitan-hockey-club-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While a warning alone might have made the plaintiffs in that case comply with all future discovery orders, \"other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts.\"  Id.

The district court did not take this position because it found the letters to fall within an exception to the discovery rules for material that is presented \"solely for impeachment purposes.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DO THE LETTERS FALL WITHIN AN EXCEPTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p>TO THE DISCOVERY RULES?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26(a)(3) provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial Disclosures.

The federal cases that have decided whether evidence falls within the impeachment exception to the discovery rules are, for the most part, personal injury cases.  They frequently deal with two kinds of evidence:  video surveillance tapes of a plaintiff's activities subsequent to the injury giving rise to the suit;  and information that a defendant has of the plaintiff's prior medical history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Although some district courts have found video surveillance tapes to be \"solely\" impeachment evidence, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3), the weight of authority seems to be that such evidence is both impeaching and substantive and should be disclosed.  See Wegner v. Cliff Viessman, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span>, 157-59 (N.D.Iowa 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And this approach makes evidentiary sense.

Even those who have been most concerned about protecting impeachment material recognize that substantive evidence must be subject to discovery even though it also tends to contradict evidence of the discovering party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 Wright &amp; Miller, supra, &#167; 2015, at 212 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only circuit court that directly addresses this subject is Chiasson v.

In holding that a video surveillance tape was not \"solely\" impeachment evidence, the court defined substantive evidence as \"that which is offered to establish the truth of a matter to be determined by the trier of fact.\"  Id. at 517.   It then stated:  \"Impeachment evidence, on the other hand, is that which is offered to 'discredit a witness ... to reduce the effectiveness of [her] testimony by bringing forth evidence which explains why the jury should not put faith in [her] ... testimony.' \"  Id.

The court held:  \"Because the tape is, at the very least, in part substantive, it should have been disclosed prior to trial, regardless of its impeachment value.\"  Id. at 517-18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true of the disputed evidence here.  The excerpts from the letters written by Mrs. Klonoski to her sister were at least in part substantive, and therefore they did not fall within the \"solely for impeachment\" exception of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).  The letter excerpts constituted substantive evidence because, separate and apart from whether they contradicted Dr. Klonoski's testimony, they tended \"to establish the truth of a matter to be determined by the trier of fact.\"  Chiasson, 988 F.2d at 518.   This is true even though, in addition to their substantive content, the excerpts tended to contradict Dr. Klonoski's testimony regarding the state of his marriage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We hold, therefore, that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in finding the letter excerpts to fall within the exception to the discovery rules for evidence introduced \"solely for impeachment purposes\" of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p180\">\n      <span class=\"num\">180</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think that Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2) opens the evidence door to the excerpts because they are admissions against a party opponent, as defendants argue.  The question is not the admissibility of the excerpts under the Federal Rules of Evidence but whether they were barred because their introduction violated the pretrial discovery orders of the district court and federal discovery rules.  The rules of evidence do not trump the discovery rules contained in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In Labadie, the D.C. Circuit found that the district court's admission of documents was erroneous and prejudicial because plaintiff was not given notice of the documents until after it had rested its case on the last day of trial.  The court noted that \"when the documents were finally produced, [plaintiff] had little, if any, time effectively to ... cross-examine [defendant] as to their content.\"  Id. at 94-95.   In the present case, plaintiff was even more prejudiced by the lack of discovery.  He had virtually finished presenting his entire case to the jury;  Dr. Klonoski's direct testimony had been completed.  His depiction of the state of the marriage was very different from the way he would have characterized it if his late wife's letters had been disclosed to him prior to his testifying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot help being impressed by the exquisite timing of the injection of the letters into the trial.  Dr. Klonoski, the last witness in the plaintiff's case, had finished his direct testimony.  The plaintiff's case had been completed.  Cross-examination started with some innocuous questions.  This was followed by what clearly were questions setting up Dr. Klonoski for the introduction of the letters.

If letters or other documents are allowed in evidence after a trial starts for the sole reason that they were not obtained sooner by the party offering them, the rules of discovery and court orders pertaining thereto would become empty phrases signifying nothing.  Trial by ambush would be re-born.  Enforcement of discovery rules and orders is necessary to prevent abuse by future litigants.

This explanation was accepted by the district judge.  But it is beside the point.  The fact that a party had not actually obtained certain documents before the discovery deadline does not excuse a violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The belated appearance of the letters violated the plain meaning and the intent of the discovery rules.  It also ignored the specific requirements of the court's pretrial discovery orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The contents of Mrs. Klonoski's letters were not disclosed prior to trial, as they should have been under the July 16, 1996 discovery order which provided specifically:  \"defendants shall produce a list of all persons known by them to possess discoverable information related to:  (1) marital discord between Dr. and Mrs. Klonoski ... and a general description of the nature of that information.\"   The final pretrial order was based on the parties' representations that discovery had been completed and the case was ready for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the defendants be excused for their failure to comply.  That defense counsel did not obtain the letters until two days before their use at trial on cross-examination does not make them admissible.  Defendants had been furnished with the address of Mrs. Klonoski's father in Poland more than a full year before trial.  Her father and sister lived at the same address.  The defendants could, at that time, have undertaken the same investigation that for some unexplained reason did not come to fruition until the trial was near completion.  They have offered no legitimate explanation for why they waited as long as they did, knowing that the federal rules and the court had required them to disclose potential trial exhibits and all relevant responses to discovery requests well before the trial began.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  This suggests that the defendants may have been, at best, either lax or negligent in pursuing pretrial discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defense counsel admitted that they at least knew about the letters and the general outlines of their contents two days earlier than they disclosed them, i.e., they knew about them before Dr. Klonoski testified on direct.  Counsel could have put plaintiff on notice that certain new and hitherto undisclosed evidence was on the verge of becoming available on the issue of marital discord.  If such notice had been given at that point, prior to Dr. Klonoski's testimony on direct, then undoubtedly his testimony would have been different and the present problem would most likely never have arisen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THE DISTRICT COURT'S RULING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reading the district court's rulings and comments, we have difficulty understanding the basis of its decision to allow excerpts from the letters to be read to the jury.  The first paragraph of the court's order states:  \"I think these letters pose a substantial risk of unfair prejudice that would outweigh their probative value.\"   Despite this pronouncement, the court admitted excerpts from the letters into evidence.  With due respect, we do not think that the prejudice was reduced appreciably by limiting the court's ruling to the excerpts read to the jury.  In fact, by shortening lengthy letters and allowing into evidence only the inflammatory portions, their prejudicial impact was probably heightened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also puzzled by the statement:  \"I acknowledge that Attorney Lukey makes a very good point about late discovery, not that you've violated my order of disclosure.  I find that you've not.\"   The only basis for this finding was that the court believed the letter fell within the impeachment exception provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).  We have found, supra, that the exception does not apply.  Clearly the introduction of the letters without prior notice to plaintiff violated the pretrial discovery order of July 19 and the final pretrial order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the court's statement that Attorney Lukey \"is somewhat at a prejudicial point in that there are other letters that may present a different view altogether of this.\"   We believe this greatly understated the predicament in which plaintiff's attorney found herself.  First, Attorney Lukey was correct that, because of the defendants' failure to provide these letters during the discovery process, plaintiff's counsel was unable to conduct her own investigation which might uncover other letters from Mrs. Klonoski explaining what she wrote in the letters introduced by defendants, or which might demonstrate that Mrs. Klonoski's anger was a passing feeling that did not reflect her overall view of the marriage.  But more critically, plaintiff had already planned and executed his trial strategy based on the evidence available to the parties through discovery.  He had presented his entire case, including the direct examination of his lead witness.  To spring these letters--hitherto unknown by plaintiff and his attorneys--upon the plaintiff at that stage of the litigation was a lot more than \"somewhat ... prejudicial.\"   Realistically, it was devastating to his ability to succeed with the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A CONTINUANCE AS A POSSIBLE REMEDY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court asked plaintiff's counsel at least twice if she wanted a continuance.  She said she did not want one because she did not think it would do any good.  It is true, as defendants argue, that in some cases we have found that surprise evidence could be combated by granting a continuance to the surprised party.  See Newell Puerto Rico, Ltd. v. Rubbermaid, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666565\"><a href=\"/opinion/666565/newell-puerto-rico-ltd-v-rubbermaid-incorporated-newell-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1994).  In Licciardi we discussed at length the effectiveness of a continuance as an antidote to surprise evidence.  140 F.3d at 366-67.   As we stated there:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p>It is true that, where effective to counteract the surprise to one party wrought by the other party's failure to abide by Rule 26, a continuance or the calling of a rebuttal witness is preferable to terminating the trial and beginning anew.  However, a continuance is not effective in every circumstance to counteract the unfair surprise.  See Thibeault [v. Square D Co.], 960 F.2d [239,] 246 [ (1st Cir.1992) ] (\"[A] continuance is often ineffectual as a sanction and unfair to both the court and the opposing party.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Licciardi, 140 F.3d at 366.   We found no practical way for the plaintiff to remedy the surprise;  any solution would have prejudiced the plaintiff even more.  Id. at 366.   We thought it important to consider the policy behind the discovery rules.  Directly contrary to this policy, granting a continuance, we found, would create greater incentives for attorneys to violate Rule 26(e).  Id.;  see also National Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109527\"><a href=\"/opinion/109527/national-hockey-league-v-metropolitan-hockey-club-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span> (Strict sanctions are necessary \"to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.\").  \"Such conduct should not be rewarded.\"  Licciardi, 140 F.3d at 367.   And as we also noted in Thibeault:  \"If continuances were granted as a matter of course for violations of Rule 26(e), the rule could always be disregarded with impunity.\"  Thibeault, 960 F.2d at 246;  see also Freund, 956 F.2d at 359.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this rationale applies with equal force to the instant case.  We fail to see how a continuance could have accomplished anything in this case.  As plaintiff's counsel pointed out orally at the hearing on the admissibility of the letters, the only thing she could have done was to take the deposition of Dr. Klonoski's sister-in-law to find out as much as she could about the letters.  Because of the distances involved and the language problems, this would have necessitated a lengthy continuance.  A continuance was not a practical alternative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, short of a new trial, a continuance would have accomplished nothing at all to mitigate the prejudice caused to plaintiff's case by defendants' having waited until after Dr. Klonoski had finished his direct testimony before disclosing the letters to the plaintiff.  As noted supra, defense counsel knew about the letters prior to Dr. Klonoski's testimony.  If counsel had notified the plaintiff at that point, then perhaps a continuance might have been the appropriate remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A continuance would have been an inadequate remedy in this case also because of the policy concerns regarding incentives for parties to comply with discovery rules.  See National Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109527\"><a href=\"/opinion/109527/national-hockey-league-v-metropolitan-hockey-club-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span> (Absent strict sanctions, \"other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts.\").  As plaintiff's counsel told the district court, if we were to condone the procedure followed by the defendants in this case, then \"what everyone would do in order to avoid the necessity of disclosing materials that are particularly good for ambushing the other side is not do their investigation until the time of trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p>IS A NEW TRIAL REQUIRED?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendants argue that, even if the district court erred by admitting the letter excerpts into evidence and allowing the defendants to use them in cross-examining Dr. Klonoski, a new trial is not warranted because the letter excerpts could have had no effect on the jury's verdict of no liability.  Their contention can be summarized as follows.  In his jury instructions, the district court judge told the jury to consider the letter excerpts only in its determination of hedonic damages.  Because the jury found that the defendants were not liable, it never reached the damages issue.  Therefore, the admission of the letter excerpts were, at the most, harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has surface appeal but we reject it.  We note that the cases cited by defendants in support of their position are not cases involving the breach of discovery orders and the discovery rules.  Defendants' precedential support consists of cases that focus on the judge's instructions after the admission or exclusion of evidence.  See Navarro de Cosme v. Hospital Pavia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553839\"><a href=\"/opinion/553839/maria-r-navarro-de-cosme-v-hospital-pavia/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where there has been, as there was here, an egregious breach of discovery orders and the discovery rules, we think that the controlling case is Anderson v.

The plaintiffs in Anderson sued for personal injuries allegedly sustained because of toxic contamination to water wells.  The jury found that the defendants were not responsible for the pollution.  Shortly after the trial, the plaintiffs learned that the defendants had failed to disclose a groundwater study during pretrial discovery.  Id. at 922.   The plaintiffs moved to set aside the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).  Id. at 923.   The district court denied the motion because the \"plaintiffs had not been prevented from fully and fairly presenting their case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reviewed the district court's ruling for abuse of discretion.

We held that the \"[f]ailure to disclose or produce materials requested in discovery can constitute 'misconduct' within the purview of this subsection.\"  Anderson at 923 (citing Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355098\"><a href=\"/opinion/355098/martha-ann-brundage-rozier-v-ford-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1332</span></a></span>, 1339 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We defined misconduct as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p>\"Misconduct\" does not demand proof of nefarious intent or purpose as a prerequisite to redress.  For the term to have meaning in the Rule 60(b)(3) context, it must differ from both \"fraud\" and \"misrepresentation.\"   Definition of this difference requires us to take an expansive view of \"misconduct.\"   The term can cover even accidental omissions--elsewise it would be pleonastic, because \"fraud\" and \"misrepresentation\" would likely subsume it.  Cf. United States v. One Douglas A-26B Aircraft, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396360\"><a href=\"/opinion/396360/united-states-v-one-1-douglas-a-26b-aircraft-serial-no-28034-faa/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1372</span></a></span>, 1374-75 n. 6 (11th Cir.1981) (to avoid redundancy, \"misrepresentation\" in Rule 60(b)(3) must encompass more than false statements made with intent to deceive).  We think such a construction not overly harsh;  it takes scant imagination to conjure up discovery responses which, though made in good faith, are so ineptly researched or lackadaisical that they deny the opposing party a fair trial.  Accidents--at least avoidable ones--should not be immune from the reach of the rule.  Thus, we find ourselves in agreement with the Fifth Circuit that, depending upon the circumstances, relief on the ground of misconduct may be justified \"whether there was evil, innocent or careless, purpose.\"  Bros Inc. v.

Next, the moving party must show that the misconduct substantially interfered with its ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at, trial.  This burden may be shouldered either by establishing the material's likely worth as trial evidence or by elucidating its value as a tool for obtaining meaningful discovery.  The burden can also be met by presumption or inference, if the movant can successfully demonstrate that the misconduct was knowing or deliberate.  Once a presumption of substantial interference arises, it can alone carry the day, unless defeated by a clear and convincing demonstration that the consequences of the misconduct were nugacious.  Alternatively, if unaided by a presumption--that is, if the movant is unable to prove that the misconduct was knowing or deliberate--it may still prevail as long as it proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the nondisclosure worked some substantial interference with the full and fair preparation or presentation of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 926 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this case falls well within the parameters of Anderson.   As already noted, there was, intentional or otherwise, an egregious breach of the discovery orders and the discovery rules which resulted in \"substantial interference with the full and fair preparation\" of plaintiff's case.  We cannot know with certainty what impact the letter excerpts had on the jury, but to dismiss what happened as harmless error would render the discovery rules and orders issued thereunder useless.  Moreover, where, as in this case, undisclosed evidence is introduced at a key point in the trial, it would be unrealistic to say that it had no effect on the jury's determination as to liability.  If the jury decided that Dr. Klonoski was a tyrant as a husband and a liar, his chances of obtaining a favorable and fair verdict were destroyed.  We find that the district court erred as a matter of law in allowing the letter excerpts into evidence and, as in Anderson, abused its discretion in not granting plaintiff's motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Perez-Perez v.

Illinois Cent. R.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694341\"><a href=\"/opinion/694341/steve-debiasio-v-illinois-central-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1995).  But the ruling in Debiasio was highly factspecific and does not govern the present case.  In addition, despite its dicta regarding abuse of discretion, Debiasio held that the error was harmless, and affirmed the jury verdict.  52 F.3d at 686;  see also supra at 269 n. 5</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Nor did this contradiction necessarily mean that Dr. Klonoski was deliberately lying.  It is not uncommon for one spouse's view of the marriage to differ from that of the other spouse.  Moreover, it is undisputed that Dr. Klonoski was not aware of the letters, prior to being asked to read them on cross-examination at trial.  He did not know that letters containing such statements even existed.  Perhaps if these had been letters written by Dr. Klonoski himself, they might be deemed \"solely for impeachment.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We are aware, of course, that the district court found that the letters did not violate its pretrial discovery orders.  We assume, absent any explanation from the district court as to its reasoning, that this conclusion was based on the court's incorrect ruling that the letters were excepted from discovery under the \"solely for impeachment\" provision of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(3).  See infra at 273</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Indeed, in the side bar conference when the letters were first disclosed during Dr. Klonoski's cross-examination, defense counsel represented to the court that counsel had \"just got[ten the first letter] last night based on the testimony that we had heard in this case, and it's legitimate cross-examination.\"  (Emphasis added.)   Later discussion made it clear that defendants' dispatching their investigators to Poland had nothing to do with any \"testimony that [they] had heard in [the] case.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> In Conway, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the grant of a new trial under Rule 59(a), because the plaintiff had \"been unfairly made the victim of surprise,\" in that the defendant had called a previously undisclosed expert witness.  687 F.2d at 109-11.   The appeals court rejected the defendant's argument that the proper remedy was a continuance</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
