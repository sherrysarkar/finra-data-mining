William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n      [Hon. George A. O’Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n\f     Kevin Lynch and Kevin Babineau on brief pro se.\n     G.R.

Thai, Assistant\nAttorney General, on briefs for appellee.\n\f           Per Curiam.       Having reviewed these two cases in\n\ntandem    due   to   the   overlap     in   issues,     we   affirm   both\n\njudgments substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge\n\nO'Toole's opinion in No. 99-1614.             See 47 F. Supp. 2d 125\n\n(D. Mass. 1999).       We add only the following comments.\n\n           In No. 99-1614, we need not decide whether the\n\nmethodology prescribed by Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472\n\n(1995), is applicable in the parole context.                    As Judge\n\nO'Toole    explained,      whether    one    scrutinizes      the   parole\n\nstatute     for      \"mandatory      language\"        and    \"substantive\n\npredicates,\" see, e.g., Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S.\n\n369 (1987), or whether one asks whether an \"atypical and\n\nsignificant     hardship\"    has     been   imposed    for   purposes   of\n\nSandin, plaintiffs' attempt to establish a liberty interest\n\nfails.    The extent to which our decision in Hamm v. Latessa,\n\n72 F.3d 947, 954 (1st Cir. 1995), resolved the issue of\n\nSandin's applicability need not here be determined.\n\n           In No. 99-1936, one of plaintiff's complaints is\n\nthat the \"full membership\" of the Parole Board did not\n\nproperly participate in his hearing.              To the extent this\n\nclaim relies on equal protection, the dismissal thereof is\n\nsummarily affirmed, inasmuch as plaintiff has not alleged\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fany differential treatment of a protected class to which he\n\nbelongs.    To the extent this claim rests on state law, the\n\ndismissal    is    without   prejudice    to   the    pursuit    of   any\n\navailable relief in state court.\n\n            In    both   cases,   we    find   no    need   to   address\n\ndefendant's contention that, under Heck v. Humphrey, 512\n\nU.S. 477 (1994), and related cases, plaintiffs' challenges\n\nto the Massachusetts parole procedures should have been\n\npursued in a habeas action rather than in a suit under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.     However the Heck issue might be resolved, it\n\ndoes not pose any concern as to our jurisdiction under\n\nArticle III.      Parella v. Retirement Bd. of the Rhode Island\n\nEmployees' Retirement System, 173 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
