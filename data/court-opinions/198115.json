Sullivan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\r\nbrief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n              September 11, 1998\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Defendant Francis E. Sherwood\r\nwas charged in a two-count indictment with being a convicted felon\r\nin possession of firearms and of ammunition in violation of 18\r\nU.S.C.  922(g)(1).  He pled guilty to both counts, and the\r\ndistrict court subsequently sentenced him to concurrent terms of\r\nseventy months of imprisonment and three years of supervised\r\nrelease for each count.  Sherwood's prior felony record consisted\r\nof a two-count conviction under Rhode Island law for second degree\r\nchild molestation.\r\nSherwood challenges his sentence on two grounds.  First,\r\nhe contends that the district court incorrectly determined that\r\nsecond degree child molestation was a \"crime of violence\" for\r\npurposes of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual  2K2.1(a).  Second,\r\nhe argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his criminal\r\nhistory score by two points after concluding that he had committed\r\nthe instant offense while on probation for his previous felony\r\nconviction.  We affirm.\r\n                     I.  BACKGROUND  On May 14, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a two-\r\ncount indictment, charging the defendant with being a felon in\r\npossession on or about April 22, 1997, of firearms and of\r\nammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  The indictment\r\nstemmed from the seizure by federal agents of 111 firearms and\r\napproximately 24,217 rounds of ammunition from Sherwood's home in\r\nCharlestown, Rhode Island.  As part of the search, agents also\r\nrecovered documents relating to the ownership or acquisition of a\r\ntotal of 172 firearms.\r\nSherwood's prior criminal record reveals that, on\r\nMarch 28, 1984, he pled nolo contendere in state court to two\r\ncounts of second degree child molestation.  A third count, alleging\r\nassault with intent to commit first degree sexual assault against\r\na minor, was dismissed by the court.  He was sentenced on the first\r\ncount to four years' probation, and on the second count to six\r\nyears' imprisonment (four years of which was suspended), and to\r\nfour years' probation.  The defendant began acquiring weapons\r\nrelated to his  922(g)(1) violation while on probation for this\r\nstate law offense.\r\nOn June 30, 1997, the defendant entered a plea of guilty\r\nto both felon-in-possession charges, and subsequently, the district\r\ncourt sentenced him as a Level 25, Category III offender.  The\r\ndefendant's sentencing guideline level was based, in part, on the\r\ncourt's determination that his prior felony conviction was for a\r\n\"crime of violence,\" which resulted in a four-level increase in the\r\ndefendant's base offense level.  See U.S.S.G.  2K2.1(a)(3). \r\nSherwood's criminal history score was increased by two points based\r\non the court's finding that this offense was committed while the\r\ndefendant was on probation, which moved Sherwood from a criminal\r\nhistory category of II to III.  See U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(d). \r\nAccordingly, the defendant was sentenced to seventy months of\r\nimprisonment and three years of supervised release to be served\r\nconcurrently.                        II.  DISCUSSION\r\nWe review the district court's interpretation of the\r\nSentencing Guidelines de novo.  See United States v. Nicholas, 133\r\nF.3d 133, 134 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nA.  Base Offense Level Determination\r\nThe district court found that Sherwood's prior felony\r\nconviction in state court was for a \"crime of violence,\" and thus\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  2k2.1(a)(3), applied a base offense level of 22. \r\nThe defendant challenges the district court's determination that\r\nsecond degree child molestation under Rhode Island law constitutes\r\na \"crime of violence.\"  Section 4B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines\r\ndefines a \"crime of violence\" as:\r\n(a)                                  . . . any offense under federal or state law,\r\n                                     punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\r\n                                     that   \r\n\n      (1)  has as an element the use, attempted use, or\r\n           threatened use of physical force against the\r\n           person of another, or\r\n\n      (2)  . . . otherwise involves conduct that presents\r\n           a serious potential risk of physical injury to\r\n           another.\r\n\n4B1.2(a)(1) &amp; (2) (emphasis added).  The Rhode Island statute\r\nunder which Sherwood was convicted, at the time he was charged,\r\nprohibited \"sexual contact\" with a person under 13 years of age. \r\nSee R.I. Gen. Laws  11-37-4 (1956) (amended 1981).  Finding that\r\nthe offense defined in the state statute poses \"a serious potential\r\nrisk of physical injury,\" we hold that Sherwood's Rhode Island\r\nconviction was for a \"crime of violence.\"\r\n \"[T]he standard approach for determining whether a\r\nparticular crime fits within the 'crime of violence' rubric is a\r\ngeneral one, in which inquiry is restricted to the statutory\r\ndefinitions of the prior offenses, without regard to the particular\r\nfacts underlying them.\"  United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 882\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600\r\n(1990)).  Thus, we engage in a categorical analysis of the\r\nstatutory crime.  See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. at 600-02. \r\nSexual contact with a person under 13 years of age, as defined in\r\nthe Rhode Island statute, can encompass both violent and non-\r\nviolent conduct.  As such, the categorical approach allows us \"to\r\ngo beyond the fact of conviction . . . [and] examine the indictment\r\nor information and jury instructions in order to discern which type\r\nof crime the offender was convicted of perpetrating.\"  United\r\nStates v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 145 (1st Cir. 1997).  However, since\r\nthe information underlying Sherwood's conviction simply reiterates\r\nthe elements of the statute and the defendant did not face a jury\r\ntrial (and thus, we lack jury instructions), our inquiry remains\r\nlimited to the statutory formulation of the prior offense.\r\n In deciding whether the statutory crime constitutes a\r\n\"crime of violence,\" we examine \"the typical run of conduct,\"\r\nDamon, 127 F.3d at 145, for this sort of offense.  While the\r\nchronological gap between a perpetrator and his victim is not\r\nobvious from the face of the statute, we do know from the statute\r\nthat, in every instance, the victim is at most 12 years old.  Cf.\r\nMeader, 118 F.3d at 884 (finding age of victim to be \"crucial fact\"\r\nand \"relevant to the question of injury\").  Moreover, we agree with\r\nthe Fifth Circuit that child molestation crimes \"typically occur in\r\nclose quarters, and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a\r\nvictim who is not only smaller, weaker, and less experienced, but\r\nis also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of\r\nadult authority figures.\"  United States v. Velzquez-Overa, 100\r\nF.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir. 1996) (analyzing Texas statute prohibiting\r\nindecency with a child by sexual contact).\r\n Sherwood attempts to distinguish  Meader from the instant\r\ncase by pointing out that Meader involved prior convictions for\r\nstatutory rape.  See 118 F.3d at 880-81.  Sherwood relies upon\r\nUnited States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 1997) (en\r\nbanc) cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 223 (1997), to argue that the logic\r\nwhich compels the conclusion that there is \"a serious potential\r\nrisk of physical injury\" when there is sexual intercourse does not\r\ncompel or even permit the same conclusion with respect to sexual\r\ntouching.  The Seventh Circuit, however, did not hold that sexual\r\ntouching could not constitute a \"crime of violence.\"  See Shannon,\r\n110 F.3d at 389.  Rather, the contrasting views of the Seventh\r\nCircuit judges merely evidence the troubling and complex issues\r\ninvolved in determining what crimes constitute \"crimes of violence\"\r\nfor federal sentencing purposes.  See Shannon, 110 F.3d at 387-90. \r\n Whatever the dividing line between sexual offenses that\r\nconstitute crimes of violence and those that do not, we adopt our\r\nsister circuit's conclusion that \"there is a significant likelihood\r\nthat physical force may be used to perpetrate [this] crime,\"\r\nVelzquez-Overa, 100 F.3d at 422, and find that the Rhode Island\r\nstatute at issue punishes a \"crime of violence.\"  Thus, the\r\ndistrict court did not err in its base offense level determination.\r\nB.   Two-Point Addition to Criminal History Score\r\nSherwood argues that the district court erroneously added\r\ntwo points to his criminal history score because it found that the\r\ndefendant was on probation at the time of the commission of the\r\nfelon-in-possession-of-a-firearm offense.  The sentencing\r\nguidelines require the court to \"add two points if the defendant\r\ncommitted the instant offense while under any criminal justice\r\nsentence, including probation . . . .\"  U.S.S.G.  4A1.1(d). \r\nSherwood does not dispute the government's allegation and the\r\ndistrict court's finding that at least one of the firearms for\r\nwhich he was charged was acquired when he was on probation for his\r\nstate felony conviction.  The defendant avers, however, that since\r\nhe pleaded guilty to possessing firearms on or about April 22,\r\n1997, a time when he was, without question, not on probation,\r\n4A1.1(d) does not apply.  In other words, Sherwood claims that\r\nhis acquisition of weapons during his probation was not the basis\r\nof  his indictment.  Instead, when he pled guilty, Sherwood was\r\nadmitting to a crime which took place after his earlier probation\r\nhad terminated.\r\nThe commentary to that section instructs that \"[t]wo\r\npoints are added if the defendant committed any part of the instant\r\noffense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under . . . probation.\" \r\nU.S.S.G.  4A1.1(d) commentary at n.4 (emphasis added).  Relevant\r\nconduct includes \"all acts . . . that were part of the same course\r\nof conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\" \r\nU.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a)(2).  Sherwood's acquisition of firearms during\r\nhis probationary period was part of the same course of conduct as\r\nthe offense of conviction.  Thus, his acquisition of the guns\r\nqualifies as relevant conduct under the sentencing guidelines.  Cf.\r\nSanders, 982 F.2d at 9-10 (finding prior possession of gun not\r\nlisted in indictment to be relevant conduct).  Accordingly, we\r\nuphold the district court's decision to add two points to\r\nSherwood's criminal history score.                          III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the sentencing\r\ndetermination of the district court.\n",

Sherwood was charged in a two-count indictment with being a convicted felon in possession of firearms and of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).  He pled guilty to both counts, and the district court subsequently sentenced him to concurrent terms of seventy months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for each count.

First, he contends that the district court incorrectly determined that second degree child molestation was a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &#167; 2K2.1(a).  Second, he argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his criminal history score by two points after concluding that he had committed the instant offense while on probation for his previous felony conviction.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment, charging the defendant with being a felon in possession on or about April 22, 1997, of firearms and of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).  The indictment stemmed from the seizure by federal agents of 111 firearms and approximately 24,217 rounds of ammunition from Sherwood's home in Charlestown, Rhode Island.  As part of the search, agents also recovered documents relating to the ownership or acquisition of a total of 172 firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sherwood's prior criminal record reveals that, on March 28, 1984, he pled nolo contendere in state court to two counts of second degree child molestation.  A third count, alleging assault with intent to commit first degree sexual assault against a minor, was dismissed by the court.  He was sentenced on the first count to four years' probation, and on the second count to six years' imprisonment (four years of which was suspended), and to four years' probation.  The defendant began acquiring weapons related to his &#167; 922(g)(1) violation while on probation for this state law offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1997, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to both felon-in-possession charges, and subsequently, the district court sentenced him as a Level 25, Category III offender.  The defendant's sentencing guideline level was based, in part, on the court's determination that his prior felony conviction was for a \"crime of violence,\" which resulted in a four-level increase in the defendant's base offense level.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a)(3).  Sherwood's criminal history score was increased by two points based on the court's finding that this offense was committed while the defendant was on probation, which moved Sherwood from a criminal history category of II to III.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d).  Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to seventy months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo.  See United States v. Nicholas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750076\"><a href=\"/opinion/750076/united-states-v-christian-modest-nicholas/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 134 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Base Offense Level Determination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Sherwood's prior felony conviction in state court was for a \"crime of violence,\" and thus under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a)(3), applied a base offense level of 22.  The defendant challenges the district court's determination that second degree child molestation under Rhode Island law constitutes a \"crime of violence.\"   Section 4B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines defines a \"crime of violence\" as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>(a) ... any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 4B1.2(a)(1) &amp; (2) (emphasis added).  The Rhode Island statute under which Sherwood was convicted, at the time he was charged, prohibited \"sexual contact\" with a person under 13 years of age.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 11-37-4 (1956) (amended 1981).  Finding that the offense defined in the state statute poses \"a serious potential risk of physical injury,\" we hold that Sherwood's Rhode Island conviction was for a \"crime of violence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he standard approach for determining whether a particular crime fits within the 'crime of violence' rubric is a general one, in which inquiry is restricted to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, without regard to the particular facts underlying them.\"  United States v. Meader, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197459\"><a href=\"/opinion/197459/united-states-v-meader/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>, 882 (1st Cir.1997) (citing Taylor v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 600, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990)).  Thus, we engage in a categorical analysis of the statutory crime.  See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. at 600-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>.   Sexual contact with a person under 13 years of age, as defined in the Rhode Island statute, can encompass both violent and non-violent conduct.  As such, the categorical approach allows us \"to go beyond the fact of conviction ... [and] examine the indictment or information and jury instructions in order to discern which type of crime the offender was convicted of perpetrating.\"  United States v. Damon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197584\"><a href=\"/opinion/197584/united-states-v-damon/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 145 (1st Cir.1997).  However, since the information underlying Sherwood's conviction simply reiterates the elements of the statute and the defendant did not face a jury trial (and thus, we lack jury instructions), our inquiry remains limited to the statutory formulation of the prior offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding whether the statutory crime constitutes a \"crime of violence,\" we examine \"the typical run of conduct,\" Damon, 127 F.3d at 145, for this sort of offense.  While the chronological gap between a perpetrator and his victim is not obvious from the face of the statute, we do know from the statute that, in every instance, the victim is at most 12 years old.  Cf. Meader, 118 F.3d at 884 (finding age of victim to be \"crucial fact\" and \"relevant to the question of injury\").  Moreover, we agree with the Fifth Circuit that child molestation crimes \"typically occur in close quarters, and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller, weaker, and less experienced, but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.\"  United States v. Velazquez-Overa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"10694\"><a href=\"/opinion/10694/united-states-v-velazquez-overa/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 422 (5th Cir.1996) (analyzing Texas statute prohibiting indecency with a child by sexual contact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sherwood attempts to distinguish Meader from the instant case by pointing out that Meader involved prior convictions for statutory rape.

Shannon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739088\"><a href=\"/opinion/739088/united-states-v-defabian-c-shannon/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 387 (7th Cir.1997) (en banc) cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span> (1997), to argue that the logic which compels the conclusion that there is \"a serious potential risk of physical injury\" when there is sexual intercourse does not compel or even permit the same conclusion with respect to sexual touching.  The Seventh Circuit, however, did not hold that sexual touching could not constitute a \"crime of violence.\"   See Shannon, 110 F.3d at 389.   Rather, the contrasting views of the Seventh Circuit judges merely evidence the troubling and complex issues involved in determining what crimes constitute \"crimes of violence\" for federal sentencing purposes.  See Shannon, 110 F.3d at 387-90.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the dividing line between sexual offenses that constitute crimes of violence and those that do not, we adopt our sister circuit's conclusion that \"there is a significant likelihood that physical force may be used to perpetrate [this] crime,\" Velazquez-Overa, 100 F.3d at 422, and find that the Rhode Island statute at issue punishes a \"crime of violence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, the district court did not err in its base offense level determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

The sentencing guidelines require the court to \"add two points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation....\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d).  Sherwood does not dispute the government's allegation and the district court's finding that at least one of the firearms for which he was charged was acquired when he was on probation for his state felony conviction.  The defendant avers, however, that since he pleaded guilty to possessing firearms on or about April 22, 1997, a time when he was, without question, not on probation, &#167; 4A1.1(d) does not apply.  In other words, Sherwood claims that his acquisition of weapons during his probation was not the basis of his indictment.
