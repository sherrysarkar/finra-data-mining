Plaintiff Betty Ruth Shapiro\r                    GERTNER, District  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\n(Shapiro)  brought  this  action under  the  Employee  Retirement\r\n\nIncome  Security Act of 1974  (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.   1132(a)(1)(B),\r\n\nclaiming  that she was  wrongfully denied benefits  under a long-\r\n\nterm disability  insurance policy  provided by  her employer  and\r\n\nissued  by the defendant Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company\r\n\n(Reliance).  After  a non-jury trial, the district  court entered\r\n\njudgment in  favor of defendant.   On appeal,  plaintiff contends\r\n\nthat the  district court's findings were clearly  erroneous.  She\r\n\nalso contends  that she was  denied due  process of law  when the\r\n\ndistrict  court  issued  its decision  without  offering  her the\r\n\nopportunity  to present  additional evidence  or  make a  closing\r\n\nargument.  We affirm.         FACTS\r                                        FACTS\r                                             \r\n\n          The  facts  as  found by  the  district  court  were as\r\n\nfollows: On October 13, 1991, plaintiff was involved in a serious\r\n\nmotor  vehicle  accident.   She  was  treated  at the  scene  and\r\n\nreturned  home.   Three  days  later,  however,  she went  to  an\r\n\nemergency room complaining of neck,  shoulder and arm pains.  She\r\n\nbegan seeing an  orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Kenneth  Morrissey, and\r\n\nremained  in his  care  until May  12,  1992.   In  May of  1992,\r\n\nplaintiff   applied   for   reemployment   with   her   employer,\r\n\nFleet/Norstar Financial Group, Inc. (Fleet),1 after Dr. Morrissey\r\n\nadvised  her to  \"give it a  try.\"   She was not  hired, however,\r\n\nbecause there were no positions available.  In  April  of   1992,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Although it is not clear from the record, plaintiff apparently\r\nceased working sometime after her accident.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nShapiro  filed  for  disability  benefits  with  Reliance,  which\r\n\nprovided  group   long-term  disability   insurance  to   Fleet's\r\n\nemployees.   In  response,  Reliance sent  letters  to  three  of\r\n\nShapiro's treating  physicians in  order to  evaluate her  claim.\r\n\nThe  doctors did  not respond until  July of  1992.  Two  of them\r\n\nstated  that  they  were  treating  plaintiff  for  non-disabling\r\n\nmaladies unrelated  to  her disability  claim.   The  third,  Dr.\r\n\nMorrissey, found  the plaintiff to  be \"totally disabled\"  for an\r\n\n\"indefinite  period,\"2  but  that conclusion  was  belied  by his\r\n\noffice records.  The records indicated the Dr. Morrissey believed\r\n\nthe  plaintiff to  be only  partially disabled,  and that  he had\r\n\nadvised  plaintiff  on  May  12,  1992,  the  last  date  of  his\r\n\ntreatment,  that  she  could  try  to return  to  her  job  as  a\r\n\nsecurities input clerk. \r\n\n          In  August  of 1992,  defendant  retroactively approved\r\n\nplaintiff's application  for benefits  for the  period April  10,\r\n\n1992  through  July 10,  1992.    Defendant then  requested  that\r\n\nplaintiff provide additional information substantiating her claim\r\n\nfor  benefits  beyond  July  10,  1992.    It  sent  plaintiff  a\r\n\n\"Supplementary Report  for Continued Disability  Benefits\" and  a\r\n\n\"Physical Capacities  Evaluation Form\"  to be  filled out by  her\r\n\ntreating  physician.  In  November, 1992, plaintiff  returned the\r\n\nSupplementary Report,  but the  portion to  be  completed by  her\r\n\nphysician was left blank.  Instead,  plaintiff submitted a record\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Dr. Morrissey had  reported this conclusion on  an \"Attending\r\nPhysician's Statement of Disability\" dated April 7, 1992.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfrom a Dr. Tarpey, indicating  that he was treating plaintiff for\r\n\nasthma and  emphysema.   Plaintiff never  submitted the  Physical\r\n\nCapacities Evaluation Form.\r\n\n          Defendant  next sent  letters  directly to  plaintiff's\r\n\nphysicians seeking  information as to whether she continued to be\r\n\ndisabled.  Defendant received no  responses to these letters.  In\r\n\nFebruary of 1993,  plaintiff advised defendant by  telephone that\r\n\nshe was seeing a chiropractor, Dr. Andrew Lombardi.   In March of\r\n\n1993, defendant sent a letter to Dr. Lombardi seeking information\r\n\nabout his  treatment and  plaintiff's disability.   Dr.  Lombardi\r\n\nwrote  back  in   April  of  1993  providing   information  about\r\n\nplaintiff's condition, but did not indicate whether plaintiff was\r\n\ndisabled,  or whether she  had been continuously  disabled during\r\n\nthe period  between May of  1992, when she ceased  treatment with\r\n\nDr.  Morrissey,  and April  of 1993.3   Moreover,  Dr. Lombardi's\r\n\nletter   stated   that   plaintiff  had   \"denie[d]   any   prior\r\n\naccidents/incidents  that   could  have   produced  the   current\r\n\nsymptoms.   In  fact, as  plaintiff  admitted at  trial, she  had\r\n\nearlier taken a nine month disability leave for an unrelated neck\r\n\nand back injury in 1989.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  This  was significant because, under the  terms of defendant's\r\npolicy,  plaintiff's  benefits  would terminate  as  soon  as she\r\nceased to  be totally disabled.  Since  she was no longer working\r\nfor Fleet in 1993,  she needed to show that  she was continuously\r\ndisabled from  the time  when she  was so  employed  in order  to\r\ncontinue to receive benefits.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          On April 30, 1993,  defendant denied plaintiff's  claim\r\n\nfor additional benefits.   Plaintiff appealed through defendant's\r\n\ninternal appeal process, and her claim was again denied.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nI.  The District Court's Findings\r          I.  The District Court's Findings\r                                           \r\n\n          Under the  terms of  defendant's policy,  plaintiff was\r\n\neligible for disability benefits only  if she met four  criteria:\r\n\n(1) that she  was totally disabled as  a result of a  sickness or\r\n\ninjury covered by the policy, (2) that she was under the  regular\r\n\ncare   of  a  physician,  (3)  that  she  completed  a  so-called\r\n\n\"Elimination  Period,\" and  (4) that  she  submitted satisfactory\r\n\nproof of her total  disability.  Engaging in a de  novo review of\r                                                                 \r\n\nplaintiff's claim,  see Firestone Tire  and Rubber Co.  v. Bruch,\r                                                                          \r\n\n489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989), the district court found that plaintiff\r\n\ndid  not   satisfy  the   first,  second   or  fourth  of   these\r\n\nrequirements, and therefore was ineligible for benefits.  We will\r\n\nvacate  these  findings  only  if  they  are  clearly  erroneous.\r\n\nCumpiano v. Banco  Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d  148, 152 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1990).  None of them is.\r\n\n          First,  the district  court  found  that plaintiff  had\r\n\nfailed to submit  satisfactory proof of  her total disability  to\r\n\ndefendant.  This finding is  not clearly erroneous.  Although Dr.\r\n\nMorrissey  did aver  that, as  of  April 7,  1992, plaintiff  was\r\n\ntotally disabled, one month later, on May 12, 1992, Dr. Morrissey\r\n\nadvised plaintiff that she could try to return to  work.  Indeed,\r\n\nplaintiff  did attempt  to return to  work at that  time, and was\r\n\nonly  refused  because  of the  lack  of  an available  position.\r\n\nDefendant, aware  that Dr.  Morrissey had  advised plaintiff  she\r\n\ncould try  to return to  work, reasonably questioned  whether she\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nremained  totally disabled, and  engaged in numerous  attempts to\r\n\nobtain  additional proof  to  support her  claim.   Despite these\r\n\nattempts,   plaintiff  never   produced  any   evidence  of   her\r\n\ndisability.  The district court's  finding to that effect was not\r\n\nclearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The  district court also  found that plaintiff  was not\r\n\nunder the regular care of a physician.  No evidence was presented\r\n\nthat plaintiff  was regularly  seeing any  medical provider  from\r\n\nMay 12, 1992, when she ceased treatment with Dr. Morrissey, until\r\n\nFebruary 22, 1993, when she  started treatment with Dr. Lombardi.\r\n\nThere was  also evidence that  plaintiff had ceased  all physical\r\n\ntherapy during this  period.  The  district court's finding  that\r\n\nplaintiff  was not  under the  treatment of  a physician  was not\r\n\nclearly in error.  \r\n\n          Finally, the  district court  found that plaintiff  was\r\n\nnot,  in fact,  totally  disabled  during  the  relevant  period.\r\n\nAlthough  Dr. Lombardi  testified  at   trial  that  he  believed\r\n\nplaintiff  to be  totally disabled, and  that her  disability had\r\n\nbeen in place during the  relevant period, the district court did\r\n\nnot credit this  testimony as it was inconsistent  with the other\r\n\nevidence,  including Dr. Morrissey's advice  on May 12, 1992 that\r\n\nif plaintiff wanted to return to work she should \"give it a try.\"\r\n\nThe district court also  found that Dr. Lombardi's testimony  was\r\n\nbased on false statements provided to him by plaintiff, including\r\n\na false statement that she had never been in any  other accidents\r\n\nwhich  could  have  caused  her  current  symptoms.    (In  fact,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nplaintiff  had  missed  work  for   nine  months  in  1989  after\r\n\ncomplaining  of neck and  back problems.)   Dr. Lombardi likewise\r\n\nignored the fact that plaintiff had reapplied for work just after\r\n\nher initial application  for disability benefits had  been filed.\r\n\nIn light  of the  conflicting evidence,  the  district court  was\r\n\nentitled to reach the conclusion that it did.\r\n\nII.  Due Process Claim\r          II.  Due Process Claim\r                                \r\n\n          The trial was held on  December 19, 1994.  The district\r\n\ncourt  heard three live witnesses:  the plaintiff, one of her co-\r\n\nworkers, and  an employee of the defendant.   At the close of the\r\n\nday,   the  district  court   directed  the  parties   to  depose\r\n\nplaintiff's two remaining witnesses, Drs. Morrissey and Lombardi,\r\n\nand to  file edited transcripts with the court.   This was done a\r\n\nfew weeks  later.  Approximately  one year later, on  November 2,\r\n\n1995, the district court issued its decision.\r\n\n          Plaintiff now  contends that the district  court denied\r\n\nher  due  process  of  law   because  it  failed  to  provide  an\r\n\nopportunity  for closing  argument,  or  for  the  submission  of\r\n\nadditional  evidence, prior to  issuing its decision.   Plaintiff\r\n\nstates that  if given the  opportunity, she would  have presented\r\n\nevidence that an  Administrative Law Judge of the Social Security\r\n\nAdministration had found  her to be totally disabled  in April of\r\n\n1995.   Putting aside the  question of whether this  decision was\r\n\nrelevant  or  otherwise  admissible,  plaintiff  waived  her  due\r\n\nprocess  claim  by  failing  to  raise it  to  the  court  below.\r\n\nPoliquin v. Garden  Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 531 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                       \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nPlaintiff never requested the  opportunity to present  additional\r\n\nevidence  or to  make a  closing  argument in  the eleven  months\r\n\nbetween the trial date and  the issuance of the court's decision.\r\n\nMoreover,  plaintiff never moved  to alter or  amend the judgment\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 59.  \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt is affirmed.

Plaintiff Betty Ruth Shapiro\r                    GERTNER, District  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\n(Shapiro)  brought  this  action under  the  Employee  Retirement\r\n\nIncome  Security Act of 1974  (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.   1132(a)(1)(B),\r\n\nclaiming  that she was  wrongfully denied benefits  under a long-\r\n\nterm disability  insurance policy  provided by  her employer  and\r\n\nissued  by the defendant Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company\r\n\n(Reliance).  After  a non-jury trial, the district  court entered\r\n\njudgment in  favor of defendant.   On appeal,  plaintiff contends\r\n\nthat the  district court's findings were clearly  erroneous.  She\r\n\nalso contends  that she was  denied due  process of law  when the\r\n\ndistrict  court  issued  its decision  without  offering  her the\r\n\nopportunity  to present  additional evidence  or  make a  closing\r\n\nargument.  We affirm.         FACTS\r                                        FACTS\r                                             \r\n\n          The  facts  as  found by  the  district  court  were as\r\n\nfollows: On October 13, 1991, plaintiff was involved in a serious\r\n\nmotor  vehicle  accident.   She  was  treated  at the  scene  and\r\n\nreturned  home.   Three  days  later,  however,  she went  to  an\r\n\nemergency room complaining of neck,  shoulder and arm pains.  She\r\n\nbegan seeing an  orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Kenneth  Morrissey, and\r\n\nremained  in his  care  until May  12,  1992.   In  May of  1992,\r\n\nplaintiff   applied   for   reemployment   with   her   employer,\r\n\nFleet/Norstar Financial Group, Inc. (Fleet),1 after Dr. Morrissey\r\n\nadvised  her to  \"give it a  try.\"   She was not  hired, however,\r\n\nbecause there were no positions available.  In  April  of   1992,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Although it is not clear from the record, plaintiff apparently\r\nceased working sometime after her accident.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nShapiro  filed  for  disability  benefits  with  Reliance,  which\r\n\nprovided  group   long-term  disability   insurance  to   Fleet's\r\n\nemployees.   In  response,  Reliance sent  letters  to  three  of\r\n\nShapiro's treating  physicians in  order to  evaluate her  claim.\r\n\nThe  doctors did  not respond until  July of  1992.  Two  of them\r\n\nstated  that  they  were  treating  plaintiff  for  non-disabling\r\n\nmaladies unrelated  to  her disability  claim.   The  third,  Dr.\r\n\nMorrissey, found  the plaintiff to  be \"totally disabled\"  for an\r\n\n\"indefinite  period,\"2  but  that conclusion  was  belied  by his\r\n\noffice records.  The records indicated the Dr. Morrissey believed\r\n\nthe  plaintiff to  be only  partially disabled,  and that  he had\r\n\nadvised  plaintiff  on  May  12,  1992,  the  last  date  of  his\r\n\ntreatment,  that  she  could  try  to return  to  her  job  as  a\r\n\nsecurities input clerk. \r\n\n          In  August  of 1992,  defendant  retroactively approved\r\n\nplaintiff's application  for benefits  for the  period April  10,\r\n\n1992  through  July 10,  1992.    Defendant then  requested  that\r\n\nplaintiff provide additional information substantiating her claim\r\n\nfor  benefits  beyond  July  10,  1992.    It  sent  plaintiff  a\r\n\n\"Supplementary Report  for Continued Disability  Benefits\" and  a\r\n\n\"Physical Capacities  Evaluation Form\"  to be  filled out by  her\r\n\ntreating  physician.  In  November, 1992, plaintiff  returned the\r\n\nSupplementary Report,  but the  portion to  be  completed by  her\r\n\nphysician was left blank.  Instead,  plaintiff submitted a record\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Dr. Morrissey had  reported this conclusion on  an \"Attending\r\nPhysician's Statement of Disability\" dated April 7, 1992.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfrom a Dr. Tarpey, indicating  that he was treating plaintiff for\r\n\nasthma and  emphysema.   Plaintiff never  submitted the  Physical\r\n\nCapacities Evaluation Form.\r\n\n          Defendant  next sent  letters  directly to  plaintiff's\r\n\nphysicians seeking  information as to whether she continued to be\r\n\ndisabled.  Defendant received no  responses to these letters.  In\r\n\nFebruary of 1993,  plaintiff advised defendant by  telephone that\r\n\nshe was seeing a chiropractor, Dr. Andrew Lombardi.   In March of\r\n\n1993, defendant sent a letter to Dr. Lombardi seeking information\r\n\nabout his  treatment and  plaintiff's disability.   Dr.  Lombardi\r\n\nwrote  back  in   April  of  1993  providing   information  about\r\n\nplaintiff's condition, but did not indicate whether plaintiff was\r\n\ndisabled,  or whether she  had been continuously  disabled during\r\n\nthe period  between May of  1992, when she ceased  treatment with\r\n\nDr.  Morrissey,  and April  of 1993.3   Moreover,  Dr. Lombardi's\r\n\nletter   stated   that   plaintiff  had   \"denie[d]   any   prior\r\n\naccidents/incidents  that   could  have   produced  the   current\r\n\nsymptoms.   In  fact, as  plaintiff  admitted at  trial, she  had\r\n\nearlier taken a nine month disability leave for an unrelated neck\r\n\nand back injury in 1989.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  This  was significant because, under the  terms of defendant's\r\npolicy,  plaintiff's  benefits  would terminate  as  soon  as she\r\nceased to  be totally disabled.  Since  she was no longer working\r\nfor Fleet in 1993,  she needed to show that  she was continuously\r\ndisabled from  the time  when she  was so  employed  in order  to\r\ncontinue to receive benefits.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          On April 30, 1993,  defendant denied plaintiff's  claim\r\n\nfor additional benefits.   Plaintiff appealed through defendant's\r\n\ninternal appeal process, and her claim was again denied.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nI.

We will\r\n\nvacate  these  findings  only  if  they  are  clearly  erroneous.\r\n\nCumpiano v. Banco  Santander Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1990).  None of them is.\r\n\n          First,  the district  court  found  that plaintiff  had\r\n\nfailed to submit  satisfactory proof of  her total disability  to\r\n\ndefendant.  This finding is  not clearly erroneous.  Although Dr.\r\n\nMorrissey  did aver  that, as  of  April 7,  1992, plaintiff  was\r\n\ntotally disabled, one month later, on May 12, 1992, Dr. Morrissey\r\n\nadvised plaintiff that she could try to return to  work.  Indeed,\r\n\nplaintiff  did attempt  to return to  work at that  time, and was\r\n\nonly  refused  because  of the  lack  of  an available  position.\r\n\nDefendant, aware  that Dr.  Morrissey had  advised plaintiff  she\r\n\ncould try  to return to  work, reasonably questioned  whether she\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nremained  totally disabled, and  engaged in numerous  attempts to\r\n\nobtain  additional proof  to  support her  claim.   Despite these\r\n\nattempts,   plaintiff  never   produced  any   evidence  of   her\r\n\ndisability.  The district court's  finding to that effect was not\r\n\nclearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The  district court also  found that plaintiff  was not\r\n\nunder the regular care of a physician.  No evidence was presented\r\n\nthat plaintiff  was regularly  seeing any  medical provider  from\r\n\nMay 12, 1992, when she ceased treatment with Dr. Morrissey, until\r\n\nFebruary 22, 1993, when she  started treatment with Dr. Lombardi.\r\n\nThere was  also evidence that  plaintiff had ceased  all physical\r\n\ntherapy during this  period.  The  district court's finding  that\r\n\nplaintiff  was not  under the  treatment of  a physician  was not\r\n\nclearly in error.  \r\n\n          Finally, the  district court  found that plaintiff  was\r\n\nnot,  in fact,  totally  disabled  during  the  relevant  period.\r\n\nAlthough  Dr. Lombardi  testified  at   trial  that  he  believed\r\n\nplaintiff  to be  totally disabled, and  that her  disability had\r\n\nbeen in place during the  relevant period, the district court did\r\n\nnot credit this  testimony as it was inconsistent  with the other\r\n\nevidence,  including Dr. Morrissey's advice  on May 12, 1992 that\r\n\nif plaintiff wanted to return to work she should \"give it a try.\"\r\n\nThe district court also  found that Dr. Lombardi's testimony  was\r\n\nbased on false statements provided to him by plaintiff, including\r\n\na false statement that she had never been in any  other accidents\r\n\nwhich  could  have  caused  her  current  symptoms.    (In  fact,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nplaintiff  had  missed  work  for   nine  months  in  1989  after\r\n\ncomplaining  of neck and  back problems.)   Dr. Lombardi likewise\r\n\nignored the fact that plaintiff had reapplied for work just after\r\n\nher initial application  for disability benefits had  been filed.\r\n\nIn light  of the  conflicting evidence,  the  district court  was\r\n\nentitled to reach the conclusion that it did.\r\n\nII.  Due Process Claim\r          II.  Due Process Claim\r                                \r\n\n          The trial was held on  December 19, 1994.  The district\r\n\ncourt  heard three live witnesses:  the plaintiff, one of her co-\r\n\nworkers, and  an employee of the defendant.   At the close of the\r\n\nday,   the  district  court   directed  the  parties   to  depose\r\n\nplaintiff's two remaining witnesses, Drs. Morrissey and Lombardi,\r\n\nand to  file edited transcripts with the court.   This was done a\r\n\nfew weeks  later.  Approximately  one year later, on  November 2,\r\n\n1995, the district court issued its decision.\r\n\n          Plaintiff now  contends that the district  court denied\r\n\nher  due  process  of  law   because  it  failed  to  provide  an\r\n\nopportunity  for closing  argument,  or  for  the  submission  of\r\n\nadditional  evidence, prior to  issuing its decision.   Plaintiff\r\n\nstates that  if given the  opportunity, she would  have presented\r\n\nevidence that an  Administrative Law Judge of the Social Security\r\n\nAdministration had found  her to be totally disabled  in April of\r\n\n1995.   Putting aside the  question of whether this  decision was\r\n\nrelevant  or  otherwise  admissible,  plaintiff  waived  her  due\r\n\nprocess  claim  by  failing  to  raise it  to  the  court  below.\r\n\nPoliquin v.
