John  Staffier  sued  Sandoz  for  employment\r\n\ndiscrimination on  account of  age and/or handicap  under the\r\n\nMassachusetts employment discrimination statute, Mass. Gen L.\r\n\nch. 151B, and  the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen.\r\n\nL. ch.  94.  Pamela Staffier sued for loss of consortium.  On\r\n\nappeal, Staffier  pursues only the  employment discrimination\r\n\nclaim under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B.\r\n\n          The facts and  the applicable law are set  forth in\r\n\nthe  district court's  Memorandum  and Order  dated June  19,\r\n\n1995.  Staffier v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., 888 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n\n287 (D. Mass. 1995).  We have carefully reviewed the parties'\r\n\nbriefs  and  the  record  on  appeal.    The  district  court\r\n\ncorrectly determined that Staffier failed to present evidence\r\n\nthat, viewed most favorably  to Staffier, establishes a prima\r\n\nfacie case of discrimination.\r\n\n          In  particular,  Staffier failed  to  present facts\r\n\nthat would allow  an inference  that he applied  for and  was\r\n\nqualified  for the  two  sales positions  he  claims to  have\r\n\nwanted.  Those positions were filled before he was  medically\r\n\ncleared  to return to work.  Staffier argues for an inference\r\n\nthat the  medical clearance  requirement was a  mere pretext,\r\n\nbecause  Sandoz subsequently  waived the requirement  with no\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfurther information than  it had  at the  time the  positions\r\n\nwere open.   We find it  unreasonable to ask  a factfinder to\r\n\ninfer  that  (1)  Sandoz   did  not  really  require  medical\r\n\nclearance for  a job applicant who had  been totally disabled\r\n\nfor  the  previous  nine  years, and  (2)  Sandoz's  decision\r\n\neventually to grant clearance  without the additional medical\r\n\ndata it initially sought indicates that the medical clearance\r\n\nrequirement was a sham.  \r\n\n          We   have  considered   all  of   Staffier's  other\r\n\narguments  and they are without  merit.  There  simply are no\r\n\nreasonable     inferences    of     intentional    employment\r\n\ndiscrimination  to be  drawn from  the facts  in the  summary\r\n\njudgment record, and  Staffier's unsupported allegations  are\r\n\ninsufficient to make out his case.  There being no need to go\r\n\nfurther, we  affirm the summary  judgment for  Sandoz on  the\r                               \r\n\nbasis of the district court's well-reasoned opinion.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n",
