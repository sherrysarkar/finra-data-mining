On August 21,  1995,\r                                 \r\n\nCarrington was  sentenced to a  term of 50  months incarceration,\r\n\nfollowed  by a  36  month period  of  supervised release,  and  a\r\n\nmandatory special assessment of $50.  He contests the validity of\r\n\nhis  plea based on Federal  Rule of Criminal  Procedure 11(f) and\r\n\nalso appeals his sentence on several grounds.  We affirm both his\r\n\nconviction and his sentence.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r                                                  \r\n\n          The case arises  from two separate  sets of schemes  to\r\n\ndefraud.   In the first set,  charged in Counts I  through IV and\r\n\nspanning from December 1993  to April 1994, Carrington negotiated\r\n\nthe purchase  of four  expensive cars from  out-of-state dealers.\r\n\nHe then tricked the dealers into believing that they had received\r\n\nwire transfers in payment for the  cars.  All four cars were then\r\n\nshipped to Carrington in  Massachusetts.  Carrington was arrested\r\n\non  May  3, 1994,  and  released  on conditions  pending  further\r\n\nproceedings in  the district  court.  On  or about July  8, 1994,\r\n\nCarrington  and  the government  entered  into  a plea  agreement\r\n\npursuant to which he agreed to plead guilty to all four counts of\r\n\nthe  information, which was filed  on July 19,  1994.  Carrington\r\n\ndid   not  immediately   waive  indictment   and  plead   to  the\r\n\ninformation.   Instead, upon Carrington's  motion, the  Probation\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nOffice began  working on the Presentence Report  (\"PSR\") with the\r\n\nintention of  having Carrington plead  and be sentenced  upon its\r\n\ncompletion.\r\n\n          In the second set, charged in Counts V and VI, which he\r\n\nexecuted while on release in connection with Counts I through IV,\r\n\nCarrington sought to obtain and deposit bank drafts drawn against\r\n\nthe corporate bank  accounts of various  companies.  The  conduct\r\n\ncharged as  Count V took  place in  November 1994.   On or  about\r\n\nNovember  14,   1994,  while   the  parties  were   awaiting  the\r\n\npreparation of  the PSR, Carrington, identifying  himself as Chad\r\n\nLittles  (\"Littles\"), the Accounts  Receivable/Payroll Manager of\r\n\nQuorum  International, Ltd.  (\"Quorum\"),  opened an  account with\r\n\nInternational Banking Technology,  Inc. (\"IBT\"), of  Springfield,\r\n\nVirginia.    IBT  provides  a bank  drafting  system  that allows\r\n\ncreditors  to collect payment over the phone by having the debtor\r\n\npre-authorize a one-time  debit to his or her account.   When IBT\r\n\nis provided  with  the  debtor  information  by  its  client,  it\r\n\nprepares bank drafts (or  permits the client to produce  the bank\r\n\ndrafts  by means  of its  software) that  are deposited  by IBT's\r\n\nclient into its bank  account.  When these drafts  are processed,\r\n\nthe  debtor's  account  is  debited  and  the  creditor  receives\r\n\npayment.  On  or about November 16, 1994, Carrington faxed thirty\r\n\ncompleted Bank Draft Sales  Forms (\"draft forms\") to IBT.   These\r\n\ndraft  forms  are  used  to  provide  IBT  with  the  information\r\n\nnecessary for it to produce the bank drafts for the one-time pre-\r\n\nauthorized  debits.  The draft forms that Carrington faxed to IBT\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nprovided all  of the necessary information including  the name of\r\n\nthe  company to  charge,  its checking  account  number, and  the\r\n\namount  of  the  draft  requested  to  cover  the purported  pre-\r\n\nauthorized one-time debit.  Carrington requested that IBT prepare\r\n\n30 bank  drafts of  $5,000 each  for a  total of  $150,000, which\r\n\npurportedly was to constitute payment for attendance at a seminar\r\n\nallegedly held by Quorum.   Carrington's attempt failed, however,\r\n\nwhen  as  part of  IBT's fraud  control  system, it  attempted to\r\n\nverify  the authorization  for some  of the  bank drafts,  and it\r\n\nfound that some of the phone numbers were incorrect.  Because IBT\r\n\nsuspected  fraud,  it  never  completed  processing  Carrington's\r\n\nrequest, and Carrington failed to obtain the funds he sought.\r\n\n          The conduct charged  in Count VI took place in December\r\n\n1994.   On  or about  December 5,  1994, Carrington,  identifying\r\n\nhimself as  Paul Epstein (\"Epstein\"), Chief  Financial Officer of\r\n\nCitibank, phoned IBT,  faxed them an  application for bank  draft\r\n\nforms,  and  requested IBT  software  that  would  permit him  to\r\n\ntransmit his  requests for  bank drafts  to IBT by  modem.   This\r\n\nsoftware also  allowed Carrington to receive from  IBT, by modem,\r\n\nthe  instructions necessary to print the bank drafts at his home.\r\n\nOn December 29,  1994, Carrington sent to  IBT by modem  80 forms\r\n\nfor printing bank drafts at his residence,  which were to be used\r\n\nto  debit  80 different  companies'  accounts  in varied  amounts\r\n\ntotalling $583,443.50.   He  failed to  obtain  the total  amount\r\n\nsought, receiving and depositing $268,000 into a personal account\r\n\nbefore the U.S. Secret Service discovered his actions.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          Based on the events of November and December 1994,  the\r\n\ngovernment filed  a superseding information adding  two counts of\r\n\nwire fraud, Counts V and VI, to the previous Counts I through IV.\r\n\nPursuant to a second plea agreement, Carrington waived indictment\r\n\nand  pled guilty to all six counts of the superseding information\r\n\non March 28, 1995.  He was sentenced on August 21, 1995.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r                                                  \r\n\n                A.  Carrington's Rule 11 argument\r                          A.  Carrington's Rule 11 argument\r\n\n          In  his   brief,  without   having  so   argued  below,\r\n\nCarrington contends  that the district court  erred under Federal\r\n\nRule of Criminal  Procedure 11(f) by calculating  his sentence in\r\n\npart  on  a  plea   for  which  there  was  no   factual  basis.1\r\n\nSpecifically, he  argues  that  even viewed  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the government, there was no proof that the vehicles\r\n\ninvolved in the information Counts I through IV were stolen prior\r\n\nto their placement into the stream  of interstate commerce, which\r\n\nhe alleges is an essential element under the Act.  \r\n\n          Because Carrington seeks to withdraw his plea following\r\n\nthe  imposition of  his  sentence, he  must  show that  the  plea\r\n\nproceedings were marred by \"a fundamental defect which inherently\r\n\nresults  in a  complete  miscarriage of  justice  or an  omission\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  11(f)  (\"Determining accuracy  of  plea\")\r\nprovides that:\r\n\n            Notwithstanding the acceptance of  a plea\r\n            of  guilty, the court  should not enter a\r\n            judgment  upon  such plea  without making\r\n            such inquiry  as  shall satisfy  it  that\r\n            there is a factual basis for the plea.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ninconsistent with  the rudimentary  demands of  fair procedure.\"2\r\n\nUnited States v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal\r                                   \r\n\nquotations  omitted); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e); see also former\r                                                                    \r\n\nFed. R. Crim.  P. 32(d), comment.  (advisory committee's note  to\r\n\n1983 amendments to predecessor of  Rule 32(e)); United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nJapa, 994  F.2d 899, 902  (1st Cir. 1993)  (stating that,  to set\r              \r\n\naside a plea  post-sentencing, the reviewing  court must find  \"a\r\n\nfundamental defect or a miscarriage of justice\").\r\n\n          Carrington's appeal  does not meet this  high standard.\r\n\nCarrington's  sole argument under Rule 11(f) is that there was no\r\n\nevidence that the vehicles  involved in Counts I through  IV were\r\n\nstolen before they  were placed into the stream  of commerce.  We\r\n\nreject Carrington's  challenge for  two reasons, either  of which\r\n\nwould suffice independently to justify our conclusion.  First, we\r\n\nhave  previously rejected  a similar  argument under 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2314, Carrington's statute of  conviction.  See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPuerta, 38  F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 1994).  Much as Carrington does\r                \r\n\nhere, the  defendant in  Puerta argued  that \"'no  [property] had\r                                         \r\n\nbeen stolen  or taken  by fraud  at the  time of  transfer.'\" Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(quoting brief  of defendant).   Paraphrasing that argument  as a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   We  recognize that the  burden a  defendant bears  on a post-\r\nsentencing appeal from a guilty plea in this Circuit is \"somewhat\r\ncloudy,\" United  States v. Mart nez-Mart nez, 69  F.3d 1215, 1219\r                                                      \r\n(1st Cir.  1995), cert.  denied,     U.S.    ,  116 S.  Ct.  1343\r                                         \r\n(1996), as previous cases  have held direct appellants only  to a\r\nharmless error standard.  Id.; see, e.g., United States v. Parra-\r                                                                           \r\nIba ez,  936 F.2d  588, 598  &amp; n.24  (1st Cir.  1991).   We note,\r                \r\nhowever, that although we follow the more stringent  standard set\r\nout  in Ferguson and Japa,  even were we  to apply harmless error\r                                   \r\nreview, Carrington's argument would fail.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nclaim \"that  when transferred  the  [property] had  not yet  been\r                                                                     \r\n\nstolen,\" id. (emphasis  in original), we concluded  that we could\r                      \r\n\n\"see  no reason why the fraudulent taking required any more than\"\r\n\nacceptance of  the  property, misrepresentations,  access to  the\r\n\nproperty,  and \"the requisite  scienter.\"  Id.   Similarly, given\r                                                        \r\n\nthat Carrington does not argue that there was no factual basis to\r\n\nfind that he accepted  the vehicles, made misrepresentations, had\r\n\naccess  to the vehicles, and had the requisite intent -- \"knowing\r\n\nthe [vehicles] to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud,\"\r                                                          \r\n\n18 U.S.C.    2314 (emphasis added) -- his argument that there was\r\n\nno factual  basis to  find the  vehicles stolen  before transport\r\n\nmust fail, because it is simply irrelevant.\r\n\n          Second,  Carrington  pled  guilty  to  four  counts  of\r\n\ntransporting or causing to be transported vehicles  which he knew\r\n\nto  be  \"stolen, converted  and taken  by  fraud.\"   However, the\r                                         \r\n\nstatute  itself  is phrased  in  the  disjunctive, punishing  the\r\n\ntransport of goods  known to  be \"stolen, converted  or taken  by\r                                                                 \r\n\nfraud,\" see 18 U.S.C.   2314, as Carrington himself quotes in his\r                     \r\n\nbrief.  Carrington argues that there  is no factual basis for the\r\n\nconclusion that the goods were stolen when transported, but makes\r\n\nno reference to conversion or fraudulent takings.  But even if he\r\n\nwere correct with respect  to the \"stolen\" prong of  the statute,\r\n\nhe would  still need to persuade  us with respect to  both of the\r\n\nother  two prongs.  However,  Carrington does not  contend that a\r\n\nfactual basis is absent to support the proposition that he caused\r\n\nthe goods to be transported and that  he took them by fraud -- an\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nalternative basis for criminal  liability under section 2314, and\r\n\na  basis included  in the  information to  which he  pled guilty.\r\n\nEven  if Carrington were  to so argue,  it would  not profit him,\r\n\nsince  the presentence  report established  a more  than adequate\r\n\nbasis for the plea under the \"taken by fraud\" theory.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (recognizing PSR\r                            \r\n\nas adequate factual basis for plea  when considering propriety of\r\n\nplea withdrawal).   As a  result, we  conclude that no  defect or\r\n\nmiscarriage  of justice  exists to  require that  we reverse  the\r\n\ndistrict court's sentencing decision or  vacate Carrington's plea\r\n\ndue to an inadequate factual basis for  the plea pursuant to Fed.\r\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(f).\r\n\n          Besides  the  argument   with  respect  to   his  plea,\r\n\nCarrington  also raised  an  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel\r\n\nchallenge for the first time at oral argument.  Ordinarily, we do\r\n\nnot address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct\r\n\nappeal.  See United States  v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1993)  (holding that  absent  extraordinary circumstances,  fact-\r\n\nspecific claims  asserting ineffective assistance  of counsel are\r\n\nnot cognizable on direct  appeal), cert. denied, 114 S.

However, these\r\n\ncharges depend  on evidentiary matters which  are best considered\r\n\nby  the  district court  in the  first  instance.

The value and loss determinations in Counts I through IV\r\n\n          Carrington disputes  the values assigned by  the PSR --\r\n\nthat is, the values represented by the prices  he promised to pay\r\n\nthe  dealers he contacted -- and adopted by the district court in\r\n\nsentencing, to the  four cars that were the subjects  of Counts I\r\n\nthrough IV,  respectively.  He  contends that the  district court\r\n\nshould  instead have valued the car in  Count I at $30,000 -- the\r\n\namount  of money he  obtained in the  sale of the car  -- and for\r\n\nCounts  II through  IV  the  court  should  have  used  the  fair\r\n\nwholesale  value of the vehicles.  Carrington points out that the\r\n\nonly reference to valuation in  the record, apart from references\r\n\nto \"an agreed upon price,\" is in the FBI agent's affidavit of the\r\n\ncar  dealer's statements.  He  adds that the  only information on\r\n\npersonal  knowledge as to  the value of  any car  was the $30,000\r\n\nwillingly  paid  by  a  car  dealer  for  the  car  in  Count  I.\r\n\nCarrington  notes  that while  the  Guidelines  use \"fair  market\r\n\nvalue\" as the measure of the value of stolen  property, that rule\r\n\nis  not absolute,  and in fact,  if market value  is difficult to\r\n\nascertain  or inadequate  to  measure  the  harm to  the  victim,\r\n\nalternative  methods of valuation may be used.  U.S.S.G.   2B1.1,\r\n\nn.2.\r\n\n          This  court  reviews  de   novo  the  district  court's\r                                                   \r\n\ninterpretation  of   the  loss  provisions  of   the  Guidelines.\r\n\nThereafter,  it  normally  reviews  a  district  court's  factual\r\n\nfindings only for clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Koon,\r                                                                          \r\n\n   U.S.    , 116 S. Ct. 2035 (1996); United States v. Skrodzki, 9\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nF.3d  198, 202 (1st Cir. 1993).   But where, as here, a defendant\r\n\nfails  to object to the court's loss computation -- as Carrington\r\n\nconcedes in his brief -- review is for plain error.  \r\n\n          Carrington's   essential  contention,   without  record\r\n\nsupport,  is that  the prices  he negotiated  in relation  to the\r\n\nvehicles involved  in Counts  II through  IV  were overstated  in\r\n\norder  to induce  the dealers' agreement.   But in  fact, the PSR\r\n\nsuggests  that Carrington negotiated the price of each vehicle in\r\n\nan  arm's  length transaction.    Under  section 2B1.1,  comment.\r\n\n(n.2),  a   product's  fair   market  value  is   ordinarily  the\r\n\nappropriate value of the victim's loss.  Here, it was reasonable,\r\n\nparticularly in  light of  the bargaining between  Carrington and\r\n\nthe dealers, for the district court to calculate the market value\r\n\nof each vehicle to  be the price Carrington negotiated  with each\r\n\ndealership.  See, e.g., United States v. Warshawsky, 20 F.3d 204,\r                                                             \r\n\n213 (6th Cir. 1994) (applying market value in a section 2314 case\r\n\nto mean the price a  willing buyer would pay a willing  seller at\r\n\nthe time  and place the  property was taken).   Loss need  not be\r\n\ndetermined with precision, and  in fact may be inferred  from any\r\n\nreasonably reliable information.  See,  e.g., Skrodzki, 9 F.3d at\r                                                                \r\n\n203.  Furthermore, it was reasonable  for the court to adopt  the\r\n\nretail rather than the wholesale values of the cars, since all of\r\n\nthe  dealerships  from whom  Carrington  obtained  the cars  were\r\n\nengaged in retail sales of automobiles.  As a result, we conclude\r\n\nthat the district court did not commit plain error in determining\r\n\nthe market value of the vehicles in Counts I through IV.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          C.  Carrington's argument that Counts V and VI\r                    C.  Carrington's argument that Counts V and VI\r\n             should have been sentenced as attempts \r                       should have been sentenced as attempts\r\n\n          Carrington  contends that the sentencing court erred in\r\n\nconcluding  that Counts V and VI were both completed crimes, with\r\n\na total  intended loss of $583,000.   He argues that  the lack of\r\n\nactual loss counsels  for the  proposition that Counts  V and  VI\r\n\nshould be classed  as mere attempts, pursuant  to the Guidelines.\r\n\nSee  U.S.S.G.   2X1.1(b)(1) (mandating a decrease by 3 levels for\r             \r\n\nan  attempt).   Thus,  he posits,  the  offense levels  for those\r\n\ncounts should be lower than  those the district court  attributed\r\n\nto  them.  We review the district court's legal ruling concerning\r\n\nthe scope of section 2X1.1 de novo, but uphold the application of\r                                            \r\n\nsection 2X1.1  to the  facts of Carrington's  offense conduct  so\r\n\nlong   as  it  is  not  clearly  erroneous.    United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nChapdelaine, 989 F.2d  28, 34 (1st  Cir. 1993) (discussing  clear\r                     \r\n\nerror  with respect to section  2X1.1), cert. denied,  114 S.

Egemonye,  62  F.3d 425  (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1995).  In that case, the district court calculated loss pursuant\r\n\nto  section  2F1.1 based  on the  total  aggregate limits  of the\r\n\ncredit cards that the defendant wrongfully obtained.  Id. at 429.\r                                                                   \r\n\nThe  defendant  argued  that  because  section  2F1.1  references\r\n\nsection  2X1.1  regarding \"partially  completed  offense[s],\" and\r\n\nbecause he had actually inflicted a loss of only about 53 percent\r\n\nof  the aggregate credit limit before  his scheme was interrupted\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nby  arrest, the  district court  erred in  denying him  the lower\r\n\noffenselevel attendant to anonly \"partially completed\"crime.  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n          We  rejected the  application of  section 2X1.1  to the\r\n\ndefendant's  conduct in  Egemonye.   Id. at 430.   We  noted that\r                                                  \r\n\nthere were  two competing views  of section  2X1.1.  It  could be\r\n\nviewed  as offering  a reduction  for potential  versus completed\r\n\nharm; alternatively,  its provisions  could be read  literally to\r\n\ndirect its application only where the defendant has not completed\r\n\nthe actions necessary to the substantive offense.  Id.  In siding\r                                                                \r\n\nwith the latter view, we stated that\r\n\n            [t]here  would  be nothing  irrational in\r\n            deciding that actual  harm is worse  than\r\n            intended harm and providing a three-level\r\n            discount  wherever  the  sentence  for  a\r\n            completed  offense is measured in part by\r\n            intended  harm.    But  this  is  not  in\r\n            general the philosophy of the guidelines;\r\n            if  it were,  possession  of  drugs  with\r\n            intent  to  distribute would  be punished\r\n            less harshly  than the actual  sale of an\r\n            equivalent amount. . . .\r\n             [T]he cross-references  in section 2F1.1\r\n            are easily explained; they do  invoke the\r\n            discount,   or   the  possibility   of  a\r\n            discount, where the  underlying crime  is\r\n            merely an  attempt or  conspiracy. .  . .\r\n            Here, by  contrast, all 51  of the  cards\r\n            were the subject of completed crimes.\r\n\nId.;  see, e.g., United States v. Sung,  51 F.3d 92, 95 (7th Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1995) (applying the same view of section 2X1.1 to sentencing of a\r\n\ndefendant  who was arrested in the  midst of a scheme to traffick\r\n\ncounterfeit hair care products).\r\n\n          To be  sure, Carrington  tries to distinguish  Egemonye\r                                                                           \r\n\nfrom  his case.    In his  brief,  Carrington contends  that  the\r\n\ndefendant in  Egemonye  had  the credit  cards  and  the  present\r                                \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nability to turn the cards into cash, while, with respect to Count\r\n\nV,  Carrington would  still have  had to  actively negotiate  the\r\n\ndrafts even  had he received them  from IBT.  He  asserts that he\r\n\nnever  came close to being in a position to negotiate the drafts.\r\n\nHowever, Carrington does not dispute that IBT's own fraud control\r\n\nunit  prevented him  from receiving  those drafts.   Furthermore,\r\n\nCarrington also does not dispute  that he did in fact  transmit a\r\n\nwire communication pursuant to a scheme to defraud.  As a result,\r\n\nCarrington had  completed the  necessary elements of  the charged\r\n\noffense,  wire  fraud, just  as  the defendant  in  Egemonye had.\r                                                                      \r\n\nThus, we conclude that Egemonye is squarely on point.\r                                         \r\n\n          In  light  of Egemonye,  section  2X1.1  is simply  not\r                                          \r\n\napplicable  as  Carrington contends.    Carrington was  convicted\r\n\nunder Counts  V and VI of wire fraud, not attempted wire fraud or\r\n\nwire  fraud conspiracy.  The crime of wire fraud does not require\r\n\nthat the defendant's object  be attained.  It only  requires that\r\n\nthe defendant devise a scheme to defraud and then transmit a wire\r\n\ncommunication for the purposes  of executing the scheme.   See 18\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   1343.  Here, Carrington completed the necessary acts for\r\n\nthe crime  of wire fraud  in Count  V when he  faxed thirty  bank\r\n\ndraft sales form  requests to IBT in furtherance of his scheme to\r\n\nobtain $150,000, and  in Count VI  when he  sent by modem  eighty\r\n\ntransaction requests  to  IBT in  furtherance  of his  scheme  to\r\n\nobtain $583,443.50.   Because  section 2X1.1  does  not apply  to\r\n\ncompleted  substantive offenses,  Egemonye,  62 F.2d  at 430,  we\r                                                    \r\n\nconclude  that the district court correctly denied a reduction in\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\noffense level pursuant to section 2X1.1.  As a result, we find no\r\n\nerror of law or application that justifies such a reduction.  \r\n\n D.  Carrington's argument that the district court double counted\r           D.  Carrington's argument that the district court double counted\r\n    loss in sentencing him pursuant to Counts V and VI\r              loss in sentencing him pursuant to Counts V and VI\r\n\n          Carrington maintains  that the district court  erred in\r\n\nits loss  calculation in sentencing him for  the offenses charged\r\n\nin Counts V and VI.   Specifically, he contends that part  of the\r\n\nloss  that the  district  court attributed  to  Count VI  was  an\r\n\neffective double counting of  loss in Count V, since  the offense\r\n\nin Count  VI was an effort, in  part, to make up  for the lack of\r\n\nsuccess of the conduct in Count V.  Citing to Guidelines sections\r\n\n2F1.1  and 2B1.1,  Carrington maintains  that the  district court\r\n\nshould not  have found that Counts  V and VI  were two individual\r\n\noffenses.  See U.S.S.G.   2F1.1 (\"Fraud and Deceit; Forgery . . .\r                        \r\n\n\"),  comment.  (n.7)  (directing  that \"[v]aluation  of  loss  is\r\n\ndiscussed  in  the Commentary  to    2B1.1\")  and 2B1.1  (\"Theft,\r\n\nEmbezzlement . . . \"), comment. (n.2) (stating that \"[i]n certain\r\n\ncases,  an offense may involve a series of transactions without a\r\n\ncorresponding increase  in  loss\"). Instead,  argues  Carrington,\r\n\nthese  Counts were  in  fact merely  parts  of a  larger  scheme,\r\n\ndeserving of an accordant reduction in offense level.\r\n\n          Had Carrington raised this argument below, the district\r\n\ncourt's determination that Counts V and VI were separate offenses\r\n\nwould be reviewed for clear  error.  See, e.g., United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPrendergast, 979 F.2d 1289, 1291-92   (8th Cir. 1992) (discussing\r                     \r\n\nloss  calculation under U.S.S.G.    2B1.1  and 2F1.1 and stating,\r\n\nwith  respect to  uncharged  conduct, that  the district  court's\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\ndetermination  of   a  common  scheme  or  plan   \"is  a  factual\r\n\ndetermination  subject  to  review under  the  clearly  erroneous\r\n\nstandard\"); cf.

However,\r\n\nbecause Carrington failed to raise this issue below, we review it\r\n\nonly for  plain error.  See United States v.  Black, 78 F.3d 1, 5\r                                                             \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996);  United States v. Atwood, 963 F.2d  476, 477 n.2\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).   While  Carrington argues that  this issue  was\r\n\npreserved,  pointing in  his  reply brief  to  a section  of  the\r\n\ntranscript of the  proceedings that  shows that Counts  V and  VI\r\n\nwere argued simultaneously by counsel, we reject that contention.\r\n\nThe transcript in  fact shows  that Counts V  and VI were  argued\r\n\nsimultaneously with respect to Carrington's section 2X1.1 attempt\r\n\nargument;  there was  no oral  argument with respect  to sections\r\n\n2F1.1  and 2B1.1,  or whether Counts  V and  VI formed  part of a\r\n\ncommon scheme or plan.\r\n\n          We fail to find plain error for two reasons.  First, we\r\n\nthink  Carrington's reliance  on commentary  to section  2B1.1 is\r\n\nmisplaced.  Carrington essentially  contends that because, of the\r\n\n80  victims of the fraud  underlying Count VI,  thirty were among\r\n\nthe victims in  Count V, and  because he was  seeking to get  the\r\n\nsame  $150,000  from these  thirty  victims,  the district  court\r\n\ntherefore improperly double  counted this  amount in  calculating\r\n\nthe loss from  Count VI  as $583,443.50.   Carrington  emphasizes\r\n\nApplication Note 2  to section 2B1.1, which specifies  that \"[i]n\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ncertain cases, an  offense may involve  a series of  transactions\r\n\nwithout a  corresponding increase  in loss.\"   U.S.S.G.    2B1.1,\r\n\ncomment.  (n.2).  However, as the Government points out, the very\r\n\nnext sentence  in Note Two uses  as an example the  case where \"a\r\n\ndefendant  [] embezzle[s] $5,000  from a bank  and conceal[s] his\r\n\nembezzlement by  shifting this amount from one account to another\r\n\nin a series of nine  transactions over a six-month period.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nThe  loss   would  remain   at  $5,000  because   the  subsequent\r\n\ntransactions  did not  increase the  risk of  actual or  intended\r\n\nloss.  By contrast, there is no dispute that Carrington's actions\r\n\nin  Count  VI increased  the  risk of  potential loss  to  the 30\r\n\noverlapping victims.  Indeed,  Carrington's own counsel argued at\r\n\nsentencing  that \"[t]here was no follow-up [to the fraud in Count\r\n\nV], no  pursuit  of it,  it  was  abandoned and  then  a  second,\r\n\nseparate fraud was commenced.\"\r\n\n          Second,  even if the loss  on Count VI  were reduced by\r\n\n$150,000,  as  Carrington seeks,  the  aggregate  total loss  for\r\n\nCounts I through VI would  be approximately $789,000 which, under\r\n\nthe  Guidelines, would  require a  ten-level rather  than eleven-\r\n\nlevel  increase to  the offense,  resulting in  a final  adjusted\r\n\noffense level of  21 rather than 22.  See U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(1).\r                                                   \r\n\nBecause Carrington falls within  Criminal History Category I, his\r\n\nsentencing  range under  the  Guidelines would  be 41-51  months.\r\n\nBecause his current sentence  falls within this range, any  error\r\n\ncould not be found  to affect his \"substantial rights,\"  and thus\r\n\ncould not amount to plain error.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nE.  Carrington's requested \"acceptance of responsibility\" credit\r          E.  Carrington's requested \"acceptance of responsibility\" credit\r\n\n          Carrington also claims that the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying his request for a three-level reduction for acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility  pursuant to  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1.   As  a threshold\r\n\nmatter,  we must confront the question of what standard of review\r\n\napplies.   Carrington  argues  that the  district  court made  an\r\n\ninterpretive  mistake  regarding the  meaning  and  scope of  its\r\n\nfactfinding;  because  this  purported  mistake  is  inextricably\r\n\nintertwined with its factfinding, he contends that de novo review\r                                                                    \r\n\nis  warranted.    Carrington   points  out  that  the  government\r\n\nrecommended a  three-level  reduction for  timely  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility, but that the district court adopted the probation\r\n\noffice  recommendation that no sentencing consideration be given.\r\n\nCarrington argues in his brief that the  district court committed\r\n\nan error  of interpretation and related  factfinding, since \"[n]o\r\n\nfact  of  any  significance is  referred  to  by [the]  probation\r\n\n[office] other  than the  subsequent offense\" committed  while he\r\n\nwas on pretrial release.\r\n\n          While Carrington claims that his argument implicates  a\r\n\nmixed error that requires de novo review for his entire argument,\r                                           \r\n\nwe  disagree.   The  propriety of  the  district court's  use  of\r\n\ncriminal  conduct during  pretrial release  to justify  denial of\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility credit --  as a matter of  guideline\r\n\ninterpretation -- is subject to de novo review.  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTalladino,  38 F.3d  1255, 1263  (1st Cir.  1994).   However, the\r                   \r\n\napplication  of this  legal conclusion  to the  facts surrounding\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nCarrington's  offense  is  subject  to review  for  clear  error.\r\n\nUnited States v.

The Guidelines\r\n\nspecify  that  a  court,  in  its  acceptance  of  responsibility\r\n\ndetermination, can consider whether the defendant has voluntarily\r\n\nterminated all criminal conduct.   See U.S.S.G.   3E1.1, comment.\r                                                \r\n\n(n.1).   Where the defendant  commits additional crimes  while on\r\n\nrelease,  a district  court may  view that  as evidence  that the\r\n\ndefendant has  not voluntarily  terminated  all criminal  conduct\r\n\nand, accordingly, decline to award a reduction  for acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility on  that ground alone.   United States  v. O'Neil,\r                                                                          \r\n\n936  F.2d 599, 600 (1st Cir. 1991).

On August 21, 1995, Carrington was sentenced to a term of 50 months incarceration, followed by a 36 month period of supervised release, and a mandatory special assessment of $50.  He contests the validity of his plea based on Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and also appeals his sentence on several grounds.  We affirm both his conviction and his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case arises from two separate sets of schemes to defraud.  In the first set, charged in Counts I through IV and spanning from December 1993 to April 1994, Carrington negotiated the purchase of four expensive cars from out-of-state dealers.  He then tricked the dealers into believing that they had received wire transfers in payment for the cars.  All four cars were then shipped to Carrington in Massachusetts.  Carrington was arrested on May 3, 1994, and released on conditions pending further proceedings in the district court.  On or about July 8, 1994, Carrington and the government entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he agreed to plead guilty to all four counts of the information, which was filed on July 19, 1994.  Carrington did not immediately waive indictment and plead to the information.  Instead, upon Carrington's motion, the Probation Office began working on the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") with the intention of having Carrington plead and be sentenced upon its completion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second set, charged in Counts V and VI, which he executed while on release in connection with Counts I through IV, Carrington sought to obtain and deposit bank drafts drawn against the corporate bank accounts of various companies.  The conduct charged as Count V took place in November 1994.  On or about November 14, 1994, while the parties were awaiting the preparation of the PSR, Carrington, identifying himself as Chad Littles (\"Littles\"), the Accounts Receivable/Payroll Manager of Quorum International, Ltd.  (\"Quorum\"), opened an account with International Banking Technology, Inc.  (\"IBT\"), of Springfield, Virginia.  IBT provides a bank drafting system that allows creditors to collect payment over the phone by having the debtor pre-authorize a one-time debit to his or her account.  When IBT is provided with the debtor information by its client, it prepares bank drafts (or permits the client to produce the bank drafts by means of its software) that are deposited by IBT's client into its bank account.  When these drafts are processed, the debtor's account is debited and the creditor receives payment.  On or about November 16, 1994, Carrington faxed thirty completed Bank Draft Sales Forms (\"draft forms\") to IBT.  These draft forms are used to provide IBT with the information necessary for it to produce the bank drafts for the one-time pre-authorized debits.  The draft forms that Carrington faxed to IBT provided all of the necessary information including the name of the company to charge, its checking account number, and the amount of the draft requested to cover the purported pre-authorized one-time debit.  Carrington requested that IBT prepare 30 bank drafts of $5,000 each for a total of $150,000, which purportedly was to constitute payment for attendance at a seminar allegedly held by Quorum.  Carrington's attempt failed, however, when as part of IBT's fraud control system, it attempted to verify the authorization for some of the bank drafts, and it found that some of the phone numbers were incorrect.  Because IBT suspected fraud, it never completed processing Carrington's request, and Carrington failed to obtain the funds he sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conduct charged in Count VI took place in December 1994.  On or about December 5, 1994, Carrington, identifying himself as Paul Epstein (\"Epstein\"), Chief Financial Officer of Citibank, phoned IBT, faxed them an application for bank draft forms, and requested IBT software that would permit him to transmit his requests for bank drafts to IBT by modem.  This software also allowed Carrington to receive from IBT, by modem, the instructions necessary to print the bank drafts at his home.  On December 29, 1994, Carrington sent to IBT by modem 80 forms for printing bank drafts at his residence, which were to be used to debit 80 different companies' accounts in varied amounts totalling $583,443.50.  He failed to obtain the total amount sought, receiving and depositing $268,000 into a personal account before the U.S. Secret Service discovered his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the events of November and December 1994, the government filed a superseding information adding two counts of wire fraud, Counts V and VI, to the previous Counts I through IV.  Pursuant to a second plea agreement, Carrington waived indictment and pled guilty to all six counts of the superseding information on March 28, 1995.  He was sentenced on August 21, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Carrington's Rule 11 argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, without having so argued below, Carrington contends that the district court erred under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) by calculating his sentence in part on a plea for which there was no factual basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Specifically, he argues that even viewed in the light most favorable to the government, there was no proof that the vehicles involved in the information Counts I through IV were stolen prior to their placement into the stream of interstate commerce, which he alleges is an essential element under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Carrington seeks to withdraw his plea following the imposition of his sentence, he must show that the plea proceedings were marred by \"a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  United States v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotations omitted);  see Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e);  see also former Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d), comment.  (advisory committee's note to 1983 amendments to predecessor of Rule 32(e));  United States v. Japa, 994 F.2d 899, 902 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that, to set aside a plea post-sentencing, the reviewing court must find \"a fundamental defect or a miscarriage of justice\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington's appeal does not meet this high standard.  Carrington's sole argument under Rule 11(f) is that there was no evidence that the vehicles involved in Counts I through IV were stolen before they were placed into the stream of commerce.  We reject Carrington's challenge for two reasons, either of which would suffice independently to justify our conclusion.  First, we have previously rejected a similar argument under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314, Carrington's statute of conviction.  See United States v. Puerta, 38 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.1994).  Much as Carrington does here, the defendant in Puerta argued that \" 'no [property] had been stolen or taken by fraud at the time of transfer.' \"  Id. (quoting brief of defendant).  Paraphrasing that argument as a claim \"that when transferred the [property] had not yet been stolen,\" id.  (emphasis in original), we concluded that we could \"see no reason why the fraudulent taking required any more than\" acceptance of the property, misrepresentations, access to the property, and \"the requisite scienter.\"  Id.  Similarly, given that Carrington does not argue that there was no factual basis to find that he accepted the vehicles, made misrepresentations, had access to the vehicles, and had the requisite intent--\"knowing the [vehicles] to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314 (emphasis added)--his argument that there was no factual basis to find the vehicles stolen before transport must fail, because it is simply irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Carrington pled guilty to four counts of transporting or causing to be transported vehicles which he knew to be \"stolen, converted and taken by fraud.\"   However, the statute itself is phrased in the disjunctive, punishing the transport of goods known to be \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud,\" see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314, as Carrington himself quotes in his brief.  Carrington argues that there is no factual basis for the conclusion that the goods were stolen when transported, but makes no reference to conversion or fraudulent takings.  But even if he were correct with respect to the \"stolen\" prong of the statute, he would still need to persuade us with respect to both of the other two prongs.  However, Carrington does not contend that a factual basis is absent to support the proposition that he caused the goods to be transported and that he took them by fraud--an alternative basis for criminal liability under section 2314, and a basis included in the information to which he pled guilty.  Even if Carrington were to so argue, it would not profit him, since the presentence report established a more than adequate basis for the plea under the \"taken by fraud\" theory.  See United States v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing PSR as adequate factual basis for plea when considering propriety of plea withdrawal).  As a result, we conclude that no defect or miscarriage of justice exists to require that we reverse the district court's sentencing decision or vacate Carrington's plea due to an inadequate factual basis for the plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the argument with respect to his plea, Carrington also raised an ineffective assistance of counsel challenge for the first time at oral argument.  Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct appeal.  See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that absent extraordinary circumstances, fact-specific claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1086, 114 S.Ct. 1839, 128 L.Ed.2d 466 (1994).  This case is no exception.  Carrington argues that his trial counsel improperly led him to plead guilty.  However, these charges depend on evidentiary matters which are best considered by the district court in the first instance.  Id. at 1063.   Accordingly, Carrington's claim of inadequate assistance is not properly before us, and so we do not consider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>B. The value and loss determinations in Counts I through IV</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington disputes the values assigned by the PSR--that is, the values represented by the prices he promised to pay the dealers he contacted--and adopted by the district court in sentencing, to the four cars that were the subjects of Counts I through IV, respectively.  He contends that the district court should instead have valued the car in Count I at $30,000--the amount of money he obtained in the sale of the car--and for Counts II through IV the court should have used the fair wholesale value of the vehicles.  Carrington points out that the only reference to valuation in the record, apart from references to \"an agreed upon price,\" is in the FBI agent's affidavit of the car dealer's statements.  He adds that the only information on personal knowledge as to the value of any car was the $30,000 willingly paid by a car dealer for the car in Count I.  Carrington notes that while the Guidelines use \"fair market value\" as the measure of the value of stolen property, that rule is not absolute, and in fact, if market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure the harm to the victim, alternative methods of valuation may be used.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court reviews de novo the district court's interpretation of the loss provisions of the Guidelines.  Thereafter, it normally reviews a district court's factual findings only for clear error.  See, e.g., Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996);  United States v. Skrodzki, 9 F.3d 198, 202 (1st Cir.1993).  But where, as here, a defendant fails to object to the court's loss computation--as Carrington concedes in his brief--review is for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington's essential contention, without record support, is that the prices he negotiated in relation to the vehicles involved in Counts II through IV were overstated in order to induce the dealers' agreement.  But in fact, the PSR suggests that Carrington negotiated the price of each vehicle in an arm's length transaction.  Under section 2B1.1, comment.  (n.2), a product's fair market value is ordinarily the appropriate value of the victim's loss.  Here, it was reasonable, particularly in light of the bargaining between Carrington and the dealers, for the district court to calculate the market value of each vehicle to be the price Carrington negotiated with each dealership.  See, e.g., United States v. Warshawsky, 20 F.3d 204, 213 (6th Cir.1994) (applying market value in a section 2314 case to mean the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller at the time and place the property was taken).  Loss need not be determined with precision, and in fact may be inferred from any reasonably reliable information.  See, e.g., Skrodzki, 9 F.3d at 203.   Furthermore, it was reasonable for the court to adopt the retail rather than the wholesale values of the cars, since all of the dealerships from whom Carrington obtained the cars were engaged in retail sales of automobiles.  As a result, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in determining the market value of the vehicles in Counts I through IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>C. Carrington's argument that Counts V and VI should have</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>been sentenced as attempts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington contends that the sentencing court erred in concluding that Counts V and VI were both completed crimes, with a total intended loss of $583,000.  He argues that the lack of actual loss counsels for the proposition that Counts V and VI should be classed as mere attempts, pursuant to the Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(b)(1) (mandating a decrease by 3 levels for an attempt).  Thus, he posits, the offense levels for those counts should be lower than those the district court attributed to them.  We review the district court's legal ruling concerning the scope of section 2X1.1 de novo, but uphold the application of section 2X1.1 to the facts of Carrington's offense conduct so long as it is not clearly erroneous.  United States v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 34 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing clear error with respect to section 2X1.1), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1046, 114 S.Ct. 696, 126 L.Ed.2d 663 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making this argument, Carrington confronts our opinion in United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425 (1st Cir.1995).  In that case, the district court calculated loss pursuant to section 2F1.1 based on the total aggregate limits of the credit cards that the defendant wrongfully obtained.  Id. at 429.   The defendant argued that because section 2F1.1 references section 2X1.1 regarding \"partially completed offense[s],\" and because he had actually inflicted a loss of only about 53 percent of the aggregate credit limit before his scheme was interrupted by arrest, the district court erred in denying him the lower offense level attendant to an only \"partially completed\" crime.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rejected the application of section 2X1.1 to the defendant's conduct in Egemonye.  Id. at 430.   We noted that there were two competing views of section 2X1.1.  It could be viewed as offering a reduction for potential versus completed harm;  alternatively, its provisions could be read literally to direct its application only where the defendant has not completed the actions necessary to the substantive offense.  Id.  In siding with the latter view, we stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[t]here would be nothing irrational in deciding that actual harm is worse than intended harm and providing a three-level discount wherever the sentence for a completed offense is measured in part by intended harm.  But this is not in general the philosophy of the guidelines;  if it were, possession of drugs with intent to distribute would be punished less harshly than the actual sale of an equivalent amount....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[T]he cross-references in section 2F1.1 are easily explained;  they do invoke the discount, or the possibility of a discount, where the underlying crime is merely an attempt or conspiracy....  Here, by contrast, all 51 of the cards were the subject of completed crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.;  see, e.g., United States v. Sung, 51 F.3d 92, 95 (7th Cir.1995) (applying the same view of section 2X1.1 to sentencing of a defendant who was arrested in the midst of a scheme to traffick counterfeit hair care products).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Carrington tries to distinguish Egemonye from his case.  In his brief, Carrington contends that the defendant in Egemonye had the credit cards and the present ability to turn the cards into cash, while, with respect to Count V, Carrington would still have had to actively negotiate the drafts even had he received them from IBT.  He asserts that he never came close to being in a position to negotiate the drafts.  However, Carrington does not dispute that IBT's own fraud control unit prevented him from receiving those drafts.  Furthermore, Carrington also does not dispute that he did in fact transmit a wire communication pursuant to a scheme to defraud.  As a result, Carrington had completed the necessary elements of the charged offense, wire fraud, just as the defendant in Egemonye had.  Thus, we conclude that Egemonye is squarely on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of Egemonye, section 2X1.1 is simply not applicable as Carrington contends.  Carrington was convicted under Counts V and VI of wire fraud, not attempted wire fraud or wire fraud conspiracy.  The crime of wire fraud does not require that the defendant's object be attained.  It only requires that the defendant devise a scheme to defraud and then transmit a wire communication for the purposes of executing the scheme.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.  Here, Carrington completed the necessary acts for the crime of wire fraud in Count V when he faxed thirty bank draft sales form requests to IBT in furtherance of his scheme to obtain $150,000, and in Count VI when he sent by modem eighty transaction requests to IBT in furtherance of his scheme to obtain $583,443.50.  Because section 2X1.1 does not apply to completed substantive offenses, Egemonye, 62 F.3d at 430, we conclude that the district court correctly denied a reduction in offense level pursuant to section 2X1.1.  As a result, we find no error of law or application that justifies such a reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>D. Carrington's argument that the district court double</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>counted loss in sentencing him pursuant to Counts V and VI</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington maintains that the district court erred in its loss calculation in sentencing him for the offenses charged in Counts V and VI.  Specifically, he contends that part of the loss that the district court attributed to Count VI was an effective double counting of loss in Count V, since the offense in Count VI was an effort, in part, to make up for the lack of success of the conduct in Count V.  Citing to Guidelines sections 2F1.1 and 2B1.1, Carrington maintains that the district court should not have found that Counts V and VI were two individual offenses.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 (\"Fraud and Deceit;  Forgery ... \"), comment.  (n.7) (directing that \"[v]aluation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to &#167; 2B1.1\") and 2B1.1 (\"Theft, Embezzlement ... \"), comment.  (n.2) (stating that \"[i]n certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding increase in loss\").  Instead, argues Carrington, these Counts were in fact merely parts of a larger scheme, deserving of an accordant reduction in offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Carrington raised this argument below, the district court's determination that Counts V and VI were separate offenses would be reviewed for clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Prendergast, 979 F.2d 1289, 1291-92 (8th Cir.1992) (discussing loss calculation under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2B1.1 and 2F1.1 and stating, with respect to uncharged conduct, that the district court's determination of a common scheme or plan \"is a factual determination subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard\");  cf. United States v. Mak, 926 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1991) (reviewing district court's determination of a \"common scheme or plan\" of drug offenses for clear error).  However, because Carrington failed to raise this issue below, we review it only for plain error.  See United States v. Black, 78 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Atwood, 963 F.2d 476, 477 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992).  While Carrington argues that this issue was preserved, pointing in his reply brief to a section of the transcript of the proceedings that shows that Counts V and VI were argued simultaneously by counsel, we reject that contention.  The transcript in fact shows that Counts V and VI were argued simultaneously with respect to Carrington's section 2X1.1 attempt argument;  there was no oral argument with respect to sections 2F1.1 and 2B1.1, or whether Counts V and VI formed part of a common scheme or plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to find plain error for two reasons.  First, we think Carrington's reliance on commentary to section 2B1.1 is misplaced.  Carrington essentially contends that because, of the 80 victims of the fraud underlying Count VI, thirty were among the victims in Count V, and because he was seeking to get the same $150,000 from these thirty victims, the district court therefore improperly double counted this amount in calculating the loss from Count VI as $583,443.50.  Carrington emphasizes Application Note 2 to section 2B1.1, which specifies that \"[i]n certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding increase in loss.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, comment.  (n.2).  However, as the Government points out, the very next sentence in Note Two uses as an example the case where \"a defendant [ ] embezzle[s] $5,000 from a bank and conceal[s] his embezzlement by shifting this amount from one account to another in a series of nine transactions over a six-month period.\"  Id. The loss would remain at $5,000 because the subsequent transactions did not increase the risk of actual or intended loss.  By contrast, there is no dispute that Carrington's actions in Count VI increased the risk of potential loss to the 30 overlapping victims.  Indeed, Carrington's own counsel argued at sentencing that \"[t]here was no follow-up [to the fraud in Count V], no pursuit of it, it was abandoned and then a second, separate fraud was commenced.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the loss on Count VI were reduced by $150,000, as Carrington seeks, the aggregate total loss for Counts I through VI would be approximately $789,000 which, under the Guidelines, would require a ten-level rather than eleven-level increase to the offense, resulting in a final adjusted offense level of 21 rather than 22.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1).  Because Carrington falls within Criminal History Category I, his sentencing range under the Guidelines would be 41-51 months.  Appellant's current sentence falls within this range.  This conduces to the conclusion, in the circumstances of this case, that the claimed error would not warrant us in invoking our sparingly used discretion to correct plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>E. Carrington's requested \"acceptance of responsibility\" credit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington also claims that the district court erred in denying his request for a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.  As a threshold matter, we must confront the question of what standard of review applies.  Carrington argues that the district court made an interpretive mistake regarding the meaning and scope of its factfinding;  because this purported mistake is inextricably intertwined with its factfinding, he contends that de novo review is warranted.  Carrington points out that the government recommended a three-level reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility, but that the district court adopted the probation office recommendation that no sentencing consideration be given.  Carrington argues in his brief that the district court committed an error of interpretation and related factfinding, since \"[n]o fact of any significance is referred to by [the] probation [office] other than the subsequent offense\" committed while he was on pretrial release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Carrington claims that his argument implicates a mixed error that requires de novo review for his entire argument, we disagree.  The propriety of the district court's use of criminal conduct during pretrial release to justify denial of acceptance of responsibility credit--as a matter of guideline interpretation--is subject to de novo review.  United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir.1994).  However, the application of this legal conclusion to the facts surrounding Carrington's offense is subject to review for clear error.  United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 594 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1158 (1st Cir.1995).  We cannot accept the proposition that the district court erred as a matter of law by denying Carrington acceptance of responsibility credit based on his criminal conduct (included in Counts V and VI) while on pretrial release.  The Guidelines specify that a court, in its acceptance of responsibility determination, can consider whether the defendant has voluntarily terminated all criminal conduct.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.1).  Where the defendant commits additional crimes while on release, a district court may view that as evidence that the defendant has not voluntarily terminated all criminal conduct and, accordingly, decline to award a reduction for acceptance of responsibility on that ground alone.  United States v. O'Neil, 936 F.2d 599, 600 (1st Cir.1991).  This is true even where the defendant, like Carrington, has pled guilty.  Id. at 600-01;  see also United States v. Morrison, 983 F.2d 730 (6th Cir.1993);  United States v. Reed, 951 F.2d 97, 99 (6th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 996, 112 S.Ct. 1700, 118 L.Ed.2d 409 (1992).  As a result, we conclude that the district court did not commit legal error in considering Carrington's criminal conduct while on pretrial release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we review for clear error Carrington's residual argument regarding the district court's refusal to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  See, e.g., United States v. Burns, 925 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990).  \"Because credibility and demeanor play a crucial role in determining whether a person is genuinely contrite, and because the sentencing judge has the unique opportunity of observing the defendant ... and evaluating acceptance of responsibility in a live context, the finding of the sentencing court is entitled to great respect,\" and \"should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\"  Burns, 925 F.2d at 20;  Royer, 895 F.2d at 29-30.   In his brief, Carrington argues that, in its weighing of his additional offenses versus the affirmative steps Carrington has taken to admit guilt and accept responsibility for his crimes, the trial court ignored his remorse and \"cho[se] instead to focus solely on the commission of a new offense (for which a three point enhancement was assessed without objection).\"   While Carrington may state a plausible theory under which the district court could have decided to give him acceptance of responsibility credit despite his commission of new offenses, he has simply not met his burden, see United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 167 (1st Cir.1991), of showing that the district court's decision was \"without foundation,\" see Burns, 925 F.2d at 20.   Furthermore, in addition to his additional offenses, the district court also considered Carrington's decision to remain silent in open court, a factor the court was entitled to weigh in determining whether he demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility.  See United States v. Delgado Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1236 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1164, 130 L.Ed.2d 1120 (1995).  Because the district court had sufficient foundation to do so, we affirm its denial of Carrington's request for a three-level reduction based on his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) (\"Determining accuracy of plea\") provides that:</p>\n        <p>Notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We recognize that the burden a defendant bears on a post-sentencing appeal from a guilty plea in this Circuit is \"somewhat cloudy,\" United States v.

On August 21, 1995, Carrington was sentenced to a term of 50 months incarceration, followed by a 36 month period of supervised release, and a mandatory special assessment of $50.  He contests the validity of his plea based on Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and also appeals his sentence on several grounds.  We affirm both his conviction and his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case arises from two separate sets of schemes to defraud.  In the first set, charged in Counts I through IV and spanning from December 1993 to April 1994, Carrington negotiated the purchase of four expensive cars from out-of-state dealers.  He then tricked the dealers into believing that they had received wire transfers in payment for the cars.  All four cars were then shipped to Carrington in Massachusetts.  Carrington was arrested on May 3, 1994, and released on conditions pending further proceedings in the district court.  On or about July 8, 1994, Carrington and the government entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he agreed to plead guilty to all four counts of the information, which was filed on July 19, 1994.  Carrington did not immediately waive indictment and plead to the information.  Instead, upon Carrington's motion, the Probation Office began working on the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") with the intention of having Carrington plead and be sentenced upon its completion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second set, charged in Counts V and VI, which he executed while on release in connection with Counts I through IV, Carrington sought to obtain and deposit bank drafts drawn against the corporate bank accounts of various companies.  The conduct charged as Count V took place in November 1994.  On or about November 14, 1994, while the parties were awaiting the preparation of the PSR, Carrington, identifying himself as Chad Littles (\"Littles\"), the Accounts Receivable/Payroll Manager of Quorum International, Ltd.  (\"Quorum\"), opened an account with International Banking Technology, Inc.  (\"IBT\"), of Springfield, Virginia.  IBT provides a bank drafting system that allows creditors to collect payment over the phone by having the debtor pre-authorize a one-time debit to his or her account.  When IBT is provided with the debtor information by its client, it prepares bank drafts (or permits the client to produce the bank drafts by means of its software) that are deposited by IBT's client into its bank account.  When these drafts are processed, the debtor's account is debited and the creditor receives payment.  On or about November 16, 1994, Carrington faxed thirty completed Bank Draft Sales Forms (\"draft forms\") to IBT.  These draft forms are used to provide IBT with the information necessary for it to produce the bank drafts for the one-time pre-authorized debits.  The draft forms that Carrington faxed to IBT provided all of the necessary information including the name of the company to charge, its checking account number, and the amount of the draft requested to cover the purported pre-authorized one-time debit.  Carrington requested that IBT prepare 30 bank drafts of $5,000 each for a total of $150,000, which purportedly was to constitute payment for attendance at a seminar allegedly held by Quorum.  Carrington's attempt failed, however, when as part of IBT's fraud control system, it attempted to verify the authorization for some of the bank drafts, and it found that some of the phone numbers were incorrect.  Because IBT suspected fraud, it never completed processing Carrington's request, and Carrington failed to obtain the funds he sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conduct charged in Count VI took place in December 1994.  On or about December 5, 1994, Carrington, identifying himself as Paul Epstein (\"Epstein\"), Chief Financial Officer of Citibank, phoned IBT, faxed them an application for bank draft forms, and requested IBT software that would permit him to transmit his requests for bank drafts to IBT by modem.  This software also allowed Carrington to receive from IBT, by modem, the instructions necessary to print the bank drafts at his home.  On December 29, 1994, Carrington sent to IBT by modem 80 forms for printing bank drafts at his residence, which were to be used to debit 80 different companies' accounts in varied amounts totalling $583,443.50.  He failed to obtain the total amount sought, receiving and depositing $268,000 into a personal account before the U.S. Secret Service discovered his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the events of November and December 1994, the government filed a superseding information adding two counts of wire fraud, Counts V and VI, to the previous Counts I through IV.  Pursuant to a second plea agreement, Carrington waived indictment and pled guilty to all six counts of the superseding information on March 28, 1995.  He was sentenced on August 21, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Carrington's Rule 11 argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, without having so argued below, Carrington contends that the district court erred under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) by calculating his sentence in part on a plea for which there was no factual basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Specifically, he argues that even viewed in the light most favorable to the government, there was no proof that the vehicles involved in the information Counts I through IV were stolen prior to their placement into the stream of interstate commerce, which he alleges is an essential element under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Carrington seeks to withdraw his plea following the imposition of his sentence, he must show that the plea proceedings were marred by \"a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  United States v.

Carrington's sole argument under Rule 11(f) is that there was no evidence that the vehicles involved in Counts I through IV were stolen before they were placed into the stream of commerce.  We reject Carrington's challenge for two reasons, either of which would suffice independently to justify our conclusion.  First, we have previously rejected a similar argument under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314, Carrington's statute of conviction.  See United States v. Puerta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195677\"><a href=\"/opinion/195677/united-states-v-medina-puerta/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1994).  Much as Carrington does here, the defendant in Puerta argued that \" 'no [property] had been stolen or taken by fraud at the time of transfer.' \"  Id. (quoting brief of defendant).  Paraphrasing that argument as a claim \"that when transferred the [property] had not yet been stolen,\" id.  (emphasis in original), we concluded that we could \"see no reason why the fraudulent taking required any more than\" acceptance of the property, misrepresentations, access to the property, and \"the requisite scienter.\"  Id.  Similarly, given that Carrington does not argue that there was no factual basis to find that he accepted the vehicles, made misrepresentations, had access to the vehicles, and had the requisite intent--\"knowing the [vehicles] to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314 (emphasis added)--his argument that there was no factual basis to find the vehicles stolen before transport must fail, because it is simply irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Carrington pled guilty to four counts of transporting or causing to be transported vehicles which he knew to be \"stolen, converted and taken by fraud.\"   However, the statute itself is phrased in the disjunctive, punishing the transport of goods known to be \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud,\" see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2314, as Carrington himself quotes in his brief.  Carrington argues that there is no factual basis for the conclusion that the goods were stolen when transported, but makes no reference to conversion or fraudulent takings.  But even if he were correct with respect to the \"stolen\" prong of the statute, he would still need to persuade us with respect to both of the other two prongs.  However, Carrington does not contend that a factual basis is absent to support the proposition that he caused the goods to be transported and that he took them by fraud--an alternative basis for criminal liability under section 2314, and a basis included in the information to which he pled guilty.  Even if Carrington were to so argue, it would not profit him, since the presentence report established a more than adequate basis for the plea under the \"taken by fraud\" theory.  See United States v. Ferguson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196190\"><a href=\"/opinion/196190/united-states-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1995) (recognizing PSR as adequate factual basis for plea when considering propriety of plea withdrawal).  As a result, we conclude that no defect or miscarriage of justice exists to require that we reverse the district court's sentencing decision or vacate Carrington's plea due to an inadequate factual basis for the plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the argument with respect to his plea, Carrington also raised an ineffective assistance of counsel challenge for the first time at oral argument.  Ordinarily, we do not address ineffective assistance of counsel arguments on direct appeal.  See United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that absent extraordinary circumstances, fact-specific claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></span> (1994).  This case is no exception.  Carrington argues that his trial counsel improperly led him to plead guilty.  However, these charges depend on evidentiary matters which are best considered by the district court in the first instance.  Id. at 1063.   Accordingly, Carrington's claim of inadequate assistance is not properly before us, and so we do not consider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>B.

He contends that the district court should instead have valued the car in Count I at $30,000--the amount of money he obtained in the sale of the car--and for Counts II through IV the court should have used the fair wholesale value of the vehicles.  Carrington points out that the only reference to valuation in the record, apart from references to \"an agreed upon price,\" is in the FBI agent's affidavit of the car dealer's statements.  He adds that the only information on personal knowledge as to the value of any car was the $30,000 willingly paid by a car dealer for the car in Count I.  Carrington notes that while the Guidelines use \"fair market value\" as the measure of the value of stolen property, that rule is not absolute, and in fact, if market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure the harm to the victim, alternative methods of valuation may be used.

Thereafter, it normally reviews a district court's factual findings only for clear error.  See, e.g., Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But where, as here, a defendant fails to object to the court's loss computation--as Carrington concedes in his brief--review is for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington's essential contention, without record support, is that the prices he negotiated in relation to the vehicles involved in Counts II through IV were overstated in order to induce the dealers' agreement.  But in fact, the PSR suggests that Carrington negotiated the price of each vehicle in an arm's length transaction.  Under section 2B1.1, comment.  (n.2), a product's fair market value is ordinarily the appropriate value of the victim's loss.  Here, it was reasonable, particularly in light of the bargaining between Carrington and the dealers, for the district court to calculate the market value of each vehicle to be the price Carrington negotiated with each dealership.  See, e.g., United States v. Warshawsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666583\"><a href=\"/opinion/666583/united-states-v-leroy-warshawsky-93-1345-ira-warshawsky-93-1346-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 213 (6th Cir.1994) (applying market value in a section 2314 case to mean the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller at the time and place the property was taken).  Loss need not be determined with precision, and in fact may be inferred from any reasonably reliable information.  See, e.g., Skrodzki, 9 F.3d at 203.   Furthermore, it was reasonable for the court to adopt the retail rather than the wholesale values of the cars, since all of the dealerships from whom Carrington obtained the cars were engaged in retail sales of automobiles.  As a result, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in determining the market value of the vehicles in Counts I through IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>C. Carrington's argument that Counts V and VI should have</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>been sentenced as attempts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington contends that the sentencing court erred in concluding that Counts V and VI were both completed crimes, with a total intended loss of $583,000.  He argues that the lack of actual loss counsels for the proposition that Counts V and VI should be classed as mere attempts, pursuant to the Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(b)(1) (mandating a decrease by 3 levels for an attempt).  Thus, he posits, the offense levels for those counts should be lower than those the district court attributed to them.  We review the district court's legal ruling concerning the scope of section 2X1.1 de novo, but uphold the application of section 2X1.1 to the facts of Carrington's offense conduct so long as it is not clearly erroneous.  United States v. Chapdelaine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602833\"><a href=\"/opinion/602833/united-states-v-george-chapdelaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing clear error with respect to section 2X1.1), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In that case, the district court calculated loss pursuant to section 2F1.1 based on the total aggregate limits of the credit cards that the defendant wrongfully obtained.  Id. at 429.   The defendant argued that because section 2F1.1 references section 2X1.1 regarding \"partially completed offense[s],\" and because he had actually inflicted a loss of only about 53 percent of the aggregate credit limit before his scheme was interrupted by arrest, the district court erred in denying him the lower offense level attendant to an only \"partially completed\" crime.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rejected the application of section 2X1.1 to the defendant's conduct in Egemonye.  Id. at 430.   We noted that there were two competing views of section 2X1.1.  It could be viewed as offering a reduction for potential versus completed harm;  alternatively, its provisions could be read literally to direct its application only where the defendant has not completed the actions necessary to the substantive offense.  Id.  In siding with the latter view, we stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[t]here would be nothing irrational in deciding that actual harm is worse than intended harm and providing a three-level discount wherever the sentence for a completed offense is measured in part by intended harm.  But this is not in general the philosophy of the guidelines;  if it were, possession of drugs with intent to distribute would be punished less harshly than the actual sale of an equivalent amount....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[T]he cross-references in section 2F1.1 are easily explained;  they do invoke the discount, or the possibility of a discount, where the underlying crime is merely an attempt or conspiracy....  Here, by contrast, all 51 of the cards were the subject of completed crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.;  see, e.g., United States v.

In his brief, Carrington contends that the defendant in Egemonye had the credit cards and the present ability to turn the cards into cash, while, with respect to Count V, Carrington would still have had to actively negotiate the drafts even had he received them from IBT.  He asserts that he never came close to being in a position to negotiate the drafts.  However, Carrington does not dispute that IBT's own fraud control unit prevented him from receiving those drafts.  Furthermore, Carrington also does not dispute that he did in fact transmit a wire communication pursuant to a scheme to defraud.  As a result, Carrington had completed the necessary elements of the charged offense, wire fraud, just as the defendant in Egemonye had.  Thus, we conclude that Egemonye is squarely on point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of Egemonye, section 2X1.1 is simply not applicable as Carrington contends.  Carrington was convicted under Counts V and VI of wire fraud, not attempted wire fraud or wire fraud conspiracy.  The crime of wire fraud does not require that the defendant's object be attained.  It only requires that the defendant devise a scheme to defraud and then transmit a wire communication for the purposes of executing the scheme.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.  Here, Carrington completed the necessary acts for the crime of wire fraud in Count V when he faxed thirty bank draft sales form requests to IBT in furtherance of his scheme to obtain $150,000, and in Count VI when he sent by modem eighty transaction requests to IBT in furtherance of his scheme to obtain $583,443.50.  Because section 2X1.1 does not apply to completed substantive offenses, Egemonye, 62 F.3d at 430, we conclude that the district court correctly denied a reduction in offense level pursuant to section 2X1.1.  As a result, we find no error of law or application that justifies such a reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>D. Carrington's argument that the district court double</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>counted loss in sentencing him pursuant to Counts V and VI</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington maintains that the district court erred in its loss calculation in sentencing him for the offenses charged in Counts V and VI.  Specifically, he contends that part of the loss that the district court attributed to Count VI was an effective double counting of loss in Count V, since the offense in Count VI was an effort, in part, to make up for the lack of success of the conduct in Count V.  Citing to Guidelines sections 2F1.1 and 2B1.1, Carrington maintains that the district court should not have found that Counts V and VI were two individual offenses.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 (\"Fraud and Deceit;  Forgery ... \"), comment.  (n.7) (directing that \"[v]aluation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to &#167; 2B1.1\") and 2B1.1 (\"Theft, Embezzlement ... \"), comment.  (n.2) (stating that \"[i]n certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding increase in loss\").  Instead, argues Carrington, these Counts were in fact merely parts of a larger scheme, deserving of an accordant reduction in offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Carrington raised this argument below, the district court's determination that Counts V and VI were separate offenses would be reviewed for clear error.  See, e.g., United States v. Prendergast, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595245\"><a href=\"/opinion/595245/united-states-v-robert-j-prendergast-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1291-92 (8th Cir.1992) (discussing loss calculation under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2B1.1 and 2F1.1 and stating, with respect to uncharged conduct, that the district court's determination of a common scheme or plan \"is a factual determination subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard\");  cf.

However, because Carrington failed to raise this issue below, we review it only for plain error.  See United States v. Black, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196600\"><a href=\"/opinion/196600/united-states-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v.

While Carrington argues that this issue was preserved, pointing in his reply brief to a section of the transcript of the proceedings that shows that Counts V and VI were argued simultaneously by counsel, we reject that contention.  The transcript in fact shows that Counts V and VI were argued simultaneously with respect to Carrington's section 2X1.1 attempt argument;  there was no oral argument with respect to sections 2F1.1 and 2B1.1, or whether Counts V and VI formed part of a common scheme or plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fail to find plain error for two reasons.  First, we think Carrington's reliance on commentary to section 2B1.1 is misplaced.  Carrington essentially contends that because, of the 80 victims of the fraud underlying Count VI, thirty were among the victims in Count V, and because he was seeking to get the same $150,000 from these thirty victims, the district court therefore improperly double counted this amount in calculating the loss from Count VI as $583,443.50.  Carrington emphasizes Application Note 2 to section 2B1.1, which specifies that \"[i]n certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding increase in loss.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, comment.  (n.2).  However, as the Government points out, the very next sentence in Note Two uses as an example the case where \"a defendant [ ] embezzle[s] $5,000 from a bank and conceal[s] his embezzlement by shifting this amount from one account to another in a series of nine transactions over a six-month period.\"  Id. The loss would remain at $5,000 because the subsequent transactions did not increase the risk of actual or intended loss.  By contrast, there is no dispute that Carrington's actions in Count VI increased the risk of potential loss to the 30 overlapping victims.  Indeed, Carrington's own counsel argued at sentencing that \"[t]here was no follow-up [to the fraud in Count V], no pursuit of it, it was abandoned and then a second, separate fraud was commenced.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the loss on Count VI were reduced by $150,000, as Carrington seeks, the aggregate total loss for Counts I through VI would be approximately $789,000 which, under the Guidelines, would require a ten-level rather than eleven-level increase to the offense, resulting in a final adjusted offense level of 21 rather than 22.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1).  Because Carrington falls within Criminal History Category I, his sentencing range under the Guidelines would be 41-51 months.  Appellant's current sentence falls within this range.  This conduces to the conclusion, in the circumstances of this case, that the claimed error would not warrant us in invoking our sparingly used discretion to correct plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>E. Carrington's requested \"acceptance of responsibility\" credit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrington also claims that the district court erred in denying his request for a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.  As a threshold matter, we must confront the question of what standard of review applies.  Carrington argues that the district court made an interpretive mistake regarding the meaning and scope of its factfinding;  because this purported mistake is inextricably intertwined with its factfinding, he contends that de novo review is warranted.  Carrington points out that the government recommended a three-level reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility, but that the district court adopted the probation office recommendation that no sentencing consideration be given.  Carrington argues in his brief that the district court committed an error of interpretation and related factfinding, since \"[n]o fact of any significance is referred to by [the] probation [office] other than the subsequent offense\" committed while he was on pretrial release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Carrington claims that his argument implicates a mixed error that requires de novo review for his entire argument, we disagree.  The propriety of the district court's use of criminal conduct during pretrial release to justify denial of acceptance of responsibility credit--as a matter of guideline interpretation--is subject to de novo review.  United States v. Talladino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195724\"><a href=\"/opinion/195724/united-states-v-talladino/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span>, 1263 (1st Cir.1994).  However, the application of this legal conclusion to the facts surrounding Carrington's offense is subject to review for clear error.  United States v. Boots, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196657\"><a href=\"/opinion/196657/united-states-v-boots/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 594 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v.

We cannot accept the proposition that the district court erred as a matter of law by denying Carrington acceptance of responsibility credit based on his criminal conduct (included in Counts V and VI) while on pretrial release.  The Guidelines specify that a court, in its acceptance of responsibility determination, can consider whether the defendant has voluntarily terminated all criminal conduct.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.1).  Where the defendant commits additional crimes while on release, a district court may view that as evidence that the defendant has not voluntarily terminated all criminal conduct and, accordingly, decline to award a reduction for acceptance of responsibility on that ground alone.  United States v. O'Neil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563643\"><a href=\"/opinion/563643/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span>, 600 (1st Cir.1991).  This is true even where the defendant, like Carrington, has pled guilty.  Id. at 600-01;  see also United States v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597851\"><a href=\"/opinion/597851/united-states-v-dana-ray-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1993);  United States v. Reed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573177\"><a href=\"/opinion/573177/united-states-v-thomas-j-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 99 (6th Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span> (1992).  As a result, we conclude that the district court did not commit legal error in considering Carrington's criminal conduct while on pretrial release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we review for clear error Carrington's residual argument regarding the district court's refusal to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  See, e.g., United States v. Burns, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555474\"><a href=\"/opinion/555474/united-states-v-joel-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Royer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536029\"><a href=\"/opinion/536029/united-states-v-marc-a-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1990).  \"Because credibility and demeanor play a crucial role in determining whether a person is genuinely contrite, and because the sentencing judge has the unique opportunity of observing the defendant ... and evaluating acceptance of responsibility in a live context, the finding of the sentencing court is entitled to great respect,\" and \"should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\"  Burns, 925 F.2d at 20;  Royer, 895 F.2d at 29-30.   In his brief, Carrington argues that, in its weighing of his additional offenses versus the affirmative steps Carrington has taken to admit guilt and accept responsibility for his crimes, the trial court ignored his remorse and \"cho[se] instead to focus solely on the commission of a new offense (for which a three point enhancement was assessed without objection).\"   While Carrington may state a plausible theory under which the district court could have decided to give him acceptance of responsibility credit despite his commission of new offenses, he has simply not met his burden, see United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569296\"><a href=\"/opinion/569296/united-states-v-jaime-uricoechea-casallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 167 (1st Cir.1991), of showing that the district court's decision was \"without foundation,\" see Burns, 925 F.2d at 20.   Furthermore, in addition to his additional offenses, the district court also considered Carrington's decision to remain silent in open court, a factor the court was entitled to weigh in determining whether he demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility.  See United States v. Delgado Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1236 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></span> (1995).  Because the district court had sufficient foundation to do so, we affirm its denial of Carrington's request for a three-level reduction based on his acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) (\"Determining accuracy of plea\") provides that:</p>\n        <p>Notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We recognize that the burden a defendant bears on a post-sentencing appeal from a guilty plea in this Circuit is \"somewhat cloudy,\" United States v.

We note, however, that although we follow the more stringent standard set out in Ferguson and Japa, even were we to apply harmless error review, Carrington's argument would fail</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
