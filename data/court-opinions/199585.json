Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jules Delgado Valencia on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 27, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam.        Upon the agreement of the parties, and\n\nafter a thorough review of the record and of the submissions,\n\nwe reverse the district court’s order denying appellant Jules\n\nDelgado Valencia’s (“Delgado’s”) motion for relief pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 36, and we vacate the judgment and remand with\n\ninstructions to amend the sentence accordingly.\n\n            At sentencing, the court unambiguously stated that\n\nDelgado’s term of imprisonment was to be “13 years and seven\n\nmonths.” It then attempted to convert that term into months,\n\nbut it admitted that its conversion might be mathematically\nerroneous; and as it turns out, it was erroneous, and the error\n\nwas repeated in the written judgment.              “If there should be a\nvariance between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the\nsentence    as   set   forth    in   the    written   judgment,   the   oral\n\nsentence prevails.”       3 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice\nand Procedure Crim. 2d § 534 (1982).               The mathematical error\nmay be corrected pursuant to a motion under Rule 36.               Id.\n\n            The district court’s denial of the Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n36 motion is reversed, the judgment in this matter is vacated,\nand   the   case   is    remanded      to    the   district   court     with\n\ninstructions to amend the judgment to show that Delgado is to\n\nbe imprisoned for a term of 163 months.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f",
