Weld, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                June 5, 1998\r\n                                           GODBOLD, Senior Circuit Judge.  Karla Graham appeals from\r\nher conviction and sentence for making false statements in loan\r\ndocuments presented to a federally insured bank in violation of 18\r\nU.S.C.  1014.  We affirm both.\r\n     I.  Factual and Procedural History\r\nThe jury was entitled to find the following facts, either\r\nas undisputed or based on sufficient evidence.\r\nBetween 1987 and 1989 Karla Graham worked as a mortgage\r\naccount executive for Dime Real Estate Services of New Hampshire\r\n(Dime-NH)a wholly owned subsidiary of Dime Savings Bank of New York\r\n(Dime-NY) that provided residential mortgage loans.  Graham\r\noriginated the loans and was paid on commission.  During this time\r\nthe bank had a low-documentation lending program that approved loan\r\napplications without verification of income, employment or assets\r\nas long as the borrowers could make a twenty percent down payment\r\nwith their own funds.  Graham and her co-defendants found ways to\r\navoid the down payment requirement and submitted fraudulent loan\r\napplications to the bank's underwriters in Massachusetts (Dime-MA). \r\nDime-NY provided the funds for these mortgages, and all mortgages\r\nwere eventually assigned to Dime-NY.  Dime-NY is a federally\r\nchartered savings bank with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit\r\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC).\r\nAfter a large scale investigation into Dime's operations,\r\na federal grand jury returned a sixty-count indictment against\r\nGraham and six co-defendants.  Graham was charged in eleven counts\r\nof the indictment.  Two of these counts were severed and later\r\ndismissed by the government.  Graham was tried by a jury on the\r\nremaining counts.  Count 1 charged her with conspiring to make\r\nfalse statements for the purpose of influencing Dime-NY on loan\r\napplications in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  Counts 17 through 26\r\ncharged her with knowingly submitting materially false statements\r\non ten different loan applications, HUD-1 Settlement Statements,\r\nand Fannie May Affidavits for the purpose of influencing Dime-NY in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  1014.  The jury returned a verdict of\r\nguilty on counts 18 and 25 and not guilty on the remaining counts. \r\nThe district court sentenced her to eighteen months imprisonment on\r\neach count to be served concurrently and a term of one year\r\nsupervised release.\r\n        II.  Discussion of the Issues\r\nA.  Selective Prosecution and Conflict of Interest\r\nGraham asserts that her conviction violated her right to\r\ndue process because it was the product of selective prosecution on\r\nthe part of the government.  She maintains that the district court\r\nerred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of\r\nselective prosecution.  Graham points to the fact that Dime Bank-\r\nNew York was not indicted on criminal charges after it gave a\r\n$2,000,000 donation to a nonprofit housing program in Manchester,\r\nNew Hampshire.  She also notes that the U.S. Attorney in charge of\r\nthe case resides in the New Hampshire community that received the\r\ndonation.  Further complicating this picture is the fact that Dime-\r\nNY was partially owned by the FDIC and that the decision not to\r\nindict the bank came just before a successful public offering of\r\nshares in the bank, thus benefitting the FDIC by ensuring that the\r\nsale would not be marred by threats of future criminal liability. \r\nBy cumulating all of these circumstances, Graham suggests that she\r\nwas selectively prosecuted either because she did not have the\r\nwealth to avoid criminal liability through civic contributions or\r\nbecause a government conflict of interest kept the bank from being\r\nprosecuted.\r\nAn improper selective prosecution arises when a defendant\r\n\"has been singled out for prosecution when others similarly\r\nsituated have not been prosecuted and the prosecutor's reasons for\r\ndoing so were impermissible.\"  U.S. v. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\r\nCir. 1997); see also U.S. v. Peagarcano-Soler, 911 F.2d 833,\r\n837-38 (1st Cir. 1990).  The prosecutor is presumed to have acted\r\n\"in good faith for reasons of sound governmental policy.\"\r\nPeagarcano-Soler, 911 F.2d at 837 (citing U.S. v. Saad, 652 F.2d\r\n1126, 1135 (1st Cir. 1981)).  But if the defendant alleges facts\r\nthat tend to show that she has been selectively prosecuted and that\r\nraise a reasonable doubt about the propriety of the government's\r\npurpose, then she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing unless the\r\ngovernment \"puts forward adequate countervailing reasons to refute\r\nthe charge and . . . the court is persuaded that the hearing will\r\nnot be fruitful.\"  U.S. v. Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 776 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\nAlthough Graham may have presented enough evidence to\r\ncreate a prima facie case of selective prosecution by suggesting\r\nthat the bank's monetary charitable contribution precluded its\r\nprosecution, the government refuted this presumption with adequate\r\nreasons for its decisions.  Specifically the government offered a\r\nlist of eight factors it considered in its decision not to indict\r\nDime-NY:  (1) Dime's merger with Anchor in 1995; (2) the fact that\r\ncurrent senior management was not in those positions during the\r\nyears of suspected criminal activity; (3) the bank and its\r\nshareholders had suffered significant losses from the fraudulent\r\nconduct of former employees; (4) the newly formed institution had\r\nimplemented stringent fraud detection procedures; (5) the\r\nrehabilitative step of contributing $2,000,000 to the Manchester\r\nNeighborhood Housing Services, Inc.; (6) the implementation of the\r\nDime Borrowers Associations Borrowers Assistance Program II; (7)\r\npayment of $150,000 to the Dime Borrowers Associations; and (8) the\r\ncontinued cooperation of Dime-NY in the ongoing grand jury\r\ninvestigation.\r\nThe district court considered this list of factors and\r\nfound that it adequately explained the government's actions and\r\nthat no evidentiary hearing on the issue of selective prosecution\r\nwas needed.  The court further found that the accusations of\r\ngovernment conflict of interest were not substantial enough to\r\nraise any presumption of prosecutorial misconduct. \r\nWe review a district court's decision not to hold an\r\nevidentiary hearing on selective prosecution for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  Goldberg, 105 F.3d at 776 (citing U.S. v. Gary, 74\r\nF.3d 304, 313 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 2567 (1996)). \r\nIn deciding whether the district court should have granted an\r\nevidentiary hearing on the issue of selective prosecution we are\r\nfaced with a \"judgment call--tempered on appeal by the deferential\r\nstandard of review--as to the force and specificity of the\r\nallegations, the strength of the response, and the likelihood that\r\na hearing would be helpful.\"  Goldberg, 105 F.3d at 776 (citing\r\nU.S. v. Lpez, 71 F.3d 954, 963-64 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.\r\ndismissed, 117 S. Ct. 38 (1996)).  In this case the district court\r\ncarefully considered both Graham's allegations and the government's\r\nexplanation before denying an evidentiary hearing.\r\nAlthough the timing of the donation may have created a\r\nreasonable doubt about the propriety of the government's purpose,\r\nwe agree that the government adequately refuted the charge so that\r\na hearing was not necessary.  Furthermore we also agree that\r\nGraham's allegation of conflict of interest concerning the FDIC's\r\nfinancial interest in the bank does not create a presumption of\r\nimproper prosecutorial selection.  We have found no case law to\r\nsupport the preclusion of the Department of Justice from cases\r\ninvolving banks in which the FDIC has an interest.  Accordingly, we\r\nfind no abuse of the district court's discretion in denying\r\nGraham's request for an evidentiary hearing or in denying her\r\nmotion to dismiss.\r\nB.  Sufficiency of the Opening Statement\r\nGraham contends that she should have been granted a\r\njudgment of acquittal after the government's opening statement\r\nbecause it failed to point to proof for every element of each count\r\ncontained in the indictment.  Graham concedes that the government\r\ndid mention proof for the elements of the two counts upon which she\r\nwas convicted.  The decision to grant a motion for acquittal after\r\na prosecutor's opening statement is discretionary and should be\r\nmade only where the statement contains a clearly admitted fact that\r\nmust defeat its case.  See U.S. v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 414 (1st\r\nCir. 1986); U.S. v. Capocci, 433 F.2d 155, 158 (1st Cir. 1970).\r\nFurthermore, we have held that a district court's denial of a\r\nmotion for acquittal on the basis of the government's opening\r\nstatement is not reviewable and that any error in this respect can\r\nbe raised in a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.\r\nIngraldi, 793 F.2d at 414.\r\nGraham asserts that the district court erred by failing\r\nto recognize its discretion to grant the motion.  Instead the\r\ndistrict court correctly recognized that it did not have the\r\ndiscretion to grant a motion for acquittal at the close of the\r\ngovernment's opening statement in this situation.  The prosecutor\r\nadmitted no fact that clearly defeated the government's case. \r\nFailure to outline all of the evidence in the opening statement did\r\nnot create a right to an acquittal.  See Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 414. \r\nIn fact the government does not have an obligation to make any\r\nopening statement.  Id.\r\nWe have no power to review the denial of Graham's motion\r\nfor acquittal after the government's opening statement, but even if\r\nwe did, we would find that the district court did not err.\r\nC.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nGraham was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.  1014, which\r\nmakes it unlawful to \"knowingly make[] any false statement or\r\nreport, or willfully overvalue[] any land, property or security,\r\nfor the purpose of influencing in any way the action of . . . any\r\ninstitution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal\r\nDeposit Insurance Corporation.\"  18 U.S.C.  1014.  Graham contends\r\nthat her conviction was insufficiently supported because the\r\ngovernment failed to prove that she purposefully sought to\r\ninfluence a federally insured bank.  Dime-NH, out of which Graham\r\noperated, is not insured by the FDIC.  She contends that at the\r\nmost, the evidence showed that she intended to influence Dime-NH or\r\nDime-MA, which approved the mortgage applications.  However Dime-NH\r\nand Dime-MA are wholly owned subsidiaries of Dime-NY, which is a\r\nfederally insured institution.  Dime-NY was the entity actually\r\nfinancing all of Graham's mortgages and all mortgages were\r\neventually assigned to it.  Nonetheless, Graham asserts that\r\nbecause she was based in New Hampshire and submitted all of her\r\ndocuments to the Dime-NH office, the government failed to prove\r\nthat her purpose was to influence a federally insured bank.\r\nGraham's assertion fails for two reasons.  First, this\r\ncourt has held that \"the government does not have to show the\r\nalleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution; \r\nit is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a\r\nfraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk\r\nof loss.\"  U.S. v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 426 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(holding that \"it is also unnecessary for the government to prove\r\nthat a defendant knows which particular bank will be victimized by\r\nhis fraud as long as it is established that a defendant knows that\r\na financial institution will be defrauded.\") (citing U.S. v. Barakett, 994 F.2d 1107, 1110-11 (5th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Morgenstern, 933 F.2d 1108, 1114 (2d Cir. 1991)).  In this case as\r\nin Brandon, proof that Graham knew she was defrauding a bank was\r\nsufficient to prove a violation of the statute.\r\nSecond, even if the statute required that the government\r\nprove that Graham knew she was fraudulently influencing a federally\r\ninsured bank, the evidence offered by the government was sufficient\r\nto do so.  Graham was a loan originator for Dime-NH, and she had\r\nbeen sent to training at Dime-NY.  The evidence showed that at this\r\ntraining she was informed of the history and structure of Dime Bank\r\nand was given instruction on all of its loan programs.  In fact\r\nGraham admitted that she often relied on Dime Bank's size and\r\nprominence to solicit new borrowers.  Given the small size of the\r\nNew Hampshire operation, she must have been referring to its\r\nparent, Dime-NY.  Graham was not an unsophisticated private\r\nborrower, but an employee of Dime Bank specifically instructed on\r\nhow the loan process worked.  This circumstantial evidence was\r\nsufficient to prove that she understood that Dime-NY ultimately\r\nprovided the funding for the loans although they originated in New\r\nHampshire and were approved by Dime-MA.\r\nThe government offered sufficient evidence to support\r\nGraham's convictions under 18 U.S.C.  1014.\r\nD.  The Court's Questioning of the Witnesses\r\nGraham contends that the trial court's questioning of\r\ncertain witnesses deprived her of a fair trial and created\r\nprejudice in favor of the government.  Because Graham failed to\r\ncontemporaneously object to the court's comments, we review the\r\ndistrict court's questioning for plain error.  Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n52(b).\r\n\"A trial judge retains the common law power to question\r\nwitnesses and to comment on the evidence.\"  U.S. v. Gonzlez-\r\nSoberal, 109 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 1997)(citations omitted).  After\r\nreviewing the instances of which Graham complains we find no error\r\non the part of the district court.  At most, the court sought to\r\nclarify testimony given by the witnesses in question and helped to\r\nmove the proceedings along in an orderly fashion.  Considering the\r\nwide latitude granted a trial judge in managing a trial, we find no\r\nerror so obvious that it could rise to the level of substantial and\r\nfundamental prejudice required by plain error review.  See U.S. v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1994) (discussing plain error\r\nstandard of review).\r\nE.  Loss Calculation for Sentencing\r\nAlthough the two counts on which Graham was convicted\r\ninvolved no loss to the victim, she was sentenced based on related,\r\nacquitted conduct after the district court found by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence that she had participated in a conspiracy that\r\nresulted in a loss of $1.46 million to the victim.  This loss\r\nresulted in a total offense level of 17 which imposes a sentencing\r\nrange of 24-30 months.  After Graham pointed out that the loss\r\nattributed to her was substantially higher than the loss attributed\r\nto other similarly situated defendants who had cooperated with the\r\ngovernment, the government recommended a downward departure for\r\nGraham on the ground that the loss figure overstated her\r\nculpability.  The district court agreed and granted Graham a two-\r\nlevel downward departure resulting in a sentence of 18 months on\r\neach count to be served concurrently. \r\nGraham contends that the disparity in loss calculations\r\nviolated her right to due process and equal protection because it\r\nwas the result of sentencing factor manipulation.  In response to\r\nthe district court's questioning on this issue, the government\r\nexplained that any disparity was the result of early guilty pleas\r\nand cooperation agreements by other defendants.  The district\r\ncourt accepted this explanation and Graham did not specifically\r\nobject to this ruling or ask for an evidentiary hearing on the\r\nissue.  We find no plain error in the district court's decision.\r\nEven assuming that Graham could prove that the government\r\nimproperly manipulated her loss calculation, the district court's\r\ndownward departure remedied her grievance.  \"[W]here government\r\nagents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of the crime,\r\nthe sentencing court 'has ample power to deal with the situation\r\n. . . by departing from the [guideline sentencing range].'\"  U.S.v. Montoya, 62 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting U.S. v. Connell,\r\n960 F.2d 191, 196 (1st Cir. 1992)).  To the extent that Graham's\r\nappeal suggests that the departure was inadequate, absent an error\r\nof law this court has no jurisdiction to consider the extent of a\r\npermitted departure.  U.S. v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  We find no such error of law.\r\n\n               III. Conclusion\r\nWe AFFIRM Graham's conviction and sentence under 18\r\nU.S.C.  1014.\n",

In deciding whether the district court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of selective prosecution we are faced with a \"judgment call--tempered on appeal by the deferential standard of review--as to the force and specificity of the allegations, the strength of the response, and the likelihood that a hearing would be helpful.\"  Goldberg, 105 F.3d at 776 (citing U.S. v.

We have found no case law to support the preclusion of the Department of Justice from cases involving banks in which the FDIC has an interest.  Accordingly, we find no abuse of the district court's discretion in denying Graham's request for an evidentiary hearing or in denying her motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of the Opening Statement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham contends that she should have been granted a judgment of acquittal after the government's opening statement because it failed to point to proof for every element of each count contained in the indictment.  Graham concedes that the government did mention proof for the elements of the two counts upon which she was convicted.  The decision to grant a motion for acquittal after a prosecutor's opening statement is discretionary and should be made only where the statement contains a clearly admitted fact that must defeat its case.  See U.S. v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 414 (1st Cir.1986);  U.S. v. Capocci, 433 F.2d 155, 158 (1st Cir.1970).  Furthermore, we have held that a district court's denial of a motion for acquittal on the basis of the government's opening statement is not reviewable and that any error in this respect can be raised in a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 414.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham asserts that the district court erred by failing to recognize its discretion to grant the motion.  Instead the district court correctly recognized that it did not have the discretion to grant a motion for acquittal at the close of the government's opening statement in this situation.  The prosecutor admitted no fact that clearly defeated the government's case.  Failure to outline all of the evidence in the opening statement did not create a right to an acquittal.  See Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 414.   In fact the government does not have an obligation to make any opening statement.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no power to review the denial of Graham's motion for acquittal after the government's opening statement, but even if we did, we would find that the district court did not err.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014, which makes it unlawful to \"knowingly make[ ] any false statement or report, or willfully overvalue[ ] any land, property or security, for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of ... any institution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.  Graham contends that her conviction was insufficiently supported because the government failed to prove that she purposefully sought to influence a federally insured bank.  Dime-NH, out of which Graham operated, is not insured by the FDIC.  She contends that at the most, the evidence showed that she intended to influence Dime-NH or Dime-MA, which approved the mortgage applications.  However Dime-NH and Dime-MA are wholly owned subsidiaries of Dime-NY, which is a federally insured institution.  Dime-NY was the entity actually financing all of Graham's mortgages and all mortgages were eventually assigned to it.  Nonetheless, Graham asserts that because she was based in New Hampshire and submitted all of her documents to the Dime-NH office, the government failed to prove that her purpose was to influence a federally insured bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham's assertion fails for two reasons.  First, this court has held that \"the government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution;  it is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a fraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk of loss.\"  U.S. v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 426 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that \"it is also unnecessary for the government to prove that a defendant knows which particular bank will be victimized by his fraud as long as it is established that a defendant knows that a financial institution will be defrauded.\")  (citing U.S. v. Barakett, 994 F.2d 1107, 1110-11 (5th Cir.1993);  U.S. v. Morgenstern, 933 F.2d 1108, 1114 (2d Cir.1991)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In this case as in Brandon, proof that Graham knew she was defrauding a bank was sufficient to prove a violation of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the statute required that the government prove that Graham knew she was fraudulently influencing a federally insured bank, the evidence offered by the government was sufficient to do so.  Graham was a loan originator for Dime-NH, and she had been sent to training at Dime-NY.  The evidence showed that at this training she was informed of the history and structure of Dime Bank and was given instruction on all of its loan programs.  In fact Graham admitted that she often relied on Dime Bank's size and prominence to solicit new borrowers.  Given the small size of the New Hampshire operation, she must have been referring to its parent, Dime-NY.  Graham was not an unsophisticated private borrower, but an employee of Dime Bank specifically instructed on how the loan process worked.  This circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove that she understood that Dime-NY ultimately provided the funding for the loans although they originated in New Hampshire and were approved by Dime-MA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered sufficient evidence to support Graham's convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Court's Questioning of the Witnesses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham contends that the trial court's questioning of certain witnesses deprived her of a fair trial and created prejudice in favor of the government.  Because Graham failed to contemporaneously object to the court's comments, we review the district court's questioning for plain error.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A trial judge retains the common law power to question witnesses and to comment on the evidence.\"  U.S. v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir.1997) (citations omitted).  After reviewing the instances of which Graham complains we find no error on the part of the district court.  At most, the court sought to clarify testimony given by the witnesses in question and helped to move the proceedings along in an orderly fashion.  Considering the wide latitude granted a trial judge in managing a trial, we find no error so obvious that it could rise to the level of substantial and fundamental prejudice required by plain error review.  See U.S. v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1994) (discussing plain error standard of review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Loss Calculation for Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the two counts on which Graham was convicted involved no loss to the victim, she was sentenced based on related, acquitted conduct after the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that she had participated in a conspiracy that resulted in a loss of $1.46 million to the victim.  This loss resulted in a total offense level of 17 which imposes a sentencing range of 24-30 months.  After Graham pointed out that the loss attributed to her was substantially higher than the loss attributed to other similarly situated defendants who had cooperated with the government, the government recommended a downward departure for Graham on the ground that the loss figure overstated her culpability.  The district court agreed and granted Graham a two-level downward departure resulting in a sentence of 18 months on each count to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham contends that the disparity in loss calculations violated her right to due process and equal protection because it was the result of sentencing factor manipulation.  In response to the district court's questioning on this issue, the government explained that any disparity was the result of early guilty pleas and cooperation agreements by other defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court accepted this explanation and Graham did not specifically object to this ruling or ask for an evidentiary hearing on the issue.  We find no plain error in the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Graham could prove that the government improperly manipulated her loss calculation, the district court's downward departure remedied her grievance.  \"[W]here government agents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of the crime, the sentencing court 'has ample power to deal with the situation ... by departing from the [guideline sentencing range].' \"  U.S. v. Montoya, 62 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting U.S. v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 196 (1st Cir.1992)).  To the extent that Graham's appeal suggests that the departure was inadequate, absent an error of law this court has no jurisdiction to consider the extent of a permitted departure.  U.S. v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995).  We find no such error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Brandon involved a conviction under both &#167; 1344 and &#167; 1014 and the court interpreted the knowledge requirement in both statutes as the same.

Factual and Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was entitled to find the following facts, either as undisputed or based on sufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1987 and 1989 Karla Graham worked as a mortgage account executive for Dime Real Estate Services of New Hampshire (Dime-NH)a wholly owned subsidiary of Dime Savings Bank of New York (Dime-NY) that provided residential mortgage loans.  Graham originated the loans and was paid on commission.  During this time the bank had a low-documentation lending program that approved loan applications without verification of income, employment or assets as long as the borrowers could make a twenty percent down payment with their own funds.  Graham and her co-defendants found ways to avoid the down payment requirement and submitted fraudulent loan applications to the bank's underwriters in Massachusetts (Dime-MA).  Dime-NY provided the funds for these mortgages, and all mortgages were eventually assigned to Dime-NY.  Dime-NY is a federally chartered savings bank with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a large scale investigation into Dime's operations, a federal grand jury returned a sixty-count indictment against Graham and six co-defendants.  Graham was charged in eleven counts of the indictment.  Two of these counts were severed and later dismissed by the government.  Graham was tried by a jury on the remaining counts.  Count 1 charged her with conspiring to make false statements for the purpose of influencing Dime-NY on loan applications in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.  Counts 17 through 26 charged her with knowingly submitting materially false statements on ten different loan applications, HUD-1 Settlement Statements, and Fannie May Affidavits for the purpose of influencing Dime-NY in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts 18 and 25 and not guilty on the remaining counts.  The district court sentenced her to eighteen months imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently and a term of one year supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion of the Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>A. Selective Prosecution and Conflict of Interest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham asserts that her conviction violated her right to due process because it was the product of selective prosecution on the part of the government.  She maintains that the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of selective prosecution.  Graham points to the fact that Dime Bank-New York was not indicted on criminal charges after it gave a $2,000,000 donation to a nonprofit housing program in Manchester, New Hampshire.  She also notes that the U.S. Attorney in charge of the case resides in the New Hampshire community that received the donation.  Further complicating this picture is the fact that DimeNY was partially owned by the FDIC and that the decision not to indict the bank came just before a successful public offering of shares in the bank, thus benefitting the FDIC by ensuring that the sale would not be marred by threats of future criminal liability.  By cumulating all of these circumstances, Graham suggests that she was selectively prosecuted either because she did not have the wealth to avoid criminal liability through civic contributions or because a government conflict of interest kept the bank from being prosecuted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An improper selective prosecution arises when a defendant \"has been singled out for prosecution when others similarly situated have not been prosecuted and the prosecutor's reasons for doing so were impermissible.\"  U.S. v.

But if the defendant alleges facts that tend to show that she has been selectively prosecuted and that raise a reasonable doubt about the propriety of the government's purpose, then she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing unless the government \"puts forward adequate countervailing reasons to refute the charge and ... the court is persuaded that the hearing will not be fruitful.\"  U.S. v.

Graham concedes that the government did mention proof for the elements of the two counts upon which she was convicted.  The decision to grant a motion for acquittal after a prosecutor's opening statement is discretionary and should be made only where the statement contains a clearly admitted fact that must defeat its case.  See U.S. v.

Furthermore, we have held that a district court's denial of a motion for acquittal on the basis of the government's opening statement is not reviewable and that any error in this respect can be raised in a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 414.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham asserts that the district court erred by failing to recognize its discretion to grant the motion.  Instead the district court correctly recognized that it did not have the discretion to grant a motion for acquittal at the close of the government's opening statement in this situation.  The prosecutor admitted no fact that clearly defeated the government's case.  Failure to outline all of the evidence in the opening statement did not create a right to an acquittal.  See Ingraldi, 793 F.2d at 414.   In fact the government does not have an obligation to make any opening statement.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no power to review the denial of Graham's motion for acquittal after the government's opening statement, but even if we did, we would find that the district court did not err.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014, which makes it unlawful to \"knowingly make[ ] any false statement or report, or willfully overvalue[ ] any land, property or security, for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of ... any institution the accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.  Graham contends that her conviction was insufficiently supported because the government failed to prove that she purposefully sought to influence a federally insured bank.  Dime-NH, out of which Graham operated, is not insured by the FDIC.  She contends that at the most, the evidence showed that she intended to influence Dime-NH or Dime-MA, which approved the mortgage applications.  However Dime-NH and Dime-MA are wholly owned subsidiaries of Dime-NY, which is a federally insured institution.  Dime-NY was the entity actually financing all of Graham's mortgages and all mortgages were eventually assigned to it.  Nonetheless, Graham asserts that because she was based in New Hampshire and submitted all of her documents to the Dime-NH office, the government failed to prove that her purpose was to influence a federally insured bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham's assertion fails for two reasons.  First, this court has held that \"the government does not have to show the alleged scheme was directed solely toward a particular institution;  it is sufficient to show that defendant knowingly executed a fraudulent scheme that exposed a federally insured bank to a risk of loss.\"  U.S. v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 426 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that \"it is also unnecessary for the government to prove that a defendant knows which particular bank will be victimized by his fraud as long as it is established that a defendant knows that a financial institution will be defrauded.\")  (citing U.S. v. Barakett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608098\"><a href=\"/opinion/608098/united-states-v-alfred-fred-barakett-aka-robert-john-koch-and-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></a></span>, 1110-11 (5th Cir.1993);  U.S. v. Morgenstern, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561783\"><a href=\"/opinion/561783/united-states-v-seymour-morgenstern/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span>, 1114 (2d Cir.1991)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In this case as in Brandon, proof that Graham knew she was defrauding a bank was sufficient to prove a violation of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the statute required that the government prove that Graham knew she was fraudulently influencing a federally insured bank, the evidence offered by the government was sufficient to do so.  Graham was a loan originator for Dime-NH, and she had been sent to training at Dime-NY.  The evidence showed that at this training she was informed of the history and structure of Dime Bank and was given instruction on all of its loan programs.  In fact Graham admitted that she often relied on Dime Bank's size and prominence to solicit new borrowers.  Given the small size of the New Hampshire operation, she must have been referring to its parent, Dime-NY.  Graham was not an unsophisticated private borrower, but an employee of Dime Bank specifically instructed on how the loan process worked.  This circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove that she understood that Dime-NY ultimately provided the funding for the loans although they originated in New Hampshire and were approved by Dime-MA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered sufficient evidence to support Graham's convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Court's Questioning of the Witnesses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham contends that the trial court's questioning of certain witnesses deprived her of a fair trial and created prejudice in favor of the government.  Because Graham failed to contemporaneously object to the court's comments, we review the district court's questioning for plain error.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A trial judge retains the common law power to question witnesses and to comment on the evidence.\"  U.S. v. Gonzalez-Soberal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.1997) (citations omitted).  After reviewing the instances of which Graham complains we find no error on the part of the district court.  At most, the court sought to clarify testimony given by the witnesses in question and helped to move the proceedings along in an orderly fashion.  Considering the wide latitude granted a trial judge in managing a trial, we find no error so obvious that it could rise to the level of substantial and fundamental prejudice required by plain error review.  See U.S. v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195351\"><a href=\"/opinion/195351/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1994) (discussing plain error standard of review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Loss Calculation for Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the two counts on which Graham was convicted involved no loss to the victim, she was sentenced based on related, acquitted conduct after the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that she had participated in a conspiracy that resulted in a loss of $1.46 million to the victim.  This loss resulted in a total offense level of 17 which imposes a sentencing range of 24-30 months.  After Graham pointed out that the loss attributed to her was substantially higher than the loss attributed to other similarly situated defendants who had cooperated with the government, the government recommended a downward departure for Graham on the ground that the loss figure overstated her culpability.  The district court agreed and granted Graham a two-level downward departure resulting in a sentence of 18 months on each count to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Graham contends that the disparity in loss calculations violated her right to due process and equal protection because it was the result of sentencing factor manipulation.  In response to the district court's questioning on this issue, the government explained that any disparity was the result of early guilty pleas and cooperation agreements by other defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The district court accepted this explanation and Graham did not specifically object to this ruling or ask for an evidentiary hearing on the issue.  We find no plain error in the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that Graham could prove that the government improperly manipulated her loss calculation, the district court's downward departure remedied her grievance.  \"[W]here government agents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of the crime, the sentencing court 'has ample power to deal with the situation ... by departing from the [guideline sentencing range].' \"  U.S. v. Montoya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196205\"><a href=\"/opinion/196205/united-states-v-montoya/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting U.S. v. Connell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580693\"><a href=\"/opinion/580693/united-states-v-gerald-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 196 (1st Cir.1992)).  To the extent that Graham's appeal suggests that the departure was inadequate, absent an error of law this court has no jurisdiction to consider the extent of a permitted departure.  U.S. v. Webster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196037\"><a href=\"/opinion/196037/united-states-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1995).  We find no such error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Brandon involved a conviction under both &#167; 1344 and &#167; 1014 and the court interpreted the knowledge requirement in both statutes as the same.  See Brandon, 17 F.3d at 425 n. 13 (\"We find the language of &#167; 1014 sufficiently similar to &#167; 1344 to warrant a similar conclusion about Congress'[s] intent with respect to the knowledge requirement in the bank fraud statute.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Section 1B1.8 of the sentencing guidelines restricts the government from using self-incriminating evidence provided by cooperating defendants in determining the applicable guideline range for those defendants.
