We affirm.\r\n\n     We find  no error  in the  district court  determination\r\n\nthat  the  1986  deed  conveying  land  from  IP  Timberlands\r\n\nOperating Company,  Ltd. [IPTO]  to International  Paper [IP]\r\n\nreserved to IPTO a right  to travel over the so-called \"outer\r\n\nroad.\"  Similarly, the court  did not err in determining that\r\n\nthe deeds  of the other  plaintiffs also endowed them  with a\r\n\nright to travel over this road.  \r\n\n     Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 33,    201-A has no effect  on\r\n\nthis issues  in this  case.  By  its plain  language, section\r\n\n201-A  pertains neither to the creation  or the extinction of\r\n\nan  easement but only to  whether an unrecorded deed provides\r\n\n\"actual  notice\"  of an  easement  to  subsequent purchasers.\r\n\nSince the  1986 deed between  IPTO and IP was  duly recorded,\r\n\npursuant to  Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.  tit. 33,    201, the  deed\r\n\nitself gave constructive notice of the easement to subsequent\r\n\npurchasers like  Wyler.   See Westman  v.
