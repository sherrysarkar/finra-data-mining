Plaintiff-appellant Jacqueline T.\n\nBenham (\"Benham\") appeals from the district court’s judgment against\n\nher on her claim of discrimination under the Employment Retirement and\n\nIncome Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461. Specifically,\n\nBenham argues that the district court’s judgment is predicated upon a\n\nfactual finding that has no support in the record. Because we conclude\n\nthat the district court relied upon a clearly erroneous factual finding\n\nin reaching its holding, we reverse and remand this case for a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                         FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n           From 1976 until 1997, Benham worked full-time at the Lenox\n\nSavings Bank (the \"Bank\") in Lenox, Massachusetts. During her tenure\n\nat the Bank, Benham held several positions, ranging in importance from\n\nbank teller to senior vice-president in charge of consumer lending. In\n\n1997, the Bank’s president, Michael Christopher, abruptly terminated\n\nBenham’s employment.\n\n           On January 15, 1998, Benham filed suit in district court\n\nclaiming that the Bank unlawfully discharged her in violation of § 510\n\nof ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1140, which prohibits the firing of an employee\n\nfor the purpose of depriving her of employee benefits.1 During the\n\n\n1   Section 510 of ERISA provides in pertinent part:\n\n      It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine,\n      suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a\n      participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which\n\n                                  -3-\n\fbench trial, Benham introduced several pieces of circumstantial\n\nevidence to substantiate her claim. First, because of her seniority\n\nand years of experience, Benham’s benefits far exceeded those of any\n\nother bank employee.     Second, Christopher’s bonus was directly\n\nproportional to the Bank’s profits, which gave him an incentive to\n\nreduce employee benefits.    Finally, Christopher actually reduced\n\nseveral of the Bank’s employee benefit plans.       For Benham, this\n\nevidence led to the inescapable conclusion that she was fired so that\n\nthe Bank could avoid paying her costly employee benefits.\n\n          In response, the Bank asserted that Benham was discharged\n\nbecause she made several improper intra-family loans. In particular,\n\nthe Bank argued that Benham created multiple conflicts of interest when\n\nshe approved and defined the terms of loans given to Paula and Joseph\n\nCzop, her daughter and son-in-law. According to the appellee, then,\n\nBenham was fired for violating the Bank’s Code of Conduct, which\n\nprohibits the authorization of loans to family members and the\n\nextension of credit to them on preferential terms.\n\n          Rather than crediting either of the proffered reasons for\n\nBenham’s termination, the district court introduced an alternative\n\n\n\n     he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit\n     plan . . . or for the purpose of interfering with the\n     attainment of any right to which such participant may become\n     entitled under the plan . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1140.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fexplanation. The court found that Christopher fired Benham \"to make an\n\nexample of her, to demonstrate his power as president of the Lenox\n\nSavings Bank.\" Believing that the district court erred in reaching\n\nthis factual determination, Benham filed the instant appeal.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          It is well settled in our jurisprudence that a district\n\ncourt’s factual findings regarding an employer’s intent are reviewed\n\nfor clear error. See Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nPursuant to this standard, we will reverse a lower court’s decision\n\nonly if \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an\n\nabiding conviction that . . . [the court's] findings are simply wrong.\"\n\nState Police Ass'n v. Commissioner, 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\naccord Indus. Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pac. Sys. Corp., 44 F.3d 40, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (ruling that an appellate court must have a \"strong,\n\nunyielding conviction that the district court was mistaken\" before\n\nreversing on clear error grounds).\n\n          Benham argues that the district court clearly erred in\n\nfinding that she was fired because Christopher \"wanted to make an\n\nexample of her, to demonstrate his power as president of the Lenox\n\nSavings Bank.\" After carefully reviewing the record, we have found no\n\nevidence whatsoever to support the district court’s factual\n\ndetermination. Our search results are corroborated by the Bank's brief\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fto this Court, which does not cite a single piece of evidence in\n\ndefense of the district court’s theory.\n\n          Instead, the Bank argues that \"[t]he [District] Court’s\n\nfinding that Christopher wanted 'to make an example of' Benham may be\n\na comment on his management style, but it is not an 'alternative\n\nexplanation' for his decision to terminate her.\" The Bank’s argument,\n\nhowever, is directly contradicted by the explicit language of the\n\ndistrict court’s findings. In a colloquy with itself, the district\n\ncourt asked and answered the critical question:\n\n          This leaves us with the key issue. Why at the\n          time [Christopher] fired [Benham] did he do so?\n          . . . He did so to make an example of her, to\n          demonstrate his power as president of the Lenox\n          Savings Bank.\n\nIt is clear from this discussion that the district court was\n\nspecifically describing what motivated Christopher to discharge Benham.\n\nFurthermore, this reason was the only one advanced by the district\n\ncourt to explain what caused the termination of Benham's employment.2\n\n          Having found no support for the district court's ultimate\n\nfactual finding, we are left with a \"strong, unyielding conviction that\n\nthe district court was mistaken.\" Indus. Gen. Corp., 44 F.3d at 46.\n\n\n\n2 Though the district court found that Christopher believed that Benham\nviolated the Bank's Code of Conduct, the court concluded that what\nactually caused Christopher to fire Benham was a need to demonstrate\nhis authority. Notwithstanding the Bank's arguments to the contrary,\nthe district court never found that Christopher terminated Benham\nbecause he believed that she violated the Code of Conduct.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fWe therefore conclude that the district court committed clear error in\n\nits findings of fact.\n\n          Not satisfied with a reversal, Benham argues that we should\n\nenter judgment in her favor because all of the district court’s\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact compel that conclusion. Though rare, an\n\nappellate court may make findings of fact where the record permits only\n\none resolution of the factual issue. See Pullman-Standard v. Swint,\n\n456 U.S. 273, 291-92 (1982); Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms\n\nDairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 463 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that \"appellate\n\nfactfinding is permissible only when no other resolution of a factbound\n\nquestion would, on the compiled record, be sustainable\").\n\n          Though the district court made some findings of fact that\n\nclearly support Benham’s claim,3 it cannot be seriously argued that the\n\ncourt’s subsidiary findings compel the conclusion that judgment should\n\nbe entered in her favor. The district court, for instance, found that\n\nBenham directly authorized at least one loan to her family -- an act\n\nwhich may have violated the Bank's Code of Conduct.         Thus, the\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact can be used as much to support Benham’s\n\nclaim as to defend the Bank’s.\n\n          In the end, there remains competent evidence from which a\n\nfactfinder could credit either Benham’s or the Bank’s version of\n\n\n3 For example, the district court found \"that it was a particular theme\nof Mr. Christopher's management of the bank to reduce . . . the\nbenefits to be afforded to bank officers and employees.\"\n\n                                 -7-\n\fevents.   Rather than usurping the district court's function and\n\nentering judgment in favor of either party, we reverse and remand this\n\ncase for a new trial.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's\n\njudgment and remand the case for a new trial.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

For Benham, this evidence led to the inescapable conclusion that she was fired so that the Bank could avoid paying her costly employee benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the Bank asserted that Benham was discharged because she made several improper intra-family loans. In particular, the Bank argued that Benham created multiple conflicts of interest when she approved and defined the terms of loans given to Paula and Joseph Czop, her daughter and son-in-law. According to the appellee, then, Benham was fired for violating the Bank's Code of Conduct, which prohibits the authorization of loans to family members and the extension of credit to them on preferential terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than crediting either of the proffered reasons for Benham's termination, the district court introduced an alternative explanation. The court found that Christopher fired Benham \"to make an example of her, to demonstrate his power as president of the Lenox Savings Bank.\" Believing that the district court erred in reaching this factual determination, Benham filed the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled in our jurisprudence that a district court's factual findings regarding an employer's intent are reviewed for clear error. <i>See Foster v. Dalton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709035\"><a href=\"/opinion/709035/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1402-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43789-sharon-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1995). Pursuant to this standard, we will reverse a lower court's decision only if \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction that... [the court's] findings are simply wrong.\" <i>State Police Ass'n v.

Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195833\"><a href=\"/opinion/195833/industrial-v-sequoia/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.1995) (ruling that an appellate court must have a \"strong, unyielding conviction that the district court was mistaken\" before reversing on clear error grounds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benham argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that she was fired because Christopher \"wanted to make an example of her, to demonstrate his power as president of the Lenox Savings Bank.\" After carefully reviewing the record, we have found no evidence whatsoever to support the district court's factual determination. Our search results are corroborated by the Bank's brief to this Court, which does not cite a single piece of evidence in defense of the district court's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the Bank argues that \"[t]he [District] Court's finding that Christopher wanted `to make an example of' Benham may be a comment on his management style, but it is not an `alternative explanation' for his decision to terminate her.\" The Bank's argument, however, is directly contradicted by the explicit language of the district court's findings. In a colloquy with itself, the district court asked and answered the critical question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves us with the key issue. Why at the time [Christopher] fired [Benham] did he do so? ... He did so to make an example of her, to demonstrate his power as president of the Lenox Savings Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from this discussion that the district court was specifically describing what motivated Christopher to discharge Benham. Furthermore, this reason was the only one advanced by the district court to explain what caused the termination of Benham's employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no support for the district court's ultimate factual finding, we are left with a \"strong, unyielding conviction that the district court was mistaken.\" <i>Indus. Gen. Corp.,</i> 44 F.3d at 46. We therefore conclude that the district court committed clear error in its findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not satisfied with a reversal, Benham argues that we should enter judgment in her favor because all of the district court's subsidiary findings of fact compel that conclusion. Though rare, an appellate court may make findings of fact where the record permits only one resolution of the factual issue. <i>See Pullman-Standard v.

The district court, for instance, found that Benham directly authorized at least one loan to her family &#8212; an act which may have violated the Bank's Code of Conduct. Thus, the subsidiary findings of fact can be used as much to support Benham's claim as to defend the Bank's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, there remains competent evidence from which a factfinder could credit either Benham's or the Bank's version of events.
