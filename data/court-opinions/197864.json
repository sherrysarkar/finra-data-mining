William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n           Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n      Boudin and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\nBernard Grossberg, by appointment of the Court, for appellant.\r\nChristopher F. Bator, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               March 18, 1998\r\n                                          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  On January 12, 1995, the Melrose,\r\nMassachusetts Police Department received a telephone call\r\nregarding the fraudulent purchase of video tapes from a store in\r\nClearwater, Florida. An extensive investigation ensued, producing\r\nsufficient evidence to allow the authorities to seek and obtain a\r\nsearch warrant of Appellant's business and residence.  The\r\nwarrant included a \"no-knock\" provision for the search of\r\nAppellant's apartment.\r\nThis provision was requested after police discovered that\r\nAppellant had an extensive criminal record involving acts of\r\nviolence.  These included convictions for armed robbery, armed\r\nrobbery while masked, assault with a dangerous weapon, threats,\r\nassault and battery, possession of a dangerous weapon, using a\r\nfirearm with intent to commit a crime, assault with a dangerous\r\nweapon, and a firearms violation (possession of a shotgun). \r\nFurthermore, the investigating police officer also had recently\r\nlearned that Appellant had threatened a neighbor with a gun. \r\nThus, believing that Appellant was armed and dangerous, and that\r\nthe investigation by the police may have alerted him to the\r\nsituation that was developing, the state sought, and a state\r\njudge granted, a \"no-knock\" warrant for the apartment in\r\nquestion. \r\nOn January 20, 1995 the police executed the warrant on\r\nAppellant's apartment seeking to obtain evidence of the\r\nfraudulent purchase of the videotapes.  The door was broken down\r\nwith a sledge hammer, the officers entered with drawn weapons,\r\nand Appellant was ordered to the ground with a gun held to his\r\nhead.  The search produced several items, including several of\r\nthe tapes sought, but more relevant to this appeal, the executing\r\nofficers found one box of Winchester .22 caliber hollow-point\r\ncartridges, as well as a .22 caliber rifle cleaning kit.  Small\r\namounts of illegal controlled substances, and stolen computer\r\nequipment were also discovered.\r\nOne of the officers also discovered a ring of keys on the kitchen\r\ncountertop.  A resident of the apartment building indicated that\r\nthere were storage compartments assigned to each apartment in the\r\ncommon basement of the building, whereupon the search party\r\nproceeded to that area.  There they found twelve open storage\r\nareas, enclosed within a framing covered with chicken wire, the\r\ninteriors of which were visible from outside the enclosures.  All\r\nbut two of the enclosures were marked with numbers corresponding\r\nto apartment numbers located in the building.\r\nApartment 5, Appellant's premises, was one of the two numbers\r\nthat was not marked on any locker.  Upon testing by a police\r\nofficer of several of the keys recovered from Appellant's\r\napartment on the locks of the two unnumbered storage spaces, he\r\nwas able to unlock one of the locks.  The officers did not\r\nproceed further and again locked the premise in question.  They\r\nwere able to observe through the chicken wire, however, several\r\nboxes located inside.\r\n With this information, the police sought and received an\r\nadditional warrant to search the storage area that was assigned\r\nto Appellant's apartment.  Upon execution of this warrant, the\r\npolice discovered the firearms enumerated in Count One of the\r\nindictment, namely, a Colt .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol, a\r\nColt .357 caliber magnum revolver, a Charter Arms .22 caliber\r\nrifle, and an Astra .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol with an\r\nobliterated serial number.\r\nThe fruits of this investigation were turned over to the federal\r\nauthorities, whereupon Appellant was charged in a two count\r\nindictment alleging violations of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1), because\r\nhe was a convicted felon in possession of firearms and of\r\nammunition. Appellant sought to suppress the evidence obtained\r\nfrom his apartment, including the keys, as well as the items\r\nseized from his storage compartment in the basement of the\r\napartment house. The motion was denied by the district court and\r\nthereafter Appellant entered a conditional guilty plea. After\r\nbeing sentenced by the district court to a term of 180 months'\r\nincarceration and five years' supervised release, Appellant\r\nsought to withdraw his plea. This request was denied by the\r\ndistrict court and this appeal followed.\r\nThree errors are claimed on appeal: (1) the failure to grant the\r\nsuppression of the evidence seized at Appellant's apartment and\r\nlocker, (2) the denial of the motion to withdraw the conditional\r\nguilty plea, and (3) the inclusion of state charges for\r\nconspiracy to commit a violent felony and possession of a firearm\r\nduring the commission of a felony as convictions under 18 U.S.C.\r\n924(e) and Section 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines.  Finding\r\nthat the district court committed no error in its rulings, we\r\naffirm Appellant's conviction.\r\nI.  The Motion to Suppress\r\nAppellant challenges the district court's finding that the \"no-\r\nknock\" provisions of the search warrant to his apartment were\r\nlawful, and questions the court's validation of the police entry\r\ninto the basement area and the discovery of the evidence located\r\nthere.\r\n  A.  \"No-Knock\" Warrants\r\n Although there is a presumption in favor of announcement, i.e.,\r\nknocking or some similar gesture, this postulate \"yield[s] under\r\ncircumstances presenting a threat of physical violence.\"  Wilsonv. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 936 (1995). The burden that must be\r\nmet by the police to validate a \"no-knock\" entry \"is not high.\" \r\nRichards v. Wisconsin,     U.S.    ,    , 117 S. Ct. 1416, 1422\r\n(1997).  \"Under Richards, a no-knock entry is justified if police\r\nhave a 'reasonable suspicion' that knocking and announcing would\r\nbe dangerous . . . to the purposes of the investigation.\"  United\r\nStates v. Ramrez,     U.S.    ,    , 1998 WL 88055, at *3 (U.S.\r\nMarch 4, 1998).  In this case, Appellant's copious record of\r\nviolent convictions, coupled with the attesting police officer's\r\npersonal knowledge of a recent armed action by him, and the\r\nofficer's suspicion that Hawkins was aware of the police interest\r\nin him more than sufficiently justified a \"reasonable suspicion\"\r\nthat knocking and announcing their presence would be dangerous to\r\nthe officers executing the search warrant.\r\nFurthermore, this was not a spur of the moment decision by the\r\nexecuting officers.  The matter was submitted to the judgment of\r\na judicial officer who passed upon facts submitted, the existence\r\nof which has not been questioned. Under these circumstances the\r\nexecuting officers were clearly entitled to rely on the validity\r\nof the warrant.  See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).\r\nThus the evidence discovered in the apartment, including the\r\nammunition and the basement locker keys, was legally obtained and\r\ncould have been used by the government against Appellant at\r\ntrial, had one taken place.\r\n     B.  The Basement\r\nIt is now beyond cavil in this circuit that a tenant lacks a\r\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of an\r\napartment building.  See United States v. Cruz Pagn, 537 F.2d\r\n554, 557-58 (1st Cir. 1976). The unenclosed areas of the basement\r\nof this apartment building were such common areas.  See id. \r\nAppellant thus had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the\r\nbasement common area.  See United States v. Thornley, 707 F.2d\r\n622, 625 (1st Cir. 1983).\r\nOnce legally inside this area, the police had a right to perceive\r\nwhatever was available to them through the use of their senses,\r\nincluding their common sense. Cf. Carroll v. United States, 267\r\nU.S. 132, 162 (1925) (probable cause is a flexible \"common sense\"\r\nstandard).  This exercise revealed, (1) that all the lockers were\r\nnumbered, except two; (2) that one of the two numbers missing\r\ncorresponded to Appellant's apartment number; (3) that the keys\r\nlegally obtained in Appellant's apartment fitted one of the\r\nunnumbered lockers, and thus that area was most likely  subject\r\nto his control; and (4) that the boxes that could be observed\r\nthrough the chicken wire most likely belonged to Appellant and\r\ncould contain additional evidence relevant to the subject of the\r\ncriminal investigation.\r\nProceeding with this information to seek a search warrant to\r\ninquire into the contents of the boxes was exactly what was\r\nappropriate under the circumstances of this case. The evidence\r\nuncovered as a result of this procedure was thus legally\r\nadmissible against Appellant.\r\nII.  Appellant's Attempted Withdrawal of Conditional Plea\r\nFour criteria have been established as determinative in\r\nconsidering motions to withdraw guilty pleas: (1) the\r\nplausibility of the reasons prompting the requested change of\r\nplea; (2) the existence or not of an assertion of innocence; (3)\r\nthe timing of the motion; and (4) whether, when viewed in the\r\nlight of emergent circumstances, the plea was knowing, voluntary,\r\nand intelligent, within what is mandated by Rule 11 of the\r\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. United States v. Muriel, 111\r\nF.3d 975, 977 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nAppellant does not claim any defect in the Rule 11 proceeding. \r\nThe colloquy shows that there was none.  Appellant was thoroughly\r\nquestioned by the trial judge without any coercion being apparent\r\nfrom the record or being claimed thereafter.  It further shows\r\nthat he clearly understood the charges against him, that he\r\nvoluntarily and intelligently admitted his guilt and the facts\r\nsufficient to support these charges, and that he understood the\r\nconsequences of these actions.\r\n Against this scenario, we have Appellant's claim, made 16 months\r\nafter he entered his plea and 9 months after he was sentenced,\r\nthat he was unaware of the firearms contained in one of the boxes\r\nfound in the basement, which according to this latest version,\r\nwere brought into his house by his former wife in 1993, and then\r\nstored in the basement.  To this, Appellant adds the insinuation\r\nthat the firearms were \"planted\" in these boxes by his former\r\nwife's police officer boyfriend.   \r\nFortunately, although perhaps less so for Appellant, we need not\r\nenter this potential morass.  Appellant seems to overlook that he\r\nwas charged and convicted under Count Two of the indictment for\r\nbeing a felon in possession of ammunition, in itself a violation\r\nof  922(g), independent of the charges contained in Count One. \r\nNone of his contentions affect his conviction on the second\r\ncount, because that count stemmed from the evidence seized in\r\nAppellant's apartment, and was not based upon evidence taken from\r\nhis storage locker.  Appellant's conviction on Count Two alone\r\nwould have been sufficient to support the sentence he received. \r\nFor this reason, all of the arguments raised as to Count One are,\r\nin fact, irrelevant.               \r\nThe district court did not exceed its discretion in denying\r\nAppellant's request to withdraw his conditional guilty plea.\r\nIII.  The Sentencing Non-Issues\r\nAppellant's main contention regarding his sentencing is his claim\r\nof improper inclusion of two state convictions as predicate\r\noffenses to establish that he qualified as a career armed\r\ncriminal subject to mandatory sentencing under the Armed Career\r\nCriminal Act (\"ACCA\"). 18 U.S.C.  924 et seq.\r\nIt is settled law in this circuit that authority interpreting the\r\nSentencing Guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence\",\r\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.2(1), is persuasive in interpreting the ACCA's\r\ndefinition of what constitutes a violent felony pursuant to \r\n924(e)(2)(B) of that statute, and vice versa.  See United Statesv. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 882-83 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.\r\nFiore, 983 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1992).  We have also unequivocally\r\nheld that conspiracy to commit a crime of violence, as defined in\r\nthe career offender guidelines, is itself a crime of violence for\r\npurposes of its treatment under the Guidelines.  Fiore, 983 F.2d\r\nat 3.  Considering that armed robbery is defined as a \"crime of\r\nviolence\" under ACCA, 18 U.S.C.  924(e)(2)(B), it is clear that\r\nthe district court committed no error in concluding that\r\nAppellant's conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery was\r\na qualifying predicate to his being sentenced under the mandatory\r\nminimum sentencing requirements of that statute. 18 U.S.C.  924\r\n(e)(1).\r\nBecause this conviction, in conjunction with Appellant's other\r\nconvictions for predicate offenses, is sufficient to qualify him\r\nas a career armed criminal under  924(e), \"we need go no\r\nfurther.\"\r\nThe district court committed no reversible error and Appellant's\r\nconviction is therefore affirmed.\r\n",

The evidence\r\nuncovered as a result of this procedure was thus legally\r\nadmissible against Appellant.\r\nII.  Appellant's Attempted Withdrawal of Conditional Plea\r\nFour criteria have been established as determinative in\r\nconsidering motions to withdraw guilty pleas: (1) the\r\nplausibility of the reasons prompting the requested change of\r\nplea; (2) the existence or not of an assertion of innocence; (3)\r\nthe timing of the motion; and (4) whether, when viewed in the\r\nlight of emergent circumstances, the plea was knowing, voluntary,\r\nand intelligent, within what is mandated by Rule 11 of the\r\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. United States v. Muriel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197340\"><a href=\"/opinion/197340/united-states-v-muriel/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nAppellant does not claim any defect in the Rule 11 proceeding. \r\nThe colloquy shows that there was none.  Appellant was thoroughly\r\nquestioned by the trial judge without any coercion being apparent\r\nfrom the record or being claimed thereafter.  It further shows\r\nthat he clearly understood the charges against him, that he\r\nvoluntarily and intelligently admitted his guilt and the facts\r\nsufficient to support these charges, and that he understood the\r\nconsequences of these actions.\r\n Against this scenario, we have Appellant's claim, made 16 months\r\nafter he entered his plea and 9 months after he was sentenced,\r\nthat he was unaware of the firearms contained in one of the boxes\r\nfound in the basement, which according to this latest version,\r\nwere brought into his house by his former wife in 1993, and then\r\nstored in the basement.  To this, Appellant adds the insinuation\r\nthat the firearms were \"planted\" in these boxes by his former\r\nwife's police officer boyfriend.   \r\nFortunately, although perhaps less so for Appellant, we need not\r\nenter this potential morass.  Appellant seems to overlook that he\r\nwas charged and convicted under Count Two of the indictment for\r\nbeing a felon in possession of ammunition, in itself a violation\r\nof  922(g), independent of the charges contained in Count One. \r\nNone of his contentions affect his conviction on the second\r\ncount, because that count stemmed from the evidence seized in\r\nAppellant's apartment, and was not based upon evidence taken from\r\nhis storage locker.  Appellant's conviction on Count Two alone\r\nwould have been sufficient to support the sentence he received. \r\nFor this reason, all of the arguments raised as to Count One are,\r\nin fact, irrelevant.               \r\nThe district court did not exceed its discretion in denying\r\nAppellant's request to withdraw his conditional guilty plea.\r\nIII.  The Sentencing Non-Issues\r\nAppellant's main contention regarding his sentencing is his claim\r\nof improper inclusion of two state convictions as predicate\r\noffenses to establish that he qualified as a career armed\r\ncriminal subject to mandatory sentencing under the Armed Career\r\nCriminal Act (\"ACCA\"). 18 U.S.C.  924 et seq.\r\nIt is settled law in this circuit that authority interpreting the\r\nSentencing Guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence\",\r\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.2(1), is persuasive in interpreting the ACCA's\r\ndefinition of what constitutes a violent felony pursuant to \r\n924(e)(2)(B) of that statute, and vice versa.

We have also unequivocally\r\nheld that conspiracy to commit a crime of violence, as defined in\r\nthe career offender guidelines, is itself a crime of violence for\r\npurposes of its treatment under the Guidelines.  Fiore, 983 F.2d\r\nat 3.  Considering that armed robbery is defined as a \"crime of\r\nviolence\" under ACCA, 18 U.S.C.  924(e)(2)(B), it is clear that\r\nthe district court committed no error in concluding that\r\nAppellant's conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery was\r\na qualifying predicate to his being sentenced under the mandatory\r\nminimum sentencing requirements of that statute. 18 U.S.C.  924\r\n(e)(1).\r\nBecause this conviction, in conjunction with Appellant's other\r\nconvictions for predicate offenses, is sufficient to qualify him\r\nas a career armed criminal under  924(e), \"we need go no\r\nfurther.\"\r\nThe district court committed no reversible error and Appellant's\r\nconviction is therefore affirmed.\r\n</pre>",
