Defendants-appellants\n\nchallenge the district court judgment granting plaintiffs-appellees\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.           See Aponte v. Calderón, 176 F.\n\nSupp.   2d   135   (D.P.R.    2001).     Plaintiffs-appellees   originally\n\nbrought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Independent\n\nCitizens' Commission to Evaluate Government Transactions (\"Blue\n\nRibbon Commission\" or \"Commission\"), which was created by appellant\n\nSila M. Calderón through an executive order.           They alleged, inter\n\nalia, that the Commission violated appellees' rights to due process\n\nof law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution.         The district court agreed and entered a\n\npermanent injunction forbidding the Commission from engaging in\nfuture investigations without instituting trial-type procedures.\nBecause we find that the Commission's investigation implicates no\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty or property interest of the\nappellees, we reverse the district court's grant of injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief.\n\n                          I. Factual Background\n\nA.   The Creation and Structure of the Blue Ribbon Commission\n\n             Appellant Sila María Calderón was elected Governor of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico in November 2000. Shortly after taking\noffice in January 2001, she promulgated Executive Order No. 2001-06\n(\"Order\").     The Order states that there is a \"pressing need\" to\n\nmake \"proper and efficient use of public resources\" and to complete\n\"the total erradication [sic] of government corruption.\"                 To\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffurther that effort, the Order creates the \"Independent Citizens'\n\nCommission to Evaluate Government Transactions . . . for the\n\npurpose of evaluating significant government transactions.\"\n           The Order gives the Blue Ribbon Commission the power to\n\nevaluate transactions accomplished by the executive branch of the\n\nPuerto   Rican   government.         These    transactions     may   have   been\ncompleted by either the current or previous administrations and\n\nmust \"have the potential of substantially impacting on areas such\n\nas the government's structure, the public treasury, the country's\n\neconomy and infrastructure, or the citizenry's trust in government\n\ninstitutions.\"    To further these evaluations, the Order gives the\n\nCommission the authority to request information from natural and\n\nartificial persons, to require the assistance of the executive\nbranch, and to issue reports to the Governor, including both the\n\nfindings of any investigation and any recommendations.                      These\n\nrecommendations may include the adoption of \"new statutory or\nregulatory rules,\" the modification of existing rules, and further\n\nproceedings, either administrative, civil, or criminal, against\n\ncertain persons. The Order also provides that the Commission shall\n\noperate with strict confidentiality.               Only the Governor has the\n\npower to publicize the findings, recommendations, or evidence\n\ncollected by the Commission.\n\n           The   Governor     also   has     the   exclusive   power   to    name\n\nCommission   members.   She    originally      appointed    appellants      David\n\nNoriega-Rodríguez, Ileana Colón-Carlo, Carmen Rita Vélez-Borrás,\n\nPedro Galarza, and Pedro López-Oliver.             Noriega-Rodríguez was made\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fChairperson.       Galarza and López-Oliver have both resigned from the\n\nCommission, and appellant Angel Hermida replaced López-Oliver.1\n\n            The Commission has the power to adopt internal operating\nrules.   Pursuant to that power, the Commission promulgated both\n\nOperating By-Laws (\"By-Laws\") and Guidelines for Investigation and\n\nDrafting of Reports (\"Guidelines\").                 Only the By-Laws were made\npublic by the Commission.           The unpublished Guidelines, however,\n\nprovide most of the substantive procedures that the Commission and\n\nits staff     follow    in    conducting       their      investigations.2      These\n\nprocedures    include     the    ability       of   the    Commission    to   request\n\nofficers of the executive branch to secure the appearance and\n\ntestimony     of    reluctant      witnesses,          using   appropriate      legal\n\nmechanisms.    During interviews, the Commissioners or their staff\nmay record testimony in a variety of ways, including handwritten\n\nnotes.   Witnesses are not allowed to take notes, record their\n\ntestimony,    or     obtain     copies   of     their      statements.        This   is\nostensibly to protect the confidentiality of the Commission's\n\ninvestigations.        Those witnesses who are not considered suspects\n\nare not allowed to have an attorney present.                       However, those\n\nwitnesses who are suspected of violating laws or regulations of a\n\n1\n    Adolfo Krans, Governor Calderón's husband, is the final\nappellant.     Appellees originally sued Krans, the conjugal\npartnership of Krans and Governor Calderón, the various unnamed\nspouses of the Commission members, their conjugal partnerships, and\nseveral additional unnamed defendants.\n2\n  The district court published           the Guidelines by attaching a copy\nto its opinion. See Aponte v.             Calderón, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 168-\n172. Before this publication,            the Guidelines had never been made\npublic. Indeed, the fact that            these procedures existed had never\nbeen made public.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fpenal nature are to be advised of their constitutional rights,\n\nincluding their right against forced self-incrimination.                           The\n\nGuidelines also require Commissioners to report any evidence that\ncreates more than a mere suspicion of criminal activity.                           The\n\nCommission, once it has verified such evidence, may refer the\n\nmatter to the Puerto Rican Department of Justice.\n            It is also important to note what powers the Blue Ribbon\n\nCommission    does     not   have.      It     does    not   have    the   power    to\n\nindependently        initiate    or     file     any     civil,      criminal,      or\n\nadministrative charges.         It can only recommend that other agencies\n\ndo so. Most importantly, the Commission cannot adjudicate criminal\n\nliability or make probable cause determinations.\n\nB.   The Investigations and Publication of Reports Relating to\n     Appellees\n\n             The Blue Ribbon Commission has completed reports on three\ntransactions.    Two of those are implicated in this case.                 The first\n\nconcerns the lease and purchase of a building, located at Barbosa\nAvenue 306, and an adjacent parking lot (\"Barbosa Report\").                         It\ndiscusses both appellees.             The second details the relationship\nbetween the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, the\n\nSolid   Waste    Authority,      and    the     Puerto       Rico   Infrastructure\nManagement Group, Inc., a private entity (\"PRIME Report\").                          It\n\ndiscusses     only    appellee    Daniel       Pagán.        The    district   court\nconcluded, after holding a hearing, that both reports \"find that\nthere is probable cause to believe that violations of Puerto Rico\n\ncriminal law have occurred.\"           Aponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 144.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            Both plaintiffs-appellees served as high-ranking Puerto\n\nRican officials under former Governor Pedro Rosselló.                      Appellee\n\nJorge E. Aponte was Director of the Office of Management and\nBudget.   Appellee Daniel Pagán was Secretary of the Department of\n\nNatural and Environmental Resources.             Both Aponte and Pagán held\n\ntheir positions in the Puerto Rican government until December 31,\n2000, when Governor Rosselló's term ended.\n\n            The Commission interviewed appellee Aponte on April 19,\n\n2001, regarding the Barbosa transaction.               This interview occurred\n\nafter   Aponte    received    a   letter   at    his    home,       requesting   his\n\nappearance at a hearing. Originally, the hearing was scheduled for\n\nMarch 29, 2001, but Aponte did not attend due to his concerns about\n\nthe   Commission.     Instead,     he    hand-delivered         a    letter,    which\nrequested a copy of the Commission's by-laws, the subject matter of\n\nthe hearing, an opinion letter by the Puerto Rican Secretary of\n\nJustice explaining the legal basis for the Commission to compel\nwitnesses    to   attend     hearings,     and    any    information       on     the\n\nappointment of counsel to assist him at the hearing.                       When he\n\ndelivered the letter, the Commission's staff informed Aponte that\n\nhe was not entitled to appointment of counsel.                      He subsequently\n\nreceived a copy of the Order, the By-Laws, and a letter explaining\n\nthat the Commission was interested in his involvement in the\n\nBarbosa transaction.       The letter also rescheduled the hearing for\n\nApril 19.\n\n            Aponte attended the hearing on April 19, based in part on\n\nthe assurances of the Commission's staff that his testimony was\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fneeded only to authenticate certain documents.               He did not believe\n\nthat he, himself, was under investigation for misconduct, and while\n\nhe knew that his attendance at the hearing was not required by law,\nhe believed that the Commission would draw negative inferences\n\nshould he refuse to attend.          Aponte also concluded, based on his\n\nreading of the Order and the By-Laws, that the Commission could\nrequire him to appear under compulsion of legal process should he\n\nrefuse to attend voluntarily.\n\n           At the hearing, Aponte objected to the Commission as\n\nunconstitutional. He asked to take notes of the proceedings and to\n\nhave a copy of the investigators' notes, but these requests were\n\ndenied.    Aponte    rejected      the    Commission's      request   to    have   a\n\nstenographer   record       the   interview.      At   no    point    during     the\ninterview did anyone advise Aponte of any constitutional rights.\n\n           Appellee Pagán was interviewed on April 25, 2001, after\n\nan armed agent of the Puerto Rico Department of Justice Special\nInvestigations Bureau (\"NIE\")3 delivered a summons to Pagán's home.\n\nAfter receiving the summons, Pagán informed the Commission that he\n\nwas willing to cooperate, despite his belief that the Commission\n\ndid not have the power to compel his appearance.                However, Pagán\n\nalso believed,      based    on   his    former   experiences,       that   he   was\n\n\"required\" to appear, although not under legal compulsion. He knew\n\nof individuals who had failed to cooperate with NIE investigations\n\nand had been subject to formal actions.\n\n\n\n3\n    NIE is the Spanish acronym.\n\n                                         -7-\n\f          Like his fellow appellee, Pagán was interviewed regarding\n\nthe Barbosa transaction.            At the time of his interview, the\n\nCommission     did    not   suspect     Pagán    of   any   criminal    conduct,\ntherefore, the Commission did not inform Pagán of any rights that\n\nmight have attached had he been a suspect. He requested permission\n\nto record or take notes during the hearing, but the Commission\ndenied both requests.           The Commission's staff did take written\n\nnotes on both Pagán's oral testimony and documentary evidence.\n\n          On May 9, 2001, Governor Calderón, accompanied by some of\n\nthe Commissioners, held a press conference at which she discussed\n\nthe Commission's findings and released copies of the Barbosa\n\nReport.      The Governor subsequently referred the matter to the\n\nPuerto Rican Secretary of Justice.              The district court found that\nthe report accuses both appellees of criminal misconduct (although\n\nthe report itself does not speak in terms of crimes or criminal\n\nstatutes).      The    report    also   contains      extensive   analysis   and\nconclusions     regarding     the     transaction's     utility   and    wisdom,\n\ndiscusses specific mistakes, and recommends improvements so that\n\nsimilar mistakes do not occur in the future.\n\n             At the time of the press conference, neither appellee had\n\nreceived a copy of the Barbosa Report nor been given an opportunity\n\nto respond to any charges contained in the report.                 Pagán later\n\nobtained a copy of the Barbosa Report, but he could not review the\n\nevidence relied upon by the Commission (which had been attached to\n\nthe report submitted to the Governor).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            The    Commission,      as   part   of   a   later      investigation,\n\nsummoned Pagán to appear at a second hearing, which was to cover\n\nthe remodeling of the Barbosa building and a contract between PRIME\nand the Solid Waste Authority.            Pagán chose not to appear at this\n\nhearing.\n\n            A few months later, the Commission finished the PRIME\nReport and delivered it to the Governor.                  As with the Barbosa\n\nreport,    the    Governor    and   several     Commissioners       held   a   press\n\nconference where the report and its findings were discussed.                       The\n\nPRIME Report concludes that Pagán \"improperly intervened\" in the\n\nbidding process of the transaction and that Pagán also caused\n\ncertain documents to \"disappear,\" requiring the awarded bid to be\n\nannulled.        It also contains a lengthy analysis of the entire\ntransaction and recommendations for future improvements.                       Again,\n\nGovernor    Calderón    forwarded        the   report    to   the    Puerto    Rican\n\nSecretary of Justice for further investigation and proceedings.                      A\nsecond PRIME report was later delivered to Governor Calderón, who,\n\nin turn, referred it to the Secretary of Justice.\n\n                        II.    Procedural Background\n\n            The district court decided this case after holding a\n\nhearing    and    entertaining      various     dispositive      motions      by   the\nparties. The issues raised in these various motions included: (1)\nwhether appellees had stated a valid due process claim; (2) whether\n\nappellants are protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity; (3)\nwhether Governor Calderón is entitled to absolute immunity; (4)\n\nwhether appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction should be\n\n                                         -9-\n\fgranted; and (5) whether the district court should decline to\n\nexercise jurisdiction over appellees' state-law claims.\n\n            On November 6-8, 2001, the district court held a hearing.\nThis hearing was originally scheduled to address appellees' motion\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.         To prepare for that hearing, the\n\ndistrict court issued an order, dated October 16, 2001, advising\nthe parties which issues the court expected to cover in the\n\nhearing.    The court outlined the final issue as follows:             \"What\n\nother evidence, aside from that properly submitted in a preliminary\n\ninjunction hearing, do the parties expect that they would present\n\nif the case were to be tried on the merits?          See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n65(a)(2).\"4    At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court\n\nstated, \"I think that there is no reason why I should not give a\nfinal adjudication. . . .      That's exactly what I intend to do under\n\nRule 65.\"     Neither party objected.\n\n            Thereafter, on November 29, 2001, the district court\nissued the decision that is the subject of this appeal.               After\n\ndeciding that the case was ripe and not an appropriate case for\n\nabstention, the court held that (1) Governor Calderón is not\n\nentitled to absolute immunity; (2) appellants are not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity; (3) the Commission violated appellees' rights\n\nto procedural due process, entitling appellees to injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory    relief;   and   (4)   the    Commission   did   not   violate\n\n4\n   Rule 65(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides,\nin relevant part: \"Before or after the commencement of the hearing\nof an application for a preliminary injunction, the court may order\nthe trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and\nconsolidated with the hearing of the application.\"\n\n                                     -10-\n\fappellees' right to freedom of association or to equal protection\n\nof the laws.    The court did not decide the state-law issues raised\n\nin appellees' complaint or determine damages.\n\n                            III.   Discussion\n\n           Appellants challenge the district court's decision on\n\nseveral grounds.      First, they raise a procedural issue as to the\n\ncourt's invocation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.           Second,\n\nthey contest the court's substantive decision that the Commission\n\nviolated appellees' due process rights.           Third, they argue that\n\nGovernor Calderón is entitled to absolute immunity regarding her\nestablishment of the Blue Ribbon Commission through an executive\n\norder.     Fourth,    appellants   argue   that    they   are   entitled   to\nqualified immunity.     We address each in turn.\n\nA.    Rule 65(a)(2)\n\n            The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a court to\nconsolidate a preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the\n\nmerits.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2).          However, the court must\nprovide the parties with \"'clear and unambiguous notice'\" of its\nintent to consolidate.      Univ. of Tex. v. Camenish, 451 U.S. 390,\n\n395 (1981) (quoting Pughsley v. 3750 Lake Shore Drive Coop. Bldg.,\n\n463 F.2d 1055, 1057 (7th Cir. 1972)).        This notice must be given\n\nsufficiently early to allow the parties time to assemble and\n\npresent their evidence.     Id.    However, any right to object to the\n\ncourt's timeliness in giving notice will be lost if a party does\n\nnot    object   contemporaneously     with   the     court's     notice    of\n\nconsolidation. K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907,\n\n                                   -11-\n\f913 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that appellant waived its right to\n\ncomplain when the court announced its intention to consolidate\n\nduring the second day of a preliminary injunction hearing and\nappellant failed to object).\n\n            Here, the record is clear.          The district court signaled\n\nthe    possibility    that    it    might     consolidate   the   preliminary\ninjunction hearing with a trial on the merits in its order dated\n\nOctober 16, 2001.      While this first notice is arguably ambiguous,\n\nwe need not stop there.            At the end of the hearing, the court\n\nannounced, unambiguously, that it would consolidate under Rule 65.\n\nAppellants   failed    to    object   at     either   juncture,   consequently\n\nwaiving their right to raise this issue now. Therefore, we proceed\n\nto the merits of the case.\n\nB.    The Merits\n\n            After the consolidated trial on the merits, the district\ncourt granted a permanent injunction forbidding appellants from\n\"holding investigative hearings without affording individuals under\n\ninvestigation      substantial     opportunity    to    defend,   among   other\nrights, the right to present testimonial and documentary evidence\non their behalf and to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\"\n\nAponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 165.             Appellants contest the district\ncourt's decision, and we agree that the district court erred in\nconcluding that these actions provide a basis for the issuance of\n\nthe injunction.\n           Generally, we review a grant of a permanent injunction\n\nfor abuse of discretion, A.W. Chesterton Co. v. Chesterton, 128\n\n                                      -12-\n\fF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997), but we always review questions of law de\n\nnovo.   Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270 F.3d 17,\n\n22 (1st Cir. 2001).    We review factual findings for clear error.\nSee Water Keepers Alliance v. United States Dep't of Def., 271 F.2d\n\n21, 30 (1st Cir. 2001) (applying clearly erroneous standard to\n\nreview of factual findings).\n            In order to grant a permanent injunction, the court must\n\nfind four elements: (1) plaintiffs prevail on the merits; (2)\n\nplaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury without an injunction;\n\n(3) the harm to plaintiffs would exceed the harm to defendants from\n\nthe imposition of an injunction; and (4) the public interest would\n\nnot be adversely affected by an injunction. United States v. Mass.\n\nWater Res. Auth., 256 F.3d 36, 51 n.15 (1st Cir. 2001).            While\nappellants challenge the district court's determination on all four\n\nprongs, we find the first dispositive and, therefore, decline to\n\naddress the others.\n            Here, the district court found that appellees prevailed\n\non the merits of their procedural due process claim.         Aponte, 176\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 155-63.    A threshold requirement for a successful\n\nprocedural due process claim is to demonstrate the implication of\n\na   constitutionally   protected    interest   in   life,   liberty,   or\n\nproperty.   Romero-Barceló v. Hernández-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 32 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n            Appellees argue that two separate liberty or property\n\ninterests trigger due process protections in this case.           First,\n\nthey assert a right to be free from criminal investigation and\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fprosecution.       Second,    they     maintain    that    the    Puerto   Rican\n\nConstitution     establishes     a     protected     liberty      interest    in\n\nreputation.     We address each of these arguments in turn.\n\n           1.    Interest in being free from criminal investigation\n                  and prosecution\n\n           The district court concluded that appellees \"have a\n\nfundamental, constitutionally protected liberty interest in being\n\nfree from investigation and prosecution for criminal offenses in a\n\nmanner that tramples upon the procedural protections afforded by\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\"           Aponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 156.          To\n\nsupport this conclusion, the court looked to Jenkins v. McKeithen,\n395 U.S.   411    (1969),    which    it   determined     governs   this    case.\nAponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 160.               We disagree and hold that\n\nappellees have asserted no constitutionally protected interest\nbecause there has been no adjudication of criminal liability or of\nappellees' legal rights.\n\n           In Jenkins, a plurality of the Supreme Court held that\n\nthe subject of a public investigation carried out by the Labor-\nManagement Commission of Inquiry (\"Louisiana Commission\") stated a\nvalid due process claim when he challenged the procedures of the\n\nLouisiana Commission.       395 U.S. at 431.      A key finding on which the\nplurality relied is that the Louisiana Commission was \"empowered to\n\nbe used and allegedly [was] used to find named individuals guilty\nof violating the criminal laws.\"             Id. at 428.         Therefore, the\nLouisiana Commission \"exercise[d] a function very much akin to\n\nmaking an official adjudication of criminal culpability.\"                  Id. at\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f427.    This finding distinguishes Jenkins from the earlier case of\n\nHannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420 (1960).\n\n             Hannah    addressed    whether      due    process    rights        were\nimplicated by public investigations of the Civil Rights Commission.\n\nThis commission had been charged by Congress with investigating\n\nallegations of voting deprivations.               Id. at 421-23.          Several\ncitizens, called as witnesses by the commission, filed suit to\n\nenjoin the investigation, alleging infringements of their due\n\nprocess rights.5       Id. at 423-30.     The Court began by noting that\n\nthe Civil Rights Commission \"does not adjudicate. It does not hold\n\ntrials or determine anyone's civil or criminal liability. . . .\n\nNor does it indict, punish, or impose any legal sanctions.\"                 Id. at\n\n441.    The Court then continued to explain that when there is no\nadjudication      of   legal   rights,   the    due    process   clause     is   not\n\nimplicated to the same degree:\n\n             [W]hen governmental agencies adjudicate or\n             make binding determinations which directly\n             affect the legal rights of individuals, it is\n             imperative that those agencies use the\n             procedures which have traditionally been\n             associated with the judicial process. On the\n             other hand, when governmental action does not\n             partake of an adjudication, as for example,\n             when a general fact-finding investigation is\n             being conducted, it is not necessary that the\n             full panoply of judicial procedures be used.\n\nId.    at   442   (emphasis    added).    The    Court    also    looked,    quite\n\nspecifically, at the use of other investigative bodies in our\n\n\n5\n  Specifically, the plaintiffs wanted to know on what charges they\nwere being investigated and on the basis of whose complaint. Id.\nat 441-42.   Plaintiffs also argued that they had the right to\ncross-examine the complainants and other adverse witnesses. Id.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fgovernment. It found a long history of fact-finding investigations\n\nthat used procedures similar to those employed by the Civil Rights\n\nCommission.      Id. at 443-52.    To stress this point, the Court went\nso far as to append an extensive list of various administrative\n\nagencies which conduct investigations without trial-like rights\n\nattaching.     Id. at 454-92.     Because the Court found that the Civil\nRights Commission was more like an investigative agency, it held\n\nthat the plaintiffs' due process rights had not been violated.\n\n              The Court has steadfastly maintained this distinction\n\nbetween general fact-finding investigations and adjudications of\n\nlegal rights.       It is precisely on this point that Jenkins turns.\n\nThere, the Court distinguished the Louisiana Commission from the\n\nCivil Rights Commission by saying:\n              We are not presented with a case in which any\n              injury to appellant is merely a collateral\n              consequence of the actions of an investigatory\n              body.   Rather, it is alleged that the very\n              purpose of the [Louisiana] Commission is to\n              find persons guilty of violating criminal laws\n              without trial or procedural safeguards, and to\n              publicize those findings.\n\n395 U.S. at 424 (emphasis added).              The Court noted that the\n\nLouisiana Commission was both required to make probable cause\n\nfindings and able to file charges against individuals. Id. at 416-\n\n17. Furthermore, the Louisiana Commission was \"concerned only with\n\nexposing violations of criminal laws by specific individuals.\" Id.\n\nat 427.   These specific characteristics of the commission made it\n\nmore   like    an   adjudicatory    body    than   an   investigatory   body.\n\nTherefore, due process rights attached.\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f            In contrast, it is clear that investigations conducted by\n\nadministrative agencies, even when they may lead to criminal\n\nprosecutions, do not trigger due process rights.                    In SEC v. Jerry\n\nT. O’Brien, Inc., 467 U.S. 735 (1984), the Court considered a\n\nchallenge    to    a    private      SEC    investigation.6         The   plaintiffs\n\nchallenged the ability of the SEC to issue third-party subpoenas\nwithout informing the parties under investigation. The Court, once\n\nagain,    looked       to     the    difference      between   adjudication        and\n\ninvestigation:         \"the Due Process Clause . . . is [not] offended\n\nwhen a federal administrative agency, without notifying a person\n\nunder investigation, uses its subpoena power to gather evidence\n\nadverse to him.         The Due Process Clause is not implicated under\n\nsuch     circumstances         because      an     administrative     investigation\nadjudicates no legal rights.\"               Id. at 742.   The key distinction is\n\nthat the SEC investigated whether violations of various securities\n\nlaws may have occurred, not whether plaintiffs should be held\nlegally responsible for any such violations.                For plaintiffs to be\n\nheld legally responsible, they would have to be found guilty after\na formal adjudication, during which full due process rights would\n\nattach.\n\n            To    the       extent   that    the    district   court      found   that\n\nappellees have a constitutionally protected interest in being free\n\n6\n   Because the SEC conducted a private investigation, Jerry T.\nO'Brien bears a close resemblance to this case, where the\nCommission's investigations are conducted confidentially. However,\nthe parallel is not complete. In Jerry T. O'Brien, it is unclear\nwhether the SEC had the power to make the results of its\ninvestigation public. Here, the Commission's findings have been\nmade public by Governor Calderón.\n\n                                           -17-\n\ffrom investigation, the court erred as a matter of law.            The\n\nforegoing discussion shows that investigations, alone, do not\n\ntrigger due process rights.       There must also be an adjudication.\nWithout an adjudication of legal rights, Hannah and Jerry T.\n\nO’Brien are clear: the Due Process Clause does not require that\n\n\"the full panoply of judicial procedures be used.\"         Hannah, 363\nU.S. at 442.\n\n          However, it is not clear whether the district court also\n\nfound that there was an adjudication of appellees' legal rights.\n\nAponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 156 (stating that appellees have an\n\ninterest in being free from both investigation and prosecution).\n\nWe know that the Blue Ribbon Commission investigates government\n\ntransactions in private, and, thereafter, makes a variety of\nrecommendations.    Included within those recommendations may be the\n\nsuggestion that criminal, civil, or administrative actions be\n\nbrought against certain individuals. In both the Barbosa and PRIME\nReports, the Commission recommended that further actions be taken\n\nagainst appellees.    The question, then, is whether the Commission\n\nhas   adjudicated    appellees'    legal   rights   in   making   these\n\nrecommendations.\n\n          The question of whether there has been an adjudication\n\ndoes not turn on the language of the Order or the Commission’s\n\nself-described role.    Rather, it is a functional question.        See\n\nCooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809, 815 (7th Cir. 1999) (holding that\n\nadministrative investigation into alleged civil rights violations\n\nwhich resulted in determination of whether there was \"substantial\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fevidence\"   on    which   to   proceed   was    a   functional   adjudication\n\nbecause, in event of negative determination, claimant could only\n\nappeal denial of claim to state supreme court).              If any action of\nthe Commission alters the appellees’ legal rights, then there has\n\nbeen an adjudication.      Hannah, 363 U.S. at 441; Cooper, 196 F.3d at\n\n815.\n            Without making an explicit finding, the district court\n\nsuggests that the Commission conducts adjudications because it\n\n\"makes   actual    findings    that   named    individuals    are   guilty   of\n\ncriminal violations as part of a process of criminal prosecution.\"\n\nAponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 161.          However, the court's findings as\n\nto the subsidiary facts belies the conclusion.                 See Alfaro De\n\nQuevedo v. De Jesús Schuck, 556 F.2d 591, 593 (1st Cir. 1977)\n(finding that factual findings which are internally inconsistent\n\nare clearly erroneous).        Additionally, our independent review of\n\nthe Barbosa and PRIME Reports shows that the district court's\nconclusion is clearly erroneous.7              See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)\n\n(establishing that factual findings \"shall not be set aside unless\n\nclearly erroneous\"); see also Water Keepers Alliance, 271 F.2d at\n\n30 (applying clearly erroneous standard in review of preliminary\n\ninjunction denial).\n\n            When the district court referred to the \"actual findings\"\n\nof criminal conduct, Aponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 161, it was\n\n\n7\n  The district court's conclusion could be characterized as either\na factual finding or a mixed question of fact and law. Since the\nfinding is clearly erroneous, it does not matter how we\ncharacterize it. Therefore, we decline to decide this issue.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fapparently referencing the probable cause determinations that the\n\ncourt found in the Barbosa and PRIME Reports.8             See id. at 144\n\n(\"probable cause to believe that violations of Puerto Rico criminal\nlaw have occurred\").     However, a close reading of the district\n\ncourt’s factual findings shows that the Commission does not make\n\nbinding probable cause determinations.             Rather, the Commission\nsimply recommends that individuals be investigated further.              The\n\ndistrict   court,   itself,   said    that   the   Commission   only   makes\n\n\"accusations of criminal misconduct.\"        Id. at 148.   Throughout its\n\ndiscussion, the district court said that the Barbosa and PRIME\n\nReports \"accuse\" appellees of crimes and that appellees \"are at\n\nrisk of prosecution.\"   See, e.g., id. at 157.        Furthermore, it also\n\nrecognized that appellees have not yet been indicted.           See id. at\n156 (noting that appellees \"have not yet been formally charged\").\n\nFinally, the district court observed that, \"the reports issued by\n\nthe Blue Ribbon Commission are not obligatory, and the Commission\ncan only offer recommendations that [Governor] Calderón refer a\n\nparticular matter to the Department of Justice for prosecution.\"\n\nId. at 160.   Therefore, it is unclear how the court concludes that\n\n\"[t]he Commission makes actual findings that named individuals are\n\nguilty of criminal violations as part of a process of criminal\n\nprosecution.\"   Id. at 161.     In fact, this finding is internally\n\ninconsistent with the numerous findings that the reports only\n\n\n8\n  We assume, arguendo, that determining probable cause could be an\nadjudication sufficient to trigger the due process clause. It is\nunnecessary to decide that question here because it is clear that\nthe Commission does not even make probable cause determinations.\n\n                                     -20-\n\faccuse appellees of criminal conduct and that the Commission's\n\nrecommendations are neither binding nor work as a formal indictment\n\nor charge against appellees.\n              The district court opinion is unclear on whether the\n\nBarbosa or PRIME Reports actually accuse appellees of specific\n\ncrimes.      See, e.g., id. at 157 (\"The Commission concluded that\n\n[appellee]      Pagán     had    committed        undue    intervention      in     the\n\nperformance        of   contracts,    bidding       procedures      or    government\n\noperations in violation of Section 4353a of the Penal Code . . .\n\n.\").      Therefore,      we    conducted    an    independent      review   of     the\n\nevidence.      We conclude that the reports do accuse appellees of\n\nmisconduct.        For example, the Barbosa Report finds, \"at the very\n\nleast [appellees] were grossly negligent.\"                  The PRIME Report says\nappellee Pagán \"improperly intervened\" in the bidding procedures\n\nand, in its most damning accusation, concludes that he \"ordered the\n\npresident of the bid board to cause the disappearance of the\ndocuments.\"        However, the reports never make reference to any\n\nprovisions of the Puerto Rican Penal Code.                     They never accuse\n\nappellees of specific criminal conduct.                  Furthermore, the reports\n\nare very clear that they only suggest referring the matters to\n\nvarious      administrative      departments       for    further   investigation.\n\nThere   is    no    specific    recommendation       that    either      appellee    be\n\nprosecuted, much less any finding of probable cause or actual\n\ninstitution of legal action against appellees.                      Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the reports make specific and\n\nbinding determinations of criminal conduct is clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fSee United States v. Ortiz, 177 F.3d 108, 109 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(holding that to the extent that a district court's findings are\n\ninconsistent with the uncontroverted evidence, they are clearly\nerroneous).\n\n            Additionally, the Order, By-Laws, and Guidelines are all\n\nexplicit that the Commission is not given the power to adjudicate\nlegal rights. The Commission cannot independently initiate or file\n\nany civil, criminal, or administrative charges.               Rather, the\n\nCommission is only given the power to make recommendations to the\n\nGovernor, who then makes her own determination about whether to\n\npursue further investigations.\n\n            Therefore, we find that the Commission did not and cannot\n\nadjudicate the legal rights of appellees or any other individual.\nThere is no adjudication, functional or otherwise.            Accordingly,\n\nthe Due Process Clause has not been triggered.\n\n            With this conclusion in mind, we would like to emphasize\nthe     district     court's   conclusion      that   appellees   \"have    a\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest in ensuring that the\n\nstate    acts   in   accordance   with   due   process   standards   in   the\n\nprosecution of [appellees].\"         Aponte, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 158\n\n(emphasis added).        The fact that the district court failed to\n\nconsider the difference between a prosecution and an investigation\n\ndoes not undercut this point.        If appellees are ever prosecuted,\n\nthey will be entitled to the full protections of the Due Process\n\nClause, just like any other individual.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f           2.   Interest in reputation\n\n           Appellees   assert   another   interest,   which   they   claim\n\nserves as a valid basis for their due process claim: a liberty\n\ninterest in their reputations.      However, Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S.\n\n693 (1976), held that damage to one's reputation alone does not\n\ntrigger the protections of the Due Process Clause.            Id. at 701.\n\nReputational harms must be attached to some other alteration in\n\nstatus in order to raise a valid due process claim.      Id. at 711-12.\n\nAppellees claim to satisfy this requirement by invoking the Puerto\n\nRican Constitution.     While the Puerto Rican Constitution does\ninclude a specific protection for reputation, see P.R. Const. art.\n\nII, § 8, we conclude that the Puerto Rican courts have not afforded\ngreater protections to reputation than stateside jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, there is no indication that appellees have lost any\n\nlegal rights because of the alleged defamation by government\nactors.   Since appellees can point to no alteration in their legal\nstatus attached to any reputational injury, we hold that appellees\n\nhave not asserted a constitutionally protected interest in their\nreputations.\n           Paul is very clear.    There must be a legal alteration in\n\nplaintiff's position before the courts will recognize a procedural\ndue process claim:\n           It is apparent from our decisions that there\n           exists a variety of interests which are\n           difficult of definition but are nevertheless\n           comprehended within the meaning of either\n           \"liberty\" or \"property\" as meant in the Due\n           Process Clause. These interests attain this\n           constitutional status by virtue of the fact\n\n                                  -23-\n\f              that they have been initially recognized and\n              protected by state law, and we have repeatedly\n              ruled that the procedural guarantees of the\n              Fourteenth Amendment apply whenever the State\n              seeks to remove or significantly alter that\n              protected status.\n\nPaul,   424    U.S.   at    710-11.       The   fact   that   a   state    accords\nprotections to one's reputation by allowing one to bring a tort\n\naction does not create a legal status which is altered when the\n\nstate is the alleged defamer.            Id. at 711-12.\n\n              The question presented here is whether the fact that\n\nPuerto Rico enshrines protection for reputation in its constitution\n\ncreates a legal status which is altered when the Puerto Rican\n\ngovernment allegedly defames one of its citizens. While this issue\nhas arisen before, we have never had to decide it.                    See, e.g.,\n\nRomero-Barceló, 75 F.3d at 33.\n\n              Based on the Supreme Court's decision in Paul, we have\nconsistently      held     that   \"the    injury   to    reputation       must    be\n\naccompanied by a change in the injured person's status or rights\n\n(under substantive state or federal law).\"               Beitzell v. Jeffrey,\n\n643 F.2d 870, 878 (1st Cir. 1981); see also Brennan v. Hendrigan,\n\n888 F.2d 189, 195 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"reputational injury must\n\ncoincide with some other 'alteration of status'\" (citing Paul, 424\n\nU.S. at 709-10)).        We have termed this a \"defamation-plus\" test.\n\nCelia v. O'Malley, 918 F.2d 1017, 1021 (1st Cir. 1990).                          One\n\nexample of a successful \"defamation-plus\" claim is an allegation\n\nthat a stigmatization has occurred in connection with a termination\n\nin employment.        See Brennan, 888 F.2d at 196.               Appellees have\n\nasserted nothing similar to this traditional \"plus\" factor.\n\n                                         -24-\n\f          Instead, they rely only on the assertion that Puerto Rico\n\nlaw creates a different regime.   We have suggested that state law\n\nmay broaden the liberty interests accorded due process protections.\nSee Silva v. Worden, 130 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that\n\nMassachusetts \"may have a slightly broader conception of the\n\nliberty interests protected by due process\").     Therefore, it is\nconceivable that Puerto Rican law could accord a protected liberty\n\ninterest in reputation without appellees needing to allege an\n\nadditional deprivation.\n\n          The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has made clear that Puerto\n\nRico's Constitution provides sweeping human rights protections:\n\n\"Our Constitution recognizes and grants some fundamental rights\n\nwith a more global and protective vision than does the United\nStates Constitution.\"     López Vives v. Police of P.R., 18 P.R.\n\nOffic. Trans. 264, 273 (1987).        Furthermore, the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution should be construed broadly in regard to these rights.\nId.   Despite these broad human rights protections, it does not\n\nnecessarily follow that the Puerto Rican law protects reputation so\n\nbroadly as to make it a protected liberty interest under the United\n\nStates Constitution. To evaluate this question, it is necessary to\n\nlook more closely at the protections Puerto Rico provides.\n\n          Puerto Rico law creates a right of action for defamation\n\nand libel in three separate sources.   See Giménez Alvarez v. Silén\n\nMaldonado, 131 P.R. Dec. 91, 97-98 (1992).      First, Article II,\n\nsection 8 of the Puerto Rico Constitution provides, \"Every person\n\nhas the right to the protection of law against abusive attacks on\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fhis honor, reputation and private or family life.\"                This provision\n\nprovides a right of action without enabling legislation.                 Porto v.\n\nBentley P.R., Inc., 132 P.R. Dec. 331, 343 (1992).                    Second, the\nLibel and Slander Act of 1902 provides a right of action.                        32\n\nL.P.R.A. §§ 3141-49. This act draws from the common law tradition,\n\nPorto,    132   P.R.   Dec.   at    344    n.8,   and   has    been   modified   by\npronouncements of the United States Supreme Court. See id. at 344-\n\n46.    Third, there is a statutory right drawn from the Civil Code.\n\n31 L.P.R.A. § 5141; see also Giménez Alvarez, 131 P.R. Dec. at 98.\n\n            In interpreting these various sources of law, the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court has explicitly said that Puerto Rico law on\n\nlibel and slander follows the common law tradition. Villanueva v.\n\nHernández Class, 28 P.R. Offic. Trans. 618, 128 P.R. Dec. 618, 646\n(1991) (\"Our libel and slander law -- which follows the Anglo-Saxon\n\ncommon law . . . .\").     Beyond this overt acknowledgment, the Puerto\n\nRico     courts   frequently        cite     stateside    jurisdictions       when\ninterpreting their laws protecting personal reputation. See, e.g.,\n\nPorto, 132 P.R. Dec. at 349; Villanueva, 128 P.R. Dec. at 647-48;\n\nGonzález Martínez v. López, 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 229, 236 (1987).\n\nTherefore, as currently developed by Puerto Rican courts, there is\n\nnothing that suggests that we should treat the protections accorded\n\nto reputation by Puerto Rico any more broadly than those granted in\n\nother United States jurisdictions.\n\n            Since the law in Puerto Rico appears to be no different,\n\nfunctionally,     from    the      general    common     law    protections      for\n\nreputation, we cannot credit appellees' argument that reputation\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\falone, in    Puerto   Rico,    rises       to    a    liberty    interest    accorded\n\nindependent protection under the Due Process Clause of the United\n\nStates   Constitution.         Therefore,            appellees     have   failed    to\ndemonstrate a protected liberty interest in their reputation.\n\n            3. Appropriateness of injunctive and declaratory relief\n\n            Based on the foregoing discussion, it is clear that\n\nappellees have failed to assert any protected interest in life,\n\nliberty, or property that would trigger the protections of the Due\n\nProcess Clause.    In holding otherwise, the district court erred.\n\nConsequently, the district court abused its discretion when it\nissued the permanent injunction.\n\n            The district court also entered a declaratory judgment\nthat \"the procedures employed by the Blue Ribbon Commission in the\ninvestigation of public corruption are fundamentally unfair and\n\ncontravene   the   requisites        of    the   due     process    clause    of   the\nFourteenth Amendment.\"        As this judgment was based on the finding\nthat appellees succeeded on the merits of their due process claim,\n\nthe district court also erred in awarding declaratory relief.\n\nD.   Absolute and Qualified Immunity\n\n            Because appellees’ federal claims fail on the merits, we\n\nsee no need to probe whether, or to what extent, the appellants may\n\nbe immune from damages.\n\n                               IV.    Conclusion\n\n            Pursuant to the above discussion, we vacate the permanent\ninjunction and reverse the declaratory judgment issued against\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\fdefendants-appellants.     Finally, we remand to the district court\n\nwith   instructions   to   enter   judgment   in   favor   of   defendants-\n\nappellants on the due process claim and to dismiss the remaining\nstate law claims.\n\n           Vacated, reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f",

Calder&#243;n,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d 135 (D.P.R.2001). Plaintiffs-appellees originally brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Independent Citizens' Commission to Evaluate Government Transactions (\"Blue Ribbon Commission\" or \"Commission\"), which was created by appellant Sila M. Calder&#243;n through an executive order. They alleged, inter alia, that the Commission violated appellees' rights to due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The district court agreed and entered a permanent injunction forbidding the Commission from engaging in future investigations without instituting trial-type procedures. Because we find that the Commission's investigation implicates no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest of the appellees, we reverse the district court's grant of injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Creation and Structure of the Blue Ribbon Commission</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Sila Mar&#237;a Calder&#243;n was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in November 2000. Shortly after taking office in January 2001, she promulgated Executive Order No. 2001-06 (\"Order\"). The Order states that there is a \"pressing need\" to make \"proper and efficient use of public resources\" and to complete \"the total erradication [sic] of government corruption.\" To further that effort, the Order creates the \"Independent Citizens' Commission to Evaluate Government Transactions ... for the purpose of evaluating significant government transactions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Order gives the Blue Ribbon Commission the power to evaluate transactions accomplished by the executive branch of the Puerto Rican government. These transactions may have been completed by either the current or previous administrations and must \"have the potential of substantially impacting on areas such as the government's structure, the public treasury, the country's economy and infrastructure, or the citizenry's trust in government institutions.\" To further these evaluations, the Order gives the Commission the authority to request information from natural and artificial persons, to require the assistance of the executive branch, and to issue reports to the Governor, including both the findings of any investigation and any recommendations. These recommendations may include the adoption of \"new statutory or regulatory rules,\" the modification of existing rules, and further proceedings, either administrative, civil, or criminal, against certain persons. The Order also provides that the Commission shall operate with strict confidentiality. Only the Governor has the power to publicize the findings, recommendations, or evidence collected by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Governor also has the exclusive power to name Commission members. She originally appointed appellants David Noriega-Rodr&#237;guez, Ileana Col&#243;n-Carlo, Carmen Rita V&#233;lez-Borr&#225;s, Pedro Galarza, and Pedro L&#243;pez-Oliver. Noriega-Rodr&#237;guez was made Chairperson. Galarza and L&#243;pez-Oliver have both resigned from the Commission, and appellant Angel Hermida replaced L&#243;pez-Oliver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has the power to adopt internal operating rules. Pursuant to that power, the Commission promulgated both Operating By-Laws (\"By-Laws\") and Guidelines for Investigation and Drafting of Reports (\"Guidelines\"). Only the By-Laws were made public by the Commission. The unpublished Guidelines, however, provide most of the substantive procedures that the Commission and its staff follow in conducting their investigations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> These procedures include the ability of the Commission to request officers of the executive branch to secure the appearance and testimony of reluctant witnesses, using appropriate legal mechanisms. During interviews, the Commissioners or their staff may record testimony in a variety of ways, including handwritten notes. Witnesses are not allowed to take notes, record their testimony, or obtain copies of their statements. This is ostensibly to protect the confidentiality of the Commission's investigations. Those witnesses who are not considered suspects are not allowed to have an attorney present. However, those witnesses who are suspected of violating laws or regulations of a penal nature are to be advised of their constitutional rights, including their right against forced self-incrimination. The Guidelines also require Commissioners to report any evidence that creates more than a mere suspicion of criminal activity. The Commission, once it has verified such evidence, may refer the matter to the Puerto Rican Department of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also important to note what powers the Blue Ribbon Commission does not have. It does not have the power to independently initiate or file any civil, criminal, or administrative charges. It can only recommend that other agencies do so. Most importantly, the Commission cannot adjudicate criminal liability or make probable cause determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Investigations and Publication of Reports Relating to Appellees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Blue Ribbon Commission has completed reports on three transactions. Two of those are implicated in this case. The first concerns the lease and purchase of a building, located at Barbosa Avenue 306, and an adjacent parking lot (\"Barbosa Report\"). It discusses both appellees. The second details the relationship between the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, the Solid Waste Authority, and the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Management Group, Inc., a private entity (\"PRIME Report\"). It discusses only appellee Daniel Pag&#225;n. The district court concluded, after holding a hearing, that both reports \"find that there is probable cause to believe that violations of Puerto Rico criminal law have occurred.\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both plaintiffs-appellees served as high-ranking Puerto Rican officials under former Governor Pedro Rossell&#243;. Appellee Jorge E. Aponte was Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Appellee Daniel Pag&#225;n was Secretary of the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. Both Aponte and Pag&#225;n held their positions in the Puerto Rican government until December 31, 2000, when Governor Rossell&#243;'s term ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission interviewed appellee Aponte on April 19, 2001, regarding the Barbosa transaction. This interview occurred after Aponte received a letter at his home, requesting his appearance at a hearing. Originally, the hearing was scheduled for March 29, 2001, but Aponte did not attend due to his concerns about the Commission. Instead, he hand-delivered a letter, which requested a copy of the Commission's by-laws, the subject matter of the hearing, an opinion letter by the Puerto Rican Secretary of Justice explaining the legal basis for the Commission to compel witnesses to attend hearings, and any information on the appointment of counsel to assist him at the hearing. When he delivered the letter, the Commission's staff informed Aponte that he was not entitled to appointment of counsel. He subsequently received a copy of the Order, the By-Laws, and a letter explaining that the Commission was interested in his involvement in the Barbosa transaction. The letter also rescheduled the hearing for April 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aponte attended the hearing on April 19, based in part on the assurances of the Commission's staff that his testimony was needed only to authenticate certain documents. He did not believe that he, himself, was under investigation for misconduct, and while he knew that his attendance at the hearing was not required by law, he believed that the Commission would draw negative inferences should he refuse to attend. Aponte also concluded, based on his reading of the Order and the By-Laws, that the Commission could require him to appear under compulsion of legal process should he refuse to attend voluntarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, Aponte objected to the Commission as unconstitutional. He asked to take notes of the proceedings and to have a copy of the investigators' notes, but these requests were denied. Aponte rejected the Commission's request to have a stenographer record the interview. At no point during the interview did anyone advise Aponte of any constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Pag&#225;n was interviewed on April 25, 2001, after an armed agent of the Puerto Rico Department of Justice Special Investigations Bureau (\"NIE\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> delivered a summons to Pag&#225;n's home. After receiving the summons, Pag&#225;n informed the Commission that he was willing to cooperate, despite his belief that the Commission did not have the power to compel his appearance. However, Pag&#225;n also believed, based on his former experiences, that he was \"required\" to appear, although not under legal compulsion. He knew of individuals who had failed to cooperate with NIE investigations and had been subject to formal actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like his fellow appellee, Pag&#225;n was interviewed regarding the Barbosa transaction. At the time of his interview, the Commission did not suspect Pag&#225;n of any criminal conduct, therefore, the Commission did not inform Pag&#225;n of any rights that might have attached had he been a suspect. He requested permission to record or take notes during the hearing, but the Commission denied both requests. The Commission's staff did take written notes on both Pag&#225;n's oral testimony and documentary evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2001, Governor Calder&#243;n, accompanied by some of the Commissioners, held a press conference at which she discussed the Commission's findings and released copies of the Barbosa Report. The Governor subsequently referred the matter to the Puerto Rican Secretary of Justice. The district court found that the report accuses both appellees of criminal misconduct (although the report itself does not speak in terms of crimes or criminal statutes). The report also contains extensive analysis and conclusions regarding the transaction's utility and wisdom, discusses specific mistakes, and recommends improvements so that similar mistakes do not occur in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the press conference, neither appellee had received a copy of the Barbosa Report nor been given an opportunity to respond to any charges contained in the report. Pag&#225;n later obtained a copy of the Barbosa Report, but he could not review the evidence relied upon by the Commission (which had been attached to the report submitted to the Governor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission, as part of a later investigation, summoned Pag&#225;n to appear at a second hearing, which was to cover the remodeling of the Barbosa building and a contract between PRIME and the Solid Waste Authority. Pag&#225;n chose not to appear at this hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few months later, the Commission finished the PRIME Report and delivered it to the Governor. As with the Barbosa report, the Governor and several Commissioners held a press conference where the report and its findings were discussed. The PRIME Report concludes that Pag&#225;n \"improperly intervened\" in the bidding process of the transaction and that Pag&#225;n also caused certain documents to \"disappear,\" requiring the awarded bid to be annulled. It also contains a lengthy analysis of the entire transaction and recommendations for future improvements. Again, Governor Calder&#243;n forwarded the report to the Puerto Rican Secretary of Justice for further investigation and proceedings. A second PRIME report was later delivered to Governor Calder&#243;n, who, in turn, referred it to the Secretary of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided this case after holding a hearing and entertaining various dispositive motions by the parties. The issues raised in these various motions included: (1) whether appellees had stated a valid due process claim; (2) whether appellants are protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity; (3) whether Governor Calder&#243;n is entitled to absolute immunity; (4) whether appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted; and (5) whether the district court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over appellees' state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 6-8, 2001, the district court held a hearing. This hearing was originally scheduled to address appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction. To prepare for that hearing, the district court issued an order, dated October 16, 2001, advising the parties which issues the court expected to cover in the hearing. The court outlined the final issue as follows: \"What other evidence, aside from that properly submitted in a preliminary injunction hearing, do the parties expect that they would present if the case were to be tried on the merits? <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2).\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court stated, \"I think that there is no reason why I should not give a final adjudication.... That's exactly what I intend to do under Rule 65.\" Neither party objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on November 29, 2001, the district court issued the decision that is the subject of this appeal. After deciding that the case was ripe and not an appropriate case for abstention, the court held that (1) Governor Calder&#243;n is not entitled to absolute immunity; (2) appellants are not entitled to qualified immunity; (3) the Commission violated appellees' rights to procedural due process, entitling appellees to injunctive and declaratory relief; and (4) the Commission did not violate appellees' right to freedom of association or to equal protection of the laws. The court did not decide the state-law issues raised in appellees' complaint or determine damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge the district court's decision on several grounds. First, they raise a procedural issue as to the court's invocation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. Second, they contest the court's substantive decision that the Commission violated appellees' due process rights. Third, they argue that Governor Calder&#243;n is entitled to absolute immunity regarding her establishment of the Blue Ribbon Commission through an executive order. Fourth, appellants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity. We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 65(a)(2)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a court to consolidate a preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). However, the court must provide the parties with \"`clear and unambiguous notice'\" of its intent to consolidate. <i>Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch,</i> 451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981) (quoting <i>Pughsley v. 3750 Lake Shore Drive Coop. Bldg.,</i> 463 F.2d 1055, 1057 (7th Cir.1972)). This notice must be given sufficiently early to allow the parties time to assemble and present their evidence. <i>Id.</i> However, any right to object to the court's timeliness in giving notice will be lost if a party does not object contemporaneously with the court's notice of consolidation. <i>K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc.,</i> 875 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that appellant waived its right to complain when the court announced its intention to consolidate during the second day of a preliminary injunction hearing and appellant failed to object).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record is clear. The district court signaled the possibility that it might consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits in its order dated October 16, 2001. While this first notice is arguably ambiguous, we need not stop there. At the end of the hearing, the court announced, unambiguously, that it would consolidate under Rule 65. Appellants failed to object at either juncture, consequently waiving their right to raise this issue now. Therefore, we proceed to the merits of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the consolidated trial on the merits, the district court granted a permanent injunction forbidding appellants from \"holding investigative hearings without affording individuals under investigation substantial opportunity to defend, among other rights, the right to present testimonial and documentary evidence on their behalf and to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 165. Appellants contest the district court's decision, and we agree that the district court erred in concluding that these actions provide a basis for the issuance of the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, we review a grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion, <i>A.W. Chesterton Co. v. Chesterton,</i> 128 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997), but we always review questions of law <i>de novo. Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico,</i> 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir.2001). We review factual findings for clear error. <i>See Water Keeper Alliance v.

Mass. Water Res. Auth.,</i> 256 F.3d 36, 51 n. 15 (1st Cir.2001). While appellants challenge the district court's determination on all four prongs, we find the first dispositive and, therefore, decline to address the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court found that appellees prevailed on the merits of their procedural due process claim. <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 155-63. A threshold requirement for a successful procedural due process claim is to demonstrate the implication of a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property. <i>Romero-Barcel&#243; v. Hern&#225;ndez-Agosto,</i> 75 F.3d 23, 32 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees argue that two separate liberty or property interests trigger due process protections in this case. First, they assert a right to be free from criminal investigation and prosecution. Second, they maintain that the Puerto Rican Constitution establishes a protected liberty interest in reputation. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Interest in being free from criminal investigation and prosecution</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that appellees \"have a fundamental, constitutionally protected liberty interest in being free from investigation and prosecution for criminal offenses in a manner that tramples upon the procedural protections afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 156. To support this conclusion, the court looked to <i>Jenkins v. McKeithen,</i> 395 U.S. 411, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969), which it determined governs this case. <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 160. We disagree and hold that appellees have asserted no constitutionally protected interest because there has been no adjudication of criminal liability or of appellees' legal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Jenkins,</i> a plurality of the Supreme Court held that the subject of a public investigation carried out by the Labor-Management Commission of Inquiry (\"Louisiana Commission\") stated a valid due process claim when he challenged the procedures of the Louisiana Commission. 395 U.S. at 431, 89 S.Ct. 1843. A key finding on which the plurality relied is that the Louisiana Commission was \"empowered to be used and allegedly [was] used to find named individuals guilty of violating the criminal laws.\" <i>Id.</i> at 428, 89 S.Ct. 1843. Therefore, the Louisiana Commission \"exercise[d] a function very much akin to making an official adjudication of criminal culpability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 427, 89 S.Ct. 1843. This finding distinguishes <i>Jenkins</i> from the earlier case of <i>Hannah v. Larche,</i> 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hannah</i> addressed whether due process rights were implicated by public investigations of the Civil Rights Commission. This commission had been charged by Congress with investigating allegations of voting deprivations. <i>Id.</i> at 421-23, 80 S.Ct. 1502. Several citizens, called as witnesses by the commission, filed suit to enjoin the investigation, alleging infringements of their due process rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Id.</i> at 423-30, 80 S.Ct. 1502. The Court began by noting that the Civil Rights Commission \"does not adjudicate. It does not hold trials or determine anyone's civil or criminal liability.... Nor does it indict, punish, or impose any legal sanctions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 441, 80 S.Ct. 1502. The Court then continued to explain that when there is no adjudication of legal rights, the due process clause is not implicated to the same degree:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen governmental agencies adjudicate or make binding determinations which directly affect the legal rights of individuals, it is imperative that those agencies use the procedures which have traditionally been associated with the judicial process. On the other hand, when governmental action does not partake of an adjudication, as for example, when a <i>general fact-finding investigation</i> is being conducted, it is not necessary that the full panoply of judicial procedures be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 442, 80 S.Ct. 1502 (emphasis added). The Court also looked, quite specifically, at the use of other investigative bodies in our government. It found a long history of fact-finding investigations that used procedures similar to those employed by the Civil Rights Commission. <i>Id.</i> at 443-52, 80 S.Ct. 1502. To stress this point, the Court went so far as to append an extensive list of various administrative agencies which conduct investigations without trial-like rights attaching. <i>Id.</i> at 454-92, 80 S.Ct. 1502. Because the Court found that the Civil Rights Commission was more like an investigative agency, it held that the plaintiffs' due process rights had not been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has steadfastly maintained this distinction between general fact-finding investigations and adjudications of legal rights. It is precisely on this point that <i>Jenkins</i> turns. There, the Court distinguished the Louisiana Commission from the Civil Rights Commission by saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not presented with a case in which any injury to appellant is merely a collateral consequence of the actions of an investigatory body. Rather, it is alleged that the very purpose of the [Louisiana] Commission is <i>to find persons guilty</i> of violating criminal laws without trial or procedural safeguards, and to publicize those findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">395 U.S. at 424, 89 S.Ct. 1843 (emphasis added). The Court noted that the Louisiana Commission was both required to make probable cause findings and able to file charges against individuals. <i>Id.</i> at 416-17, 89 S.Ct. 1843. Furthermore, the Louisiana Commission was \"concerned only with exposing violations of criminal laws by specific individuals.\" <i>Id.</i> at 427, 89 S.Ct. 1843. These specific characteristics of the commission made it more like an adjudicatory body than an investigatory body. Therefore, due process rights attached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, it is clear that investigations conducted by administrative agencies, even when they may lead to criminal prosecutions, do not trigger due process rights. In <i>SEC v. Jerry T. O'Brien, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 735, 104 S.Ct. 2720, 81 L.Ed.2d 615 (1984), the Court considered a challenge to a private SEC investigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The plaintiffs challenged the ability of the SEC to issue third-party subpoenas without informing the parties under investigation. The Court, once again, looked to the difference between adjudication and investigation: \"the Due Process Clause ... is [not] offended when a federal administrative agency, without notifying a person under investigation, uses its subpoena power to gather evidence adverse to him. The Due Process Clause is not implicated under such circumstances because an administrative investigation adjudicates no legal rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 742, 104 S.Ct. 2720. The key distinction is that the SEC investigated whether violations of various securities laws may have occurred, not whether plaintiffs should be held legally responsible for any such violations. For plaintiffs to be held legally responsible, they would have to be found guilty after a formal adjudication, during which full due process rights would attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the district court found that appellees have a constitutionally protected interest in being free from <i>investigation,</i> the court erred as a matter of law. The foregoing discussion shows that investigations, alone, do not trigger due process rights. There must also be an adjudication. Without an adjudication of legal rights, <i>Hannah</i> and <i>Jerry T. O'Brien</i> are clear: the Due Process Clause does not require that \"the full panoply of judicial procedures be used.\" <i>Hannah,</i> 363 U.S. at 442, 80 S.Ct. 1502.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, it is not clear whether the district court also found that there was an adjudication of appellees' legal rights. <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 156 (stating that appellees have an interest in being free from both investigation and prosecution). We know that the Blue Ribbon Commission investigates government transactions in private, and, thereafter, makes a variety of recommendations. Included within those recommendations may be the suggestion that criminal, civil, or administrative actions be brought against certain individuals. In both the Barbosa and PRIME Reports, the Commission recommended that further actions be taken against appellees. The question, then, is whether the Commission has adjudicated appellees' legal rights in making these recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether there has been an adjudication does not turn on the language of the Order or the Commission's self-described role. Rather, it is a functional question. <i>See Cooper v. Salazar,</i> 196 F.3d 809, 815 (7th Cir.1999) (holding that administrative investigation into alleged civil rights violations which resulted in determination of whether there was \"substantial evidence\" on which to proceed was a functional adjudication because, in event of negative determination, claimant could only appeal denial of claim to state supreme court). If any action of the Commission alters the appellees' legal rights, then there has been an adjudication. <i>Hannah,</i> 363 U.S. at 441, 80 S.Ct. 1502; <i>Cooper,</i> 196 F.3d at 815.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without making an explicit finding, the district court suggests that the Commission conducts adjudications because it \"makes actual findings that named individuals are guilty of criminal violations as part of a process of criminal prosecution.\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 161. However, the court's findings as to the subsidiary facts belies the conclusion. <i>See Alfaro De Quevedo v. De Jes&#250;s Schuck,</i> 556 F.2d 591, 593 (1st Cir.1977) (finding that factual findings which are internally inconsistent are clearly erroneous). Additionally, our independent review of the Barbosa and PRIME Reports shows that the district court's conclusion is clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (establishing that factual findings \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\"); <i>see also Water Keeper Alliance,</i> 271 F.3d at 30 (applying clearly erroneous standard in review of preliminary injunction denial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court referred to the \"actual findings\" of criminal conduct, <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 161, it was apparently referencing the probable cause determinations that the court found in the Barbosa and PRIME Reports.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See id.</i> at 144 (\"probable cause to believe that violations of Puerto Rico criminal law have occurred\"). However, a close reading of the district court's factual findings shows that the Commission does not make binding probable cause determinations. Rather, the Commission simply recommends that individuals be investigated further. The district court, itself, said that the Commission only makes \"accusations of criminal misconduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148. Throughout its discussion, the district court said that the Barbosa and PRIME Reports \"accuse\" appellees of crimes and that appellees \"are at risk of prosecution.\" <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 157. Furthermore, it also recognized that appellees have not yet been indicted. <i>See id.</i> at 156 (noting that appellees \"have not yet been formally charged\"). Finally, the district court observed that, \"the reports issued by the Blue Ribbon Commission are not obligatory, and the Commission can only offer recommendations that [Governor] Calder&#243;n refer a particular matter to the Department of Justice for prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 160. Therefore, it is unclear how the court concludes that \"[t]he Commission makes actual findings that named individuals are guilty of criminal violations as part of a process of criminal prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 161. In fact, this finding is internally inconsistent with the numerous findings that the reports only accuse appellees of criminal conduct and that the Commission's recommendations are neither binding nor work as a formal indictment or charge against appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court opinion is unclear on whether the Barbosa or PRIME Reports actually accuse appellees of specific crimes. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 157 (\"The Commission concluded that [appellee] Pag&#225;n had committed undue intervention in the performance of contracts, bidding procedures or government operations in violation of Section 4353a of the Penal Code....\"). Therefore, we conducted an independent review of the evidence. We conclude that the reports do accuse appellees of misconduct. For example, the Barbosa Report finds, \"at the very least [appellees] were grossly negligent.\" The PRIME Report says appellee Pag&#225;n \"improperly intervened\" in the bidding procedures and, in its most damning accusation, concludes that he \"ordered the president of the bid board to cause the disappearance of the documents.\" However, the reports never make reference to any provisions of the Puerto Rican Penal Code. They never accuse appellees of specific criminal conduct. Furthermore, the reports are very clear that they only suggest referring the matters to various administrative departments for further investigation. There is no specific recommendation that either appellee be prosecuted, much less any finding of probable cause or actual institution of legal action against appellees. Therefore, the district court's conclusion that the reports make specific and binding determinations of criminal conduct is clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. Ortiz,</i> 177 F.3d 108, 109 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that to the extent that a district court's findings are inconsistent with the uncontroverted evidence, they are clearly erroneous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Order, By-Laws, and Guidelines are all explicit that the Commission is not given the power to adjudicate legal rights. The Commission cannot independently initiate or file any civil, criminal, or administrative charges. Rather, the Commission is only given the power to make recommendations to the Governor, who then makes her own determination about whether to pursue further investigations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we find that the Commission did not and cannot adjudicate the legal rights of appellees or any other individual. There is no adjudication, functional or otherwise. Accordingly, the Due Process Clause has not been triggered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this conclusion in mind, we would like to emphasize the district court's conclusion that appellees \"have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in ensuring that the state acts in accordance with due process standards in the <i>prosecution</i> of [appellees].\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 158 (emphasis added). The fact that the district court failed to consider the difference between a prosecution and an investigation does not undercut this point. If appellees are ever prosecuted, they will be entitled to the full protections of the Due Process Clause, just like any other individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Interest in reputation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees assert another interest, which they claim serves as a valid basis for their due process claim: a liberty interest in their reputations. However, <i>Paul v. Davis,</i> 424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), held that damage to one's reputation alone does not trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155. Reputational harms must be attached to some other alteration in status in order to raise a valid due process claim. <i>Id.</i> at 711-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155. Appellees claim to satisfy this requirement by invoking the Puerto Rican Constitution. While the Puerto Rican Constitution does include a specific protection for reputation, <i>see</i> P.R. Const. art. II, &#167; 8, we conclude that the Puerto Rican courts have not afforded greater protections to reputation than stateside jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is no indication that appellees have lost any legal rights because of the alleged defamation by government actors. Since appellees can point to no alteration in their legal status attached to any reputational injury, we hold that appellees have not asserted a constitutionally protected interest in their reputations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Paul</i> is very clear. There must be a legal alteration in plaintiff's position before the courts will recognize a procedural due process claim:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent from our decisions that there exists a variety of interests which are difficult of definition but are nevertheless comprehended within the meaning of either \"liberty\" or \"property\" as meant in the Due Process Clause. These interests attain this constitutional status by virtue of the fact that they have been initially recognized and protected by state law, and we have repeatedly ruled that the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment apply whenever the State seeks to remove or significantly alter that protected status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 710-11, 96 S.Ct. 1155. The fact that a state accords protections to one's reputation by allowing one to bring a tort action does not create a legal status which is altered when the state is the alleged defamer. <i>Id.</i> at 711-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question presented here is whether the fact that Puerto Rico enshrines protection for reputation in its constitution creates a legal status which is altered when the Puerto Rican government allegedly defames one of its citizens. While this issue has arisen before, we have never had to decide it. <i>See, e.g., Romero-Barcel&#243;,</i> 75 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Paul,</i> we have consistently held that \"the injury to reputation must be accompanied by a change in the injured person's status or rights (under substantive state or federal law).\" <i>Beitzell v. Jeffrey,</i> 643 F.2d 870, 878 (1st Cir.1981); <i>see also Brennan v. Hendrigan,</i> 888 F.2d 189, 195 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"reputational injury must coincide with some other `alteration of status'\" (citing <i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 709-10, 96 S.Ct. 1155)). We have termed this a \"defamation-plus\" test. <i>Celia v. O'Malley,</i> 918 F.2d 1017, 1021 (1st Cir.1990). One example of a successful \"defamation-plus\" claim is an allegation that a stigmatization has occurred in connection with a termination in employment. <i>See Brennan,</i> 888 F.2d at 196. Appellees have asserted nothing similar to this traditional \"plus\" factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, they rely only on the assertion that Puerto Rico law creates a different regime. We have suggested that state law may broaden the liberty interests accorded due process protections. <i>See Silva v. Worden,</i> 130 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that Massachusetts \"may have a slightly broader conception of the liberty interests protected by due process\"). Therefore, it is conceivable that Puerto Rican law could accord a protected liberty interest in reputation without appellees needing to allege an additional deprivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has made clear that Puerto Rico's Constitution provides sweeping human rights protections: \"Our Constitution recognizes and grants some fundamental rights with a more global and protective vision than does the United States Constitution.\" <i>L&#243;pez Vives v. Policia of P.R.,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 264, 273, 1987 WL 448356 (1987). Furthermore, the Puerto Rico Constitution should be construed broadly in regard to these rights. <i>Id.</i> Despite these broad human rights protections, it does not necessarily follow that the Puerto Rican law protects reputation so broadly as to make it a protected liberty interest under the United States Constitution. To evaluate this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the protections Puerto Rico provides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico law creates a right of action for defamation and libel in three separate sources. <i>See Gim&#233;nez Alvarez v. Sil&#233;n Maldonado,</i> 131 P.R. Dec. 91, 97-98, 1992 WL 754904 (1992). First, Article II, section 8 of the Puerto Rico Constitution provides, \"Every person has the right to the protection of law against abusive attacks on his honor, reputation and private or family life.\" This provision provides a right of action without enabling legislation. <i>Porto v. Bentley P.R., Inc.,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. 331, 343, 1992 WL 754807 (1992). Second, the Libel and Slander Act of 1902 provides a right of action. 32 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 3141-49. This act draws from the common law tradition, <i>Porto,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. at 344 n. 8, and has been modified by pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court. <i>See id.</i> at 344-46. Third, there is a statutory right drawn from the Civil Code. 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141; <i>see also Gim&#233;nez Alvarez,</i> 131 P.R. Dec. at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting these various sources of law, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has explicitly said that Puerto Rico law on libel and slander follows the common law tradition. <i>Villaneuva v. Hern&#225;ndez Class,</i> 28 P.R. Offic. Trans. 618, 128 P.R. Dec. 618, 646, 1991 WL 735303 (1991) (\"Our libel and slander law &#8212; which follows the Anglo-Saxon common law....\"). Beyond this overt acknowledgment, the Puerto Rico courts frequently cite stateside jurisdictions when interpreting their laws protecting personal reputation. <i>See, e.g., Porto,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. at 349; <i>Villaneuva,</i> 128 P.R. Dec. at 647-48; <i>Gonz&#225;lez Mart&#237;nez v. L&#243;pez,</i> 18 P.R. Offic. Trans. 229, 236, 1987 WL 448359 (1987). Therefore, as currently developed by Puerto Rican courts, there is nothing that suggests that we should treat the protections accorded to reputation by Puerto Rico any more broadly than those granted in other United States jurisdictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the law in Puerto Rico appears to be no different, functionally, from the general common law protections for reputation, we cannot credit appellees' argument that reputation alone, in Puerto Rico, rises to a liberty interest accorded independent protection under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Therefore, appellees have failed to demonstrate a protected liberty interest in their reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Appropriateness of injunctive and declaratory relief</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing discussion, it is clear that appellees have failed to assert any protected interest in life, liberty, or property that would trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause. In holding otherwise, the district court erred.

Absolute and Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellees' federal claims fail on the merits, we see no need to probe whether, or to what extent, the appellants may be immune from damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Calder&#243;n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2475096\"><a href=\"/opinion/2475096/aponte-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2001). Plaintiffs-appellees originally brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the Independent Citizens' Commission to Evaluate Government Transactions (\"Blue Ribbon Commission\" or \"Commission\"), which was created by appellant Sila M. Calder&#243;n through an executive order. They alleged, inter alia, that the Commission violated appellees' rights to due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The district court agreed and entered a permanent injunction forbidding the Commission from engaging in future investigations without instituting trial-type procedures. Because we find that the Commission's investigation implicates no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest of the appellees, we reverse the district court's grant of injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Creation and Structure of the Blue Ribbon Commission</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Sila Mar&#237;a Calder&#243;n was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in November 2000. Shortly after taking office in January 2001, she promulgated Executive Order No. 2001-06 (\"Order\"). The Order states that there is a \"pressing need\" to make \"proper and efficient use of public resources\" and to complete \"the total erradication [sic] of government corruption.\" To further that effort, the Order creates the \"Independent Citizens' Commission to Evaluate Government Transactions ... for the purpose of evaluating significant government transactions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Order gives the Blue Ribbon Commission the power to evaluate transactions accomplished by the executive branch of the Puerto Rican government. These transactions may have been completed by either the current or previous administrations and must \"have the potential of substantially impacting on areas such as the government's structure, the public treasury, the country's economy and infrastructure, or the citizenry's trust in government institutions.\" To further these evaluations, the Order gives the Commission the authority to request information from natural and artificial persons, to require the assistance of the executive branch, and to issue reports to the Governor, including both the findings of any investigation and any recommendations. These recommendations may include the adoption of \"new statutory or regulatory rules,\" the modification of existing rules, and further proceedings, either administrative, civil, or criminal, against certain persons. The Order also provides that the Commission shall operate with strict confidentiality. Only the Governor has the power to publicize the findings, recommendations, or evidence collected by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Governor also has the exclusive power to name Commission members. She originally appointed appellants David Noriega-Rodr&#237;guez, Ileana Col&#243;n-Carlo, Carmen Rita V&#233;lez-Borr&#225;s, Pedro Galarza, and Pedro L&#243;pez-Oliver. Noriega-Rodr&#237;guez was made Chairperson. Galarza and L&#243;pez-Oliver have both resigned from the Commission, and appellant Angel Hermida replaced L&#243;pez-Oliver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has the power to adopt internal operating rules. Pursuant to that power, the Commission promulgated both Operating By-Laws (\"By-Laws\") and Guidelines for Investigation and Drafting of Reports (\"Guidelines\"). Only the By-Laws were made public by the Commission. The unpublished Guidelines, however, provide most of the substantive procedures that the Commission and its staff follow in conducting their investigations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> These procedures include the ability of the Commission to request officers of the executive branch to secure the appearance and testimony of reluctant witnesses, using appropriate legal mechanisms. During interviews, the Commissioners or their staff may record testimony in a variety of ways, including handwritten notes. Witnesses are not allowed to take notes, record their testimony, or obtain copies of their statements. This is ostensibly to protect the confidentiality of the Commission's investigations. Those witnesses who are not considered suspects are not allowed to have an attorney present. However, those witnesses who are suspected of violating laws or regulations of a penal nature are to be advised of their constitutional rights, including their right against forced self-incrimination. The Guidelines also require Commissioners to report any evidence that creates more than a mere suspicion of criminal activity. The Commission, once it has verified such evidence, may refer the matter to the Puerto Rican Department of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also important to note what powers the Blue Ribbon Commission does not have. It does not have the power to independently initiate or file any civil, criminal, or administrative charges. It can only recommend that other agencies do so. Most importantly, the Commission cannot adjudicate criminal liability or make probable cause determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Investigations and Publication of Reports Relating to Appellees</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Blue Ribbon Commission has completed reports on three transactions. Two of those are implicated in this case. The first concerns the lease and purchase of a building, located at Barbosa Avenue 306, and an adjacent parking lot (\"Barbosa Report\"). It discusses both appellees. The second details the relationship between the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, the Solid Waste Authority, and the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Management Group, Inc., a private entity (\"PRIME Report\"). It discusses only appellee Daniel Pag&#225;n. The district court concluded, after holding a hearing, that both reports \"find that there is probable cause to believe that violations of Puerto Rico criminal law have occurred.\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both plaintiffs-appellees served as high-ranking Puerto Rican officials under former Governor Pedro Rossell&#243;. Appellee Jorge E. Aponte was Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Appellee Daniel Pag&#225;n was Secretary of the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. Both Aponte and Pag&#225;n held their positions in the Puerto Rican government until December 31, 2000, when Governor Rossell&#243;'s term ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission interviewed appellee Aponte on April 19, 2001, regarding the Barbosa transaction. This interview occurred after Aponte received a letter at his home, requesting his appearance at a hearing. Originally, the hearing was scheduled for March 29, 2001, but Aponte did not attend due to his concerns about the Commission. Instead, he hand-delivered a letter, which requested a copy of the Commission's by-laws, the subject matter of the hearing, an opinion letter by the Puerto Rican Secretary of Justice explaining the legal basis for the Commission to compel witnesses to attend hearings, and any information on the appointment of counsel to assist him at the hearing. When he delivered the letter, the Commission's staff informed Aponte that he was not entitled to appointment of counsel. He subsequently received a copy of the Order, the By-Laws, and a letter explaining that the Commission was interested in his involvement in the Barbosa transaction. The letter also rescheduled the hearing for April 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aponte attended the hearing on April 19, based in part on the assurances of the Commission's staff that his testimony was needed only to authenticate certain documents. He did not believe that he, himself, was under investigation for misconduct, and while he knew that his attendance at the hearing was not required by law, he believed that the Commission would draw negative inferences should he refuse to attend. Aponte also concluded, based on his reading of the Order and the By-Laws, that the Commission could require him to appear under compulsion of legal process should he refuse to attend voluntarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, Aponte objected to the Commission as unconstitutional. He asked to take notes of the proceedings and to have a copy of the investigators' notes, but these requests were denied. Aponte rejected the Commission's request to have a stenographer record the interview. At no point during the interview did anyone advise Aponte of any constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee Pag&#225;n was interviewed on April 25, 2001, after an armed agent of the Puerto Rico Department of Justice Special Investigations Bureau (\"NIE\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> delivered a summons to Pag&#225;n's home. After receiving the summons, Pag&#225;n informed the Commission that he was willing to cooperate, despite his belief that the Commission did not have the power to compel his appearance. However, Pag&#225;n also believed, based on his former experiences, that he was \"required\" to appear, although not under legal compulsion. He knew of individuals who had failed to cooperate with NIE investigations and had been subject to formal actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like his fellow appellee, Pag&#225;n was interviewed regarding the Barbosa transaction. At the time of his interview, the Commission did not suspect Pag&#225;n of any criminal conduct, therefore, the Commission did not inform Pag&#225;n of any rights that might have attached had he been a suspect. He requested permission to record or take notes during the hearing, but the Commission denied both requests. The Commission's staff did take written notes on both Pag&#225;n's oral testimony and documentary evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, 2001, Governor Calder&#243;n, accompanied by some of the Commissioners, held a press conference at which she discussed the Commission's findings and released copies of the Barbosa Report. The Governor subsequently referred the matter to the Puerto Rican Secretary of Justice. The district court found that the report accuses both appellees of criminal misconduct (although the report itself does not speak in terms of crimes or criminal statutes). The report also contains extensive analysis and conclusions regarding the transaction's utility and wisdom, discusses specific mistakes, and recommends improvements so that similar mistakes do not occur in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the press conference, neither appellee had received a copy of the Barbosa Report nor been given an opportunity to respond to any charges contained in the report. Pag&#225;n later obtained a copy of the Barbosa Report, but he could not review the evidence relied upon by the Commission (which had been attached to the report submitted to the Governor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission, as part of a later investigation, summoned Pag&#225;n to appear at a second hearing, which was to cover the remodeling of the Barbosa building and a contract between PRIME and the Solid Waste Authority. Pag&#225;n chose not to appear at this hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few months later, the Commission finished the PRIME Report and delivered it to the Governor. As with the Barbosa report, the Governor and several Commissioners held a press conference where the report and its findings were discussed. The PRIME Report concludes that Pag&#225;n \"improperly intervened\" in the bidding process of the transaction and that Pag&#225;n also caused certain documents to \"disappear,\" requiring the awarded bid to be annulled. It also contains a lengthy analysis of the entire transaction and recommendations for future improvements. Again, Governor Calder&#243;n forwarded the report to the Puerto Rican Secretary of Justice for further investigation and proceedings. A second PRIME report was later delivered to Governor Calder&#243;n, who, in turn, referred it to the Secretary of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided this case after holding a hearing and entertaining various dispositive motions by the parties. The issues raised in these various motions included: (1) whether appellees had stated a valid due process claim; (2) whether appellants are protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity; (3) whether Governor Calder&#243;n is entitled to absolute immunity; (4) whether appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted; and (5) whether the district court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over appellees' state-law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 6-8, 2001, the district court held a hearing. This hearing was originally scheduled to address appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction. To prepare for that hearing, the district court issued an order, dated October 16, 2001, advising the parties which issues the court expected to cover in the hearing. The court outlined the final issue as follows: \"What other evidence, aside from that properly submitted in a preliminary injunction hearing, do the parties expect that they would present if the case were to be tried on the merits? <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2).\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court stated, \"I think that there is no reason why I should not give a final adjudication.... That's exactly what I intend to do under Rule 65.\" Neither party objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, on November 29, 2001, the district court issued the decision that is the subject of this appeal. After deciding that the case was ripe and not an appropriate case for abstention, the court held that (1) Governor Calder&#243;n is not entitled to absolute immunity; (2) appellants are not entitled to qualified immunity; (3) the Commission violated appellees' rights to procedural due process, entitling appellees to injunctive and declaratory relief; and (4) the Commission did not violate appellees' right to freedom of association or to equal protection of the laws. The court did not decide the state-law issues raised in appellees' complaint or determine damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge the district court's decision on several grounds. First, they raise a procedural issue as to the court's invocation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. Second, they contest the court's substantive decision that the Commission violated appellees' due process rights. Third, they argue that Governor Calder&#243;n is entitled to absolute immunity regarding her establishment of the Blue Ribbon Commission through an executive order. Fourth, appellants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity. We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 65(a)(2)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a court to consolidate a preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). However, the court must provide the parties with \"`clear and unambiguous notice'\" of its intent to consolidate. <i>Univ. of Tex. v.

The Court then continued to explain that when there is no adjudication of legal rights, the due process clause is not implicated to the same degree:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen governmental agencies adjudicate or make binding determinations which directly affect the legal rights of individuals, it is imperative that those agencies use the procedures which have traditionally been associated with the judicial process. On the other hand, when governmental action does not partake of an adjudication, as for example, when a <i>general fact-finding investigation</i> is being conducted, it is not necessary that the full panoply of judicial procedures be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106078\"><a href=\"/opinion/106078/hannah-v-larche/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span> (emphasis added). The Court also looked, quite specifically, at the use of other investigative bodies in our government. It found a long history of fact-finding investigations that used procedures similar to those employed by the Civil Rights Commission. <i>Id.</i> at 443-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106078\"><a href=\"/opinion/106078/hannah-v-larche/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span>. To stress this point, the Court went so far as to append an extensive list of various administrative agencies which conduct investigations without trial-like rights attaching. <i>Id.</i> at 454-92, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106078\"><a href=\"/opinion/106078/hannah-v-larche/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the Court found that the Civil Rights Commission was more like an investigative agency, it held that the plaintiffs' due process rights had not been violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has steadfastly maintained this distinction between general fact-finding investigations and adjudications of legal rights. It is precisely on this point that <i>Jenkins</i> turns. There, the Court distinguished the Louisiana Commission from the Civil Rights Commission by saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not presented with a case in which any injury to appellant is merely a collateral consequence of the actions of an investigatory body. Rather, it is alleged that the very purpose of the [Louisiana] Commission is <i>to find persons guilty</i> of violating criminal laws without trial or procedural safeguards, and to publicize those findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">395 U.S. at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107964\"><a href=\"/opinion/107964/jenkins-v-mckeithen/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1843</span></a></span> (emphasis added). The Court noted that the Louisiana Commission was both required to make probable cause findings and able to file charges against individuals. <i>Id.</i> at 416-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107964\"><a href=\"/opinion/107964/jenkins-v-mckeithen/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, the Louisiana Commission was \"concerned only with exposing violations of criminal laws by specific individuals.\" <i>Id.</i> at 427, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107964\"><a href=\"/opinion/107964/jenkins-v-mckeithen/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1843</span></a></span>. These specific characteristics of the commission made it more like an adjudicatory body than an investigatory body. Therefore, due process rights attached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, it is clear that investigations conducted by administrative agencies, even when they may lead to criminal prosecutions, do not trigger due process rights. In <i>SEC v. Jerry T. O'Brien, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111217\"><a href=\"/opinion/111217/sec-v-jerry-t-obrien-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111217\"><a href=\"/opinion/111217/sec-v-jerry-t-obrien-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span> (1984), the Court considered a challenge to a private SEC investigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The plaintiffs challenged the ability of the SEC to issue third-party subpoenas without informing the parties under investigation. The Court, once again, looked to the difference between adjudication and investigation: \"the Due Process Clause ... is [not] offended when a federal administrative agency, without notifying a person under investigation, uses its subpoena power to gather evidence adverse to him. The Due Process Clause is not implicated under such circumstances because an administrative investigation adjudicates no legal rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 742, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111217\"><a href=\"/opinion/111217/sec-v-jerry-t-obrien-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2720</span></a></span>. The key distinction is that the SEC investigated whether violations of various securities laws may have occurred, not whether plaintiffs should be held legally responsible for any such violations. For plaintiffs to be held legally responsible, they would have to be found guilty after a formal adjudication, during which full due process rights would attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the district court found that appellees have a constitutionally protected interest in being free from <i>investigation,</i> the court erred as a matter of law. The foregoing discussion shows that investigations, alone, do not trigger due process rights. There must also be an adjudication. Without an adjudication of legal rights, <i>Hannah</i> and <i>Jerry T. O'Brien</i> are clear: the Due Process Clause does not require that \"the full panoply of judicial procedures be used.\" <i>Hannah,</i> 363 U.S. at 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106078\"><a href=\"/opinion/106078/hannah-v-larche/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We know that the Blue Ribbon Commission investigates government transactions in private, and, thereafter, makes a variety of recommendations. Included within those recommendations may be the suggestion that criminal, civil, or administrative actions be brought against certain individuals. In both the Barbosa and PRIME Reports, the Commission recommended that further actions be taken against appellees. The question, then, is whether the Commission has adjudicated appellees' legal rights in making these recommendations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether there has been an adjudication does not turn on the language of the Order or the Commission's self-described role. Rather, it is a functional question. <i>See Cooper v. Salazar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766781\"><a href=\"/opinion/766781/ricky-cooper-anna-marie-klups-chitunda-tillman-individually-and-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span>, 815 (7th Cir.1999) (holding that administrative investigation into alleged civil rights violations which resulted in determination of whether there was \"substantial evidence\" on which to proceed was a functional adjudication because, in event of negative determination, claimant could only appeal denial of claim to state supreme court). If any action of the Commission alters the appellees' legal rights, then there has been an adjudication. <i>Hannah,</i> 363 U.S. at 441, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106078\"><a href=\"/opinion/106078/hannah-v-larche/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, the court's findings as to the subsidiary facts belies the conclusion. <i>See Alfaro De Quevedo v. De Jes&#250;s Schuck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"346564\"><a href=\"/opinion/346564/flavia-alfaro-de-quevedo-v-francisco-de-jesus-schuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 593 (1st Cir.1977) (finding that factual findings which are internally inconsistent are clearly erroneous). Additionally, our independent review of the Barbosa and PRIME Reports shows that the district court's conclusion is clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (establishing that factual findings \"shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\"); <i>see also Water Keeper Alliance,</i> 271 F.3d at 30 (applying clearly erroneous standard in review of preliminary injunction denial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court referred to the \"actual findings\" of criminal conduct, <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 161, it was apparently referencing the probable cause determinations that the court found in the Barbosa and PRIME Reports.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See id.</i> at 144 (\"probable cause to believe that violations of Puerto Rico criminal law have occurred\"). However, a close reading of the district court's factual findings shows that the Commission does not make binding probable cause determinations. Rather, the Commission simply recommends that individuals be investigated further. The district court, itself, said that the Commission only makes \"accusations of criminal misconduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148. Throughout its discussion, the district court said that the Barbosa and PRIME Reports \"accuse\" appellees of crimes and that appellees \"are at risk of prosecution.\" <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 157. Furthermore, it also recognized that appellees have not yet been indicted. <i>See id.</i> at 156 (noting that appellees \"have not yet been formally charged\"). Finally, the district court observed that, \"the reports issued by the Blue Ribbon Commission are not obligatory, and the Commission can only offer recommendations that [Governor] Calder&#243;n refer a particular matter to the Department of Justice for prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 160. Therefore, it is unclear how the court concludes that \"[t]he Commission makes actual findings that named individuals are guilty of criminal violations as part of a process of criminal prosecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 161. In fact, this finding is internally inconsistent with the numerous findings that the reports only accuse appellees of criminal conduct and that the Commission's recommendations are neither binding nor work as a formal indictment or charge against appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court opinion is unclear on whether the Barbosa or PRIME Reports actually accuse appellees of specific crimes. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 157 (\"The Commission concluded that [appellee] Pag&#225;n had committed undue intervention in the performance of contracts, bidding procedures or government operations in violation of Section 4353a of the Penal Code....\"). Therefore, we conducted an independent review of the evidence. We conclude that the reports do accuse appellees of misconduct. For example, the Barbosa Report finds, \"at the very least [appellees] were grossly negligent.\" The PRIME Report says appellee Pag&#225;n \"improperly intervened\" in the bidding procedures and, in its most damning accusation, concludes that he \"ordered the president of the bid board to cause the disappearance of the documents.\" However, the reports never make reference to any provisions of the Puerto Rican Penal Code. They never accuse appellees of specific criminal conduct. Furthermore, the reports are very clear that they only suggest referring the matters to various administrative departments for further investigation. There is no specific recommendation that either appellee be prosecuted, much less any finding of probable cause or actual institution of legal action against appellees. Therefore, the district court's conclusion that the reports make specific and binding determinations of criminal conduct is clearly erroneous. <i>See United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198502\"><a href=\"/opinion/198502/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that to the extent that a district court's findings are inconsistent with the uncontroverted evidence, they are clearly erroneous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the Order, By-Laws, and Guidelines are all explicit that the Commission is not given the power to adjudicate legal rights. The Commission cannot independently initiate or file any civil, criminal, or administrative charges. Rather, the Commission is only given the power to make recommendations to the Governor, who then makes her own determination about whether to pursue further investigations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we find that the Commission did not and cannot adjudicate the legal rights of appellees or any other individual. There is no adjudication, functional or otherwise. Accordingly, the Due Process Clause has not been triggered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this conclusion in mind, we would like to emphasize the district court's conclusion that appellees \"have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in ensuring that the state acts in accordance with due process standards in the <i>prosecution</i> of [appellees].\" <i>Aponte,</i> 176 F.Supp.2d at 158 (emphasis added). The fact that the district court failed to consider the difference between a prosecution and an investigation does not undercut this point. If appellees are ever prosecuted, they will be entitled to the full protections of the Due Process Clause, just like any other individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Interest in reputation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees assert another interest, which they claim serves as a valid basis for their due process claim: a liberty interest in their reputations.

While the Puerto Rican Constitution does include a specific protection for reputation, <i>see</i> P.R. Const. art. II, &#167; 8, we conclude that the Puerto Rican courts have not afforded greater protections to reputation than stateside jurisdictions. Furthermore, there is no indication that appellees have lost any legal rights because of the alleged defamation by government actors. Since appellees can point to no alteration in their legal status attached to any reputational injury, we hold that appellees have not asserted a constitutionally protected interest in their reputations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Paul</i> is very clear.

These interests attain this constitutional status by virtue of the fact that they have been initially recognized and protected by state law, and we have repeatedly ruled that the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment apply whenever the State seeks to remove or significantly alter that protected status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 710-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>. The fact that a state accords protections to one's reputation by allowing one to bring a tort action does not create a legal status which is altered when the state is the alleged defamer. <i>Id.</i> at 711-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While this issue has arisen before, we have never had to decide it. <i>See, e.g., Romero-Barcel&#243;,</i> 75 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Paul,</i> we have consistently held that \"the injury to reputation must be accompanied by a change in the injured person's status or rights (under substantive state or federal law).\" <i>Beitzell v. Jeffrey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388175\"><a href=\"/opinion/388175/robert-e-beitzell-v-william-h-jeffrey-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span>, 878 (1st Cir.1981); <i>see also Brennan v. Hendrigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531204\"><a href=\"/opinion/531204/robert-brennan-v-roderick-hendrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"reputational injury must coincide with some other `alteration of status'\" (citing <i>Paul,</i> 424 U.S. at 709-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>)). We have termed this a \"defamation-plus\" test. <i>Celia v. O'Malley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551475\"><a href=\"/opinion/551475/nicholas-v-celia-jr-v-william-c-omalley-and-joseph-p-gaughan/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1021 (1st Cir.1990). One example of a successful \"defamation-plus\" claim is an allegation that a stigmatization has occurred in connection with a termination in employment. <i>See Brennan,</i> 888 F.2d at 196. Appellees have asserted nothing similar to this traditional \"plus\" factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, they rely only on the assertion that Puerto Rico law creates a different regime. We have suggested that state law may broaden the liberty interests accorded due process protections. <i>See Silva v. Worden,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197655\"><a href=\"/opinion/197655/silva-v-worden/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that Massachusetts \"may have a slightly broader conception of the liberty interests protected by due process\"). Therefore, it is conceivable that Puerto Rican law could accord a protected liberty interest in reputation without appellees needing to allege an additional deprivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has made clear that Puerto Rico's Constitution provides sweeping human rights protections: \"Our Constitution recognizes and grants some fundamental rights with a more global and protective vision than does the United States Constitution.\" <i>L&#243;pez Vives v. Policia of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span>, 273, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448356</span></span> (1987). Furthermore, the Puerto Rico Constitution should be construed broadly in regard to these rights. <i>Id.</i> Despite these broad human rights protections, it does not necessarily follow that the Puerto Rican law protects reputation so broadly as to make it a protected liberty interest under the United States Constitution. To evaluate this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the protections Puerto Rico provides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico law creates a right of action for defamation and libel in three separate sources. <i>See Gim&#233;nez Alvarez v. Sil&#233;n Maldonado,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></span>, 97-98, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">754904</span></span> (1992). First, Article II, section 8 of the Puerto Rico Constitution provides, \"Every person has the right to the protection of law against abusive attacks on his honor, reputation and private or family life.\" This provision provides a right of action without enabling legislation. <i>Porto v. Bentley P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">754807</span></span> (1992). Second, the Libel and Slander Act of 1902 provides a right of action. 32 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 3141-49. This act draws from the common law tradition, <i>Porto,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. at 344 n. 8, and has been modified by pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court. <i>See id.</i> at 344-46. Third, there is a statutory right drawn from the Civil Code. 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141; <i>see also Gim&#233;nez Alvarez,</i> 131 P.R. Dec. at 98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting these various sources of law, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has explicitly said that Puerto Rico law on libel and slander follows the common law tradition. <i>Villaneuva v. Hern&#225;ndez Class,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span>, 646, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">735303</span></span> (1991) (\"Our libel and slander law &#8212; which follows the Anglo-Saxon common law....\"). Beyond this overt acknowledgment, the Puerto Rico courts frequently cite stateside jurisdictions when interpreting their laws protecting personal reputation. <i>See, e.g., Porto,</i> 132 P.R. Dec. at 349; <i>Villaneuva,</i> 128 P.R. Dec. at 647-48; <i>Gonz&#225;lez Mart&#237;nez v. L&#243;pez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></span>, 236, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448359</span></span> (1987). Therefore, as currently developed by Puerto Rican courts, there is nothing that suggests that we should treat the protections accorded to reputation by Puerto Rico any more broadly than those granted in other United States jurisdictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the law in Puerto Rico appears to be no different, functionally, from the general common law protections for reputation, we cannot credit appellees' argument that reputation alone, in Puerto Rico, rises to a liberty interest accorded independent protection under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Therefore, appellees have failed to demonstrate a protected liberty interest in their reputation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Appropriateness of injunctive and declaratory relief</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing discussion, it is clear that appellees have failed to assert any protected interest in life, liberty, or property that would trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause. In holding otherwise, the district court erred. Consequently, the district court abused its discretion when it issued the permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also entered a declaratory judgment that \"the procedures employed by the Blue Ribbon Commission in the investigation of public corruption are fundamentally unfair and contravene the requisites of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" As this judgment was based on the finding that appellees succeeded on the merits of their due process claim, the district court also erred in awarding declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Absolute and Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellees' federal claims fail on the merits, we see no need to probe whether, or to what extent, the appellants may be immune from damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the above discussion, we vacate the permanent injunction and reverse the declaratory judgment issued against defendants-appellants. Finally, we remand to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of defendants-appellants on the due process claim and to dismiss the remaining state law claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated, reversed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Adolfo Krans, Governor Calder&#243;n's husband, is the final appellant.
