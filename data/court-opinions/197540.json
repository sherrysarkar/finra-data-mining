We have reviewed  the parties' briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nthe  record on appeal.   Dr. Gibson's  examination found that\r\n\nclaimant  had   a  normal  range  of  motion  in  his  knees,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  the   indication  of   early  osteoarthritis\r\n\nrevealed by  the x-ray.   Claimant's normal  range of  motion\r\n\nrebuts his claim that he met Listing 9.09(A) of appendix 1.\r\n\n     We  note that  the magistrate-judge  concluded that  the\r\n\nclaimant's  failure to  oppose the  Commissioner's motion  to\r\n\naffirm the judgment \"alone\" sufficed as reason to  grant that\r\n\nmotion.    This  is  error,  as  the  magistrate  still  must\r\n\ndetermine that the moving party  is entitled to a judgment as\r\n\na matter of  law.  See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 56(c).   Nonetheless,\r                                  \r\n\nthe error was harmless as the magistrate thereafter recounted\r\n\nand  analyzed the evidence and correctly concluded that there\r\n\nwas  substantial  evidence  to support  the  decision  of the\r\n\nadministrative law judge.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\r\n",
