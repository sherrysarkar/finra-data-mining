Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    Bruce J. McGiverin for appellant.\n    Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco,   Chief, Criminal Division, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\fApril 3, 2001\n\f            CAMPBELL,   Senior   Circuit   Judge.    Defendant   Félix\n\nCorporán-Cuevas (“Corporán”) was convicted upon a plea of guilty\n\nof the following two offenses: (count I) conspiring, under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371, to violate the federal Hostage Taking statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1203, and (count II) aiding and abetting, under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2, the violation of the federal Hostage Taking statute,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1203.       On appeal he raises four issues which we\n\nconsider seriatim, after a brief recitation of the relevant\n\nfacts.\n\n            On April 18, 1996, in the District of Puerto Rico,\n\ndefendant’s    alleged    co-conspirator     Félix   Beras   and    an\n\nunidentified individual abducted thirteen-year old Carlos de la\n\nRosa Berbera who was traveling in a car with his grandmother,\n\nCarmen Villar-Cordero.     At gun-point, the two kidnapers ordered\n\nMrs. Villar-Cordero out of the car and drove off with her\n\ngrandson.     Two hours later, Mrs. Villar-Cordero received a\n\nransom call, ordering that she produce the child’s parents or\n\nmoney in exchange for her grandson’s freedom.           By then, it\n\nappears that, in addition to Félix Beras, defendant Corporán and\n\ntwo other co-defendants were holding young Carlos.           The FBI\n\nsucceeded in rescuing the child four days later in Rio Piedras.\n\nBoth Corporán and Beras were on the scene and were arrested.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           On the day scheduled for trial -- October 28, 1996 --\n\nCorporán entered and the court accepted a change of plea of\n\nguilty as to Counts I and II.               On February 12, 1997, the\n\ndistrict   court   sentenced     Corporán    to   a    term    of   200    months\n\nimprisonment on Counts I and II.            The court also imposed two\n\nterms of supervised release: three years on Count I and five\n\nyears on Count II, to be served concurrently.                 Corporán filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal on February 21, 1997.\n\nI.         Elements of the Federal Crime of Hostage Taking\n\n           Defendant argues that the indictment fails to allege\n\none of the essential elements of the crime of hostage taking --\n\nthe so-called international element, see 18 U.S.C. § 1203(b)(2),\n\ninfra -- rendering it fundamentally defective and requiring us\n\nto reverse his conviction notwithstanding his guilty plea.\n\n           Section   1203   of    18   U.S.C.,        the   federal       statute\n\ncriminalizing hostage taking, states, in relevant part,\n\n           (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of\n           this section, whoever, whether inside or\n           outside the United States, seizes or detains\n           and threatens to kill, to injure, or to\n           continue to detain another person in order\n           to compel a third person or a governmental\n           organization to do or abstain from doing any\n           act as an explicit or implicit condition for\n           the release of the person detained, or\n           attempts or conspires to do so, shall be\n           punished by imprisonment for any term of\n           years or for life and, if the death of any\n           person results, shall be punished by death\n           or life imprisonment.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                ....\n\n         (b)(2) It is not an offense under this\n         section if the conduct required for the\n         offense occurred inside the United States,\n         each alleged offender and each person seized\n         or detained are nationals of the United\n         States, and each alleged offender is found\n         in   the    United   States,    unless   the\n         governmental organization sought to be\n         compelled is the Government of the United\n         States.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1203.      Defendant points out that the indictment\n\nfails to allege that he or any other person involved in the\n\nkidnaping of Carlos de la Rosa Berbera were not nationals of the\n\nUnited States (the so-called “international element,” see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1203(b)(2)).    Defendant argues that the fact that an\n\nalleged offender or victim of the hostage taking is a non-U.S.\n\nnational is an essential jurisdictional element of the offense,\n\nand, as such, had to be alleged in the indictment in order to\n\ncomport with due process.   See United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229\n\nF.3d 292, 309 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Hamling v. United States,\n\n418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974) and United States v. Hess, 124 U.S.\n\n483, 487 (1888)).   See also United States v. Penagaricano-Soler,\n\n911 F.2d 833, 839-40 (1st Cir. 1990) (citing cases).\n\n         The government does not dispute that the indictment\n\nfails to allege facts showing compliance with the international\n\naspect of the hostage taking statute, but contends that this\n\naspect need not be pleaded as it is an affirmative defense only.\n\n                               -5-\n\fAccording to the government, the defendant has the burden to\n\nallege    and   prove    that   his   case   falls   within   the    statutory\n\nexception as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1203(b)(2) – that all\n\noffenders and victims of the crime were United States nationals.\n\n\n\n            On different facts, the absence of an allegation in the\n\nindictment that at least one alleged offender or victim was a\n\nnon-U.S. national might be cause for concern.                 Compare United\n\nStates v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62, 70 (1971) (stating as a “general\n\nguide to the interpretation of criminal statutes that when an\n\nexception is incorporated in the enacting clause of a criminal\n\nstatute, the burden is on the prosecution to plead and prove\n\nthat the defendant is not within the exception”) with United\n\nStates v. Santos-Riviera, 183 F.3d 367, 370 (5th Cir. 1999)\n\n(holding    that   the    exception    incorporated    into    the   enacting\n\nclause of the Hostage Taking statute is not an essential element\n\nof the offense for which the government bears the burden of\n\nproof).    Given Vuitch, it is arguable that the Fifth Circuit’s\n\nreasoning in Santos-Riviera was incorrect.\n\n            But we need not and do not decide that issue at this\n\ntime.     The uncontraverted facts of record leave no doubt that\n\neven if the so-called international element should have been\n\npleaded    in   the     indictment,    any   error   resulting      from   that\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fomission    was   harmless.         See    Mojica-Baez,         229     F.3d    at   311\n\n(holding that failure of indictment to allege an element of the\n\noffense is subject to harmless error review where the indictment\n\notherwise     provided     the    defendants      with    fair       notice     of   the\n\ncharges against them).            Corporán freely admitted to the court\n\nthat he was a national of the Dominican Republic both at his\n\nchange of plea hearing and again at sentencing.                       That he is not\n\na United States national is undisputed.                        The international\n\nelement of the statute -- even assuming arguendo that it should\n\nhave   been    pleaded     in    the     indictment      --    has    been      plainly\n\nsatisfied,     despite     the     government’s         failure       to     plead    it\n\nexpressly.     Nothing in the record suggests that Corporán could\n\nin any way have been prejudiced by the indictment’s failure to\n\nhave alleged his Dominican citizenship.                 Accordingly, this claim\n\nof error furnishes no basis for reversal.                     See id.\n\nII.         Rule 11 Colloquy\n\n            Defendant’s         second    issue    on    appeal       concerns       the\n\nvalidity of his guilty plea.             Corporán contends that his Rule 11\n\ncolloquy before the district court was fatally flawed in two\n\nrespects:     (1) the district court failed to provide a meaningful\n\nexplanation     of   the   charges       to    which    Corporán       was     pleading\n\nguilty, and (2) the district court failed to advise Corporán,\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(5), that as\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fa consequence of his oath, he could be subject to a charge of\n\nperjury in the event of any false answers.             Defendant failed to\n\nraise these issues below1, hence, our review is governed by the\n\nplain error standard.      See United States v. Savinon-Acosta, 232\n\nF.3d 265, 268 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Where the error was not called\n\nto the district court's attention, appellate review is governed\n\nby the plain error standard, which requires not only an error\n\naffecting substantial rights but also a finding by the reviewing\n\ncourt that the error has seriously affect[ed] the fairness,\n\nintegrity,   or   public   reputation       of     judicial   proceedings.\")\n\n(alteration in original).         Having reviewed the record, we do not\n\nfind plain error.\n\n         Corporán’s first attack on his plea engages one of Rule\n\n11's core concerns -- whether the defendant understood the\n\nnature of the charges against him.           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nGandia-Maysonet,    227    F.3d    1,   3   (1st    Cir.   2000)   (“[A]   core\n\nconcern of Rule 11 . . . includes ensuring that the defendant\n\nunderstands the elements of the charges that the prosecution\n\n\n    1  We note that post-sentencing, on February 21, 1997,\ndefendant did file a pro se Motion to Set Aside Sentence, Reduce\nSentence or in the Alternative to Allow Defendant to Withdraw\nHis Plea. The substance of that motion concerned the alleged\nmisunderstandings between Corporán, his counsel and the United\nStates Attorney regarding the recommended sentencing guideline\nrange for the crimes charged. That motion did not direct the\ndistrict court’s attention to the alleged infirmities in the\nRule 11 colloquy that Corporán addresses in this appeal.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwould have to prove at trial.”)(quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).     Here, we find nothing in the record of the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy to indicate that the district court’s description of\n\nthe offenses charged was     inadequate to provide the defendant\n\nwith an understanding of the elements material to his case.\n\n            It is true, as defendant contends, that the district\n\ncourt failed to recite 18 U.S.C. § 1203(b)(2)’s international\n\naspect, i.e., that to be convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1203 an\n\noffender or a victim must be a non-United States national.             But\n\nas already pointed out, supra Part I, the existence of the\n\ninternational element was established by Corporán’s voluntary\n\nadmission in open court.     There was no way for Corporán to have\n\naltered his citizenship however much he learned about this\n\naspect of the charges against him.             The court’s failure to\n\nrecite the international aspect did not constitute plain error.\n\n            Next, Corporán argues that the district court’s bald\n\nreading of the indictment, without providing any supplemental\n\nexplanation or the meaning of key terms, such as “conspiracy,”\n\n“aiding and abetting,” or “willfully and intentionally,” was\n\ninsufficient to apprise him of the charges of hostage taking.\n\nIn some cases, however, simply reading an indictment may satisfy\n\nRule   11's   requirement.   See   Fed.   R.    Crim.   P.   11   advisory\n\ncommittee notes to 1974 Amendments (“The method by which the\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fdefendant’s     understanding        of    the     nature   of   the   charge    is\n\ndetermined     may     vary   from    case    to    case,   depending    on     the\n\ncomplexity of the circumstances and the particular defendant.\n\nIn some cases, a judge may do this by reading the indictment. .\n\n. .”).    This is such a case.            Although, “[c]harges of a complex\n\nnature, including esoteric terms unfamiliar to the lay mind, may\n\nrequire greater explication by the bench,”                   United States v.\n\nMack, 635 F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1980), here, the charges against\n\nCorporán were not complicated.             See United States v. Allard, 926\n\nF.2d 1237, 1245 (1st Cir. 1991).              See also Mack, 635 F.2d at 25\n\n& n. 2 (1st Cir. 1980).        The terms to which the defendant points\n\n-- such as “conspiracy” and “aiding and abetting” -- although\n\nterms of art, were not hard to understand in the context used.\n\nThis is not a case like United States v. Gandia-Maysonet in\n\nwhich    the   judge    and   the    government      throughout    the   Rule    11\n\ncolloquy affirmatively misstated the newly amended mens rea\n\nelement of the crime.           See Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 4-5\n\n(where the Rule 11 colloquy failed to put the defendant on\n\nnotice that to be convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2119, as amended\n\nonly six months previously, the government had to prove the\n\naggravated intent of causing death or serious bodily harm).\n\nThat the court did not embellish the indictment’s recitation of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthe offenses charged does not, in these circumstances, support\n\nCorporán’s claim of a Rule 11 error.\n\n           We further note that the government thoroughly recited\n\nthe facts underlying its case against Corporán – facts to which\n\nCorporán   acceded    and   which,       if   proved,      would    support   a\n\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1203.             These factual recitations\n\nhelped explicate the district court’s reading of the charges by\n\nfleshing out the nature of the conduct to which Corporán was\n\npleading guilty.     See Mack, 635 F.2d at 25.              Cf. Allard, 926\n\nF.2d at 1245 (determining that the prosecutor’s recitation and\n\ndefendant’s    admission    of    the     facts    underlying      the   charge\n\ninsufficient    to   educate      the    defendant    of    the    offense    of\n\ndefrauding a hospital because the fraudulent scheme described by\n\nthe government concerned mailing false licenses to the Board of\n\nRegistration in Medicine and not to a hospital).\n\n           The district court found defendant to be alert and\n\nintelligent,     a    factor       further        confirming       defendant’s\n\nunderstanding of the charges.           We find no error, let alone plain\n\nerror   that   affected     the     fairness,      integrity,      or    public\n\nreputation of the judicial process.           See United States v. Perez-\n\nCarrera, No. 98-1788, slip. op. at 4 & n. 2 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nSavinon-Acosta, 232 F.3d at 268.              We hold that the Rule 11\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcolloquy fairly put defendant on notice of the substance of the\n\ncrimes for which he was charged.\n\n            Corporán’s second attack on his plea points us to the\n\ndistrict court’s failure to inform the defendant that, as a\n\nconsequence of his oath, he could be subject to a charge of\n\nperjury in the event of any false answers.           See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(c)(5).    Although it seems true from the record that Corporán\n\nwas not so advised by the district court, we have held that a\n\ntechnical failure such as this one, standing alone, may be\n\nharmless error.     Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 3 (“Failures to\n\ncomply with very specific, yet technical, requirements of Rule\n\n11 are often found ’harmless,’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).”); United\n\nStates v. Allard, 926 F.2d at 1244 (“Mere technical violations\n\nof [Rule 11's] procedural requirements do not warrant setting\n\naside a plea.”).     Here the question is not just whether the\n\nerror was harmless, but whether plain error was committed.                 As\n\nno perjury charges are pending against Corporán (and he has not\n\nbeen   threatened   with    any),    and   the    Rule    11   colloquy   was\n\notherwise    adequate,     the   district       court’s   omission   rather\n\nobviously does not amount to plain error.\n\nIII.        Adherence to Rule 32\n\n            Corporán’s   third    issue    on    appeal   alleges    various\n\nviolations of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, all of\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fwhich   concern   the   timeliness   with    which    the    defendant   was\n\nprovided with a copy of the presentence report (PSR) and the\n\ngovernment’s objections thereto.          In general, Corporán states\n\nthat he did not have a sufficient opportunity to review his PSR\n\nand thus he requests a remand for re-sentencing.\n\n          The record shows that the defendant’s counsel was not\n\nserved with a copy of the PSR until January 27, 1997 -- less\n\nthan a week before the February 3rd date that was scheduled for\n\nsentencing -- and that he did not receive the government’s\n\nobjections until the morning of February 3rd.              Rule 32 provides\n\nthat, unless waived, the defendant has the right to a copy of\n\nthe PSR no less than thirty-five days prior to sentencing and to\n\nthe government’s objections to the PSR no less than twenty-one\n\ndays prior to sentencing.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(6)(A) and\n\n(B).    Corporán objected to the sentencing going forward on\n\nFebruary 3rd, and the district court appropriately granted him\n\na   continuance   until   February   7,     1997,    the    date   by   which\n\nCorporán’s counsel said he would be ready.           Defense counsel told\n\nthe court that he needed some time to discuss the PSR with his\n\nclient and to go over what he remembered to be some agreements\n\nwith the government that were made back in October, 1996, at the\n\ntime of the guilty plea.      He went on to state that he would be\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\ffiling objections to the PSR and that he would be ready for\n\nsentencing on February 7, 1997.\n\n            The    sentencing    did    not    in    fact    take    place   until\n\nFebruary 12, the February 7th date having been rescheduled after\n\ndefense counsel had sprained his ankle.              On February 12, instead\n\nof filing objections to the PSR as he said he would, defendant\n\ntold the court that he “basically agree[d] with all” of the\n\nobjections filed by the government and argued only that, as a\n\nfirst offender, defendant should be sentenced at the lower end\n\nof the agreed-to guideline range of 188 months to 235 months in\n\nprison.     Defendant now asserts that if more time had been\n\nprovided he would have filed objections to the PSR.                    He relies\n\non the pro se motion he later filed on February 21, 1997 as\n\nsupport for his allegation that he would have disputed the\n\nsentence imposed had he had more time to do so.\n\n            We find no merit in Corporán’s argument on appeal for\n\nresentencing      based   upon   alleged      Rule   32     error.     First,   by\n\nproposing    and    accepting    the    February      7th    sentencing      date,\n\nCorporán waived the lengthier time period provided in Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(b)(6)(A) and (B).             The rule expressly recognizes\n\nthat a defendant may waive these longer periods.                         See id.\n\nSecond, at the February 3rd hearing, the district court informed\n\nthe defendant on the record that unless the government prevailed\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fon its objections, the sentencing guideline range would be 188\n\nto 235 months.      To this, the defense counsel assured the court\n\nthat he had “explained to [his client] all the potential ranges\n\ndepending on the outcome of these objections.”           Defendant had\n\nnotice of the sentencing range and cannot be heard now to claim\n\nsurprise.   Third, on February 12, defense counsel informed the\n\ncourt that “we basically agree with all of [the government’s\n\nobjections].”       Defense counsel’s assurances to the district\n\ncourt on both occasions conforms with the case law in this\n\ncircuit that requires the district court to ascertain from the\n\ndefendant and his counsel that they have had an opportunity to\n\nread and discuss the PSR.     See, e.g., United States v. Manrique,\n\n959 F.2d 1155, 1157 (1st Cir. 1992) (determining that defense\n\ncounsel's statement -- \"with regard to the Presentence Report\n\nand the government's version therein the defendant virtually has\n\nadopted the government's version\" -- sufficient to establish\n\nthat counsel had read the PSR and discussed its contents with\n\nthe   defendant).      Fourth,   at   the   February   12th   sentencing\n\nhearing, after defense counsel explained defendant’s position\n\nthat the appropriate sentence for a first offender is at the\n\nlower end of the guideline range, the defendant himself, when\n\nasked, told the judge that he had nothing else to add.           For all\n\nof these reasons, the defendant cannot now be heard to object\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fthat he was unfairly surprised by the sentence imposed and that\n\nthe basis of the sentence is without proper foundation.                 Given\n\ndefendant’s waiver, defense counsel’s assurances and defendant’s\n\nsilences during the two hearings on sentencing, we can ascertain\n\nno plain error in the district court’s administration of Rule\n\n32.\n\nIV.         Sentencing Error\n\n            Defendant argues, and the government agrees, that the\n\ndistrict judge erred in imposing a concurrent 200 month sentence\n\nfor   a   conviction   on   Count   I,    which   charged   defendant    with\n\nconspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, an offense that\n\nprovides for imprisonment of \"not more than five years.\"                 The\n\njudgment in this case imposed a 200 month sentence on both\n\ncounts without specifically tying that sentence to either count.\n\nHowever,     the   docket    sheet       understandably     describes     the\n\ndisposition for Count I, Conspiracy to Defraud under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371, as being imprisonment for a term of 200 months.            The same\n\nsentence is said to have been imposed for Count II, aiding and\n\nabetting a violation of the Hostage Taking statute, 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1203 and 2.    Thus, the court records indicate the imposition of\n\nconcurrent sentences of 200 months each for Counts I and II,\n\ndespite the fact that Count I, charging conspiracy under 18\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fU.S.C. § 371, carries a maximum penalty of only five years. 2\n\nCorporán was properly advised at the plea colloquy that the\n\nmaximum penalty under Count I was five years.      It was plain\n\nerror, therefore, to sentence Corporán under Count I to 200\n\nmonths, a term of imprisonment 120 months beyond 18 U.S.C. §\n\n371's statutory maximum.     See United States v. Perez-Carrera,\n\nNo. 98-1788, slip. op. at 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001).     As noted, the\n\ngovernment concedes that the sentence under Count I cannot\n\nstand. We therefore remand Count I to the district court with\n\ninstructions to modify the sentence imposed under Count I so as\n\nnot to exceed imprisonment for more than five years.    See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 35(a).     In all other respects, the conviction and\n\nsentence are affirmed.\n\n         So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n    2 Defendant was not charged with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1203, the hostage taking statute itself, which includes within\nits proscription the conspiracy to commit the act of hostage\ntaking and which is punishable by life in prison. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1203.\n\n                               -17-\n\f",

Vega-\nPacheco,   Chief, Criminal Division, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\fApril 3, 2001\n\f            CAMPBELL,   Senior   Circuit   Judge.    Defendant   Félix\n\nCorporán-Cuevas (“Corporán”) was convicted upon a plea of guilty\n\nof the following two offenses: (count I) conspiring, under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371, to violate the federal Hostage Taking statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1203, and (count II) aiding and abetting, under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2, the violation of the federal Hostage Taking statute,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1203.       On appeal he raises four issues which we\n\nconsider seriatim, after a brief recitation of the relevant\n\nfacts.\n\n            On April 18, 1996, in the District of Puerto Rico,\n\ndefendant’s    alleged    co-conspirator     Félix   Beras   and    an\n\nunidentified individual abducted thirteen-year old Carlos de la\n\nRosa Berbera who was traveling in a car with his grandmother,\n\nCarmen Villar-Cordero.     At gun-point, the two kidnapers ordered\n\nMrs. Villar-Cordero out of the car and drove off with her\n\ngrandson.     Two hours later, Mrs. Villar-Cordero received a\n\nransom call, ordering that she produce the child’s parents or\n\nmoney in exchange for her grandson’s freedom.           By then, it\n\nappears that, in addition to Félix Beras, defendant Corporán and\n\ntwo other co-defendants were holding young Carlos.           The FBI\n\nsucceeded in rescuing the child four days later in Rio Piedras.\n\nBoth Corporán and Beras were on the scene and were arrested.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           On the day scheduled for trial -- October 28, 1996 --\n\nCorporán entered and the court accepted a change of plea of\n\nguilty as to Counts I and II.               On February 12, 1997, the\n\ndistrict   court   sentenced     Corporán    to   a    term    of   200    months\n\nimprisonment on Counts I and II.            The court also imposed two\n\nterms of supervised release: three years on Count I and five\n\nyears on Count II, to be served concurrently.                 Corporán filed a\n\ntimely notice of appeal on February 21, 1997.\n\nI.         Elements of the Federal Crime of Hostage Taking\n\n           Defendant argues that the indictment fails to allege\n\none of the essential elements of the crime of hostage taking --\n\nthe so-called international element, see 18 U.S.C. § 1203(b)(2),\n\ninfra -- rendering it fundamentally defective and requiring us\n\nto reverse his conviction notwithstanding his guilty plea.\n\n           Section   1203   of    18   U.S.C.,        the   federal       statute\n\ncriminalizing hostage taking, states, in relevant part,\n\n           (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of\n           this section, whoever, whether inside or\n           outside the United States, seizes or detains\n           and threatens to kill, to injure, or to\n           continue to detain another person in order\n           to compel a third person or a governmental\n           organization to do or abstain from doing any\n           act as an explicit or implicit condition for\n           the release of the person detained, or\n           attempts or conspires to do so, shall be\n           punished by imprisonment for any term of\n           years or for life and, if the death of any\n           person results, shall be punished by death\n           or life imprisonment.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                ....\n\n         (b)(2) It is not an offense under this\n         section if the conduct required for the\n         offense occurred inside the United States,\n         each alleged offender and each person seized\n         or detained are nationals of the United\n         States, and each alleged offender is found\n         in   the    United   States,    unless   the\n         governmental organization sought to be\n         compelled is the Government of the United\n         States.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1203.      Defendant points out that the indictment\n\nfails to allege that he or any other person involved in the\n\nkidnaping of Carlos de la Rosa Berbera were not nationals of the\n\nUnited States (the so-called “international element,” see 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1203(b)(2)).    Defendant argues that the fact that an\n\nalleged offender or victim of the hostage taking is a non-U.S.\n\nnational is an essential jurisdictional element of the offense,\n\nand, as such, had to be alleged in the indictment in order to\n\ncomport with due process.

Given Vuitch, it is arguable that the Fifth Circuit’s\n\nreasoning in Santos-Riviera was incorrect.\n\n            But we need not and do not decide that issue at this\n\ntime.     The uncontraverted facts of record leave no doubt that\n\neven if the so-called international element should have been\n\npleaded    in   the     indictment,    any   error   resulting      from   that\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fomission    was   harmless.         See    Mojica-Baez,         229     F.3d    at   311\n\n(holding that failure of indictment to allege an element of the\n\noffense is subject to harmless error review where the indictment\n\notherwise     provided     the    defendants      with    fair       notice     of   the\n\ncharges against them).            Corporán freely admitted to the court\n\nthat he was a national of the Dominican Republic both at his\n\nchange of plea hearing and again at sentencing.                       That he is not\n\na United States national is undisputed.                        The international\n\nelement of the statute -- even assuming arguendo that it should\n\nhave   been    pleaded     in    the     indictment      --    has    been      plainly\n\nsatisfied,     despite     the     government’s         failure       to     plead    it\n\nexpressly.     Nothing in the record suggests that Corporán could\n\nin any way have been prejudiced by the indictment’s failure to\n\nhave alleged his Dominican citizenship.                 Accordingly, this claim\n\nof error furnishes no basis for reversal.                     See id.\n\nII.         Rule 11 Colloquy\n\n            Defendant’s         second    issue    on    appeal       concerns       the\n\nvalidity of his guilty plea.             Corporán contends that his Rule 11\n\ncolloquy before the district court was fatally flawed in two\n\nrespects:     (1) the district court failed to provide a meaningful\n\nexplanation     of   the   charges       to    which    Corporán       was     pleading\n\nguilty, and (2) the district court failed to advise Corporán,\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(5), that as\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fa consequence of his oath, he could be subject to a charge of\n\nperjury in the event of any false answers.             Defendant failed to\n\nraise these issues below1, hence, our review is governed by the\n\nplain error standard.      See United States v. Savinon-Acosta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199154\"><a href=\"/opinion/199154/united-states-v-savinon-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Where the error was not called\n\nto the district court's attention, appellate review is governed\n\nby the plain error standard, which requires not only an error\n\naffecting substantial rights but also a finding by the reviewing\n\ncourt that the error has seriously affect[ed] the fairness,\n\nintegrity,   or   public   reputation       of     judicial   proceedings.\")\n\n(alteration in original).         Having reviewed the record, we do not\n\nfind plain error.\n\n         Corporán’s first attack on his plea engages one of Rule\n\n11's core concerns -- whether the defendant understood the\n\nnature of the charges against him.           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nGandia-Maysonet,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199077\"><a href=\"/opinion/199077/united-states-v-gandia-maysonet/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   3   (1st    Cir.   2000)   (“[A]   core\n\nconcern of Rule 11 . . . includes ensuring that the defendant\n\nunderstands the elements of the charges that the prosecution\n\n\n    1  We note that post-sentencing, on February 21, 1997,\ndefendant did file a pro se Motion to Set Aside Sentence, Reduce\nSentence or in the Alternative to Allow Defendant to Withdraw\nHis Plea. The substance of that motion concerned the alleged\nmisunderstandings between Corporán, his counsel and the United\nStates Attorney regarding the recommended sentencing guideline\nrange for the crimes charged. That motion did not direct the\ndistrict court’s attention to the alleged infirmities in the\nRule 11 colloquy that Corporán addresses in this appeal.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwould have to prove at trial.”)(quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).     Here, we find nothing in the record of the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy to indicate that the district court’s description of\n\nthe offenses charged was     inadequate to provide the defendant\n\nwith an understanding of the elements material to his case.\n\n            It is true, as defendant contends, that the district\n\ncourt failed to recite 18 U.S.C. § 1203(b)(2)’s international\n\naspect, i.e., that to be convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1203 an\n\noffender or a victim must be a non-United States national.             But\n\nas already pointed out, supra Part I, the existence of the\n\ninternational element was established by Corporán’s voluntary\n\nadmission in open court.     There was no way for Corporán to have\n\naltered his citizenship however much he learned about this\n\naspect of the charges against him.             The court’s failure to\n\nrecite the international aspect did not constitute plain error.\n\n            Next, Corporán argues that the district court’s bald\n\nreading of the indictment, without providing any supplemental\n\nexplanation or the meaning of key terms, such as “conspiracy,”\n\n“aiding and abetting,” or “willfully and intentionally,” was\n\ninsufficient to apprise him of the charges of hostage taking.\n\nIn some cases, however, simply reading an indictment may satisfy\n\nRule   11's   requirement.   See   Fed.   R.    Crim.   P.   11   advisory\n\ncommittee notes to 1974 Amendments (“The method by which the\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fdefendant’s     understanding        of    the     nature   of   the   charge    is\n\ndetermined     may     vary   from    case    to    case,   depending    on     the\n\ncomplexity of the circumstances and the particular defendant.\n\nIn some cases, a judge may do this by reading the indictment. .\n\n. .”).    This is such a case.

See Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 4-5\n\n(where the Rule 11 colloquy failed to put the defendant on\n\nnotice that to be convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2119, as amended\n\nonly six months previously, the government had to prove the\n\naggravated intent of causing death or serious bodily harm).\n\nThat the court did not embellish the indictment’s recitation of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthe offenses charged does not, in these circumstances, support\n\nCorporán’s claim of a Rule 11 error.\n\n           We further note that the government thoroughly recited\n\nthe facts underlying its case against Corporán – facts to which\n\nCorporán   acceded    and   which,       if   proved,      would    support   a\n\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1203.             These factual recitations\n\nhelped explicate the district court’s reading of the charges by\n\nfleshing out the nature of the conduct to which Corporán was\n\npleading guilty.     See Mack, 635 F.2d at 25.              Cf. Allard, 926\n\nF.2d at 1245 (determining that the prosecutor’s recitation and\n\ndefendant’s    admission    of    the     facts    underlying      the   charge\n\ninsufficient    to   educate      the    defendant    of    the    offense    of\n\ndefrauding a hospital because the fraudulent scheme described by\n\nthe government concerned mailing false licenses to the Board of\n\nRegistration in Medicine and not to a hospital).\n\n           The district court found defendant to be alert and\n\nintelligent,     a    factor       further        confirming       defendant’s\n\nunderstanding of the charges.           We find no error, let alone plain\n\nerror   that   affected     the     fairness,      integrity,      or    public\n\nreputation of the judicial process.           See United States v. Perez-\n\nCarrera, No. 98-1788, slip. op. at 4 & n. 2 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nSavinon-Acosta, 232 F.3d at 268.              We hold that the Rule 11\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcolloquy fairly put defendant on notice of the substance of the\n\ncrimes for which he was charged.\n\n            Corporán’s second attack on his plea points us to the\n\ndistrict court’s failure to inform the defendant that, as a\n\nconsequence of his oath, he could be subject to a charge of\n\nperjury in the event of any false answers.           See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(c)(5).    Although it seems true from the record that Corporán\n\nwas not so advised by the district court, we have held that a\n\ntechnical failure such as this one, standing alone, may be\n\nharmless error.     Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d at 3 (“Failures to\n\ncomply with very specific, yet technical, requirements of Rule\n\n11 are often found ’harmless,’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h).”); United\n\nStates v. Allard, 926 F.2d at 1244 (“Mere technical violations\n\nof [Rule 11's] procedural requirements do not warrant setting\n\naside a plea.”).     Here the question is not just whether the\n\nerror was harmless, but whether plain error was committed.                 As\n\nno perjury charges are pending against Corporán (and he has not\n\nbeen   threatened   with    any),    and   the    Rule    11   colloquy   was\n\notherwise    adequate,     the   district       court’s   omission   rather\n\nobviously does not amount to plain error.\n\nIII.        Adherence to Rule 32\n\n            Corporán’s   third    issue    on    appeal   alleges    various\n\nviolations of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, all of\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fwhich   concern   the   timeliness   with    which    the    defendant   was\n\nprovided with a copy of the presentence report (PSR) and the\n\ngovernment’s objections thereto.          In general, Corporán states\n\nthat he did not have a sufficient opportunity to review his PSR\n\nand thus he requests a remand for re-sentencing.\n\n          The record shows that the defendant’s counsel was not\n\nserved with a copy of the PSR until January 27, 1997 -- less\n\nthan a week before the February 3rd date that was scheduled for\n\nsentencing -- and that he did not receive the government’s\n\nobjections until the morning of February 3rd.              Rule 32 provides\n\nthat, unless waived, the defendant has the right to a copy of\n\nthe PSR no less than thirty-five days prior to sentencing and to\n\nthe government’s objections to the PSR no less than twenty-one\n\ndays prior to sentencing.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(6)(A) and\n\n(B).    Corporán objected to the sentencing going forward on\n\nFebruary 3rd, and the district court appropriately granted him\n\na   continuance   until   February   7,     1997,    the    date   by   which\n\nCorporán’s counsel said he would be ready.           Defense counsel told\n\nthe court that he needed some time to discuss the PSR with his\n\nclient and to go over what he remembered to be some agreements\n\nwith the government that were made back in October, 1996, at the\n\ntime of the guilty plea.      He went on to state that he would be\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\ffiling objections to the PSR and that he would be ready for\n\nsentencing on February 7, 1997.\n\n            The    sentencing    did    not    in    fact    take    place   until\n\nFebruary 12, the February 7th date having been rescheduled after\n\ndefense counsel had sprained his ankle.              On February 12, instead\n\nof filing objections to the PSR as he said he would, defendant\n\ntold the court that he “basically agree[d] with all” of the\n\nobjections filed by the government and argued only that, as a\n\nfirst offender, defendant should be sentenced at the lower end\n\nof the agreed-to guideline range of 188 months to 235 months in\n\nprison.     Defendant now asserts that if more time had been\n\nprovided he would have filed objections to the PSR.                    He relies\n\non the pro se motion he later filed on February 21, 1997 as\n\nsupport for his allegation that he would have disputed the\n\nsentence imposed had he had more time to do so.\n\n            We find no merit in Corporán’s argument on appeal for\n\nresentencing      based   upon   alleged      Rule   32     error.     First,   by\n\nproposing    and    accepting    the    February      7th    sentencing      date,\n\nCorporán waived the lengthier time period provided in Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(b)(6)(A) and (B).             The rule expressly recognizes\n\nthat a defendant may waive these longer periods.                         See id.\n\nSecond, at the February 3rd hearing, the district court informed\n\nthe defendant on the record that unless the government prevailed\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fon its objections, the sentencing guideline range would be 188\n\nto 235 months.      To this, the defense counsel assured the court\n\nthat he had “explained to [his client] all the potential ranges\n\ndepending on the outcome of these objections.”           Defendant had\n\nnotice of the sentencing range and cannot be heard now to claim\n\nsurprise.   Third, on February 12, defense counsel informed the\n\ncourt that “we basically agree with all of [the government’s\n\nobjections].”       Defense counsel’s assurances to the district\n\ncourt on both occasions conforms with the case law in this\n\ncircuit that requires the district court to ascertain from the\n\ndefendant and his counsel that they have had an opportunity to\n\nread and discuss the PSR.     See, e.g., United States v. Manrique,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580298\"><a href=\"/opinion/580298/united-states-v-nestor-fernando-manrique-aka-freddy/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (1st Cir. 1992) (determining that defense\n\ncounsel's statement -- \"with regard to the Presentence Report\n\nand the government's version therein the defendant virtually has\n\nadopted the government's version\" -- sufficient to establish\n\nthat counsel had read the PSR and discussed its contents with\n\nthe   defendant).      Fourth,   at   the   February   12th   sentencing\n\nhearing, after defense counsel explained defendant’s position\n\nthat the appropriate sentence for a first offender is at the\n\nlower end of the guideline range, the defendant himself, when\n\nasked, told the judge that he had nothing else to add.           For all\n\nof these reasons, the defendant cannot now be heard to object\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fthat he was unfairly surprised by the sentence imposed and that\n\nthe basis of the sentence is without proper foundation.                 Given\n\ndefendant’s waiver, defense counsel’s assurances and defendant’s\n\nsilences during the two hearings on sentencing, we can ascertain\n\nno plain error in the district court’s administration of Rule\n\n32.\n\nIV.         Sentencing Error\n\n            Defendant argues, and the government agrees, that the\n\ndistrict judge erred in imposing a concurrent 200 month sentence\n\nfor   a   conviction   on   Count   I,    which   charged   defendant    with\n\nconspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, an offense that\n\nprovides for imprisonment of \"not more than five years.\"                 The\n\njudgment in this case imposed a 200 month sentence on both\n\ncounts without specifically tying that sentence to either count.\n\nHowever,     the   docket    sheet       understandably     describes     the\n\ndisposition for Count I, Conspiracy to Defraud under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371, as being imprisonment for a term of 200 months.            The same\n\nsentence is said to have been imposed for Count II, aiding and\n\nabetting a violation of the Hostage Taking statute, 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1203 and 2.    Thus, the court records indicate the imposition of\n\nconcurrent sentences of 200 months each for Counts I and II,\n\ndespite the fact that Count I, charging conspiracy under 18\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fU.S.C. § 371, carries a maximum penalty of only five years. 2\n\nCorporán was properly advised at the plea colloquy that the\n\nmaximum penalty under Count I was five years.      It was plain\n\nerror, therefore, to sentence Corporán under Count I to 200\n\nmonths, a term of imprisonment 120 months beyond 18 U.S.C. §\n\n371's statutory maximum.     See United States v. Perez-Carrera,\n\nNo. 98-1788, slip. op. at 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001).     As noted, the\n\ngovernment concedes that the sentence under Count I cannot\n\nstand. We therefore remand Count I to the district court with\n\ninstructions to modify the sentence imposed under Count I so as\n\nnot to exceed imprisonment for more than five years.    See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 35(a).     In all other respects, the conviction and\n\nsentence are affirmed.\n\n         So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n    2 Defendant was not charged with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1203, the hostage taking statute itself, which includes within\nits proscription the conspiracy to commit the act of hostage\ntaking and which is punishable by life in prison. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1203.\n\n                               -17-\n\f</pre>",
