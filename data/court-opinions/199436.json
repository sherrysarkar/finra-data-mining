Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                     Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Perry D. Wheeler, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Kathleen M. Powers, with whom Marc DeSisto and DeSisto Law were\non brief, for appellees.\n\fJune 11, 2001\n\n\n\n\n     -2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge. This appeal arises from an action\n\nfor damages filed by appellant Geoffrey Gardner against South Kingstown\n\n(Rhode Island) Chief of Police Vincent Vespia pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983. Specifically, appellant alleges that Vespia violated his Second\n\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights when he concluded that Gardner's prior\n\nnolo contendere plea for misdemeanor domestic assault constituted a\n\n\"conviction\" under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), thereby disqualifying him\n\nfrom purchasing a firearm. The district court granted summary judgment\n\nin favor of Vespia, stating that he was entitled to qualified immunity\n\nbecause it was not clearly established whether a \"conviction\" under\n\n§ 922(g)(9) is defined by state or federal law. Because we hold that\n\nappellant has failed to allege the deprivation of a constitutional\n\nright, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          On March 30, 1998, appellant sought to purchase a handgun\n\nfrom Universal Firearms Ltd., a licensed firearms dealer in South\n\nKingstown, Rhode Island. As required by law, appellant completed an\n\napplication for the firearm, which was forwarded to Chief Vespia for a\n\nbackground check. In the course of this check, Vespia learned that in\n\nNovember 1995, appellant had been arrested for domestic assault with a\n\ndangerous weapon. The arrest record indicated that at a pretrial\n\nhearing in January 1996, the charge was amended to simple assault.\n\nAppellant pled nolo contendere to the amended charge and was sentenced\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fto one year of probation. Based upon the Rhode Island Supreme Court's\n\nholding in State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258 (R.I. 1980), which held that a\n\nplea of nolo contendere is equivalent to a plea of guilty, id. at 1266,\n\nVespia concluded that appellant had been convicted of misdemeanor\n\ndomestic assault and was therefore precluded from receiving or\n\npossessing a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).\n\n          When appellant learned that his application had been denied,\n\nhe wrote to Vespia requesting a written explanation. In turn, Vespia\n\ncontacted Agent Joseph M. Riehl of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &\n\nFirearms to review appellant's application. Riehl informed Vespia that\n\nhis assessment of appellant's disqualification appeared correct.\n\nAccordingly, Vespia responded to appellant on April 20, 1998,\n\nexplaining that his plea of nolo contendere to the misdemeanor assault\n\ncharge disqualified him from owning or possessing a firearm under\n\nfederal law.\n\n          On May 28, 1998, appellant filed suit in federal district\n\ncourt for the District of Rhode Island against Vespia pursuant to 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983. In particular, appellant claimed that Chief Vespia\n\nlacked the authority to block his purchase of a firearm and that\n\nVespia's actions violated his rights under the Second and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the Constitution. On a motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court ruled in favor of Vespia, concluding that he acted\n\nwithin his legal authority under federal, state and local law and that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fhe was entitled to qualified immunity for his actions. We review the\n\nsummary judgment ruling de novo. Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f                              DISCUSSION\n\n            In evaluating appellant's § 1983 claim, the district court\n\ndetermined that Chief Vespia was entitled to the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity.    Gardner v. Vespia, No. 98-292ML (D.R.I. Mar. 24, 2000)\n\n(order granting summary judgment).      This defense \"shields public\n\nofficials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil\n\ndamages, insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\n\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.\" Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525,\n\n530-31 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n\n(1982)) (internal quotations omitted).1      However, \"[a] necessary\n\nconcomitant to the determination of whether the constitutional right\n\nasserted by a plaintiff is 'clearly established' at the time the\n\ndefendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has\n\nasserted the violation of a constitutional right at all.\" Id. at 531\n\n1  Gardner argues that the defense of qualified immunity is not\navailable to Vespia because the background check at issue was mandated\nby law and thus \"ministerial\" and not \"discretionary.\" See Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982) (noting that the qualified-\nimmunity defense shields government officials exercising \"discretionary\nfunctions\"). He is wrong. Even if there is a viable ministerial-duty\nexception to the qualified immunity doctrine, but see, e.g., Sellers v.\nBaer, 28 F.3d 895, 902 (8th Cir. 1994) (opining that the exception is\na \"dead letter\" and collecting opinions expressing skepticism as to\nwhether a distinction should be drawn between discretionary and\nministerial duties for purposes of a qualified-immunity analysis), we\nhave rejected its applicability where, as here, a law enforcement\nofficer is sued for a judgment made about whether and how a given law\napplies to a given set of facts, see Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2, 11-12\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                  -6-\n\f(quoting Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991)); see also Wilson\n\nv. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999). A cause of action brought under §\n\n1983, then, reverses the normal order of judicial analysis and requires\n\nthat we consider the constitutional question first; \"[t]his order of\n\nprocedure is designed to 'spare a defendant not only unwarranted\n\nliability, but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those\n\ndefending a long drawn-out lawsuit.'\" Wilson, 526 U.S. at 609 (quoting\n\nSiegert, 500 U.S. at 232).2\n\n          Appellant claims that his Second and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights were violated in two ways.      First, he asserts that Vespia\n\ntransgressed his rights by conducting a background check in violation\n\nof state law. However, even if Gardner is correct that Vespia violated\n\nstate law, such a violation would not constitute a violation of\n\nGardner's Second and/or Fourteenth Amendment rights, as was pleaded.\n\nIn other words, Gardner simply has no federal right to demand that\n\nVespia stay within the confines of state law in conducting background\n\nchecks of those purchasing firearms.\n\n          Gardner's second argument is that Vespia misinterpreted the\n\nlaw in determining that his prior nolo contendere plea constituted a\n\n\"conviction\" for purposes of § 922(g)(9). The constitutional question,\n\n\n\n2 As the Supreme Court noted, this approach \"promotes clarity in the\nlegal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both the\nofficers and the general public.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609\n(1999).\n\n                                 -7-\n\ftherefore, is whether an erroneous denial of a firearm amounts to a\n\nconstitutional violation.     It does not.3\n\nAs Gardner acknowledges, the Second Amendment does not confer an\n\nabsolute right to bear arms. United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174,\n\n178 (1939) (holding that Second Amendment does not invalidate\n\nlimitations on firearms that do not have a reasonable relationship to\n\na well-regulated militia). Consequently, even if Gardner was not, in\n\nfact, disqualified from purchasing a firearm, Vespia's conclusion to\n\nthe contrary did not violate any constitutional right to own that\n\nfirearm.   Using the magic words of \"freedom of contract\" as an\n\nalternative constitutional ground does not alter this result.4 \"[W]here\n\nanother provision of the Constitution provides an explicit textual\n\nsource of constitutional protection, a court must assess a plaintiff's\n\nclaims under that explicit provision and not the more generalized\n\nnotion of 'substantive due process.'\" See Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S.\n\n\n3 We note that the facts alleged by appellant do not demonstrate that\nin denying appellant's application, Vespia engaged in any kind of\n\"purposeful discrimination\" which might constitute a violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Medina v. Rudman,\n545 F.2d 244, 249 (1st Cir. 1976).\n4 Appellant premises this right on Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S.\n564 (1972). Roth repeated the pronouncement of Meyer v. Nebraska, 262\nU.S. 390 (1923), that the meaning of \"liberty\" in the Fourteenth\nAmendment includes \"the right to contract.\" Roth, 408 U.S. at 572.\nAlthough, as stated above, Gardner's claim is not properly analyzed\nunder this provision, we note that cases interpreting the \"liberties\"\noutlined in Meyer have construed them quite narrowly. See, e.g., Conn\nv. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 291 (1999) (refusing to read Roth and Meyer\nto stand for specific rights not articulated therein).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f286, 293 (1999) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989)).\n\nThe thrust of Gardner's challenge is the infringement upon his right to\n\nbear arms, and Second Amendment jurisprudence provides an adequate\n\nanswer to this challenge.\n\n          The facts alleged by Gardner, even if true, do not allege the\n\nviolation of an actual constitutional right. Accordingly, Vespia is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity for his actions.5\n\n          The decision of the district court is hereby affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n5 In rendering judgment against Gardner on grounds of qualified\nimmunity, the court did not address Gardner's prayer for injunctive\nrelief. Gardner does not, however, assign error to this omission in\nhis appellate brief.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Specifically, appellant alleges that Vespia violated his Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights when he concluded that Gardner's prior nolo contendere plea for misdemeanor domestic assault constituted a \"conviction\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9), thereby disqualifying him from purchasing a firearm. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Vespia, stating that he was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established whether a \"conviction\" under &#167; 922(g)(9) is defined by state or federal law. Because we hold that appellant has failed to allege the deprivation of a constitutional right, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 30, 1998, appellant sought to purchase a handgun from Universal Firearms Ltd., a licensed firearms dealer in South Kingstown, Rhode Island. As required by law, appellant completed an application for the firearm, which was forwarded to Chief Vespia for a background check. In the course of this check, Vespia learned that in November 1995, appellant had been arrested for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon. The arrest record indicated that at a pretrial hearing in January 1996, the charge was amended to simple assault. Appellant pled nolo contendere to the amended charge and was sentenced to one year of probation. Based upon the Rhode Island Supreme Court's holding in State v. Feng, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260025\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260025/state-v-feng/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span> (R.I. 1980), which held that a plea of nolo contendere is equivalent to a plea of guilty, id. at 1266, Vespia concluded that appellant had been convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault and was therefore precluded from receiving or possessing a firearm under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When appellant learned that his application had been denied, he wrote to Vespia requesting a written explanation. In turn, Vespia contacted Agent Joseph M. Riehl of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms to review appellant's application. Riehl informed Vespia that his assessment of appellant's disqualification appeared correct. Accordingly, Vespia responded to appellant on April 20, 1998, explaining that his plea of nolo contendere to the misdemeanor assault charge disqualified him from owning or possessing a firearm under federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1998, appellant filed suit in federal district court for the District of Rhode Island against Vespia pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. In particular, appellant claimed that Chief Vespia lacked the authority to block his purchase of a firearm and that Vespia's actions violated his rights under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. On a motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled in favor of Vespia, concluding that he acted within his legal authority under federal, state and local law and that he was entitled to qualified immunity for his actions. We review the summary judgment ruling de novo. Swain v. Spinney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197434\"><a href=\"/opinion/197434/swain-v-roe/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating appellant's &#167; 1983 claim, the district court determined that Chief Vespia was entitled to the defense of qualified immunity. Gardner v. Vespia, No. 98-292ML (D.R.I. Mar. 24, 2000) (order granting summary judgment). This defense \"shields public officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages, insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Brown v. Hot, Sexy &amp; Safer Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706820\"><a href=\"/opinion/706820/ronald-c-brown-v-hot-sexy-and-safer-productions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 530-31 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818 (1982)) (internal quotations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> However, \"[a] necessary concomitant to the determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is 'clearly established' at the time the defendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted the violation of a constitutional right at all.\" Id. at 531 (quoting Siegert v. Gilley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112594\"><a href=\"/opinion/112594/siegert-v-gilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 232 (1991)); see also Wilson v. Layne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 609 (1999). A cause of action brought under &#167; 1983, then, reverses the normal order of judicial analysis and requires that we consider the constitutional question first; \"[t]his order of procedure is designed to 'spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability, but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long drawn-out lawsuit.'\" Wilson, 526 U.S. at 609 (quoting Siegert, 500 U.S. at 232).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that his Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated in two ways. First, he asserts that Vespia transgressed his rights by conducting a background check in violation of state law. However, even if Gardner is correct that Vespia violated state law, such a violation would not constitute a violation of Gardner's Second and/or Fourteenth Amendment rights, as was pleaded. In other words, Gardner simply has no federal right to demand that Vespia stay within the confines of state law in conducting background checks of those purchasing firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gardner's second argument is that Vespia misinterpreted the law in determining that his prior nolo contendere plea constituted a \"conviction\" for purposes of &#167; 922(g)(9). The constitutional question, therefore, is whether an erroneous denial of a firearm amounts to a constitutional violation. It does not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Gardner acknowledges, the Second Amendment does not confer an absolute right to bear arms. United States v. Miller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103203\"><a href=\"/opinion/103203/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 178 (1939) (holding that Second Amendment does not invalidate limitations on firearms that do not have a reasonable relationship to a well-regulated militia). Consequently, even if Gardner was not, in fact, disqualified from purchasing a firearm, Vespia's conclusion to the contrary did not violate any constitutional right to own that firearm. Using the magic words of \"freedom of contract\" as an alternative constitutional ground does not alter this result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> \"[W]here another provision of the Constitution provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection, a court must assess a plaintiff's claims under that explicit provision and not the more generalized notion of 'substantive due process.'\" See Conn v. Gabbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118276\"><a href=\"/opinion/118276/conn-v-gabbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 293 (1999) (quoting Graham v. Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 395 (1989)). The thrust of Gardner's challenge is the infringement upon his right to bear arms, and Second Amendment jurisprudence provides an adequate answer to this challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts alleged by Gardner, even if true, do not allege the violation of an actual constitutional right. Accordingly, Vespia is entitled to qualified immunity for his actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Gardner argues that the defense of qualified immunity is not available to Vespia because the background check at issue was mandated by law and thus \"ministerial\" and not \"discretionary.\" See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818 (1982) (noting that the qualified-immunity defense shields government officials exercising \"discretionary functions\"). He is wrong. Even if there is a viable ministerial-duty exception to the qualified immunity doctrine, but see, e.g., Sellers v. Baer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673504\"><a href=\"/opinion/673504/tina-marie-sellers-by-and-through-her-guardian-natural-mother-and-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span>, 902 (8th Cir. 1994) (opining that the exception is a \"dead letter\" and collecting opinions expressing skepticism as to whether a distinction should be drawn between discretionary and ministerial duties for purposes of a qualified-immunity analysis), we have rejected its applicability where, as here, a law enforcement officer is sued for a judgment made about whether and how a given law applies to a given set of facts, see Horta v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629115\"><a href=\"/opinion/629115/debra-horta-v-charles-b-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 11-12 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As the Supreme Court noted, this approach \"promotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both the officers and the general public.\" Wilson v. Layne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 609 (1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that the facts alleged by appellant do not demonstrate that in denying appellant's application, Vespia engaged in any kind of \"purposeful discrimination\" which might constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Medina v. Rudman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340653\"><a href=\"/opinion/340653/geraldine-c-medina-v-warren-b-rudman/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 249 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellant premises this right on Board of Regents v.

Roth repeated the pronouncement of Meyer v.
