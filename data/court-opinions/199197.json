Richard, Petit, and Hall\n\n(defendants) appeal from their respective convictions and sentences\n\nimposed after a jury returned guilty verdicts for conspiracy,\n\nbankruptcy fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and securities fraud\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 152, 1314, 1956(a)(1)(A)(i),\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i), 1957, and 15 U.S.C. § 77q.      The district court had\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3231, and we have jurisdiction\n\nover these timely filed appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3742(a).   We affirm.\n\n                                 I\n\n         Between 1989 and 1997, Catherine Duffy Petit, Paul\n\nRichard, David Hall, and several associates participated in a\n\nmultifarious criminal scheme pivoting around an effort to finance\n\nPetit’s multi-million dollar civil lawsuit against Key Bank of Maine\n\n(Key Bank) and the law firm of Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer and Nelson\n\n(Bernstein Shur).\n\n         In the late 1980's Petit became involved in a series of\n\nlegal battles with Key Bank and her former attorneys, Bernstein Shur.\n\nIn 1989 Petit persuaded Thomas Blackburn, a Maine attorney, to assist\n\nher in raising money to maintain her lawsuit against Key Bank and\n\nBernstein Shur, and to pay her living expenses.      Blackburn began\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\flocating investors willing to purchase stakes in the outcome of the\n\nlitigation.   Investors were told that the lawsuit was a “sure thing”\n\nand were promised that payments would be made when the case was\n\nsettled.   In addition, they were told that the investments were\n\nbacked by a multi-million dollar escrow account.     In return for their\n\ninvestment, investors were given assignments, signed by Petit and\n\nwitnessed by Blackburn, that agreed to pay up to double the\n\ninvestment, plus 18% of the lawsuit proceeds, usually within six\n\nmonths of the investment.\n\n           In October 1990, Bernstein Shur settled with Petit.   The\n\nlawsuit continued against Key Bank.   The settlement was used by Petit\n\nand Blackburn to entice yet more investors, and, between 1990 and\n\n1995, Petit and Blackburn expanded the scheme, recruiting several\n\nindividuals to enlarge its fund-raising capacity.     Petit and her\n\nassociates continued to raise money even after the last remaining\n\ncount of the lawsuit was dismissed in May of 1995.     The dismissal of\n\nthe lawsuit was never divulged to the investors.     After the lawsuit\n\nwas dismissed, Blackburn extricated himself from the operation.       He\n\nhad helped Petit raise approximately $4.2 million.\n\n           During this period, Richard played an important and\n\nversatile role in the operation, acting variously as Petit’s\n\ncompanion, liaison, and enforcer, among other things.     He arranged\n\nmeetings, subdued anxious investors, and threatened Blackburn when he\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fannounced his desire to withdraw.\n\n            The scheme broadened in 1993 to include further criminal\n\nconduct when Petit was forced into Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy\n\n(later converted into Chapter 11) by creditors unrelated to the\n\ninstant case.    Maintaining that the lawsuit was her only asset, Petit\n\ndirected Richard and two other associates to set up a dummy\n\ncorporation, HER, Inc., with which to conceal assets from the\n\nbankruptcy court.    During the course of the bankruptcy proceedings,\n\nPetit falsely denied receiving any income from the sale of her\n\ninterest in the litigation, and she and her associates acted to\n\nconceal assets from the bankruptcy court, the trustee, and her\n\ncreditors in the bankruptcy proceedings, primarily through the use of\n\nHER, Inc.\n\n            In late 1994, David Hall, a licensed broker-dealer for Sun\n\nLife Assurance of Canada, joined the scheme, soliciting funds from\n\nseveral of his clients, many of whom were elderly.    Arguing that\n\ntheir Sun Life investments were not performing adequately, Hall\n\nsuggested a risk-free, high-interest alternative.    He specifically\n\ntold two investors that the investment was in Petit’s lawsuit, which\n\nhe asserted was secured by a large escrow account.    He informed\n\nneither of them that Petit was in bankruptcy, nor did he inform them\n\nof the lawsuit’s dismissal in 1995.    As Hall solicited more\n\ninvestors, he became yet more duplicitous, often asserting that the\n\n\n                                -5-\n\finvestment was in real estate.    Hall forwarded the funds he received\n\nfrom investors to HER, Inc., via Richard and other associates,\n\nkeeping a percentage for himself.\n\n         The fund-raising and money laundering scheme continued\n\nuntil 1997, when a Maine state investigation into HER, Inc. led to\n\nthe arrests of Petit and several of her associates.     The operation\n\nhad raised over $8 million between 1989 and 1997, the bulk of which\n\nwas used to finance Petit’s profligate lifestyle.\n\n         A federal grand jury in the District of Maine indicted\n\ndefendants for a multitude of offenses.     Count 1 charged Petit,\n\nRichard, and Hall with conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud, mail\n\nfraud, money laundering, and securities fraud in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 371 and 2.   Counts 2 through 13 charged them with\n\nbankruptcy fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 152 and 2.     Counts 14\n\nthrough 26 charged them with mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1314 and 2.   Counts 27 through 47 charged them with money laundering\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1)(A) and 2.     Counts 48 through\n\n62 charged them with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 2.   Counts 63 through 75 charged them with money\n\nlaundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1957 and 2.     Counts 76\n\nthrough 87 charged them with securities fraud in violation of 15\n\nU.S.C. § 77q and 18 U.S.C. § 2.     Count 88 alleged criminal forfeiture\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(a)(1), 1957, 982, and 2.\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f          At the end of the government’s case at trial, each of the\n\ndefendants     moved for a judgment of acquittal, which were granted on\n\nCounts 10, 15, 20, 23 through 26, and 86 of the indictment.      The\n\ncourt also granted a judgment of acquittal with respect to Hall on\n\nthe bankruptcy fraud counts (Counts 2 through 13, and Counts 27\n\nthrough 62).     Motions directed at other counts were denied.   The jury\n\nfound Petit guilty on all counts submitted to them (Counts 1, 2-3, 5-\n\n9, 11-13, 14, 16-19, 21-22, 27-85, 87).     They found Richard guilty on\n\nCount 1 (conspiracy), Counts 2, 4, and 9 through 13 (bankruptcy\n\nfraud), but not guilty on Count 7 (bankruptcy fraud).     He was found\n\nguilty of all remaining mail fraud, money laundering and securities\n\nfraud counts (Counts 14, 16 through 19, 21, 22, 27 through 85, and\n\n87).   The jury found Hall guilty of conspiracy (Count 1), three\n\ncounts of mail fraud (Count 16, 17, and 19), five counts of money\n\nlaundering (Counts 65, 68, 71, 72, and 74), and ten counts of\n\nsecurities fraud (Counts 76 through 85).     He was found not guilty of\n\nfour counts of mail fraud (Counts 14, 18, 21, and 22), eight counts\n\nof money laundering (Counts 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 73, and 75), and\n\none count of securities fraud (Count 87).\n\n          Each defendant submitted a Rule 29 motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal on several counts and the court acquitted defendants on the\n\nmoney laundering charges alleged in Counts 48 through 53, 55 through\n\n57, 59 through 67, 69 through 71, and 73 through 75.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f                               II\n\n         We first address Hall's contentions.     He argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal of the remaining money laundering counts in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1957.   He alleges that the government failed to prove all of\n\nthe elements of an 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) offense.    Pursuant to section\n\n1957(a), the government must show that Hall (1) knowingly engaged or\n\nattempted to engage in a monetary transaction (2) in criminally\n\nderived property (3) of a value greater than $10,000, and (4) derived\n\nfrom specified unlawful activity.   First, Hall argues that the\n\ngovernment did not prove that he engaged in a monetary transaction.\n\nSecond, he argues that his acquittal on all bankruptcy fraud counts\n\nrequires an acquittal on all money laundering counts because the\n\nmoney laundering counts listed bankruptcy fraud as the specified\n\nunderlying offense.   Third, he contends that the funds he received\n\nfrom his investors and transferred to his associates were not the\n\nproceeds of the bankruptcy fraud at the time of the transfer and,\n\ntherefore, were not criminally derived property at the time of Hall’s\n\ntransfers.\n\n         \"The denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nis reviewed de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder\n\ncould have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with\n\nall reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n                              -8-\n\fgovernment, established each element of the particular offense beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.\"    United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 67 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n                                A.\n\n         Hall’s first argument raises a discrete question of\n\nstatutory interpretation:    whether the delivery or transfer of a\n\ncheck, which is the proceeds of unlawful activity, to another person\n\nis a monetary transaction within the meaning of section 1957(a).     The\n\ngovernment argues that a “monetary transaction” occurred every time\n\nHall received a check from an investor and handed it over to a co-\n\nconspirator, who, in turn, would deposit the check into the HER, Inc.\n\nbank account.    In reply, Hall contends that he did not engage in any\n\n“monetary transactions” because the transactions he engaged in were\n\ntransfers to persons and not deposits into a financial institution.\n\n         The term “monetary transaction” is defined in section\n\n1957(f)(1) as:\n\n         . . . the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange,\n         in or affecting interstate commerce or foreign\n         commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument (as\n         defined in section 1956(c)(5) of this title) by,\n         through, or to a financial institution    . . .\n         including any transaction that would be a financial\n         transaction under section 1956(c)(4)(B) of this title\n         . . . ”\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 1957(f)(1).   Section 1956(c)(4)(B) defines “financial\n\ntransaction” as “a transaction involving the use of a financial\n\ninstitution which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect,\n\ninterstate commerce in any way or degree.”   18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956(c)(4)(B).   The term “monetary instrument” is defined in section\n\n1956(c)(5), and includes “currency of the United States,” “personal\n\nchecks,” and “bank checks.”   18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(5).\n\n          We interpret these provisions to mean that giving\n\ncriminally derived checks to a co-conspirator, who deposits them into\n\na bank account, is a transfer to, and involves the use of, a\n\nfinancial institution, which satisfies the definition of “monetary\n\ntransaction” in section 1957(f)(1).   Further, transferring funds to a\n\nco-conspirator involves monetary instruments, namely the currency or\n\nchecks   involved, which satisfies section 1956(c)(5).\n\n          In this case, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to\n\nfind that Hall accepted checks, known to him to be derived from\n\nunlawful activity, exercised control over them, and transferred them\n\nto associates for the very purpose of having them deposit the checks\n\ninto a bank account.   Thus, a jury could conclude from the evidence\n\npresented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,\n\nthat the conduct alleged in the indictment constitutes a monetary\n\ntransaction under 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a).\n\n                               B.\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f         Hall next contends that he cannot be convicted of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1957(a) because he was not convicted of bankruptcy fraud,\n\nthe underlying offense listed in the section 1957 monetary\n\ntransaction counts in the indictment.   He maintains that because the\n\njury acquitted him of the offense by which he allegedly obtained the\n\nmoney, there was no criminally derived property and, thus, no\n\nviolation.\n\n         The Eighth Circuit has held that “the fact that the jury\n\ndid not convict [defendant] on the relevant underlying . . . charges\n\ndoes not undermine the money-laundering convictions . . . . The only\n\nrelevant question when reconciling inconsistent verdicts . . . is\n\nwhether there was enough evidence presented to support the\n\nconviction.”   United States v. Whatley, 133 F.3d 601, 605-606 (8th\n\nCir. 1998); see also McIntosh v. United States 2000 WL 1206564, at *4\n\n(S.D. Ind. 2000) (“Even where the government formally charges the\n\nmoney laundering defendant with a separate offense constituting the\n\n‘specified unlawful activity,’ acquittal on the underlying charge\n\ndoes not necessarily defeat the money laundering charge.”).     We are\n\npersuaded that the Eighth Circuit states the correct rule.\n\nInconsistent verdicts “do[] not indicate that the government\n\nnecessarily failed to prove an essential element of its case beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"   United States v. Sullivan 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) quoting United States v. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f1996).     On their own, inconsistent verdicts are not sufficient\n\ngrounds for reversing a criminal conviction as long as the appellate\n\ncourt is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence present to\n\nsupport the conviction.     Id.   A jury may acquit a defendant as to one\n\nor more charges for any number of reasons, and yet come to the\n\nreasonable conclusion that the defendant was guilty of other related\n\ncharges.     United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 64-65, 105 S.Ct. 471,\n\n476-477 (1984).\n\n            Furthermore, a conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a)\n\ndoes not require proof that the defendant committed the specified\n\npredicate offense, United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1234 (1st\n\nCir. 1995); it merely requires proof that the monetary transaction\n\nconstituted the proceeds of a predicate offense.         United States v.\n\nMankarious, 151 F.3d 694, 703 (7th Cir. 1998).         Moreover, while “[a]\n\ndefendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew\n\nthat the transaction involved ‘criminally derived’ property . . . he\n\nneed not have known that the subject property was derived from\n\n‘specified unlawful activity.’”          Gabriele, 63 F.3d at 65 (citations\n\nomitted).     Since a monetary transaction conviction does not require\n\nproof of a specific offense, nor that Hall knew that the subject\n\nproperty was derived from specified unlawful activity, Hall’s\n\nacquittal of the bankruptcy fraud charges did not have any effect on\n\nhis monetary transaction convictions.         See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f703.\n\n                                 C.\n\n            Hall attacks his section 1957 convictions from yet another\n\nangle.     He contends that, under United States v. Johnson, 971 F.2d\n\n562, 368-70 (10th Cir. 1992), the underlying act of bankruptcy fraud\n\nmust be “complete” before a violation can occur, and that bankruptcy\n\nfraud was not “complete” when he transferred money to his associates.\n\nHe, thus, argues that the funds he transferred did not constitute the\n\nproceeds of bankruptcy fraud – the specified unlawful activity listed\n\nin the monetary transaction charge –      at the time of the transfers\n\nand, therefore, were not “criminally derived property” pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1957(f)(2).     Section 1957(f)(2) defines “criminally derived\n\nproperty” as “any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds\n\nobtained from a criminal offense.”      A defendant may not be convicted\n\nunder section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved\n\n“criminally derived” property, but he need not know that the property\n\nwas derived from the “specified unlawful activity.”      18 U.S.C. §\n\n1957(c).     In other words, the government must prove (1) that Hall had\n\ngeneral knowledge of the subject property’s criminal nature, and (2)\n\nthat the property, in fact, was derived from a specified offense\n\nlisted in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7).      18 U.S.C. § 1957(f)(3).   The\n\ngovernment need not prove that Hall had knowledge of the specified\n\noffense, or that he committed it.\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f            Based upon Hall’s convictions of both mail fraud and\n\nsecurities fraud, it is clear that he had sufficient knowledge that\n\nthe money he received from his investors – the subject property – was\n\ncriminally derived.     Each check he received from his victims was the\n\nproduct of his unlawful activities.     Thus, it is evident that the\n\nmonetary transactions Hall engaged in were “in criminally derived\n\nproperty,” and that he had knowledge of that fact.\n\n            However, the gravamen of Hall’s argument is that the\n\nsubject property was not derived from bankruptcy fraud, which was the\n\nspecified predicate offense listed in the money laundering and\n\nmonetary transaction counts of the indictment (mail fraud and\n\nsecurities fraud were not listed).     Hall argues that the subject\n\nproperty did not constitute criminally derived proceeds because the\n\nbankruptcy fraud was not complete when he transferred the money to\n\nhis associates.     He alleges that the bankruptcy fraud was not\n\ncomplete until the funds were deposited into the HER, Inc. bank\n\naccount.     According to this argument, the predicate act of bankruptcy\n\nfraud must be “complete” before a section 1957 violation can occur.\n\nFor this proposition he relies on a Tenth Circuit case, United States\n\nv. Johnson.     971 F.2d at 569-570.\n\n            Johnson is distinguishable from the case before us,\n\nhowever.     Johnson involved the laundering of funds derived from wire\n\nfraud.     The court concluded that the defendant could not have engaged\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fin a transaction in criminally derived property because he did not\n\npossess the proceeds of the wire fraud until after the completion of\n\nthe wire transfer.     Id.   That is, the only use of wires in Johnson to\n\nprove the predicate wire fraud were the very transfers that allegedly\n\ninvolved “criminally derived property” under 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a).\n\nThus, when the court in      Johnson used the language of time to\n\ndescribe the relationship between the money laundering and the\n\npredicate offense, \"it really was just worried about the definition\n\nof proceeds.\"     See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 704-705.   As the 10th\n\nCircuit explained in Johnson, money laundering criminalizes a\n\ntransaction in proceeds, not the transaction that creates the\n\nproceeds.     971 F.2d at 570.   Thus, “the laundering of funds cannot\n\noccur in the same transaction through which those funds first became\n\ntainted by crime.”     United States v. Butler, 211 F.3d 826, 830 (4th\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n            This law does not assist Hall, however.   Although 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1957 does not define when money becomes “proceeds,” the\n\nThird and Fourth Circuits have held that “proceeds are derived from\n\nan already completed offense, or a completed phase of an ongoing\n\noffense.”     United States v. Conley, 37 F.3d 970, 980 (3rd Cir. 1994)\n\n(emphasis added); Butler, 211 F.3d at 829; see also Mankarious, 151\n\nF.3d at 705 (explaining that a fraud scheme can produce proceeds long\n\nbefore the act that ultimately triggers federal jurisdiction).         At\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\ftrial, the government introduced sufficient evidence from which a\n\njury could conclude that the receipt of checks by Hall from his\n\ninvestors constituted a completed phase of bankruptcy fraud.     Hall\n\nwas recruited to join Petit’s fund-raising operation in 1994, after\n\nthe bankruptcy fraud phase of the scheme had begun.     After Petit\n\nentered into bankruptcy in 1993, she and her associates immediately\n\nbegan concealing all financial transactions relating to her lone\n\nlisted asset, the Key Bank lawsuit, from the bankruptcy trustee.\n\nThus, a jury could find from the evidence presented that Petit and\n\nher associates engaged in the concealment of assets from the\n\nbankruptcy trustee immediately upon receipt of the checks by Hall,\n\nand that Hall’s acceptance of the checks constituted a completed\n\nphase in the ongoing bankruptcy fraud.\n\n          In this case, the defendants’ fraudulent scheme generated\n\nproceeds, and then Hall committed separate acts to launder the\n\nproceeds after he took them into his possession.     As the Seventh\n\nCircuit held in Mankarious, “[b]ecause . . .   money laundering does\n\nnot focus on the specifics of the predicate offense, it does not\n\nmatter when all the acts constituting the predicate offense take\n\nplace.   It matters only that the predicate offense has produced\n\nproceeds in transactions distinct from those transactions allegedly\n\nconstituting money laundering.”   151 F.3d at 706.    Thus, the district\n\ncourt properly denied Hall’s Rule 29 motion of acquittal for section\n\n\n                              -16-\n\f1957(a) money laundering.\n\n\n\n                              III\n\n         Defendants Petit and Richard contend that the district\n\ncourt’s imposition of attorneys' fees in their respective restitution\n\norders was erroneous.   Petit’s and Richard’s presentence reports\n\nrecommended restitution in the amount of $7,999,005 pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3663A and U.S.S.G. § 5E1.1.   This amount included $355,903\n\nfor legal fees expended by the victims.    Both Petit and Richard\n\nobjected to the $7,999,005 total at sentencing, but did not\n\nspecifically object to the imposition of attorneys' fees.     On appeal,\n\nPetit and Richard contend that the inclusion of attorneys' fees\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3663A constitutes error and, therefore, must\n\nbe reversed.\n\n         The government contends that because they did not\n\nspecifically object to the inclusion of attorneys' fees, they did not\n\npreserve the issue for appellate review.    In addition, the government\n\ncontends that the imposition of attorneys' fees in the restitution\n\norders was proper pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3663A because the victims’\n\nlegal expenses were losses reasonably foreseeable.\n\n         Because the record on appeal reflects that the defendants\n\ndid not specifically object to the inclusion of attorneys’ fees, our\n\nreview is for plain error.   United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255,\n\n\n                              -17-\n\f264 (1st Cir. 1996).   Under the plain error standard we will review\n\nfor particularly “egregious” or “obvious” legal error, Negron v.\n\nCaleb Brett U.S.A., Inc., 212 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Merric, 166 F.3d 406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999), which our\n\nfailure to consider would result in a “miscarriage of justice” or\n\nwould seriously affect the “fairness, integrity or public reputation\n\nof judicial proceedings.”     Negron 212 F.3d at 672, quoting Cambridge\n\nPlating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 767 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n         Petit and Richard were sentenced and ordered to pay\n\nrestitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A and 3664 (the Mandatory\n\nVictim Restitution Act of 1996) (the Act).     Congress amended 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3663 (the Victim and Witness Protection Act) in 1996 in an\n\neffort to guarantee restitution to the victims of criminal conduct.\n\nUnder the Act, a district court must order the payment of restitution\n\nin the full amount of the victim’s loss without considering the\n\ndefendant’s ability to pay.     18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A and 3664(f)(1)(A).\n\n         In cases where restitution is ordered for offenses\n\nresulting in the loss of property, section 3663A(b)(1) provides that\n\nthe district court shall require defendants to pay victims an amount\n\nequal to (1) the greater of (a) the value of the property on the date\n\nof the damage, loss, or destruction; or (b) the value of the property\n\non the date of sentencing, less (2) the value of any part of the\n\nproperty that is returned.     18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(1)(B).   The language\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fcontained in this provision is identical to the language in the prior\n\nprovision, 18 U.S.C. § 3663(b)(1), with the exception of the use of\n\n“shall” in place of “may,” thereby obviating the district court’s\n\ndiscretion.\n\n         A majority of the circuits have held that restitution\n\nunder section 3663(b)(1) cannot include consequential damages.\n\nGovernment of Virgin Islands v, Davis, 43 F.3d 41, 45 (3rd Cir.\n\n1994); United States v. Patty, 992 F.2d 1045, 1049 (10th Cir. 1993);\n\nUnited States v. Mullins, 971 F.2d 1138, 1147 (4th Cir. 1992); United\n\nStates v. Arvanitis, 902 F.2d 489, 497 (7th Cir. 1990); United States\n\nv. Walker, 896 F.2d 295, 307 n. 26 (8th Cir. 1990); United States v.\n\nBarany, 884 F.2d 1255, 1260-1261 (9th Cir. 1989); United States v.\n\nMitchell, 876 F.2d 1178, 1184 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\n         The government contends that Congress substantially\n\nbroadened the scope of section 3663 when it enacted section 3663A in\n\n1996, rendering these cases irrelevant because they deal with section\n\n3663(b)(1), and not section 3663A(b)(1).   Further, the government\n\nargues that our decision in United States v. Collins, 209 F.3d 1 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), is directly on point, and requires us to conclude that\n\nthe inclusion of attorneys' fees is authorized by the Act when legal\n\nexpenses constitute losses reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.\n\n         This controversy, interesting and important as it may be,\n\nneed not be resolved to dispose of the issue before us.   Even if the\n\n\n                             -19-\n\fposition asserted by Petit and Richard were correct, a decision we do\n\nnot make, they could not prevail on this issue.   Because defendants\n\ndid not specifically object to the inclusion of attorneys' fees at\n\nsentencing, we could reverse the district court's restitution order\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3663A only if it constituted particularly\n\n“egregious” or “obvious” legal error.   Negron, 212 F.3d at 672.\n\nPrior to this case, our circuit had not interpreted the language\n\ncontained in section 3663(b)(1) and section 3663A(b)(1).    While the\n\nmajority of our sister circuits have held that, under this language,\n\nrestitution cannot include consequential damages such as attorneys’\n\nfees, the law in this circuit was not “obvious” when the district\n\ncourt made its decision, and the district court’s restitution order\n\nwas not particularly “egregious” under the circumstances.     We,\n\ntherefore, affirm the district court’s restitution order.\n\n                               IV\n\n         Appellants’ remaining claims have been considered but do\n\nnot require discussion.   We have stated previously that:\n\n         [w]e understand the practical pressure on\n         lawyers – especially in criminal cases – to\n         resolve doubts in favor of including doubtful\n         claims along with stronger ones.   But cases\n         with difficult issues now crowd the dockets. At\n         least in opinion writing, the court’s time is\n         best reserved for colorable claims.\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\fUnited States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 207 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nquoting United States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40, 49 (1st Cir. 1996).     We\n\nfollow this principle   and address other issues raised by defendants\n\n(and co-defendant Roland Morin) in an unpublished disposition.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -21-\n\f",

The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231, and we have jurisdiction over these timely filed appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Between 1989 and 1997, Catherine Duffy Petit, Paul Richard, David Hall, and several associates participated in a multifarious criminal scheme pivoting around an effort to finance Petit's multi-million dollar civil lawsuit against Key Bank of Maine (Key Bank) and the law firm of Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer and Nelson (Bernstein Shur).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980's Petit became involved in a series of legal battles with Key Bank and her former attorneys, Bernstein Shur. In 1989 Petit persuaded Thomas Blackburn, a Maine attorney, to assist her in raising money to maintain her lawsuit against Key Bank and Bernstein Shur, and to pay her living expenses. Blackburn began locating investors willing to purchase stakes in the outcome of the litigation. Investors were told that the lawsuit was a \"sure thing\" and were promised that payments would be made when the case was settled. In addition, they were told that the investments were backed by a multi-million dollar escrow account. In return for their investment, investors were given assignments, signed by Petit and witnessed by Blackburn, that agreed to pay up to double the investment, plus 18% of the lawsuit proceeds, usually within six months of the investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1990, Bernstein Shur settled with Petit. The lawsuit continued against Key Bank. The settlement was used by Petit and Blackburn to entice yet more investors, and, between 1990 and 1995, Petit and Blackburn expanded the scheme, recruiting several individuals to enlarge its fund-raising capacity. Petit and her associates continued to raise money even after the last remaining count of the lawsuit was dismissed in May of 1995. The dismissal of the lawsuit was never divulged to the investors. After the lawsuit was dismissed, Blackburn extricated himself from the operation. He had helped Petit raise approximately $4.2 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Richard played an important and versatile role in the operation, acting variously as Petit's companion, liaison, and enforcer, among other things. He arranged meetings, subdued anxious investors, and threatened Blackburn when he announced his desire to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme broadened in 1993 to include further criminal conduct when Petit was forced into Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy (later converted into Chapter 11) by creditors unrelated to the instant case. Maintaining that the lawsuit was her only asset, Petit directed Richard and two other associates to set up a dummy corporation, HER, Inc., with which to conceal assets from the bankruptcy court. During the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, Petit falsely denied receiving any income from the sale of her interest in the litigation, and she and her associates acted to conceal assets from the bankruptcy court, the trustee, and her creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings, primarily through the use of HER, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1994, David Hall, a licensed broker-dealer for Sun Life Assurance of Canada, joined the scheme, soliciting funds from several of his clients, many of whom were elderly. Arguing that their Sun Life investments were not performing adequately, Hall suggested a risk-free, high-interest alternative. He specifically told two investors that the investment was in Petit's lawsuit, which he asserted was secured by a large escrow account. He informed neither of them that Petit was in bankruptcy, nor did he inform them of the lawsuit's dismissal in 1995. As Hall solicited more investors, he became yet more duplicitous, often asserting that the investment was in real estate. Hall forwarded the funds he received from investors to HER, Inc., via Richard and other associates, keeping a percentage for himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fund-raising and money laundering scheme continued until 1997, when a Maine state investigation into HER, Inc. led to the arrests of Petit and several of her associates. The operation had raised over $8 million between 1989 and 1997, the bulk of which was used to finance Petit's profligate lifestyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury in the District of Maine indicted defendants for a multitude of offenses. Count 1 charged Petit, Richard, and Hall with conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and securities fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371 and 2. Counts 2 through 13 charged them with bankruptcy fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 152 and 2. Counts 14 through 26 charged them with mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1314 and 2. Counts 27 through 47 charged them with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(A) and 2. Counts 48 through 62 charged them with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 2. Counts 63 through 75 charged them with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1957 and 2. Counts 76 through 87 charged them with securities fraud in violation of 15 U.S.C. &#167; 77q and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Count 88 alleged criminal forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(a)(1), 1957, 982, and 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the government's case at trial, each of the defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal, which were granted on Counts 10, 15, 20, 23 through 26, and 86 of the indictment. The court also granted a judgment of acquittal with respect to Hall on the bankruptcy fraud counts (Counts 2 through 13, and Counts 27 through 62). Motions directed at other counts were denied. The jury found Petit guilty on all counts submitted to them (Counts 1, 2-3, 5-9, 11-13, 14, 16-19, 21-22, 27-85, 87). They found Richard guilty on Count 1 (conspiracy), Counts 2, 4, and 9 through 13 (bankruptcy fraud), but not guilty on Count 7 (bankruptcy fraud). He was found guilty of all remaining mail fraud, money laundering and securities fraud counts (Counts 14, 16 through 19, 21, 22, 27 through 85, and 87). The jury found Hall guilty of conspiracy (Count 1), three counts of mail fraud (Count 16, 17, and 19), five counts of money laundering (Counts 65, 68, 71, 72, and 74), and ten counts of securities fraud (Counts 76 through 85). He was found not guilty of four counts of mail fraud (Counts 14, 18, 21, and 22), eight counts of money laundering (Counts 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 73, and 75), and one count of securities fraud (Count 87).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each defendant submitted a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal on several counts and the court acquitted defendants on the money laundering charges alleged in Counts 48 through 53, 55 through 57, 59 through 67, 69 through 71, and 73 through 75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address Hall's contentions. He argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal of the remaining money laundering counts in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957. He alleges that the government failed to prove all of the elements of an 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a) offense. Pursuant to section 1957(a), the government must show that Hall (1) knowingly engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction (2) in criminally derived property (3) of a value greater than $10,000, and (4) derived from specified unlawful activity. First, Hall argues that the government did not prove that he engaged in a monetary transaction. Second, he argues that his acquittal on all bankruptcy fraud counts requires an acquittal on all money laundering counts because the money laundering counts listed bankruptcy fraud as the specified underlying offense. Third, he contends that the funds he received from his investors and transferred to his associates were not the proceeds of the bankruptcy fraud at the time of the transfer and, therefore, were not criminally derived property at the time of Hall's transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, established each element of the particular offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall's first argument raises a discrete question of statutory interpretation: whether the delivery or transfer of a check, which is the proceeds of unlawful activity, to another person is a monetary transaction within the meaning of section 1957(a). The government argues that a \"monetary transaction\" occurred every time Hall received a check from an investor and handed it over to a co-conspirator, who, in turn, would deposit the check into the HER, Inc. bank account. In reply, Hall contends that he did not engage in any \"monetary transactions\" because the transactions he engaged in were transfers to persons and not deposits into a financial institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"monetary transaction\" is defined in section 1957(f)(1) as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate commerce or foreign commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument (as defined in section 1956(c)(5) of this title) by, through, or to a financial institution . . . including any transaction that would be a financial transaction under section 1956(c)(4)(B) of this title . . . \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(1).

The term \"monetary instrument\" is defined in section 1956(c)(5), and includes \"currency of the United States,\" \"personal checks,\" and \"bank checks.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret these provisions to mean that giving criminally derived checks to a co-conspirator, who deposits them into a bank account, is a transfer to, and involves the use of, a financial institution, which satisfies the definition of \"monetary transaction\" in section 1957(f)(1). Further, transferring funds to a co-conspirator involves monetary instruments, namely the currency or checks involved, which satisfies section 1956(c)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Hall accepted checks, known to him to be derived from unlawful activity, exercised control over them, and transferred them to associates for the very purpose of having them deposit the checks into a bank account. Thus, a jury could conclude from the evidence presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, that the conduct alleged in the indictment constitutes a monetary transaction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall next contends that he cannot be convicted of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a) because he was not convicted of bankruptcy fraud, the underlying offense listed in the section 1957 monetary transaction counts in the indictment. He maintains that because the jury acquitted him of the offense by which he allegedly obtained the money, there was no criminally derived property and, thus, no violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eighth Circuit has held that \"the fact that the jury did not convict [defendant] on the relevant underlying . . . charges does not undermine the money-laundering convictions . . . . The only relevant question when reconciling inconsistent verdicts . . . is whether there was enough evidence presented to support the conviction.\" United States v. Whatley, 133 F.3d 601, 605-606 (8th Cir. 1998); see also McIntosh v. United States 2000 WL 1206564, at *4 (S.D. Ind. 2000) (\"Even where the government formally charges the money laundering defendant with a separate offense constituting the 'specified unlawful activity,' acquittal on the underlying charge does not necessarily defeat the money laundering charge.\"). We are persuaded that the Eighth Circuit states the correct rule. Inconsistent verdicts \"do[] not indicate that the government necessarily failed to prove an essential element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Sullivan 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir. 1996) quoting United States v. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1996). On their own, inconsistent verdicts are not sufficient grounds for reversing a criminal conviction as long as the appellate court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence present to support the conviction. Id. A jury may acquit a defendant as to one or more charges for any number of reasons, and yet come to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant was guilty of other related charges. United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 64-65, 105 S.Ct. 471, 476-477 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, a conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a) does not require proof that the defendant committed the specified predicate offense, United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1234 (1st Cir. 1995); it merely requires proof that the monetary transaction constituted the proceeds of a predicate offense. United States v. Mankarious, 151 F.3d 694, 703 (7th Cir. 1998). Moreover, while \"[a] defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved 'criminally derived' property . . . he need not have known that the subject property was derived from 'specified unlawful activity.'\" Gabriele, 63 F.3d at 65 (citations omitted). Since a monetary transaction conviction does not require proof of a specific offense, nor that Hall knew that the subject property was derived from specified unlawful activity, Halls acquittal of the bankruptcy fraud charges did not have any effect on his monetary transaction convictions. See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 703.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall attacks his section 1957 convictions from yet another angle. He contends that, under United States v. Johnson, 971 F.2d 562, 368-70 (10th Cir. 1992), the underlying act of bankruptcy fraud must be \"complete\" before a violation can occur, and that bankruptcy fraud was not \"complete\" when he transferred money to his associates. He, thus, argues that the funds he transferred did not constitute the proceeds of bankruptcy fraud - the specified unlawful activity listed in the monetary transaction charge - at the time of the transfers and, therefore, were not \"criminally derived property\" pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(2). Section 1957(f)(2) defines \"criminally derived property\" as \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.\" A defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived\" property, but he need not know that the property was derived from the \"specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(c). In other words, the government must prove (1) that Hall had general knowledge of the subject property's criminal nature, and (2) that the property, in fact, was derived from a specified offense listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(7). 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(3). The government need not prove that Hall had knowledge of the specified offense, or that he committed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon Hall's convictions of both mail fraud and securities fraud, it is clear that he had sufficient knowledge that the money he received from his investors - the subject property - was criminally derived. Each check he received from his victims was the product of his unlawful activities. Thus, it is evident that the monetary transactions Hall engaged in were \"in criminally derived property,\" and that he had knowledge of that fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the gravamen of Hall's argument is that the subject property was not derived from bankruptcy fraud, which was the specified predicate offense listed in the money laundering and monetary transaction counts of the indictment (mail fraud and securities fraud were not listed). Hall argues that the subject property did not constitute criminally derived proceeds because the bankruptcy fraud was not complete when he transferred the money to his associates. He alleges that the bankruptcy fraud was not complete until the funds were deposited into the HER, Inc. bank account. According to this argument, the predicate act of bankruptcy fraud must be \"complete\" before a section 1957 violation can occur. For this proposition he relies on a Tenth Circuit case, United States v. Johnson. 971 F.2d at 569-570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson is distinguishable from the case before us, however. Johnson involved the laundering of funds derived from wire fraud. The court concluded that the defendant could not have engaged in a transaction in criminally derived property because he did not possess the proceeds of the wire fraud until after the completion of the wire transfer. Id. That is, the only use of wires in Johnson to prove the predicate wire fraud were the very transfers that allegedly involved \"criminally derived property\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a). Thus, when the court in Johnson used the language of time to describe the relationship between the money laundering and the predicate offense, \"it really was just worried about the definition of proceeds.\" See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 704-705. As the 10th Circuit explained in Johnson, money laundering criminalizes a transaction in proceeds, not the transaction that creates the proceeds. 971 F.2d at 570. Thus, \"the laundering of funds cannot occur in the same transaction through which those funds first became tainted by crime.\" United States v. Butler, 211 F.3d 826, 830 (4th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This law does not assist Hall, however. Although 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957 does not define when money becomes \"proceeds,\" the Third and Fourth Circuits have held that \"proceeds are derived from an already completed offense, or a completed phase of an ongoing offense.\" United States v. Conley, 37 F.3d 970, 980 (3rd Cir. 1994) (emphasis added); Butler, 211 F.3d at 829; see also Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 705 (explaining that a fraud scheme can produce proceeds long before the act that ultimately triggers federal jurisdiction). At trial, the government introduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the receipt of checks by Hall from his investors constituted a completed phase of bankruptcy fraud. Hall was recruited to join Petit's fund-raising operation in 1994, after the bankruptcy fraud phase of the scheme had begun. After Petit entered into bankruptcy in 1993, she and her associates immediately began concealing all financial transactions relating to her lone listed asset, the Key Bank lawsuit, from the bankruptcy trustee. Thus, a jury could find from the evidence presented that Petit and her associates engaged in the concealment of assets from the bankruptcy trustee immediately upon receipt of the checks by Hall, and that Hall's acceptance of the checks constituted a completed phase in the ongoing bankruptcy fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the defendants' fraudulent scheme generated proceeds, and then Hall committed separate acts to launder the proceeds after he took them into his possession. As the Seventh Circuit held in Mankarious, \"[b]ecause . . . money laundering does not focus on the specifics of the predicate offense, it does not matter when all the acts constituting the predicate offense take place. It matters only that the predicate offense has produced proceeds in transactions distinct from those transactions allegedly constituting money laundering.\" 151 F.3d at 706. Thus, the district court properly denied Hall's Rule 29 motion of acquittal for section 1957(a) money laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants Petit and Richard contend that the district court's imposition of attorneys' fees in their respective restitution orders was erroneous. Petit's and Richard's presentence reports recommended restitution in the amount of $7,999,005 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.1. This amount included $355,903 for legal fees expended by the victims. Both Petit and Richard objected to the $7,999,005 total at sentencing, but did not specifically object to the imposition of attorneys' fees. On appeal, Petit and Richard contend that the inclusion of attorneys' fees pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A constitutes error and, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that because they did not specifically object to the inclusion of attorneys' fees, they did not preserve the issue for appellate review. In addition, the government contends that the imposition of attorneys' fees in the restitution orders was proper pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A because the victims' legal expenses were losses reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the record on appeal reflects that the defendants did not specifically object to the inclusion of attorneys' fees, our review is for plain error. United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 264 (1st Cir. 1996). Under the plain error standard we will review for particularly \"egregious\" or \"obvious\" legal error, Negron v. Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc., 212 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Merric, 166 F.3d 406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999), which our failure to consider would result in a \"miscarriage of justice\" or would seriously affect the \"fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Negron 212 F.3d at 672, quoting Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 767 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petit and Richard were sentenced and ordered to pay restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663A and 3664 (the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996) (the Act). Congress amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663 (the Victim and Witness Protection Act) in 1996 in an effort to guarantee restitution to the victims of criminal conduct. Under the Act, a district court must order the payment of restitution in the full amount of the victim's loss without considering the defendant's ability to pay. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663A and 3664(f)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where restitution is ordered for offenses resulting in the loss of property, section 3663A(b)(1) provides that the district court shall require defendants to pay victims an amount equal to (1) the greater of (a) the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or (b) the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less (2) the value of any part of the property that is returned. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A(b)(1)(B). The language contained in this provision is identical to the language in the prior provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(b)(1), with the exception of the use of \"shall\" in place of \"may,\" thereby obviating the district court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A majority of the circuits have held that restitution under section 3663(b)(1) cannot include consequential damages. Government of Virgin Islands v, Davis, 43 F.3d 41, 45 (3rd Cir. 1994); United States v. Patty, 992 F.2d 1045, 1049 (10th Cir. 1993); United States v.

Further, the government argues that our decision in United States v. Collins, 209 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999), is directly on point, and requires us to conclude that the inclusion of attorneys' fees is authorized by the Act when legal expenses constitute losses reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This controversy, interesting and important as it may be, need not be resolved to dispose of the issue before us. Even if the position asserted by Petit and Richard were correct, a decision we do not make, they could not prevail on this issue. Because defendants did not specifically object to the inclusion of attorneys' fees at sentencing, we could reverse the district court's restitution order under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A only if it constituted particularly \"egregious\" or \"obvious\" legal error. Negron, 212 F.3d at 672. Prior to this case, our circuit had not interpreted the language contained in section 3663(b)(1) and section 3663A(b)(1). While the majority of our sister circuits have held that, under this language, restitution cannot include consequential damages such as attorneys' fees, the law in this circuit was not \"obvious\" when the district court made its decision, and the district court's restitution order was not particularly \"egregious\" under the circumstances.

The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231, and we have jurisdiction over these timely filed appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Between 1989 and 1997, Catherine Duffy Petit, Paul Richard, David Hall, and several associates participated in a multifarious criminal scheme pivoting around an effort to finance Petit's multi-million dollar civil lawsuit against Key Bank of Maine (Key Bank) and the law firm of Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer and Nelson (Bernstein Shur).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980's Petit became involved in a series of legal battles with Key Bank and her former attorneys, Bernstein Shur. In 1989 Petit persuaded Thomas Blackburn, a Maine attorney, to assist her in raising money to maintain her lawsuit against Key Bank and Bernstein Shur, and to pay her living expenses. Blackburn began locating investors willing to purchase stakes in the outcome of the litigation. Investors were told that the lawsuit was a \"sure thing\" and were promised that payments would be made when the case was settled. In addition, they were told that the investments were backed by a multi-million dollar escrow account. In return for their investment, investors were given assignments, signed by Petit and witnessed by Blackburn, that agreed to pay up to double the investment, plus 18% of the lawsuit proceeds, usually within six months of the investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1990, Bernstein Shur settled with Petit. The lawsuit continued against Key Bank. The settlement was used by Petit and Blackburn to entice yet more investors, and, between 1990 and 1995, Petit and Blackburn expanded the scheme, recruiting several individuals to enlarge its fund-raising capacity. Petit and her associates continued to raise money even after the last remaining count of the lawsuit was dismissed in May of 1995. The dismissal of the lawsuit was never divulged to the investors. After the lawsuit was dismissed, Blackburn extricated himself from the operation. He had helped Petit raise approximately $4.2 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Richard played an important and versatile role in the operation, acting variously as Petit's companion, liaison, and enforcer, among other things. He arranged meetings, subdued anxious investors, and threatened Blackburn when he announced his desire to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme broadened in 1993 to include further criminal conduct when Petit was forced into Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy (later converted into Chapter 11) by creditors unrelated to the instant case. Maintaining that the lawsuit was her only asset, Petit directed Richard and two other associates to set up a dummy corporation, HER, Inc., with which to conceal assets from the bankruptcy court. During the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, Petit falsely denied receiving any income from the sale of her interest in the litigation, and she and her associates acted to conceal assets from the bankruptcy court, the trustee, and her creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings, primarily through the use of HER, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1994, David Hall, a licensed broker-dealer for Sun Life Assurance of Canada, joined the scheme, soliciting funds from several of his clients, many of whom were elderly. Arguing that their Sun Life investments were not performing adequately, Hall suggested a risk-free, high-interest alternative. He specifically told two investors that the investment was in Petit's lawsuit, which he asserted was secured by a large escrow account. He informed neither of them that Petit was in bankruptcy, nor did he inform them of the lawsuit's dismissal in 1995. As Hall solicited more investors, he became yet more duplicitous, often asserting that the investment was in real estate. Hall forwarded the funds he received from investors to HER, Inc., via Richard and other associates, keeping a percentage for himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fund-raising and money laundering scheme continued until 1997, when a Maine state investigation into HER, Inc. led to the arrests of Petit and several of her associates. The operation had raised over $8 million between 1989 and 1997, the bulk of which was used to finance Petit's profligate lifestyle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury in the District of Maine indicted defendants for a multitude of offenses.

He argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal of the remaining money laundering counts in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957. He alleges that the government failed to prove all of the elements of an 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a) offense. Pursuant to section 1957(a), the government must show that Hall (1) knowingly engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction (2) in criminally derived property (3) of a value greater than $10,000, and (4) derived from specified unlawful activity. First, Hall argues that the government did not prove that he engaged in a monetary transaction. Second, he argues that his acquittal on all bankruptcy fraud counts requires an acquittal on all money laundering counts because the money laundering counts listed bankruptcy fraud as the specified underlying offense. Third, he contends that the funds he received from his investors and transferred to his associates were not the proceeds of the bankruptcy fraud at the time of the transfer and, therefore, were not criminally derived property at the time of Hall's transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo to determine whether any rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, established each element of the particular offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v.

The government argues that a \"monetary transaction\" occurred every time Hall received a check from an investor and handed it over to a co-conspirator, who, in turn, would deposit the check into the HER, Inc. bank account. In reply, Hall contends that he did not engage in any \"monetary transactions\" because the transactions he engaged in were transfers to persons and not deposits into a financial institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"monetary transaction\" is defined in section 1957(f)(1) as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate commerce or foreign commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument (as defined in section 1956(c)(5) of this title) by, through, or to a financial institution . . . including any transaction that would be a financial transaction under section 1956(c)(4)(B) of this title . . . \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(1).

The term \"monetary instrument\" is defined in section 1956(c)(5), and includes \"currency of the United States,\" \"personal checks,\" and \"bank checks.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpret these provisions to mean that giving criminally derived checks to a co-conspirator, who deposits them into a bank account, is a transfer to, and involves the use of, a financial institution, which satisfies the definition of \"monetary transaction\" in section 1957(f)(1). Further, transferring funds to a co-conspirator involves monetary instruments, namely the currency or checks involved, which satisfies section 1956(c)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Hall accepted checks, known to him to be derived from unlawful activity, exercised control over them, and transferred them to associates for the very purpose of having them deposit the checks into a bank account. Thus, a jury could conclude from the evidence presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, that the conduct alleged in the indictment constitutes a monetary transaction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall next contends that he cannot be convicted of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a) because he was not convicted of bankruptcy fraud, the underlying offense listed in the section 1957 monetary transaction counts in the indictment. He maintains that because the jury acquitted him of the offense by which he allegedly obtained the money, there was no criminally derived property and, thus, no violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eighth Circuit has held that \"the fact that the jury did not convict [defendant] on the relevant underlying . . . charges does not undermine the money-laundering convictions . . . .

Moreover, while \"[a] defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved 'criminally derived' property . . . he need not have known that the subject property was derived from 'specified unlawful activity.'\" Gabriele, 63 F.3d at 65 (citations omitted). Since a monetary transaction conviction does not require proof of a specific offense, nor that Hall knew that the subject property was derived from specified unlawful activity, Halls acquittal of the bankruptcy fraud charges did not have any effect on his monetary transaction convictions. See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 703.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hall attacks his section 1957 convictions from yet another angle. He contends that, under United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587734\"><a href=\"/opinion/587734/united-states-v-robert-l-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 368-70 (10th Cir. 1992), the underlying act of bankruptcy fraud must be \"complete\" before a violation can occur, and that bankruptcy fraud was not \"complete\" when he transferred money to his associates. He, thus, argues that the funds he transferred did not constitute the proceeds of bankruptcy fraud - the specified unlawful activity listed in the monetary transaction charge - at the time of the transfers and, therefore, were not \"criminally derived property\" pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(2). Section 1957(f)(2) defines \"criminally derived property\" as \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.\" A defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived\" property, but he need not know that the property was derived from the \"specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(c). In other words, the government must prove (1) that Hall had general knowledge of the subject property's criminal nature, and (2) that the property, in fact, was derived from a specified offense listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(7). 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(3). The government need not prove that Hall had knowledge of the specified offense, or that he committed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon Hall's convictions of both mail fraud and securities fraud, it is clear that he had sufficient knowledge that the money he received from his investors - the subject property - was criminally derived. Each check he received from his victims was the product of his unlawful activities. Thus, it is evident that the monetary transactions Hall engaged in were \"in criminally derived property,\" and that he had knowledge of that fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the gravamen of Hall's argument is that the subject property was not derived from bankruptcy fraud, which was the specified predicate offense listed in the money laundering and monetary transaction counts of the indictment (mail fraud and securities fraud were not listed). Hall argues that the subject property did not constitute criminally derived proceeds because the bankruptcy fraud was not complete when he transferred the money to his associates. He alleges that the bankruptcy fraud was not complete until the funds were deposited into the HER, Inc. bank account. According to this argument, the predicate act of bankruptcy fraud must be \"complete\" before a section 1957 violation can occur. For this proposition he relies on a Tenth Circuit case, United States v. Johnson. 971 F.2d at 569-570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnson is distinguishable from the case before us, however. Johnson involved the laundering of funds derived from wire fraud. The court concluded that the defendant could not have engaged in a transaction in criminally derived property because he did not possess the proceeds of the wire fraud until after the completion of the wire transfer. Id. That is, the only use of wires in Johnson to prove the predicate wire fraud were the very transfers that allegedly involved \"criminally derived property\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a). Thus, when the court in Johnson used the language of time to describe the relationship between the money laundering and the predicate offense, \"it really was just worried about the definition of proceeds.\" See Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 704-705. As the 10th Circuit explained in Johnson, money laundering criminalizes a transaction in proceeds, not the transaction that creates the proceeds. 971 F.2d at 570. Thus, \"the laundering of funds cannot occur in the same transaction through which those funds first became tainted by crime.\" United States v. Butler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768618\"><a href=\"/opinion/768618/united-states-v-edward-r-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 830 (4th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This law does not assist Hall, however. Although 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957 does not define when money becomes \"proceeds,\" the Third and Fourth Circuits have held that \"proceeds are derived from an already completed offense, or a completed phase of an ongoing offense.\" United States v. Conley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679973\"><a href=\"/opinion/679973/united-states-v-john-f-duffy-conley-william-c-curtin-sheila-smith-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 980 (3rd Cir. 1994) (emphasis added); Butler, 211 F.3d at 829; see also Mankarious, 151 F.3d at 705 (explaining that a fraud scheme can produce proceeds long before the act that ultimately triggers federal jurisdiction). At trial, the government introduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that the receipt of checks by Hall from his investors constituted a completed phase of bankruptcy fraud. Hall was recruited to join Petit's fund-raising operation in 1994, after the bankruptcy fraud phase of the scheme had begun. After Petit entered into bankruptcy in 1993, she and her associates immediately began concealing all financial transactions relating to her lone listed asset, the Key Bank lawsuit, from the bankruptcy trustee. Thus, a jury could find from the evidence presented that Petit and her associates engaged in the concealment of assets from the bankruptcy trustee immediately upon receipt of the checks by Hall, and that Hall's acceptance of the checks constituted a completed phase in the ongoing bankruptcy fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the defendants' fraudulent scheme generated proceeds, and then Hall committed separate acts to launder the proceeds after he took them into his possession. As the Seventh Circuit held in Mankarious, \"[b]ecause . . . money laundering does not focus on the specifics of the predicate offense, it does not matter when all the acts constituting the predicate offense take place. It matters only that the predicate offense has produced proceeds in transactions distinct from those transactions allegedly constituting money laundering.\" 151 F.3d at 706. Thus, the district court properly denied Hall's Rule 29 motion of acquittal for section 1957(a) money laundering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants Petit and Richard contend that the district court's imposition of attorneys' fees in their respective restitution orders was erroneous.

This amount included $355,903 for legal fees expended by the victims. Both Petit and Richard objected to the $7,999,005 total at sentencing, but did not specifically object to the imposition of attorneys' fees.

Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524644\"><a href=\"/opinion/524644/united-states-v-leroy-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1178</span></a></span>, 1184 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that Congress substantially broadened the scope of section 3663 when it enacted section 3663A in 1996, rendering these cases irrelevant because they deal with section 3663(b)(1), and not section 3663A(b)(1). Further, the government argues that our decision in United States v. Collins, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span> (1st Cir. 1999), is directly on point, and requires us to conclude that the inclusion of attorneys' fees is authorized by the Act when legal expenses constitute losses reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This controversy, interesting and important as it may be, need not be resolved to dispose of the issue before us. Even if the position asserted by Petit and Richard were correct, a decision we do not make, they could not prevail on this issue. Because defendants did not specifically object to the inclusion of attorneys' fees at sentencing, we could reverse the district court's restitution order under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663A only if it constituted particularly \"egregious\" or \"obvious\" legal error. Negron, 212 F.3d at 672. Prior to this case, our circuit had not interpreted the language contained in section 3663(b)(1) and section 3663A(b)(1). While the majority of our sister circuits have held that, under this language, restitution cannot include consequential damages such as attorneys' fees, the law in this circuit was not \"obvious\" when the district court made its decision, and the district court's restitution order was not particularly \"egregious\" under the circumstances. We, therefore, affirm the district court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' remaining claims have been considered but do not require discussion.

But cases with difficult issues now crowd the dockets. At least in opinion writing, the court's time is best reserved for colorable claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.
