Hershkowitz, Assistant General Counsel, with whom\nLawrence M. Noble, General Counsel, Richard B. Bader, Associate General\nCounsel, and David Kolker, Holly J. Baker, and Erin K. Monaghan,\nAttorneys, were on brief, for appellee.\n\f                            November 1, 2000\n\n\n\n           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         Presidential candidate Ralph\n\nNader and others assert that the prohibition in the Federal\n\nElection   Campaign   Act    on   the    use   of   corporate    money    \"in\n\nconnection with\" federal elections invalidates certain              Federal\n\nElection   Commission    regulations       governing    the     funding   of\n\npresidential debates.       Those regulations permit corporations to\n\nmake contributions from their general treasuries to qualified\n\nnonprofit, nonpartisan organizations staging federal candidate\n\ndebates.   Suit was brought in anticipation of the debates to be\n\nstaged by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) before\n\nthe November 2000 Presidential Election.              The district court\n\ndismissed Nader’s claims on the merits and entered judgment on\n\nSeptember 14, 2000.         Nader appealed and this court granted\n\nexpedited review.     We hold, contrary to the FEC,           that we have\n\nArticle III jurisdiction and, contrary to Nader, that the\n\nplaintiffs’ facial challenge to the debate regulations fails.\n\n                                   I.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            With the 2000 presidential debates on the horizon,\n\nNader, nominee of the Green Party, together with organizations\n\nsupporting    his   campaign,   as    well      as   both    supportive   and\n\nuncommitted individual voters, brought this action on June 19,\n\n2000 in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts. The plaintiffs challenge as ultra vires two FEC\n\nregulations, 11 C.F.R. §§ 110.13 and 114.4(f), which allow\n\nqualified     nonprofit,   nonpartisan          organizations     to   accept\n\ncorporate donations in staging presidential debates and allow\n\ncorporations to make such donations.             The plaintiffs claim that\n\nthe regulations violate a provision of the Federal Election\n\nCampaign Act, 2 U.S.C. §§ 431 et seq. , which               makes it unlawful\n\nfor a corporation to make any \"contribution or expenditure in\n\nconnection with\" the presidential elections.                  Id. § 441b(a).\n\nThe Act defines \"contribution or expenditure\" to include \"any\n\ndirect or indirect payment . . . or gift of money, or any\n\nservices, or anything of value . . . to any candidate, campaign\n\ncommittee,    or    political   party      or    organization.\"        Id.   §\n\n441b(b)(2).\n\n            On June 29, the plaintiffs moved to preliminarily\n\nenjoin the FEC from implementing the challenged regulations and\n\n                                     -3-\n\frequested that the district court order the FEC to enforce the\n\nFECA's prohibition on corporate contributions so as to prevent\n\ncorporate sponsorship of the presidential debates.            The FEC\n\nmoved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that none of\n\nthe plaintiffs could demonstrate Article III standing and that\n\nthe plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative\n\nremedies.\n\n            After holding oral argument on both motions on August\n\n14, 2000, the district court on September 1 denied the FEC's\n\nmotion to dismiss, concluding that Nader and the Green Party had\n\nstanding to challenge the FEC's debate regulations1 and that\n\nplaintiffs    were   entitled   to   review   because   the   futility\n\nexception to the exhaustion requirement of the Administrative\n\nProcedure Act applied.    The court denied plaintiffs' motion for\n\na preliminary injunction, however, finding no likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits, on the basis that the regulations were\n\nbased on a reasonable interpretation of the FECA entitled to\n\ndeference under Chevron U.S.A., Inc.          v.   Natural Resources\n\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).\n\n\n    1     The district court found that the individual voter\nplaintiffs lacked standing.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f         On September 6, the district court entered final\n\njudgment in accordance with a stipulation of the parties, and\n\nplaintiffs filed a motion for expedited review in this court,\n\nwhich the FEC opposed.     We granted plaintiffs' motion on\n\nSeptember 26, 2000, ordered expedited briefing, and heard oral\n\nargument on October 5.\n\n                             II.\n\n         We first address the FEC's argument that plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.   Like the\n\ndistrict court, we think the plaintiffs are not required to\n\npetition the FEC before bringing a facial challenge to the\n\nagency's regulations. Because the FECA itself has no provisions\n\ngoverning judicial review of FEC regulations, the judicial\n\nreview procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 701 et seq., apply to a facial challenge to the FECA's\n\nimplementing regulations. See Perot v. FEC, 97 F.3d 553, 560-61\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996); Faucher v. FEC, 743 F. Supp. 64, 68 (1990),\n\naff'd 928 F.2d 968 (1st Cir. 1991).    The FEC has steadfastly\n\nmaintained that these debate regulations are valid and there is\n\nno point in requiring plaintiffs to go through exhaustion.   See\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fSkubel v. Fuoroli, 113 F.3d 330, 334 (2d Cir. 1997); Brown v.\n\nSecretary of HHS, 46 F.3d 102, 113-14 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                  III.\n\n            We next consider whether the plaintiffs have standing.\n\nStanding     doctrine   involves      \"a   blend    of     constitutional\n\nrequirements and prudential considerations.\"                 Valley Forge\n\nChristian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church and\n\nState, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).              The constitutional\n\ncomponent    of   standing    stems   directly     from    Article   III's\n\nlimitation of federal judicial power to deciding justiciable\n\ncases or controversies.       See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751\n\n(1984).2     To   establish   standing,    it   does   not   suffice   for\n\nplaintiffs to show merely that they bring a justiciable issue\n\nbefore the court; they must show further that they have a\n\nsufficiently personal stake in the issue.                 This means that\n\nplaintiffs must show: (1) that they have suffered or are in\n\ndanger of suffering some injury that is both concrete and\n\nparticularized to them; (2) that this injury is fairly traceable\n\nto the allegedly illegal conduct of the defendant; and (3) that\n\n\n     2    The FEC makes no claim that the plaintiffs have failed\nto meet prudential standing requirements.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fa favorable decision will likely redress the injury. See Valley\n\nForge, 454 U.S. at 472; see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano,\n\n4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1993).              We first determine whether Nader\n\nhas standing; we then turn to the voter plaintiffs.\n\nA.   Whether Nader Has Standing\n\n           Nader       argues     that      the   FEC   regulations     allowing\n\ncorporate sponsorship of the presidential debates have injured\n\nhim by making corporate contributions available to his opponents\n\n(in the form of free television exposure during the debates)\n\nwhen such contributions are not available to him. Consequently,\n\nNader   has    been    put   at    a   competitive       disadvantage    in   the\n\npresidential race, and as a result he has had to alter his\n\ncampaign strategy and spend more on advertising in order to\n\ncompensate               for           this           disadvantage.\n\n           The FEC's central counterargument is that the injuries\n\nNader alleges are not fairly traceable to the FEC regulations\n\nhe challenges.        Nader's standing theory is misplaced, the FEC\n\ncontends: while it might be true that Nader's exclusion from the\n\ndebates puts him at a competitive disadvantage, Nader is not\n\nchallenging his exclusion from the debates. As plaintiffs state\n\nin their      brief:    \"This     is   a    lawsuit     about   the funding of\n\n                                           -7-\n\fpresidential debates, not a challenge to the rules governing\n\nparticipation in debates.\"            Moreover, Nader concedes that, even\n\nif FEC regulations did not allow corporate sponsorship of the\n\ndebates, the debates would likely be held anyway, with funding\n\ncoming from public sources or the media; and Nader makes no\n\nclaim that in such event he would have a better chance of being\n\ninvited to participate.         Thus Nader has failed to show, the FEC\n\nconcludes, that there is a causal nexus between corporate\n\nsponsorship of the debates and the injuries he alleges as his\n\nbasis for standing.\n\n            In reply, Nader argues that there is such a causal\n\nnexus.   At the time that he brought this suit, Nader still stood\n\na chance of being invited to participate in the debates.              Yet if\n\nhe were invited, he says, he would be forced to decline the\n\ninvitation    due    to   his    principled    stand     against   accepting\n\ncorporate contributions.          The consequences of this Faustian\n\ndilemma, he argues, suffice for standing: not only did it create\n\nthe potential injury of having to cede to his opponents the\n\nadvantage of free television exposure, but it also forced him\n\npresently    to     conduct     his     campaign   and   make   advertising\n\nexpenditures on the assumption that no such exposure would be\n\n                                        -8-\n\favailable    to    him.    In   this     sense,        corporate    sponsorship\n\nthreatened to exclude him from the debates and had a palpable\n\nand immediate impact on his campaign strategy and expenditures.\n\n            In support of his position, Nader cites Vote Choice,\n\nInc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1993).                  In that case,\n\nElizabeth Leonard, a Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate,\n\nchallenged    a    state   campaign          finance     law    requiring      all\n\ncandidates, at the time they declared their candidacies, to\n\nchoose whether to accept public funding for their campaigns.\n\nThe law at issue attached certain benefits to the acceptance of\n\npublic funding, such as free air time on community television\n\nand higher caps on campaign contributions.                   See id. at 29-30.\n\nLeonard chose to decline public funding and thereby to forego\n\nthe accompanying benefits.         As a result, this court held, she\n\nhad standing.        Given Leonard's choice not to accept public\n\nfunding, the law put her at a potential disadvantage as to any\n\npublicly    funded    opponents   she        might   face,     forcing   her    to\n\nstructure    her     campaign     to     anticipate       and      offset   that\n\ndisadvantage.      See id. at 36-37.         \"In our view,\" we held, \"such\n\nan impact on the strategy and conduct of an office-seeker's\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fpolitical campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to\n\nconfer standing.\"     Id. at 37.\n\n           Nader argues, and the district court agreed, that his\n\ncase is analogous: given Nader's choice not to accept corporate\n\ncontributions,      the    FEC's   regulations     allowing   corporate\n\nsponsorship    of    the    debates       effectively   bar   him    from\n\nparticipating even if he qualifies for an invitation.               He is\n\nthus put at a potential disadvantage in the event that he is\n\ninvited and forced by his principles to decline the invitation;\n\nand he suffers a consequent present harm, in that he has been\n\nforced to structure his campaign to offset this potential\n\ndisadvantage -- e.g., by spending more on advertising than he\n\nwould if there remained a chance that he could appear in the\n\ndebates.\n\n           While the question is close, we find that Nader does\n\nhave standing under Vote Choice.          Nader has been and continues\n\nto be a significant candidate in the 2000 presidential race. At\n\nthe time he brought this suit,3 it was a genuinely open question\n\n\n    3     A footnote in the concurring opinion suggests that we\nmight err in assessing Nader's standing from this chronological\npoint of reference; it points to a Tenth Circuit case, Powder\nRiver Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477 (10th Cir.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fwhether he would be invited to the debates: Nader brought suit\n\n\n\n\n1995), holding that a plaintiff must not only have standing at\nthe time he brings suit, but must retain it throughout the\nlitigation. The case has rightly been criticized for ignoring\nlanguage in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992),\nclearly indicating that standing is to be \"assessed under the\nfacts existing when the complaint is filed.\" Klamath Siskiyou\nWildlands Ctr. v. Babbitt, No. CV-99-1044-ST, 2000 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 2269, at *9 (D. Or. Feb. 15, 2000) (quoting Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 571, n.4).     The problem with the approach taken in\nPowder River is that it conflates questions of standing with\nquestions of mootness: while it is true that a plaintiff must\nhave a personal interest at stake throughout the litigation of\na case, such interest is to be assessed under the rubric of\nstanding at the commencement of the case, and under the rubric\nof mootness thereafter. See, e.g., Steger v. Franco, Inc., No.\n99-2294, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 24818, at *7 (8th Cir. Oct. 3,\n2000) (\"[S]tanding is based on the facts as they existed at the\ntime the lawsuit was filed.\"); White v. Lee, Nos. 99-15098, 99-\n15109, and 99-16033, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 23778, at *81 (9th\nCir. Sep. 27, 2000) (same); Advanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA,\n211 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (same); see also Gwaltney of\nSmithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., 484 U.S. 49, 69\n(Scalia, J., concurring) (\"Subject matter jurisdiction depends\non the state of things at the time of the action brought; if it\nexisted when the suit was brought, subsequent events cannot oust\nthe court of jurisdiction.\") (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).    \"The confusion is understandable, given\n[the Supreme Court's] repeated statements that the doctrine of\nmootness can be described as 'the doctrine of standing set in a\ntime frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at\nthe commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue\nthroughout its existence (mootness).'\" Friends of the Earth,\nInc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 120\nS.Ct. 693, 708-09 (2000) (citations omitted). But questions of\nstanding and questions of mootness are distinct, and it is\nimportant to treat them separately. See id. at 709-10. We\naddress whether Nader's claim is moot below.\n\n                             -11-\n\fin June 2000; the CPD's first determination of which candidates\n\nwould be invited to the debates was scheduled for Labor Day;\n\nwithin that time, it was certainly possible that Nader would be\n\nable to meet the CPD's eligibility threshold of a fifteen-\n\npercent showing of support in the national polls.           Nader thus\n\nreasonably claims that, at the time he brought suit, corporate\n\nsponsorship of the debates loomed as a potential stumbling block\n\nin   the   path   of   his   campaign,   which   forced   him   to   make\n\nsignificant adjustments to his campaign strategy and use of\n\nfunds.4    \"[W]e see nothing 'improbable' about the proposition,\"\n\nand we do not think it proper to second-guess a candidate's\n\nreasonable assessment of his own campaign.         See Friends of the\n\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., ___ U.S. ___,\n\n\n\n     4    The concurrence argues that Nader's injury is \"overly\nspeculative,\" and that our granting him standing effectively\n\"grants standing to any political entrant to challenge any\nelection regulation to which they might someday be subject.\"\nInfra, at ___ (emphasis added). Our holding is nowhere near so\nbroad.   Nader was not merely \"any political entrant\" in the\npresidential race. At the time he brought suit, he could have\nplausibly hoped to qualify for an invitation to the debates.\nNor did he merely worry that \"someday\" corporate sponsorship of\nthe debates would interfere with his campaign. At the time of\nfiling, invitations to the debates were scheduled to be\ndetermined at a definite date, soon enough in the future to\naffect his present campaign plans.\n\n                                  -12-\n\f120 S.Ct. 693, 706 (2000) (finding standing to turn on the\n\nreasonableness of plaintiffs' fear that defendant's conduct\n\nwould interfere with their activity).          We similarly granted\n\ncredence in Vote Choice to plaintiff Leonard's claim that she\n\nhad to adjust her campaign to account for the possibility of\n\nfacing a publicly funded opponent, even though in the end that\n\npossibility did not materialize.       Vote Choice, 4 F.3d at 37; see\n\nalso Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 814 F. Supp 195, 204\n\n(D.R.I. 1993). To probe any further into these situations would\n\nrequire the clairvoyance of campaign consultants or political\n\npundits -- guises that members of the apolitical branch should\n\nbe especially hesitant to assume.\n\n           The FEC attempts to distinguish Vote Choice from this\n\ncase on the grounds that the plaintiff in Vote Choice was\n\ndirectly subject to the law she challenged: the law specifically\n\nrequired all candidates to choose whether to accept public\n\nfunding.    By contrast, the FEC regulations in question here\n\nregulate    not   candidates,    but       rather   debate   staging\n\norganizations, such as the CPD, and their corporate donors.\n\nThus, the FEC argues, the regulations could not possibly have\n\nput Nader to a \"coerced choice,\" as was at issue in Vote Choice,\n\n                                -13-\n\fsee 4 F.3d at 37, simply because the regulations do not apply to\n\nNader at all.       In short, the argument goes, the plaintiff's\n\nchoice in Vote Choice was coerced by law, while Nader's choice\n\nis wholly self-imposed.\n\n          The FEC's formalistic distinction, however, does not\n\nwithstand scrutiny.     The FEC regulations Nader challenges allow\n\nthe CPD to accept corporate funds; the CPD's acceptance of\n\ncorporate funds in turn presents Nader with a choice of whether\n\nto participate in corporate-sponsored debates.        Thus, but for\n\nthe regulations, Nader would not be coerced to make the choice.\n\nGranted, the coercion wrought by the regulations is indirect,\n\nbut that makes no difference; the choice is still fairly\n\ntraceable to the regulations.        Cf. Fulani v. League of Women\n\nVoters, 882 F.2d 621, 628 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding candidate's\n\nexclusion from debates traceable to government's refusal to\n\nrevoke   League's    tax-exempt   status,   where   \"[b]ut   for   the\n\ngovernment's refusal . . . the League, as a practical matter,\n\nwould have been unable to sponsor [the debates]\").5          Moreover,\n\n\n    5     Similarly flawed is the FEC's argument that Nader\ncannot claim standing on the basis that he has been put at a\ncompetitive disadvantage in the presidential race.    The FEC\ncites a line of Second Circuit decisions in which competitive\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthis is not a case like Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n\n555 (1992), where the agency is alleged to have unlawfully\n\nregulated a third party, and the plaintiff's standing depends on\n\nan unpredictable question of whether the third party will use\n\nits discretion under the regulation so as to harm the plaintiff.\n\nSee id. at 562.   In this case, whether the CPD will choose to\n\naccept corporate funds to help stage the 2000 presidential\n\ndebates is not unpredictable; the CPD had already chosen to do\n\nso by the time Nader brought suit.6\n\n\n\ndisadvantage in a political race has been recognized as a\npossible basis for standing, but only where the plaintiff has\nshown \"that he personally competes in the same arena with the\nparty to whom the government has bestowed the assertedly illegal\nbenefit.\" In re United States Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d\n1020, 1029 (2d Cir. 1989), quoted in Fulani v. Bentsen, 35 F.3d\n49, 54 (2d Cir. 1994); see also Gottlieb v. FEC, 143 F.3d 618,\n620-21 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Fulani v. Brady, 935 F.2d 1324, 1327\n(D.C. Cir. 1991). The FEC argues that Nader cannot claim such\nstanding, because he does not compete in the same arena with the\nCPD, which is the party to whom the FEC has bestowed the\nassertedly illegal benefit of access to corporate funding.\nAgain, however, such argument unjustifiably ignores the\nconsequences of the FEC's action: the corporate funds that the\nFEC has allowed the CPD to solicit in the end pay for free\ntelevision exposure for the debate participants; and obviously\nNader competes in the same arena with these other candidates.\n    6     The CPD announced on January 6, 2000 that Anheuser-\nBusch would serve as one of the national financial sponsors for\nits 2000 presidential debates, as well as the sole financial\nsponsor of the October 17 debate in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n                              -15-\n\f          In addition, the FEC's analysis of Vote Choice, as the\n\nFEC itself suggested at oral argument, leads to the result that\n\nno   candidate   could   ever   challenge   the   FEC   regulations   in\n\nquestion here, regardless of how likely he or she was to be\n\ninvited to debate.   If the FEC is right that only those directly\n\ngoverned by the regulations can challenge them, then only debate\n\nstaging organizations such as the CPD or their corporate donors\n\ncould ever bring challenge. But these parties are beneficiaries\n\nof the regulations, and the regulations are permissive with\n\nrespect to them. Hence, these parties are unlikely ever to have\n\nany incentive -- or, likewise, standing -- to seek to invalidate\n\nthe regulations insofar as they permit corporate sponsorship of\n\nthe debates.7     In this respect, then, the regulations might\n\neffectively be immune from judicial review. We see no reason to\n\nread Vote Choice to imply this result.8\n\n\nAnnheuser-Busch reportedly paid $550,000 to underwrite the\nOctober 17 debate.\n     7    Rather, such parties would likely bring challenge only\nif they were excluded for some reason from the benefits of being\nable to receive or donate corporate funds in support of the\ndebates.\n     8    We recognize that the mere implication \"that if [the\nplaintiff has] no standing to sue, no one would have standing,\nis not a reason to find standing.\" Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at\n\n                                  -16-\n\f           Finally, we reject the FEC's suggestion in its brief\n\nthat Nader's choice is self-imposed, that it \"only exists\n\nbecause he perceives a dilemma, not because it appears anywhere\n\nin the regulations.\"      Such a view would raise too high a bar for\n\nstanding; clearly, one who challenges a governmental action may\n\nnot be denied standing merely because his challenge in a sense\n\nstems from his own choosing.               For example, if instead of\n\ninvolving corporate sponsorship, this case instead involved\n\nregulations allowing the CPD to impose speech restrictions on\n\ndebate participants -- e.g., a requirement that the participants\n\nsay a word of gratitude to the CPD's underwriters -- there would\n\nhardly be question that the debate participants would have\n\nstanding   to   challenge    such   regulations,     even    though    their\n\nobjection might stem purely from a choice of conscience.                Cf.,\n\ne.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173               (1991) (no standing\n\nquestion    raised     where      doctors       challenged    regulations\n\nconditioning    receipt     of   funds     on   compliance   with     speech\n\n\n\n\n489 (citations omitted). But that is not what is wrong with the\nFEC's direct regulation theory. What is wrong with the FEC's\ntheory is that it permits only those directly subject to the\nregulations to bring suit, when the very persons likely to be\nharmed by the regulations are not directly subject to them.\n\n                                    -17-\n\frestrictions); Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S.\n\n383,       393   (1988)   (self-censorship    is    harm      sufficient   for\n\nstanding).9           In sum, the FEC regulations Nader challenges\n\nhave caused him sufficient injury for the purposes of standing.\n\nBy     allowing     corporate   sponsorship        of   the    debates,    the\n\nregulations threatened to force Nader to decline an invitation\n\nto participate in the debates, and that threat affected the\n\nconduct of his campaign.         In light of the FECA's concern with\n\nensuring that corporate funds do not undermine the fairness of\n\nfederal elections, we find that Nader has claimed sufficient\n\nunfairness to his campaign to establish standing.                   \"To hold\n\notherwise would tend to diminish the import of depriving a\n\nserious candidate for public office of the opportunity to\n\ncompete equally for votes in an election,\" and would make it too\n\ndifficult for candidates in Nader's position to challenge FEC\n\nregulations thought to impinge on that opportunity.                See Fulani\n\nv. League of Women Voters Education Fund, 882 F.2d 621, 626\n\n(1989).\n\n\n       9  We note also that Nader's choice is not wholly\nideological; he objects to participating in corporate-sponsored\ndebates not only because they offend his principles, but\nbecause, on his view, they are illegal.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f           There remains, however, a question of redressibility.\n\nAt the time he brought suit, Nader could have been provided with\n\nrelief that would have redressed his injury -- namely, a\n\njudgment in effect preventing corporate sponsorship of the\n\ndebates    in   time    to   preserve    the   possibility   of     his\n\nparticipation. Now that the 2000 presidential debates are over,\n\nsuch relief is no longer available.        However, this subsequent\n\nredressibility problem is one of mootness, not standing.            See\n\nAdvanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2000) (noting that \"[s]tanding is assessed at the time the\n\naction    commences,\"   whereas    mootness    concerns   whether    \"a\n\njudiciable controversy existed but no longer remains\") (citing\n\nFriends of the Earth, 120 S.Ct. at 709) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).    And the FEC conceded at oral argument that\n\nNader's case is not moot.     As other courts have held in similar\n\ncases, this sort of case qualifies for the exception to mootness\n\nfor disputes \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\":\n\ncorporate sponsorship of the debates is sure to be challenged\n\nagain in future elections, yet, as here, the short length of the\n\ncampaign season will make a timely resolution difficult.            See\n\nStorer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8 (1974); Fulani v. League\n\n                                  -19-\n\fof Women Voters Educ. Fund, 882 F.2d 621, 628 (2d Cir. 1989);\n\nJohnson v. F.C.C., 829 F.2d 157, 159 n.7 (D.C.Cir. 1987).\n\nHence, Nader's case is not moot, and he has satisfied the\n\nrequirements for standing.10\n\nB. Whether Voters Have Standing\n\n            The voter plaintiffs assert two grounds for standing.\n\nFirst, they argue that, as voters, they are harmed directly by\n\nthe corruption of the political process allegedly caused by\n\ncorporate sponsorship of the debates.              Second, the voters who\n\nhave decided to vote for Nader argue that, as supporters of\n\nNader,   they   suffer   derivatively       from    any     injury    the   FEC\n\nregulations cause him.\n\n            As to the first argument, the harm done to the general\n\npublic   by   corruption     of    the   political    process      is   not   a\n\nsufficiently     concrete,        personalized     injury     to     establish\n\nstanding.     Plaintiffs cite to FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998),\n\n\n    10    Nader's interest in this case is identical to that of\nhis party (represented by plaintiffs Green Party USA and the\nAssociation of State Green Parties) and campaign organization\n(the Nader 2000 Primary Committee); together, they represent the\nNader candidacy that has been injured by the FEC regulations as\ndescribed in the preceding discussion. Hence, by virtue of our\nfinding that Nader has standing, we also find that these\nplaintiffs have standing.\n\n                                     -20-\n\ffor the proposition that any voting-related injury is per se\n\nsufficiently concrete and personalized to establish standing.\n\nBut Akins does not open the door so wide.               Akins held that\n\nindividual voters had standing to challenge the FEC's decision\n\nnot to subject the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to\n\ncertain disclosure requirements.          The Court's decision did not\n\nrest merely on the fact that the voters there had suffered a\n\n\"voting-related\" injury.         Rather, what was important was that\n\nthe voters had been denied access to information that would have\n\nhelped      them   evaluate   candidates     for   office,     when   such\n\ninformation was specifically required by statute to be disclosed\n\nto the public.     See Akins, 524 U.S. at 21; see also Common Cause\n\nv.   FEC,    108   F.3d   413,    418   (D.C.   Cir.   1997)    (limiting\n\n\"informational standing\" under FECA to cases in which plaintiffs\n\nare denied information that is \"both useful in voting and\n\nrequired by Congress to be disclosed\").                In contrast, the\n\nplaintiffs here allege no such particularized burden they will\n\nsuffer as a result of corporate sponsorship of the debates.\n\nTheir concern for corruption of the political process \"is not\n\nonly widely shared, but is also of an abstract and indefinite\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fnature,\" comparable to \"the common concern for obedience to\n\nlaw.\" Akins, 524 U.S. at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          As to the argument of Nader's supporters that they\n\nsuffer derivatively from his injury, again, such argument sweeps\n\ntoo broadly.     Regardless of Nader's injury, his supporters\n\nremain fully able to advocate for his candidacy and to cast\n\ntheir votes in his favor.       Compare Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,\n\n94   (1976)    (\"[T]he    denial    of    public   financing   to   some\n\nPresidential candidates is not restrictive of voters' rights .\n\n. . .\"), and Gottlieb v. FEC, 143 F.3d 618, 622 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n\n(\"The extra infusion of funds into the Clinton campaign did not\n\nimpede   the   voters    from   supporting   the   candidate   of   their\n\nchoice.\"), with Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 143-44 (1972)\n\n(holding that expensive filing fees keeping candidates from\n\nappearing on ballot harmed voters by preventing them from voting\n\nfor the candidate of their choice).          The only derivative harm\n\nNader's supporters can possibly assert is that their preferred\n\ncandidate now has less chance of being elected.           Such \"harm,\"\n\nhowever, is hardly a restriction on voters' rights and by itself\n\nis not a legally cognizable injury sufficient for standing. See\n\nGottlieb, 143 F.3d at 622 (holding that voters cannot establish\n\n                                   -22-\n\fstanding   solely   on   basis     that    their    candidates     have   been\n\nunfairly treated).\n\n                                     IV.\n\n           Having determined that Nader has standing, we turn to\n\nhis challenge to the validity of the debate regulations. The\n\nissue before us is a narrow one:                  whether the FEC debate\n\nregulations allowing corporate funding of certain debate staging\n\norganizations, 11 C.F.R. §§ 110.13 and 114.4(f), violate, on\n\ntheir face, the FECA.           The exclusion of Nader from the 2000\n\nPresidential election debates is not at issue, nor is any\n\nconstitutional claim asserted.         We review de novo the district\n\ncourt's decision to uphold the regulations, a question of law.\n\nStrickland v. Commissioner, Maine Dept. of Human Services, 96\n\nF.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           The   parties    dispute       whether    this   case    requires\n\ndeference to the administrative agency’s determination under\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.S. 837 (1984).       Chevron governs the judicial review of\n\nagency   regulations       to    ensure    that    they   comply   with   the\n\napplicable statutory scheme, and entails a two step analysis.\n\nIf Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue and the\n\n                                    -23-\n\fintent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter. Id.\n\nat 842.       Agency regulations in accord with that unambiguously\n\nexpressed intent are upheld; those that contravene that intent\n\nare invalid.        But if the statute is silent or ambiguous with\n\nrespect to the precise issue, then the question becomes whether\n\nthe agency’s regulations are based on a permissible construction\n\nof the statute.            Id. at 843.           In assessing the agency's\n\nconstruction of an ambiguous provision, courts, under this\n\nsecond    step      of   Chevron,   must       defer   to   reasonable   agency\n\ninterpretation and implementation of the provision.                      United\n\nStates v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 383 (1999). The FEC\n\nis the type of agency which is entitled to such deference where\n\ncongressional intent is ambiguous. FEC v. Democratic Senatorial\n\nCampaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981).\n\n              Several key statutory provisions of the FECA are at\n\nissue.        The   FECA   prohibits      corporations       from   making   any\n\ncontribution or expenditure \"in connection with\" any federal\n\nelection, 2 U.S.C. § 441b(a), and defines \"contribution or\n\nexpenditure\" to include \"any direct or indirect payment . . . or\n\ngift . . . to any candidate, campaign committee, or political\n\nparty    or    organization,\"       id.    §    441b(b)(2).      This    general\n\n                                      -24-\n\fprohibition    is     subject     to   three    exceptions,   which   permit\n\ncorporate     funds    to   be    used    (1)    for   internal   corporate\n\ncommunications; (2) for nonpartisan registration and get-out-\n\nthe-vote campaigns by a corporation directed to its stockholders\n\nand executive and administrative personnel and their families;\n\nand (3) for the establishment of a separate segregated fund used\n\nfor political purposes.          Id. § 441b(b)(2)(A)-(C).      In addition,\n\nthe FECA's general definition section also addresses the term\n\n\"expenditure,\" defining it to include any payments made \"for the\n\npurpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\" id. §\n\n431(9)(A)(i), but not to include \"nonpartisan activity designed\n\nto encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote,\" id. §\n\n431(9)(B)(ii).11\n\n            Implementing these statutory provisions, in 1980 the\n\nFEC promulgated debate regulations to govern contributions and\n\nexpenditures made in sponsorship of candidate debates; in 1996,\n\nit revised them.       Under the FEC's regulatory scheme, corporate\n\ncontributions and expenditures may be made to defray the costs\n\n\n\n     11   No party has attributed any significance to the failure\nto exclude this latter category from the definition of\n\"contribution.\"\n\n                                       -25-\n\fof conducting candidate debates where those debates are held by\n\nnonpartisan organizations so long as those organizations and the\n\nstructure of the debate meet certain criteria. Two interrelated\n\nregulations     produce    this    result.        First,   Section     110.13\n\ndelineates the requirements for debate staging organizations,\n\ndebate structure, and criteria for candidate selection necessary\n\nto qualify for exemption from the contribution and expenditure\n\nrestrictions.      Debate staging organizations must either be\n\nnonprofit organizations that \"do not endorse, support, or oppose\n\npolitical candidates or political parties,\" or broadcasters that\n\nare \"not owned or controlled by a political party, political\n\ncommittee or candidate.\"        11 C.F.R. § 110.13(a).          The candidate\n\ndebate   must   include    at     least    two   candidates      and   not   be\n\nstructured \"to promote or advance one candidate over another.\"\n\n11 C.F.R. § 110.13(b).       Finally, debate staging organizations\n\nare required to use \"pre-established objective criteria to\n\ndetermine which candidates may participate in the debate\" and\n\nmay not rely solely on nomination by particular parties.                     11\n\nC.F.R. § 110.13(c).       Second, Section 114.4(f) allows nonprofit\n\ndebate   staging   organizations          to   accept   funds    donated     by\n\ncorporations to defray costs incurred in staging candidate\n\n                                    -26-\n\fdebates and, on the flipside, expressly permits corporations to\n\nmake such donations to qualifed debate staging organizations.\n\n11 C.F.R. § 114.4(f).        Complementing these sections, the FEC\n\nregulations defining the terms \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\"\n\nas covered by the Act expressly exempt the funds used in staging\n\na qualified      candidate    debate      from     the   \"contributions\"           and\n\n\"expenditures\"     regulated       by    the   FECA.       See    11    C.F.R.       §\n\n100.7(b)(21)      (not   included         in     \"contributions\");           id.     §\n\n100.8(b)(23) (not included in \"expenditures\").                    In accordance\n\nwith the requirements of the FECA, 2 U.S.C. § 438(d), the\n\nproposed regulations, along with the FEC's analysis, were sent\n\nto    Congress   and   did   not    become     final     until    Congress         had\n\nopportunity to express disapproval.12\n\n           Nader argues that these debate regulations permit\n\ncorporate contributions to flow to candidates in violation of\n\nthe   general    prohibition       of    Section    441b(a)      and   that    such\n\ncontributions do not fall within the limited exceptions of\n\nSection    441b(b)(2)(A)-(C);           further,    he   rejects       the    FEC's\n\n\n\n      12  The Senate rejected an initial, more restrictive\nversion of the debate regulations through this mechanism by\nunanimous resolution. See S. Res. 236, 96th Cong. (1979).\n\n                                        -27-\n\fcontention that the regulations permissibly construe ambiguities\n\nin what corporate disbursements qualify as \"contributions and\n\nexpenditures\" under the Act.            Nader argues the FEC’s position\n\nmust be rejected       for several reasons.          First, Nader contends\n\nthat the general prohibition against corporate contributions and\n\nexpenditures in Section 441b(a) stands alone and is not at all\n\nambiguous.      This    prohibition,         he   says,   reflects   a   clear\n\ncongressional    intent       that   corporate      monies   not   go    toward\n\npolitical activities unless they fall into one of the three\n\nnarrowly drawn exceptions in Section 441b(b), none of which is\n\napplicable to candidate debates.             Hence this provision reveals\n\nan unambiguous congressional intent that corporate monies not be\n\nused to sponsor candidate debates.\n\n           Second, Nader argues that when Congress enacted the\n\nmore specific rules contained in Section 441b governing the use\n\nof general treasury corporate funds in 1976, it narrowed the\n\nexemption from the prohibition on corporate contributions so as\n\nto permit only those \"nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-\n\nvote    campaigns\"     that   are    aimed    at   the    corporations'    own\n\n\"shareholders and executive or administrative personnel and\n\ntheir    families.\"       2    U.S.C.    §    441b(b)(2).      While     Nader\n\n                                     -28-\n\facknowledges that Section 431(9)(B)(ii) contains a more general\n\nexception permitting funding for \"nonpartisan activity designed\n\nto encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote,\" that\n\n\"permission\" comes in the form of an exemption to the FECA's\n\ngeneral definition of \"expenditure.\"                   Nader maintains that the\n\nenactment    of    a     specific      provision       dealing      with   corporate\n\ncontributions and expenditures and defining those terms for that\n\npurpose renders the general definition inapposite, citing the\n\nprinciple that a specific statute governs over a more general\n\none.   See HCSC-Laundry v. United States, 450 U.S. 1, 6 (1981).\n\n\n\n            The    specific        exception      in   Section      441b(b)(2)   for\n\n\"nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns by a\n\ncorporation       aimed    at    its      stockholders        and   executive    and\n\nadministrative personnel and their families,\" Nader argues,\n\nclearly does not exempt funding of candidate debates. Moreover,\n\neven if read in tandem with the general exemption excluding\n\nexpenditures for \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage\n\nindividuals       to    vote    or   to     register     to    vote\"   in   Section\n\n431(9)(B)(ii), Nader maintains that the statute still contains\n\nno   ambiguity         regarding     the    legality     of     expenditures     for\n\n                                           -29-\n\fcandidate   debates   because    a   debate    cannot      reasonably   be\n\ndescribed as such an activity.13        Since sponsoring candidate\n\ndebates does not fall into these exceptions to the prohibition\n\nof Section 441b(a), he contends that the clear intent of\n\nCongress as expressed in that prohibition must govern.              Thus,\n\nNader argues, there is no ambiguity in the statute that would\n\npermit the FEC, under the       Chevron doctrine, to make policy\n\ninterstitially.       While   disavowing      any   need    to   look   at\n\nlegislative history to clarify what Congress meant, Nader says\n\nthat nothing in that history supports the FEC's reading.                And\n\nso, Nader concludes, there is no gap in the statute on the\n\n\n\n\n    13    Congress clearly did intend to permit corporate\nexpenditures, Nader says, at least for internal nonpartisan\nvoter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns. But it is\nnot enough, he argues, for the FEC simply to say that debates\nwill \"stimulate voter interest and that will lead more people to\nregister to vote or to vote.\"      44 Fed. Reg. 76,736 (1979).\nNationally televised debates serve predominantly as \"a critical\ncampaign showpiece for participating candidates.\"          Nader\nconcedes that had Congress said that an exemption applies to\ncorporate expenditures for activities \"such as\" voter\nregistration, then the FEC would be in a stronger position. See\nU.S. v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 387 (1999). But the\nFECA contains no such language.\n\n                                 -30-\n\fprecise question of whether corporate funds can be used to\n\nfinance electoral debates.14\n\n            In the alternative, Nader argues that even under the\n\nsecond stage of Chevron these regulations should fail.                Nader\n\nmaintains    that   the   regulations     cannot   be   a        permissible\n\nconstruction of the statute because they are inconsistent with\n\nthe purposes of the Act.      Nader alleges that the FECA seeks to\n\nrestrict    the   influence   of   corporate   monies       in    political\n\nelections in order to protect the integrity of the electoral\n\nsystem.    Since the debate regulations instead promote corporate\n\ninvolvement in political activity, they are not a reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the FECA.\n\n            Finally, Nader responds to the common sense observation\n\nthat these debate regulations have been in place for more than\n\ntwenty years, that they have governed many well-publicized\n\n\n\n    14    In a footnote in his appellate brief, Nader argues that\neven if Congress did leave the FEC discretion to create\nexceptions to the general prohibition on corporate funding, such\na grant of discretion would violate the nondelegation doctrine\nas recently applied by the D.C. Circuit. See American Trucking\nAss'ns, Inc. v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027 (D.C. Cir. 1999), cert.\ngranted, Browner v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc., 120 S. Ct.\n2003 (2000). Such summary treatment does not permit a reasoned\nanalysis and we disregard the argument.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fdebates, and that Congress never once intimated that the FEC\n\nrules were contrary to its intention.              Nader says that this\n\n\"silence\" proves nothing: a busy Congress cannot be expected to\n\npolice every agency action; indeed, in 5 U.S.C. § 801(g)\n\nCongress forbade the courts to infer any such intent from its\n\nsilence.15\n\n               The    FEC   responds   that   Nader's   emphasis     on     the\n\nnarrowness of the exceptions in Section 441b(b)(2)(B) and\n\nSection 431(9)(B)(ii) is misplaced: the debate regulations do\n\nnot interpret the scope of these exceptions, the FEC contends;\n\nrather, they interpret what types of corporate disbursements\n\ncount     as    \"contributions     and    expenditures\"   in   the        first\n\ninstance. 16         The FEC relies on asserted ambiguities in Section\n\n\n     15   5 U.S.C. § 801(g) states: \"If Congress does not enact\na joint resolution of disapproval under section 802 respecting\na rule, no court or agency may infer any intent of the Congress\nfrom any action or inaction of the Congress with regard to such\nrule, related statute, or joint resolution of disapproval.\"\n     16   Nader suggests in his brief that the FEC has conceded\nin a prior proceeding that donations to debate staging\norganizations would constitute prohibited \"contributions\" absent\nthe \"safe harbor\" created by the debate regulations. However,\nthe FEC opinion he cites simply holds that donations to debate\nstaging organizations that do not meet the requirements of\nSection 110.13 constitute prohibited contributions to the\nparticipating candidates, not that absent the regulations,\n\n                                       -32-\n\f441b as well as Section 431(9) to justify its policymaking\n\nactivity with regard to candidate debates. The general language\n\nof those sections, the FEC contends, says nothing indicating any\n\ncongressional consideration, much less a clear congressional\n\nintent, about whether (or in what circumstances) sponsorship of\n\ncandidate debates should be treated as a \"contribution\" or\n\n\"expenditure,\" which the FEC claims is the \"precise question at\n\nissue\" in this case. Since the general provisions leave this\n\nquestion    open,   the   FEC   argues   that   the   FECA   effectively\n\ndelegates that question to the policymaking authority of the\n\nagency. Moreover, the FEC suggests that its construction of the\n\nstatute is reasonable in three additional respects:           first, the\n\nnarrow construction of the prohibitory language of the Act\n\nserves     to   protect   First    Amendment     interests    otherwise\n\npotentially implicated by it; second, the construction of the\n\nAct accords with Congressional intent as expressed in the\n\n\n\n\ndonations to any debate staging organization would necessarily\nconstitute unlawful contributions.      See FEC Statement of\nReasons, In the Matter of Commission on Presidential Debates\n(April 6, 1998) at 4. In other words, the FEC regulations at\nissue can reasonably be viewed as defining the scope of the\ndefinitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" rather than\ncreating exceptions to their clear terms.\n\n                                  -33-\n\flegislative record; and third, the debate regulations serve\n\npurposes akin to those served by the existing exceptions to the\n\nstatute's prohibitions.         Thus the FEC insists that the debate\n\nregulations reflect a reasonable construction of the FECA that\n\nis due Chevron deference.         Finally, the FEC also points to the\n\nfact that the debate regulations were submitted to Congress,\n\nwhich did not disapprove them, and have been in force quite\n\npublicly for twenty years.\n\n              Our analysis under Chevron begins with the question of\n\nwhether the FECA statutory scheme reveals a clear congressional\n\nintent to ban the particular activity of corporate sponsorship\n\nof the debates as permitted under the regulations.              We conclude\n\nthat several aspects of the statutory scheme, rather than\n\nindicating a clear congressional intent on the issue, in fact\n\nfoster ambiguity.         As a primary matter, it is not clear on the\n\nface of the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" that\n\ncorporate       disbursements     to    nonpartisan      debate    staging\n\norganizations even fall within the scope of the Act's coverage\n\nin    the     first   instance.        Section   441b    bars     corporate\n\ncontributions or expenditures \"in connection with any election,\"\n\n2    U.S.C.    441b(a),    including   direct    or   indirect    corporate\n\n                                    -34-\n\fpayments or gifts \"to any candidate, campaign committee, or\n\npolitical party or organization.\"      Id. § 441b(b)(2).   Section\n\n431(9) defines \"expenditures\" as any payments made \"for the\n\npurpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\"     Id. §\n\n431(9)(a)(i).      In neither case is it clear that corporate\n\ndisbursements to nonprofit debate staging organizations fall\n\nwithin the ambit of the respective definitions, as such payments\n\nare not clearly \"in connection with any election,\" nor are they\n\nclearly \"indirect payments . . . to any candidate,\" nor are they\n\nclearly made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for\n\nFederal office.\"     These imprecise definitional phrases display\n\nthe ambiguity present in the statutory scheme.       The Supreme\n\nCourt itself has observed (in a different context) that the\n\nphrase, \"for the purpose of influencing any election,\" is\n\nambiguous.   See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 79-80 (1976).   In\n\nlight of this uncertainty, the statute taken as a whole does not\n\nexpress a clear congressional intent with respect to the precise\n\nquestion at issue.\n\n         Other language in the FECA reinforces our finding that\n\nthe statute is ambiguous.      First, that Congress intended to\n\ndelegate broad policymaking discretion to the FEC is confirmed\n\n                                -35-\n\fby the statutory charge that the FEC shall \"formulate policy\n\nunder the Act.\"       2 U.S.C. § 437.          Congress also lodged a degree\n\nof   flexibility      in    the    definitions       of   \"contribution\"      and\n\n\"expenditure\" in particular where it defined them to \"include\"\n\ncertain   uses   and       phrased     the   exceptions      to   their    general\n\nprohibitions as enumerating activities that the terms \"shall not\n\ninclude.\"    See id. § 441b.           The Supreme Court has recognized an\n\nelement of flexibility in the term \"include,\" as it indicates\n\nthat \"activities not specifically enumerated in that section may\n\nnonetheless     be    encompassed       by   it.\"      FEC   v.   Massachusetts\n\nCitizens For Life, Inc.,             479 U.S. 238, 246 (1986).            Thus the\n\ndefinitions are not only of uncertain scope but also employ\n\nlanguage suggestive of flexibility.\n\n            The language and structure of the exceptions to the\n\nprohibitions also suggest ambiguity.                   The statutory phrase\n\n\"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote\n\nor   register    to    vote\"      at   Section      431(9)(B)(ii)    gives    the\n\nCommission some leeway to interpret the term \"activity\" and to\n\ndecide which activities so \"encourage\" people. In addition, the\n\nstatutory structure gives rise to a second question: how the\n\nspecific corporate funding prohibition and exception in Section\n\n                                        -36-\n\f441b(b)(2)(B)      are    meant   to     operate    with   the   more       general\n\n\"encouraging activity\" provision of Section 431(9)(B)(ii).                      It\n\nis unclear whether the specific provision trumps the earlier\n\n\"encouraging activity\" exception by limiting it and removing any\n\nleeway in the Commission, as Nader contends, or whether Congress\n\nintended the two sections to work together and to provide some\n\nflexibility to the Commission.            In light of these questions, we\n\nfind the statute is not clear on its face and rules of statutory\n\ninterpretation do not compel any one particular answer to the\n\nprecise question at issue.\n\n             Resort to the legislative history, even if appropriate,\n\nfails   to     dispel     this    uncertainty       and    provide      a    clear\n\nCongressional intent. We explain, beginning with the amendments\n\nCongress     has   made    to     the    Act   in   response     to     judicial\n\ndevelopments. Although the language of the statute is seemingly\n\nbroad, that language has often been reviewed by courts in light\n\nof constitutional constraints, that is, the First Amendment\n\nrights of those regulated.              See United States v. C.I.O., 335\n\nU.S. 106, 123-24 (1948) (union political endorsements directed\n\nto union members are not contributions or expenditure covered by\n\nthe predecessor of the Act); MCFL, 479 U.S. at 249 (corporate\n\n                                        -37-\n\fcommunications about candidates that do not expressly advocate\n\nthe election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate); Maine\n\nRight to Life Committee, Inc. v. FEC, 98 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(same), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 810 (1997); Clifton v. FEC, 114\n\nF.3d 1309 (1st Cir. 1997) (corporate voter guides comparing the\n\npositions of competing candidates), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1108\n\n(1998); Orloski v. FEC, 795 F.2d 156 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (corporate\n\ndonations to picnic during which incumbent candidate addressed\n\nconstitutents).\n\n           These decisions, in turn, led Congress to amend the\n\noriginal statute.        As the FEC notes, the statute has changed\n\nover time so as to mesh more smoothly with subsequent court\n\ndecisions and other related statutes.            The exceptions to the\n\nprohibition now set out in Section 441b(b) were added to the\n\npredecessor of Section 441b in 1971 largely to codify earlier\n\ncourt decisions.    See, e.g., Pipefitters Local Union No. 562 v.\n\nUnited States, 407 U.S. 385, 409-13, 421-27 (1972) (exception\n\nallowing segregated political fund codified prior case law).\n\nCongress   then    refined    the   exceptions    in   1974,   excepting\n\n\"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote\n\nor to   register    to    vote.\"     See 2 U.S.C. § 431(9)(B)(ii).\n\n                                    -38-\n\fFinally, in 1976, Congress incorporated the prohibitions on\n\ncorporate expenditures and the concomitant exceptions previously\n\ncodified at 18 U.S.C. § 610 into the FECA with the enactment of\n\nSection 441b, which specifically excepted from the prohibition\n\non corporate expenditures the internal registration and get-out-\n\nthe-vote   activities   described     earlier.   See   2   U.S.C.   §\n\n441b(b)(2)(B).\n\n           The FEC says that Congress illuminated how these\n\nprovisions were meant to work together in the legislative\n\nhistory:\n\n           The conferees' intent with regard to the inter-\n           relationship between sections [2 U.S.C. 431(9)(B)(ii)]\n           and [2 U.S.C. 441b(b)(2)(B)] which permit such\n           activities as assisting eligible voters to register\n           and get to the polls, so long as these services are\n           made available without regard to the voter's political\n           preference, is the following: these provisions should\n           be read together to permit corporations both to take\n           part in nonpartisan registration and get out the vote\n           activities that are not restricted to stockholders and\n           executive or administrative personnel, if such\n           activities are jointly sponsored by the corporation\n           and an organization that does not endorse candidates\n           and are conducted by that organization; and to permit\n           corporations, on their own, to engage in such\n           activities restricted to executive or administrative\n           personnel and stockholders and their families. The\n           same rule, of course, applies to labor organizations.\n\n\n\n\n                               -39-\n\fH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-1057, at 63-64 (1976).          Indeed, a key\n\nphrase in this legislative history indicates that Congress\n\nintended to permit corporate funding of \"such activities as\"\n\nassisting eligible voters.     Once again, rather than collapsing\n\nambiguity, this legislative history confirms it.\n\n         Finally,   although   our     conclusion   that   the   debate\n\nregulations coincide with congressional intent would be the same\n\nin any event, we note that this view is consistent with\n\nCongress's apparent acquiescence in the regulations under the\n\n\"report and wait\" requirements of the FECA. Nader's reliance on\n\nthe admonition against inferring any intent from Congress's\n\nsilence in 5 U.S.C. § 801(g) is inappropriate, as that provision\n\nis limited to proposed rules submitted to Congress under the\n\ndisapproval mechanism established in 5 U.S.C. §§ 801 and 802,\n\nand hence does not apply to regulations promulgated by the FEC\n\nunder 2 U.S.C. § 438(d) long before the enactment of 5 U.S.C. §\n\n801 in 1996.   Moreover, this is not a situation of complete\n\ncongressional inaction;      the failure to disapprove of the\n\ncurrent debate regulations takes on additional significance in\n\n\n\n\n                                -40-\n\flight of Congress's rejection of the FEC's initial proposal.17\n\nThus we conclude that the FECA expresses no clear congressional\n\nintent on the precise issue in this case -- the corporate\n\nsponsorship of qualified debate staging organizations to defray\n\nthe costs of conducting candidate debates.\n\n            Since we have determined that the FECA does not answer\n\nthe precise question at issue, the question thus becomes whether\n\nthe FEC's efforts in the debate regulations to permit such\n\ncorporate    sponsorship,    and   to   define   the   proper   scope   of\n\n\"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as used by the Act, reflect a\n\npermissible construction of the statute.         Under Chevron, absent\n\nan unambiguously expressed congressional intent on the precise\n\nissue, the courts must defer to the Commission's construction if\n\nit   is   reasonable   and   not   inconsistent    with   the   statute.\n\nDuckworth v. Pratt & Whitney, Inc., 152 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    The debate regulations at issue pass that test.\n\n\n\n     17   Indeed, when the Senate rejected the initial proposal,\nthe floor statements of the resolution's cosponsors indicated\nthat the Senate was concerned that the initial proposed\nregulations were too intrusive and burdensome on debate\nsponsors, not too permissive in allowing corporate sponsorship\nof debates. See 125 Cong. Rec. 24,957-58 (1979) (statements of\nSen. Pell and Sen. Hatfield).\n\n                                   -41-\n\f            First, the debate regulations reflect a reasonable\n\nunderstanding of the purposes of the FECA, and in fact parallel\n\nthe purposes of its express exceptions. In 1979, the Commission\n\naddressed the funding and sponsorship of candidate debates in a\n\nrulemaking.    The Commission decided that since the legislative\n\npolicy behind the express exceptions was to permit corporations\n\nand unions to fund activity directed to the general public to\n\nencourage    voter      participation      so   long   as     the    activity   is\n\nconducted primarily by a nonpartisan organization, \"permitting\n\ncorporations      and    labor    organizations        to    donate    funds    to\n\nnonprofit nonpartisan organizations for [debate] staging is\n\nconsistent    with      congressional      intent      and    policy.\"      FEC,\n\nExplanation    and      Justification,       Funding    and       Sponsorship   of\n\nFederal Candidate Debates, 44 Fed. Reg. 74,734, at 76,736\n\n(1979); see also 44 Fed. Reg. 39,348, at 39,349.                   The Commission\n\nconcluded that \"[t]he educational purposes\" of a debate staged\n\nby such nonpartisan organizations \"is similar to the purpose\n\nunderlying nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote\n\ncampaigns.\"        Id.    at     39,348.        \"Unlike      single    candidate\n\nappearances, nonpartisan debates are designed to educate and\n\ninform   voters    rather      than   to   influence        the    nomination   or\n\n                                      -42-\n\felection of a particular candidate.            Hence, funds received and\n\nexpended [by certain nonprofit organizations] to defray costs\n\nincurred     in    staging   nonpartisan      public    debates   are   not\n\nconsidered contributions or expenditures under the Act.\"                Id.\n\nMoreover, the FEC's debate regulations are in accord with\n\ncongressional expectations as expressed in the legislative\n\nhistory discussed above.          It is certainly within the purview of\n\nagency discretion to accord respect to congressional intent as\n\nreflected in the legislative record.\n\n             Finally, the debate regulations are not inconsistent\n\nwith   the    definitions        of   \"contribution\"    and   \"expenditure\"\n\nprovided by Section 441b.              As the prohibition contained in\n\nSection 441b did not specifically address corporate donations to\n\nnonpartisan       tax   exempt    organizations   but    rather   addressed\n\npayments \"to any candidate, campaign committee, or political\n\nparty or organization,\" the Commission reasonably determined\n\nthat the prohibition need not apply to corporate disbursements\n\nto nonpartisan tax exempt organizations for the limited purpose\n\nof staging candidate debates.            The Commission's determinations\n\nthat the prohibition was especially concerned with \"active\n\nelectioneering\" to promote a particular candidate and that\n\n                                       -43-\n\fsponsoring a nonpartisan debate was not \"active electioneering\"\n\nwere similarly permissible.          And the fact that the regulations\n\nallow corporate contributions to candidate debates in order to\n\nencourage    voter     participation        in    a   fashion    not    expressly\n\npermitted    by     the    statute   does    not      itself    invalidate     the\n\nregulation.        \"Agencies often are allowed through rulemaking to\n\nregulate    beyond     the    express   substantial       directives      of   the\n\nstatute, so long as the statute is not contradicted.\"                    Clifton,\n\n114 F.3d at 1312.             Hence, the Commission's views are not\n\nunreasonable, nor are they inconsistent with the statute.\n\n            We note that Nader's interpretation of the FECA is also\n\nnot unreasonable.          He argues that the debates in fact promote\n\nthe campaigns of those invited to participate.                   As amicus CPD\n\nsays, the goal of its debates \"is to afford the members of the\n\npublic an opportunity to sharpen their views, in a focused\n\ndebate format, of those candidates from among whom the next\n\nPresident and Vice President will be selected.\"18                      Insofar as\n\nsuch     debates    have     the   primary       effect   of    showcasing     the\n\ncandidacies of those selected to participate,                  Nader reasonably\n\n\n       18 We acknowledge with appreciation the amicus brief\nsubmitted by the CPD.\n\n                                      -44-\n\fconcludes that corporate funding of the debates might be viewed\n\nas     contributing     in     effect   to    the   candidacies     of    the\n\nparticipants.    But Congress gave the choice as to the preferred\n\nreasonable interpretation to the FEC, not to Nader.                The task\n\nfor the reviewing court under Chevron is only to undertake the\n\nnarrow    inquiry     into    whether   the    agency's    construction   is\n\nsufficiently reasonable to be accepted by the reviewing court.\n\n            The debate regulations at issue do not contravene the\n\nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress, as reflected in the\n\nFECA statutory scheme, but rather fall within the scope of the\n\npolicymaking authority Congress delegated to the FEC under the\n\nAct.       Moreover,     the     regulations     reflect    a    permissible\n\nconstruction of the statute, indeed one that easily falls within\n\nthe reasonable ambit of the statutory terms.\n\n            We reject Nader’s challenge and affirm the district\n\ncourt judgment dismissing his suit.            So ordered.      No costs are\n\nawarded.\n\n                             Concurrence follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\f         TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, concurring.    Although I agree\n\nwith the majority's affirmance of the district court's dismissal\n\nof this action, I would not have reached the merits of this\n\ncase, because I believe Ralph Nader lacks standing for the\n\nreasons stated herein. Even if Nader has standing, I would find\n\nthat there is no Article III case or controversy here, as\n\nNader's claim is moot at this point in the litigation.\n\n                              I.\n\n         Standing doctrine embraces both constitutional mandates\n\nand prudential considerations.1    See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S.\n\n\n    1     Because I find that Nader lacks the constitutional\nrequirements for standing, I have not addressed the issue of\nprudential standing.      However, a plaintiff generally has\nprudential standing under § 10(a) of the APA when his interest\nis \"arguably\" within the \"zone of interests to be protected or\nregulated by the statue in question.\" National Credit Union\nAdmin. v. First Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 489 (1998)\n(quoting Assoc. of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., 397 U.S. 150,\n153).   Given that this section of the FECA is designed to\nprevent corruption in campaign finance, see, e.g., FEC v.\nNational Right to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 209 (1982), and that\nNader challenges it not based on corruption per se, but because\nit provides additional advantages to his competitors, his injury\nat first blush lies outside the statutory zone of protection.\nThe fact that Nader personally is concerned with corruption in\npolitics is particularly irrelevant to the standing question.\nSee Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 573-74 (1992)\n(\"[A] citizen's interest in proper application of the\nConstitution and laws . . . does not state an Article III case\nor controversy.\"); United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114\n\n                              -46-\n\f737,   751   (1983).   When   a   plaintiff   lacks   standing   in   a\n\nconstitutional    sense,   this   Court   lacks   jurisdiction   under\n\nArticle III.    See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498-99 (1975).\n\nThe constitutional component of standing derived from Article\n\nIII requires that \"a plaintiff . . . allege personal injury\n\nfairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct\n\nand likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\"       Allen, 468\n\nU.S. at 751.      In other words, the plaintiff must show (1)\n\n\"actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant's\n\nputatively illegal conduct,\" (2) \"that the injury may fairly be\n\ntraced to the challenged action,\" and (3) \"that a favorable\n\ndecision will redress the injury.\"            Vote Choice Inc. v.\n\nDiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1993).             Although these\n\nconcepts are admittedly \"not susceptible of precise definition,\"\n\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"A mere interest in an event--no matter how\npassionate or sincere the interest and no matter how charged\nwith public import the event--will not substitute for an actual\ninjury.\").\n     Furthermore, to the extent the district court viewed the\nprudential analysis as considerations \"weighing\" in Nader's\nfavor, the court made an error of law. If the plaintiff fails\nto meet the constitutional standing guidelines, no assessment of\nhis personal concern can create an Article III case or\ncontroversy. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at\n560-61 (three elements are the \"irreducible constitutional\nminimum\").\n\n                                  -47-\n\fAllen, 468 U.S. at 751, our case law has provided a sufficient\n\noutline of the standing map to address this petitioner.\n\n         The     extent   and    type   of   injury   required   for\n\nconstitutional standing is not easily defined.        It must at the\n\nvery least be \"distinct and palpable,\" id. (quoting Gladstone,\n\nRealtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100 (1979)), and\n\nnot \"abstract,\" \"conjectural,\" or \"hypothetical,\" id. (quoting\n\nLos Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-102 (1983); O'Shea v.\n\nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974)).        As I read his claim,\n\nNader asserts two distinct theories of injury. First, he claims\n\nan injury derived from the      \"coercive choice\" potentially posed\n\nby the allegedly illegal debate regulations.           According to\n\nNader, if he is invited to participate in the debates, he will\n\nbe forced into a Hobbesian choice: either compromise of his\n\ncorporate watchdog platform or loss of an important avenue for\n\ncommunication.     Second, Nader claims injury as a political\n\ncompetitor: opponents invited to the debate benefit directly\n\nfrom allegedly illegal corporate sponsorship.\n\n         The problem with the majority approach, as I see it,\n\nis that the majority found standing here by collapsing these two\n\nvery separate theories.    If he had been invited to the debate,\n\n                                 -48-\n\fNader may indeed have faced a choice between accepting corporate\n\nsponsorship and losing free national exposure.         However, as he\n\nwas not invited to the debate, he did not face this choice; he\n\ncannot be injured by any coercive effect it might have had, or\n\nby any strategic changes to his campaign such a choice might\n\nentail.    Likewise, it is surely true that Nader was at a\n\ncompetitive disadvantage because his opponents participated in\n\nthe debates.   He may have had to alter his strategy to cope with\n\nthe free air time that they receive.           However, to the extent\n\nthat Nader faces this problem, it is because he is a political\n\ncompetitor, not because he faces a coerced choice under the Vote\n\nChoice analysis; his unwillingness to participate in the debates\n\nif invited did not affect Nader's response to this free air\n\ntime.     And as I discuss below, his injury as a political\n\ncompetitor is   not   traceable    to    the   challenged   regulations\n\nbecause he cannot show that the debates likely would not occur\n\nwithout the corporate sponsorship.2\n\n\n    2     Throughout, the majority examines Nader's situation in\nJune, when this lawsuit was filed, under the assumption that\nstanding is measured only at the time of filing. Although some\ncases hold that standing is only measured at that time, other\ncases point in the opposite direction, i.e., that a petitioner\nmust retain standing throughout the litigation.      See, e.g.,\n\n                                  -49-\n\f                                  A.\n\n          I began by addressing the \"coerced choice\" theory.\n\nRelying   on   Vote   Choice,   Nader   claims   that   the   allegedly\n\nimpermissible regulation coercively impacted the strategy and\n\nconduct of his presidential campaign.      In Vote Choice, Elizabeth\n\nLeonard, a Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate, challenged a\n\nset of state campaign finance laws that: (i) required candidates\n\n\n\n\nPowder River Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477,\n1485 (10th Cir. 1995).     Such a conclusion would seriously\ncomplicate the majority's approach; far before oral argument it\nwas quite clear that Nader would not receive an invitation to\nthe debate, and thus his campaign strategy was determined\nwithout any influence of a potential choice.\n\n     Although the majority suggests that Powder River no longer\nprovides any authority because of the Supreme Court's\nintervening decision in Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\nEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 120 S. Ct. 693 (2000), I note that\nalthough the Court described standing as \"[t]he requisite\npersonal interest that must exist at the commencement of the\nlitigation,\" id. at 709, it also did \"not license courts to\nretain jurisdiction over cases in which one or both parties\nplainly lacks a continuing interest,\" id. at 710. Friends of\nthe Earth thus distinguished standing from mootness, but\nprimarily to indicate that because the mootness analysis occurs\nat the end of litigation, there are important differences\nbetween the two doctrines. See id. My point here, which is\nsupported by Powder River and not directly contradicted by\nFriends of the Earth, is that when standing disappears in the\nearly stages of litigation, we should perhaps dismiss for lack\nof standing even if it may have existed at the time of the\ncomplaint.\n\n                                 -50-\n\fupon declaring their candidacy to make an irrevocable election\n\nwhether to use public funds; (ii) forced candidates electing to\n\nuse public funds to sign an irrevocable pledge to abide by\n\nvarious terms and conditions of the fund grant; and (iii)\n\ncreated significant differences in legally allowed contributions\n\nbetween those who accepted and those who did not accept public\n\nfunding (a so-called \"contribution cap gap\").             Although Leonard\n\nhad not accepted the public funding and never actually faced a\n\npublicly funded opponent, we found that she retained standing to\n\nchallenge the public funding provisions. We reasoned that \"when\n\ndeclaring her candidacy, Leonard had to make an irrevocable\n\ncommitment\" as to her use of public funding.               Vote Choice, 4\n\nF.3d at 36-37.       As a result, she had to plan her campaign\n\nstrategy based on the possibility that her opponent (perhaps an\n\nundeclared one) would make the opposite choice; \"the coerced\n\nchoice between public and private financing colored her campaign\n\nstrategy from the outset.\"           Id.    We concluded that \"such an\n\nimpact   on   the   strategy   and    conduct   of   an   office-seeker's\n\npolitical campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to\n\nconfer standing.     See id.\n\n\n\n                                     -51-\n\f            Nader   argues,    and   the    majority   agrees,   that   the\n\nallegedly    illegal    corporate      contributions     to   the   debate\n\norganizing entity create a coercive choice of the type in Vote\n\nChoice, and thus standing follows.               However, there is an\n\nimportant distinction between the two situations.             Vote Choice\n\ndid not grant Leonard standing simply because of the benefits\n\ngiven to her publicly funded opponents under Rhode Island\n\ncampaign finance law.     To do so would have premised standing on\n\nLeonard's injury as a political competitor; that is, it would\n\nhave found injury due to the additional benefits accrued by her\n\nopponents.    Such a theory may be viable here, and I discuss it\n\nbelow. Vote Choice, however, premised standing on the fact that\n\nLeonard's choice not to accept such benefits shaped her strategy\n\nthroughout the race.          In other words, because Rhode Island\n\nprovided allegedly unlawful incentives to accept public funding,\n\na candidate could challenge those incentives even if they did\n\nnot ultimately rely on them.         But in the present case, Nader was\n\nnot coerced into making this choice –             in fact, he has been\n\nsaved from coercion by the lack of sufficient public support to\n\nmeet the threshold set by the Commission on Public Debates (the\n\n\"CPD\").   Unlike Leonard, whose campaign strategy was altered by\n\n                                     -52-\n\fan irrevocable choice made at the start of her campaign, Nader\n\nnever faced such a dilemma.                If he had, I would have found\n\nstanding under Vote Choice.\n\n            However, the majority finds potential coercion even\n\nwhen none actually exists. In my view, by creating a present\n\nharm from the possibility of a future one, they dangerously\n\nexpand our standing jurisprudence. The majority begins with the\n\ntheory that because Nader has chosen not to accept corporate\n\ncontributions, he was barred from the debates at the time the\n\nCPD accepted corporate donations, whether he proved ultimately\n\neligible    or    not.         If    the   debates    were   not   funded    by\n\ncorporations, however, Nader would have been able and willing to\n\nparticipate if he had been invited. This seems plausible to me.\n\nHowever, the majority continues, this \"threat\" of being forced\n\nto decline a debate invitation in the future \"had a palpable and\n\nimmediate     impact      on        [Nader's]    campaign     strategy      and\n\nexpenditures,\" namely that Nader spent \"more on advertising than\n\nhe would [have] if there remained a chance that he could appear\n\nin the debate.\"          I agree with the majority that it is not\n\ngenerally    proper      for    this    institution    \"to   second-guess    a\n\ncandidate's      reasonable         assessment   of   his    own   campaign.\"\n\n                                       -53-\n\fHowever, I am not willing to grant a petitioner seeking standing\n\nfree reign to allege changes in strategy forced only by the\n\npossibility   of   future   events.     Much   as   our    standing\n\njurisprudence requires the injury to be \"distinct and palpable,\"\n\nAllen, 468 U.S. at 751, I believe that a strategic harm argued\n\nunder Vote Choice must be more than a mere potentiality.        And\n\nunlike the majority, I find something \"improbable\" about the\n\nproposition that a threatened choice three months in the future\n\nimpacted Nader's strategy at the time of the complaint.\n\n         Let me expand.     In June of 2000, at the time he filed\n\nthis complaint, Nader admittedly failed to meet the eligibility\n\nrequirements set by the CPD in January of 2000.3    Specifically,\n\nhe had not reached the 15% popular opinion threshold, although\n\nsome polls had him in the 6 % range.   See Frank Newport, Gallup\n\nNews Service, Poll Releases (October 23, 2000), available at\n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr001023.asp.         In   June,\n\nNader's potential strategies were thus either to attempt to\n\n\n\n    3     These eligibility requirements were: (i) constitutional\neligibility; (ii) appearance on a sufficient number of state\nballots to achieve an Electoral College majority; and (iii) a\nlevel of support exceeding 15% according to major national\npolls. See Joint Appendix 174-76.\n\n                               -54-\n\freach the 15% threshold, so that he would be eligible for the\n\nfree exposure of the debates, or not to attempt to reach the 15%\n\nthreshold.    However, given that he was running for President of\n\nthe United States, the latter choice does not seem a viable one\n\n– whether or not he received a debate invitation.             Moreover,\n\nNader has never asserted that, because he would not accept a\n\ndebate invitation under any circumstances, he resigned himself\n\nto a failed campaign that would never reach the 15% mark.\n\n            Even   ignoring   the   infirmities   of   this   theory   of\n\nstrategic impact, I note that Nader has not alleged that his\n\ncampaign strategy was so affected by the potential choice which\n\nhe faced.     His main brief merely asserts that \"Nader and his\n\norganizational supporters have been forced to adjust their\n\ncampaign strategy to compensate for the benefits conferred upon\n\nNader's competitors by the Debate Regulations\" (emphasis added).\n\nIn Nader's reply brief, he explains the strategic impact of the\n\nregulations in slightly more detail: \"Nader has been forced to\n\nspend more of his campaign's money on advertising in order to\n\novercome the free television time that candidates Bush and Gore\n\nhave and will continue to receive as debate participants.\"             In\n\nthis regard, Nader is correct: the fact that his opponents will\n\n                                    -55-\n\fparticipate in the debates and that he will not (either because\n\nhe is not invited or because he chooses not to) means he will\n\nhave to spend additional advertising funds to match their free\n\ntelevision time.    However, Nader's phrasing indicates that the\n\nstrategic impact of the debate regulations, in his mind, is only\n\nrelated to the receipt of illegal (according to him) money by\n\nhis opponents.      Nader says nothing about planning for the\n\npossibility of receiving free debate time; he has apparently\n\nassumed that he will not compete and formed his campaign\n\nstrategy based on that assumption.           This is very different from\n\nthe strategic impact proposed by the majority, and it is also\n\nforeign to our analysis in           Vote Choice.     At base, Nader is\n\nclaiming   injury   as    a   political      competitor;   the   majority's\n\nattempt to dress it as a future choice with a present strategic\n\nimpact is misguided and not supported by either appellant's\n\nbrief or their approach at oral argument.             Furthermore, unlike\n\nin Vote Choice, the district court here failed to make clear\n\nfindings of strategy, simply noting that appellants had alleged\n\na strategic harm.        See Becker v. FEC, No. 00-11192-PBS, at 14\n\n(D. Mass., September 1, 2000).         Even if it is inappropriate for\n\na court    to   evaluate      the   actual   impact   of   a   choice   on   a\n\n                                     -56-\n\fcandidate's strategy, and even if a court should accept the\n\ncandidate's assessment of the impact at face value with hardly\n\nany inquiry, we need not premise injury on a supposed strategic\n\nimpact not even argued by the petitioner.\n\n         In short, I find that theoretical injury caused by\n\npotential future choices is the type of injury the Supreme Court\n\nwarned against in Lujan.   In Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), we noted specific hurdles for abstract harms\n\nsuch as this:\n\n         The [Supreme] Court placed a special gloss\n         on cases in which a party seeks exclusively\n         injunctive or declaratory relief. In such\n         purlieus, standing inheres only if the\n         complainant can show that he has suffered\n         (or has been threatened with) \"an invasion\n         of a legally protected interest which is . .\n         . concrete and particularized,\" Lujan, 504\n         U.S. at 560, together with \"a sufficient\n         likelihood that he will again be wronged in\n         a significant way,\" Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111.\n         In other words, the complainant must\n         establish that the feared harm is \"actual or\n         imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n         Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.     It bears noting\n         that the imminence concept, while admittedly\n         far reaching, is bounded by its Article III\n         purpose: \"to ensure that the alleged injury\n         is not too speculative.\" Id. at 564 n.2.\n\nI do not find that Nader has made a sufficient showing of a\n\n\"concrete and particularized\" injury; the unfocused \"threat\" of\n\n                              -57-\n\fa   coerced   choice   sometime   hence   is   much   like   the   overly\n\nspeculative \"'some day' intentions\" that the Supreme Court found\n\nlacking in Lujan.      Id. at 564.\n\n           The problem of abstractness and lack of imminence is\n\nfurther revealed by the opening the majority creates for future\n\nlitigants.    Because the majority analysis places its present\n\nharm in the possibility of a future choice, anyone that could\n\nface the future choice must have the same injury.            No language\n\nin the majority necessarily restricts this to candidates with a\n\nsignificant chance of facing the future choice; presumably, the\n\npossibility of this choice affected Nader's strategy prior to\n\nJune.    It theoretically could have altered his decision even to\n\nenter the race.        In expanding standing to Nader here, the\n\nmajority grants standing to any political entrant to challenge\n\nany election regulation to which they might someday be subject.4\n\n\n     4    Although the majority contends that its holding is\n\"nowhere near so broad\" as I have suggested, I am unconvinced.\nTheir basic point is that potential choices in the future can\nalter strategy today, and that forced changes in strategy today\ncan meet the injury requirement for standing. I see no clear\nway of distinguishing Nader's \"plausible\" hope that he would be\ninvited to the debates \"at a definite date\" in the future, from\nperhaps slightly less plausible (but still possible) hopes that\nmay occur at a more distant time.\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\f                                    B.\n\n           Nader's second theory of standing is not based on the\n\nstrategic underpinnings of his own campaign, but on the theory\n\nthat the corporate contributions to the CPD impermissibly help\n\nhis competitors,      essentially     providing     Gore    and   Bush   with\n\ninexpensive access to extensive media coverage. The theory that\n\na political competitor incurs injury because of an impermissible\n\nbenefit to his opponent is premised on a line of cases granting\n\nstanding   to   economic    competitors.      See,     e.g.,      Clarke   v.\n\nSecurities Indus. Ass'n, 479 U.S. 308, 403 (1987).\n\n           Courts have, however, been reluctant to adopt this\n\n\"political competitor\" theory of standing, not so much because\n\nthe injury faced by a plaintiff is not a real one, but because\n\nthat   injury   generally    cannot   be   traced    to    the    challenged\n\nregulation,     nor   is    the   injury    usually        redressable     by\n\n\n\n\n     For example, Nader is running for President. Presumably,\nissues affecting the President of the United States inform his\ndecision to run, which is undoubtedly part and parcel of his\ncampaign strategy.    Yet I doubt very much that the majority\nwould grant Nader standing to challenge, say, the calculation of\nthe presidential salary, simply because he may potentially be\nsubject to its dictates. However, I believe that the majority's\ntheory of standing would require them to do so if Nader asserted\nthat such issues altered his current campaign strategy.\n\n                                  -59-\n\finvalidating the regulation. Three cases pursued by minor party\n\ncandidate Lenora Fulani indicate the contours of this standing\n\ndoctrine.    In Fulani v. League of Women Voters Educ. Fund, 882\n\nF.2d 621 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit found that Fulani\n\nhad standing to challenge the tax-exempt status of the League of\n\nWomen Voters.       Fulani claimed that the League's refusal to\n\ninclude her in debates deprived her of critical media exposure\n\nand   competitive    advantage,   as   well   as   the   opportunity   to\n\ncommunicate her political ideas to the electorate.            The court\n\nfound   that:\n\n            [T]he loss of competitive advantage flowing\n            from the League's exclusion of Fulani from\n            the national debates constitutes sufficient\n            \"injury\" for standing purposes, because such\n            loss palpably impaired Fulani's ability to\n            compete on an equal footing with other\n            significant presidential candidates.      To\n            hold otherwise would tend to diminish the\n            import of depriving a serious candidate for\n            public office of the opportunity to compete\n            equally for votes in an election, and would\n            imply that such a candidate could never\n            challenge the conduct of the offending\n            agency or party.\n\nFulani v. League, 882 F.2d at 626.            The Second Circuit then\n\nfound that the other prerequisites for standing were met,\n\nbecause removing the League's not-for-profit status would end\n\n\n                                  -60-\n\fthe League's ability to sponsor debates, and probably would have\n\nmeant the absence of any debates in the 1988 campaign season.\n\n         In Fulani v. Brady, 935 F.2d 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1991) and\n\nFulani v. Bentsen, 35 F.3d 49 (2d Cir. 1994), both the Second\n\nand the D.C. Circuits cut back on this approach, in cases more\n\nnearly mirroring our own.   In Fulani v. Brady, Fulani sought\n\nstanding to challenge the tax-exempt status of the CPD based on\n\nits decision that she lacked a realistic chance of being elected\n\nPresident, and its concordant refusal to invite her to the 1988\n\npresidential debates.   The D.C. Circuit focused its inquiry on\n\nthe fact that Fulani was challenging a tax exemption, and noted\n\nstrong judicial precedent against the ability to challenge the\n\ntax treatment of a competitor.   See id. at 1327.   In particular,\n\nFulani could not meet the standing requirements of traceability\n\nand redressability: first, many factors beyond the tax-exempt\n\nstatus of the CPD were influential in excluding Fulani from the\n\ndebates; second, revocation of the tax-exempt status of the CPD\n\nwould not necessarily have any impact on the purportedly unfair\n\nprovision of media coverage to the major party candidates.    See\n\nid. at 1328-29.    Although Nader is not challenging a tax\n\nexemption, his claim is once removed because it does not\n\n                              -61-\n\fchallenge the entity hosting the debate (the CPD) but that\n\nentity's source of funds.     At best, a Nader victory here could\n\nrequire the CPD to find other sources of funds; it would not\n\nnecessarily reduce his opponent's television exposure, nor would\n\nit likely cancel the debates.\n\n           In Fulani v. Bentsen, Fulani again challenged the tax\n\nstatus of the League.     However, the Second Circuit, noting that\n\nthe debate in question was co-sponsored by CNN, refused to find\n\ninjury based on \"the alleged incremental advantage accorded\n\nparticipants in debates in which the League plays a sponsoring\n\nrole.\"    Id. at 52-53.    In other words, the fact that Fulani's\n\ncompetitors might benefit from the accouterments of League\n\nsponsorship was insufficient to create standing. Similarly, the\n\nfact that Nader's competitors may gain incremental advantages\n\nthrough   their   association   with   corporate   sponsors   is   an\n\ninsufficient basis for standing, given that a decision by this\n\nCourt will have little or no impact on the exposure they gain\n\ndue to the debate.\n\n           Moreover, the Second Circuit has indicated that for a\n\nplaintiff to gain standing as a political competitor, he must\n\n\"personally compete in the same arena with the same party to\n\n                                -62-\n\fwhom   the   government         has    bestowed    the    assertedly         illegal\n\nbenefit.\"       In re United States Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d\n\n1020, 1029 (2d Cir. 1989).                 In this case, the benefit has\n\nperhaps been conferred upon the sponsoring corporations, who at\n\nthe most are allowed to further their political viewpoint by\n\nsponsoring      a    two-person       debate,    and    at    least    are     given\n\nadditional air-time for their beer and pretzels.                      Perhaps the\n\nbenefit has been conferred upon CPD, the entity which receives\n\nthe allegedly illegal contributions.                   Nader would argue that\n\nGore and Bush receive the unlawful benefit, and that as their\n\ncompetitor      he    has    standing.         However,      Fulani    v.    Bentsen\n\nexplicitly refused to extend the competitive standing rule to\n\nencompass this removed level of competition.                     Id. at 54 (\"We\n\ndecline to extend the rule of Catholic Conference to encompass\n\nnot only a plaintiff's competitors in a defined arena, but also\n\nany    entity       that    provides   a    tangential       benefit    to    those\n\ncompetitors.\").        Nader does compete with Bush and Gore, who may\n\nor may not have received tangential benefits from corporate\n\nsponsorship of the debates; however, I fear that expanding\n\ncompetitor standing to this extent gives plaintiffs the ability\n\nto challenge a host of regulations that, while undoubtedly\n\n                                        -63-\n\fhaving incidental beneficial effects on their competitors, are\n\nnot traceable to a concrete, particularized harm.        See Catholic\n\nConference, 885 F.2d at 1028; see also Gottlieb v. FEC, 143 F.3d\n\n618, 621 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (AmeriPAC could not challenge matching\n\nfunds received by the Clinton campaign, because it was never in\n\na position to receive such matching funds itself).\n\n                                 C.\n\n           The majority rues the fact that this analysis \"leads\n\nto the result that no candidate could ever challenge the FEC\n\nregulations in question here, regardless of how likely he or she\n\nwas to be invited to the debate.\"          First, I dispute this\n\npremise.   Although no candidate may be able to challenge the\n\nregulations under a political competitor theory of standing, it\n\nis certainly possible that a candidate would have standing under\n\nthe Vote Choice theory, if he or she actually faced a coerced\n\nchoice.    If Nader had reached the 15% mark, been invited to\n\ndebate, and then refused to do so, I would be tempted to find\n\nstanding here. Al Gore or George W. Bush could potentially have\n\nchallenged the regulations as well.        Furthermore, under the\n\ncompetitor theory, a rival debate organization or a potential\n\nnon-corporate   sponsor   that    could   not   afford    the   CPD's\n\n                                 -64-\n\fsponsorship     prices   might     have    successfully    defended   their\n\nstanding as an economic competitor.           In any event, even in the\n\nmajority's refusal to read Vote Choice as implying that \"the\n\nregulations might effectively be immune from judicial review,\"\n\nthe majority admits that the fact that the plaintiff might be\n\nthe best person to have standing does not in itself give them\n\nstanding.    See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United\n\nfor the Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 489\n\n(1982).\n\n            I do not doubt \"the powerful beneficial effect that\n\nmass media exposure can have today on the candidacy of a\n\nsignificant aspirant seeking national political office.\" Fulani\n\nv.    League,   882   F.2d    at   626.     But   this    effect   alone   is\n\ninsufficient to confer standing on such an aspirant simply\n\nbecause his claim is related to this mass media exposure.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            The majority gives short shrift to the question of\n\nmootness, stating conclusively that \"this sort of case qualifies\n\nfor   the   exception    to    mootness     for   disputes    'capable     of\n\nrepetition, yet evading review.'\" I have no quarrel with the\n\nclaim that this case is capable of repetition: under the\n\n                                    -65-\n\fmajority's theory of standing, in fact, it is all too capable of\n\nrepetition as any candidate or potential candidate could claim\n\nthat their strategy is affected by the potential that they will\n\nbe subject to a choice down the campaign trail.\n\n            The Supreme Court has indicated that election cases are\n\nparticularly privy to this mootness exception.             See Storer v.\n\nBrown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8; Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S.\n\n752, 756 n.5 (1973); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 333 n.2\n\n(1972); Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 816 (1969).               However,\n\nall of these cases      involved burdens placed on candidates or\n\nvoters in order for them to participate in the election process,\n\nan inherently time-sensitive issue.5        For example, in Storer,\n\npetitioners challenged ballot access and nomination procedures\n\nnecessarily    occurring   between   the   primary   and    the    general\n\nelection.    See id. at 726-28; see also Rockefeller, 410 U.S. at\n\n752-56 (similar issue).      Dunn involved a challenge to state\n\n\n    5     In addition, these election exceptions to mootness\ninvolved First Amendment constitutional challenges, an area\nafforded special treatment by the Court's standing and mootness\njurisprudence. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991)\nIn contrast, Nader does not raise a First Amendment challenge of\nany sort, but simply challenges the legality of FEC regulations.\nThe majority recognizes this distinction, but chooses to rely\nupon it to find an exception here.\n\n                                -66-\n\fresidency requirements which a would-be voter might not be able\n\nto challenge until just before the election, and which would\n\nwithout   the   exception   become   moot   immediately    after   the\n\nelection.    See id. at 333-34.      In Fulani v. League, Fulani's\n\nstanding arose only at the time she was not invited to the\n\ndebates, which meant that not enough time remained to litigate\n\nprior to the debates being held.       See id. at 628.    It is ironic\n\nthat the very rationale which the majority used to grant Nader\n\nstanding should now (I believe) lead them to find mootness.\n\nUnder the majority's new standing jurisprudence, Nader could\n\nhave brought his suit at any time after announcing his candidacy\n\nand possibly before doing so.        A future petitioner who faces\n\nthis same strategic problem will have ample time to sue in a\n\nmanner so that we can redress his injury if appropriate.\n\n            Moreover, the procedural history of this case indicates\n\nthat future cases in which standing arises will not necessarily\n\nevade our review. Nader's complaint was filed on June 29, 2000.\n\nHowever, oral argument was not until six weeks later, on August\n\n14, 2000.    The argument was delayed by both the recusal of the\n\noriginal assigned judge and by at least one unopposed motion to\n\nextend time (made by the FEC).         Although the district court\n\n                                -67-\n\fissued its Memorandum and Order relatively quickly, on September\n\n1, 2000, two more weeks passed until a final judgment was\n\nentered on September 18, 2000.            This Court granted expedited\n\nreview and oral arguments were heard on October 5, 2000.\n\nAlthough we have not issued our opinion until now, we certainly\n\ncould   have   done   so   with   more    alacrity   if   it   had   proved\n\nnecessary.     Given the procedural history of this case, it can\n\nhardly be said that an Article III case or controversy on the\n\nissues raised would not be capable of full litigation and\n\nappellate review in a sufficient time to prevent mootness.\n\n          This case should never have reached the merits of the\n\nchallenge to the FEC regulation.          Nader lacked standing, either\n\nbecause his injury was hypothetical, or because his injury,\n\nalthough potentially real, was not traceable to the challenged\n\nregulations and not redressable by the invalidation of the\n\nchallenged regulations.       Moreover, by the time the litigation\n\nreached this court, Nader's harm had become moot.              Although I\n\nagree with the majority that this appeal should be dismissed, I\n\nwould not have reached the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -68-\n\f",

Those regulations permit corporations to make contributions from their general treasuries to qualified nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations staging federal candidate debates. Suit was brought in anticipation of the debates to be staged by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) before the November 2000 Presidential Election. The district court dismissed Nader's claims on the merits and entered judgment on September 14, 2000. Nader appealed and this court granted expedited review. We hold, contrary to the FEC, that we have Article III jurisdiction and, contrary to Nader, that the plaintiffs' facial challenge to the debate regulations fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the 2000 presidential debates on the horizon, Nader, nominee of the Green Party, together with organizations supporting his campaign, as well as both supportive and uncommitted individual voters, brought this action on June 19, 2000 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs challenge as ultra vires two FEC regulations, 11 C.F.R.  110.13 and 114.4(f), which allow qualified nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations to accept corporate donations in staging presidential debates and allow corporations to make such donations. The plaintiffs claim that the regulations violate a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C.  431 et seq. , which makes it unlawful for a corporation to make any \"contribution or expenditure in connection with\" the presidential elections. Id.  441b(a). The Act defines \"contribution or expenditure\" to include \"any direct or indirect payment . . . or gift of money, or any services, or anything of value . . . to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization.\" Id.  441b(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 29, the plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin the FEC from implementing the challenged regulations and requested that the district court order the FEC to enforce the FECA's prohibition on corporate contributions so as to prevent corporate sponsorship of the presidential debates. The FEC moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that none of the plaintiffs could demonstrate Article III standing and that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding oral argument on both motions on August 14, 2000, the district court on September 1 denied the FEC's motion to dismiss, concluding that Nader and the Green Party had standing to challenge the FEC's debate regulations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that plaintiffs were entitled to review because the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act applied. The court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, however, finding no likelihood of success on the merits, on the basis that the regulations were based on a reasonable interpretation of the FECA entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, the district court entered final judgment in accordance with a stipulation of the parties, and plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited review in this court, which the FEC opposed. We granted plaintiffs' motion on September 26, 2000, ordered expedited briefing, and heard oral argument on October 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address the FEC's argument that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Like the district court, we think the plaintiffs are not required to petition the FEC before bringing a facial challenge to the agency's regulations. Because the FECA itself has no provisions governing judicial review of FEC regulations, the judicial review procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  701 et seq., apply to a facial challenge to the FECA's implementing regulations. See Perot v. FEC, 97 F.3d 553, 560-61 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Faucher v. FEC, 743 F. Supp. 64, 68 (1990), aff'd 928 F.2d 968 (1st Cir. 1991). The FEC has steadfastly maintained that these debate regulations are valid and there is no point in requiring plaintiffs to go through exhaustion. See Skubel v. Fuoroli, 113 F.3d 330, 334 (2d Cir. 1997); Brown v. Secretary of HHS, 46 F.3d 102, 113-14 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider whether the plaintiffs have standing. Standing doctrine involves \"a blend of constitutional requirements and prudential considerations.\" Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982). The constitutional component of standing stems directly from Article III's limitation of federal judicial power to deciding justiciable cases or controversies. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751(1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> To establish standing, it does not suffice for plaintiffs to show merely that they bring a justiciable issue before the court; they must show further that they have a sufficiently personal stake in the issue. This means that plaintiffs must show: (1) that they have suffered or are in danger of suffering some injury that is both concrete and particularized to them; (2) that this injury is fairly traceable to the allegedly illegal conduct of the defendant; and (3) that a favorable decision will likely redress the injury. See Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 472; see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1993). We first determine whether Nader has standing; we then turn to the voter plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Whether Nader Has Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues that the FEC regulations allowing corporate sponsorship of the presidential debates have injured him by making corporate contributions available to his opponents (in the form of free television exposure during the debates) when such contributions are not available to him. Consequently, Nader has been put at a competitive disadvantage in the presidential race, and as a result he has had to alter his campaign strategy and spend more on advertising in order to compensate for this disadvantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC's central counterargument is that the injuries Nader alleges are not fairly traceable to the FEC regulations he challenges. Nader's standing theory is misplaced, the FEC contends: while it might be true that Nader's exclusion from the debates puts him at a competitive disadvantage, Nader is not challenging his exclusion from the debates. As plaintiffs state in their brief: \"This is a lawsuit about the funding of presidential debates, not a challenge to the rules governing participation in debates.\" Moreover, Nader concedes that, even if FEC regulations did not allow corporate sponsorship of the debates, the debates would likely be held anyway, with funding coming from public sources or the media; and Nader makes no claim that in such event he would have a better chance of being invited to participate. Thus Nader has failed to show, the FEC concludes, that there is a causal nexus between corporate sponsorship of the debates and the injuries he alleges as his basis for standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Nader argues that there is such a causal nexus. At the time that he brought this suit, Nader still stood a chance of being invited to participate in the debates. Yet if he were invited, he says, he would be forced to decline the invitation due to his principled stand against accepting corporate contributions. The consequences of this Faustian dilemma, he argues, suffice for standing: not only did it create the potential injury of having to cede to his opponents the advantage of free television exposure, but it also forced him presently to conduct his campaign and make advertising expenditures on the assumption that no such exposure would be available to him. In this sense, corporate sponsorship threatened to exclude him from the debates and had a palpable and immediate impact on his campaign strategy and expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his position, Nader cites Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1993). In that case, Elizabeth Leonard, a Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate, challenged a state campaign finance law requiring all candidates, at the time they declared their candidacies, to choose whether to accept public funding for their campaigns. The law at issue attached certain benefits to the acceptance of public funding, such as free air time on community television and higher caps on campaign contributions. See id. at 29-30. Leonard chose to decline public funding and thereby to forego the accompanying benefits. As a result, this court held, she had standing. Given Leonard's choice not to accept public funding, the law put her at a potential disadvantage as to any publicly funded opponents she might face, forcing her to structure her campaign to anticipate and offset that disadvantage. See id. at 36-37. \"In our view,\" we held, \"such an impact on the strategy and conduct of an office-seeker's political campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to confer standing.\" Id. at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues, and the district court agreed, that his case is analogous: given Nader's choice not to accept corporate contributions, the FEC's regulations allowing corporate sponsorship of the debates effectively bar him from participating even if he qualifies for an invitation. He is thus put at a potential disadvantage in the event that he is invited and forced by his principles to decline the invitation; and he suffers a consequent present harm, in that he has been forced to structure his campaign to offset this potential disadvantage -- e.g., by spending more on advertising than he would if there remained a chance that he could appear in the debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the question is close, we find that Nader does have standing under Vote Choice. Nader has been and continues to be a significant candidate in the 2000 presidential race. At the time he brought this suit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> it was a genuinely open question whether he would be invited to the debates: Nader brought suit in June 2000; the CPD's first determination of which candidates would be invited to the debates was scheduled for Labor Day; within that time, it was certainly possible that Nader would be able to meet the CPD's eligibility threshold of a fifteen-percent showing of support in the national polls. Nader thus reasonably claims that, at the time he brought suit, corporate sponsorship of the debates loomed as a potential stumbling block in the path of his campaign, which forced him to make significant adjustments to his campaign strategy and use of funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> \"[W]e see nothing 'improbable' about the proposition,\" and we do not think it proper to second-guess a candidate's reasonable assessment of his own campaign. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 120 S.Ct. 693, 706 (2000) (finding standing to turn on the reasonableness of plaintiffs' fear that defendant's conduct would interfere with their activity). We similarly granted credence in Vote Choice to plaintiff Leonard's claim that she had to adjust her campaign to account for the possibility of facing a publicly funded opponent, even though in the end that possibility did not materialize. Vote Choice, 4 F.3d at 37; see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 814 F. Supp 195, 204 (D.R.I. 1993). To probe any further into these situations would require the clairvoyance of campaign consultants or political pundits -- guises that members of the apolitical branch should be especially hesitant to assume.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC attempts to distinguish Vote Choice from this case on the grounds that the plaintiff in Vote Choice was directly subject to the law she challenged: the law specifically required all candidates to choose whether to accept public funding. By contrast, the FEC regulations in question here regulate not candidates, but rather debate staging organizations, such as the CPD, and their corporate donors. Thus, the FEC argues, the regulations could not possibly have put Nader to a \"coerced choice,\" as was at issue in Vote Choice, see 4 F.3d at 37, simply because the regulations do not apply to Nader at all. In short, the argument goes, the plaintiff's choice in Vote Choice was coerced by law, while Nader's choice is wholly self-imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC's formalistic distinction, however, does not withstand scrutiny. The FEC regulations Nader challenges allow the CPD to accept corporate funds; the CPD's acceptance of corporate funds in turn presents Nader with a choice of whether to participate in corporate-sponsored debates. Thus, but for the regulations, Nader would not be coerced to make the choice. Granted, the coercion wrought by the regulations is indirect, but that makes no difference; the choice is still fairly traceable to the regulations. Cf. Fulani v. League of Women Voters, 882 F.2d 621, 628 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding candidate's exclusion from debates traceable to government's refusal to revoke League's tax-exempt status, where \"[b]ut for the government's refusal . . . the League, as a practical matter, would have been unable to sponsor [the debates]\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, this is not a case like Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), where the agency is alleged to have unlawfully regulated a third party, and the plaintiff's standing depends on an unpredictable question of whether the third party will use its discretion under the regulation so as to harm the plaintiff. See id. at 562. In this case, whether the CPD will choose to accept corporate funds to help stage the 2000 presidential debates is not unpredictable; the CPD had already chosen to do so by the time Nader brought suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the FEC's analysis of Vote Choice, as the FEC itself suggested at oral argument, leads to the result that no candidate could ever challenge the FEC regulations in question here, regardless of how likely he or she was to be invited to debate. If the FEC is right that only those directly governed by the regulations can challenge them, then only debate staging organizations such as the CPD or their corporate donors could ever bring challenge. But these parties are beneficiaries of the regulations, and the regulations are permissive with respect to them. Hence, these parties are unlikely ever to have any incentive -- or, likewise, standing -- to seek to invalidate the regulations insofar as they permit corporate sponsorship of the debates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In this respect, then, the regulations might effectively be immune from judicial review. We see no reason to read Vote Choice to imply this result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the FEC's suggestion in its brief that Nader's choice is self-imposed, that it \"only exists because he perceives a dilemma, not because it appears anywhere in the regulations.\" Such a view would raise too high a bar for standing; clearly, one who challenges a governmental action may not be denied standing merely because his challenge in a sense stems from his own choosing. For example, if instead of involving corporate sponsorship, this case instead involved regulations allowing the CPD to impose speech restrictions on debate participants -- e.g., a requirement that the participants say a word of gratitude to the CPD's underwriters -- there would hardly be question that the debate participants would have standing to challenge such regulations, even though their objection might stem purely from a choice of conscience. Cf., e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991) (no standing question raised where doctors challenged regulations conditioning receipt of funds on compliance with speech restrictions); Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988) (self-censorship is harm sufficient for standing).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the FEC regulations Nader challenges have caused him sufficient injury for the purposes of standing. By allowing corporate sponsorship of the debates, the regulations threatened to force Nader to decline an invitation to participate in the debates, and that threat affected the conduct of his campaign. In light of the FECA's concern with ensuring that corporate funds do not undermine the fairness of federal elections, we find that Nader has claimed sufficient unfairness to his campaign to establish standing. \"To hold otherwise would tend to diminish the import of depriving a serious candidate for public office of the opportunity to compete equally for votes in an election,\" and would make it too difficult for candidates in Nader's position to challenge FEC regulations thought to impinge on that opportunity. See Fulani v. League of Women Voters Education Fund, 882 F.2d 621, 626 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains, however, a question of redressibility. At the time he brought suit, Nader could have been provided with relief that would have redressed his injury -- namely, a judgment in effect preventing corporate sponsorship of the debates in time to preserve the possibility of his participation. Now that the 2000 presidential debates are over, such relief is no longer available. However, this subsequent redressibility problem is one of mootness, not standing. See Advanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (noting that \"[s]tanding is assessed at the time the action commences,\" whereas mootness concerns whether \"a judiciable controversy existed but no longer remains\") (citing Friends of the Earth, 120 S.Ct. at 709) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the FEC conceded at oral argument that Nader's case is not moot. As other courts have held in similar cases, this sort of case qualifies for the exception to mootness for disputes \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\": corporate sponsorship of the debates is sure to be challenged again in future elections, yet, as here, the short length of the campaign season will make a timely resolution difficult. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8 (1974); Fulani v. League of Women Voters Educ. Fund, 882 F.2d 621, 628 (2d Cir. 1989); Johnson v. F.C.C., 829 F.2d 157, 159 n.7 (D.C.Cir. 1987). Hence, Nader's case is not moot, and he has satisfied the requirements for standing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Whether Voters Have Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The voter plaintiffs assert two grounds for standing. First, they argue that, as voters, they are harmed directly by the corruption of the political process allegedly caused by corporate sponsorship of the debates. Second, the voters who have decided to vote for Nader argue that, as supporters of Nader, they suffer derivatively from any injury the FEC regulations cause him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first argument, the harm done to the general public by corruption of the political process is not a sufficiently concrete, personalized injury to establish standing. Plaintiffs cite to FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), for the proposition that any voting-related injury is per se sufficiently concrete and personalized to establish standing. But Akins does not open the door so wide. Akins held that individual voters had standing to challenge the FEC's decision not to subject the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to certain disclosure requirements. The Court's decision did not rest merely on the fact that the voters there had suffered a \"voting-related\" injury. Rather, what was important was that the voters had been denied access to information that would have helped them evaluate candidates for office, when such information was specifically required by statute to be disclosed to the public. See Akins, 524 U.S. at 21; see also Common Cause v. FEC, 108 F.3d 413, 418 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (limiting \"informational standing\" under FECA to cases in which plaintiffs are denied information that is \"both useful in voting and required by Congress to be disclosed\"). In contrast, the plaintiffs here allege no such particularized burden they will suffer as a result of corporate sponsorship of the debates. Their concern for corruption of the political process \"is not only widely shared, but is also of an abstract and indefinite nature,\" comparable to \"the common concern for obedience to law.\" Akins, 524 U.S. at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the argument of Nader's supporters that they suffer derivatively from his injury, again, such argument sweeps too broadly. Regardless of Nader's injury, his supporters remain fully able to advocate for his candidacy and to cast their votes in his favor. Compare Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 94 (1976) (\"[T]he denial of public financing to some Presidential candidates is not restrictive of voters' rights . . . .\"), and Gottlieb v. FEC, 143 F.3d 618, 622 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\"The extra infusion of funds into the Clinton campaign did not impede the voters from supporting the candidate of their choice.\"), with Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 143-44 (1972) (holding that expensive filing fees keeping candidates from appearing on ballot harmed voters by preventing them from voting for the candidate of their choice). The only derivative harm Nader's supporters can possibly assert is that their preferred candidate now has less chance of being elected. Such \"harm,\" however, is hardly a restriction on voters' rights and by itself is not a legally cognizable injury sufficient for standing. See Gottlieb, 143 F.3d at 622 (holding that voters cannot establish standing solely on basis that their candidates have been unfairly treated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Nader has standing, we turn to his challenge to the validity of the debate regulations. The issue before us is a narrow one: whether the FEC debate regulations allowing corporate funding of certain debate staging organizations, 11 C.F.R.  110.13 and 114.4(f), violate, on their face, the FECA. The exclusion of Nader from the 2000 Presidential election debates is not at issue, nor is any constitutional claim asserted. We review de novo the district court's decision to uphold the regulations, a question of law. Strickland v. Commissioner, Maine Dept. of Human Services, 96 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether this case requires deference to the administrative agency's determination under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Chevron governs the judicial review of agency regulations to ensure that they comply with the applicable statutory scheme, and entails a two step analysis. If Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue and the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter. Id. at 842. Agency regulations in accord with that unambiguously expressed intent are upheld; those that contravene that intent are invalid. But if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the precise issue, then the question becomes whether the agency's regulations are based on a permissible construction of the statute. Id. at 843. In assessing the agency's construction of an ambiguous provision, courts, under this second step of Chevron, must defer to reasonable agency interpretation and implementation of the provision. United States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 383 (1999). The FEC is the type of agency which is entitled to such deference where congressional intent is ambiguous. FEC v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several key statutory provisions of the FECA are at issue. The FECA prohibits corporations from making any contribution or expenditure \"in connection with\" any federal election, 2 U.S.C.  441b(a), and defines \"contribution or expenditure\" to include \"any direct or indirect payment . . . or gift . . . to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization,\" id.  441b(b)(2). This general prohibition is subject to three exceptions, which permit corporate funds to be used (1) for internal corporate communications; (2) for nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns by a corporation directed to its stockholders and executive and administrative personnel and their families; and (3) for the establishment of a separate segregated fund used for political purposes. Id.  441b(b)(2)(A)-(C). In addition, the FECA's general definition section also addresses the term \"expenditure,\" defining it to include any payments made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\" id.  431(9)(A)(i), but not to include \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote,\" id.  431(9)(B)(ii).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implementing these statutory provisions, in 1980 the FEC promulgated debate regulations to govern contributions and expenditures made in sponsorship of candidate debates; in 1996, it revised them. Under the FEC's regulatory scheme, corporate contributions and expenditures may be made to defray the costs of conducting candidate debates where those debates are held by nonpartisan organizations so long as those organizations and the structure of the debate meet certain criteria. Two interrelated regulations produce this result. First, Section 110.13 delineates the requirements for debate staging organizations, debate structure, and criteria for candidate selection necessary to qualify for exemption from the contribution and expenditure restrictions. Debate staging organizations must either be nonprofit organizations that \"do not endorse, support, or oppose political candidates or political parties,\" or broadcasters that are \"not owned or controlled by a political party, political committee or candidate.\" 11 C.F.R.  110.13(a). The candidate debate must include at least two candidates and not be structured \"to promote or advance one candidate over another.\" 11 C.F.R.  110.13(b). Finally, debate staging organizations are required to use \"pre-established objective criteria to determine which candidates may participate in the debate\" and may not rely solely on nomination by particular parties. 11 C.F.R.  110.13(c). Second, Section 114.4(f) allows nonprofit debate staging organizations to accept funds donated by corporations to defray costs incurred in staging candidate debates and, on the flipside, expressly permits corporations to make such donations to qualifed debate staging organizations. 11 C.F.R.  114.4(f). Complementing these sections, the FEC regulations defining the terms \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as covered by the Act expressly exempt the funds used in staging a qualified candidate debate from the \"contributions\" and \"expenditures\" regulated by the FECA. See 11 C.F.R.  100.7(b)(21) (not included in \"contributions\"); id.  100.8(b)(23) (not included in \"expenditures\"). In accordance with the requirements of the FECA, 2 U.S.C.  438(d), the proposed regulations, along with the FEC's analysis, were sent to Congress and did not become final until Congress had opportunity to express disapproval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues that these debate regulations permit corporate contributions to flow to candidates in violation of the general prohibition of Section 441b(a) and that such contributions do not fall within the limited exceptions of Section 441b(b)(2)(A)-(C); further, he rejects the FEC's contention that the regulations permissibly construe ambiguities in what corporate disbursements qualify as \"contributions and expenditures\" under the Act. Nader argues the FEC's position must be rejected for several reasons. First, Nader contends that the general prohibition against corporate contributions and expenditures in Section 441b(a) stands alone and is not at all ambiguous. This prohibition, he says, reflects a clear congressional intent that corporate monies not go toward political activities unless they fall into one of the three narrowly drawn exceptions in Section 441b(b), none of which is applicable to candidate debates. Hence this provision reveals an unambiguous congressional intent that corporate monies not be used to sponsor candidate debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Nader argues that when Congress enacted the more specific rules contained in Section 441b governing the use of general treasury corporate funds in 1976, it narrowed the exemption from the prohibition on corporate contributions so as to permit only those \"nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns\" that are aimed at the corporations' own \"shareholders and executive or administrative personnel and their families.\" 2 U.S.C.  441b(b)(2). While Nader acknowledges that Section 431(9)(B)(ii) contains a more general exception permitting funding for \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote,\" that \"permission\" comes in the form of an exemption to the FECA's general definition of \"expenditure.\" Nader maintains that the enactment of a specific provision dealing with corporate contributions and expenditures and defining those terms for that purpose renders the general definition inapposite, citing the principle that a specific statute governs over a more general one. See HCSC-Laundry v. United States, 450 U.S. 1, 6 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific exception in Section 441b(b)(2) for \"nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns by a corporation aimed at its stockholders and executive and administrative personnel and their families,\" Nader argues, clearly does not exempt funding of candidate debates. Moreover, even if read in tandem with the general exemption excluding expenditures for \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote\" in Section 431(9)(B)(ii), Nader maintains that the statute still contains no ambiguity regarding the legality of expenditures for candidate debates because a debate cannot reasonably be described as such an activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Since sponsoring candidate debates does not fall into these exceptions to the prohibition of Section 441b(a), he contends that the clear intent of Congress as expressed in that prohibition must govern. Thus, Nader argues, there is no ambiguity in the statute that would permit the FEC, under the Chevron doctrine, to make policy interstitially. While disavowing any need to look at legislative history to clarify what Congress meant, Nader says that nothing in that history supports the FEC's reading. And so, Nader concludes, there is no gap in the statute on the precise question of whether corporate funds can be used to finance electoral debates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Nader argues that even under the second stage of Chevron these regulations should fail. Nader maintains that the regulations cannot be a permissible construction of the statute because they are inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Nader alleges that the FECA seeks to restrict the influence of corporate monies in political elections in order to protect the integrity of the electoral system. Since the debate regulations instead promote corporate involvement in political activity, they are not a reasonable interpretation of the FECA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Nader responds to the common sense observation that these debate regulations have been in place for more than twenty years, that they have governed many well-publicized debates, and that Congress never once intimated that the FEC rules were contrary to its intention. Nader says that this \"silence\" proves nothing: a busy Congress cannot be expected to police every agency action; indeed, in 5 U.S.C.  801(g) Congress forbade the courts to infer any such intent from its silence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC responds that Nader's emphasis on the narrowness of the exceptions in Section 441b(b)(2)(B) and Section 431(9)(B)(ii) is misplaced: the debate regulations do not interpret the scope of these exceptions, the FEC contends; rather, they interpret what types of corporate disbursements count as \"contributions and expenditures\" in the first instance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The FEC relies on asserted ambiguities in Section 441b as well as Section 431(9) to justify its policymaking activity with regard to candidate debates. The general language of those sections, the FEC contends, says nothing indicating any congressional consideration, much less a clear congressional intent, about whether (or in what circumstances) sponsorship of candidate debates should be treated as a \"contribution\" or \"expenditure,\" which the FEC claims is the \"precise question at issue\" in this case. Since the general provisions leave this question open, the FEC argues that the FECA effectively delegates that question to the policymaking authority of the agency. Moreover, the FEC suggests that its construction of the statute is reasonable in three additional respects: first, the narrow construction of the prohibitory language of the Act serves to protect First Amendment interests otherwise potentially implicated by it; second, the construction of the Act accords with Congressional intent as expressed in the legislative record; and third, the debate regulations serve purposes akin to those served by the existing exceptions to the statute's prohibitions. Thus the FEC insists that the debate regulations reflect a reasonable construction of the FECA that is due Chevron deference. Finally, the FEC also points to the fact that the debate regulations were submitted to Congress, which did not disapprove them, and have been in force quite publicly for twenty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis under Chevron begins with the question of whether the FECA statutory scheme reveals a clear congressional intent to ban the particular activity of corporate sponsorship of the debates as permitted under the regulations. We conclude that several aspects of the statutory scheme, rather than indicating a clear congressional intent on the issue, in fact foster ambiguity. As a primary matter, it is not clear on the face of the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" that corporate disbursements to nonpartisan debate staging organizations even fall within the scope of the Act's coverage in the first instance. Section 441b bars corporate contributions or expenditures \"in connection with any election,\" 2 U.S.C. 441b(a), including direct or indirect corporate payments or gifts \"to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization.\" Id.  441b(b)(2). Section 431(9) defines \"expenditures\" as any payments made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" Id.  431(9)(a)(i). In neither case is it clear that corporate disbursements to nonprofit debate staging organizations fall within the ambit of the respective definitions, as such payments are not clearly \"in connection with any election,\" nor are they clearly \"indirect payments . . . to any candidate,\" nor are they clearly made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" These imprecise definitional phrases display the ambiguity present in the statutory scheme. The Supreme Court itself has observed (in a different context) that the phrase, \"for the purpose of influencing any election,\" is ambiguous. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 79-80 (1976). In light of this uncertainty, the statute taken as a whole does not express a clear congressional intent with respect to the precise question at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other language in the FECA reinforces our finding that the statute is ambiguous. First, that Congress intended to delegate broad policymaking discretion to the FEC is confirmed by the statutory charge that the FEC shall \"formulate policy under the Act.\" 2 U.S.C.  437. Congress also lodged a degree of flexibility in the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" in particular where it defined them to \"include\" certain uses and phrased the exceptions to their general prohibitions as enumerating activities that the terms \"shall not include.\" See id.  441b. The Supreme Court has recognized an element of flexibility in the term \"include,\" as it indicates that \"activities not specifically enumerated in that section may nonetheless be encompassed by it.\" FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens For Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 246 (1986). Thus the definitions are not only of uncertain scope but also employ language suggestive of flexibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language and structure of the exceptions to the prohibitions also suggest ambiguity. The statutory phrase \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or register to vote\" at Section 431(9)(B)(ii) gives the Commission some leeway to interpret the term \"activity\" and to decide which activities so \"encourage\" people. In addition, the statutory structure gives rise to a second question: how the specific corporate funding prohibition and exception in Section 441b(b)(2)(B) are meant to operate with the more general \"encouraging activity\" provision of Section 431(9)(B)(ii). It is unclear whether the specific provision trumps the earlier \"encouraging activity\" exception by limiting it and removing any leeway in the Commission, as Nader contends, or whether Congress intended the two sections to work together and to provide some flexibility to the Commission. In light of these questions, we find the statute is not clear on its face and rules of statutory interpretation do not compel any one particular answer to the precise question at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resort to the legislative history, even if appropriate, fails to dispel this uncertainty and provide a clear Congressional intent. We explain, beginning with the amendments Congress has made to the Act in response to judicial developments. Although the language of the statute is seemingly broad, that language has often been reviewed by courts in light of constitutional constraints, that is, the First Amendment rights of those regulated.

As the FEC notes, the statute has changed over time so as to mesh more smoothly with subsequent court decisions and other related statutes. The exceptions to the prohibition now set out in Section 441b(b) were added to the predecessor of Section 441b in 1971 largely to codify earlier court decisions. See, e.g., Pipefitters Local Union No. 562 v. United States, 407 U.S. 385, 409-13, 421-27 (1972) (exception allowing segregated political fund codified prior case law). Congress then refined the exceptions in 1974, excepting \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote.\" See 2 U.S.C.  431(9)(B)(ii). Finally, in 1976, Congress incorporated the prohibitions on corporate expenditures and the concomitant exceptions previously codified at 18 U.S.C.  610 into the FECA with the enactment of Section 441b, which specifically excepted from the prohibition on corporate expenditures the internal registration and get-out-the-vote activities described earlier. See 2 U.S.C.  441b(b)(2)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC says that Congress illuminated how these provisions were meant to work together in the legislative history:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conferees' intent with regard to the inter-relationship between sections [2 U.S.C. 431(9)(B)(ii)] and [2 U.S.C. 441b(b)(2)(B)] which permit such activities as assisting eligible voters to register and get to the polls, so long as these services are made available without regard to the voter's political preference, is the following: these provisions should be read together to permit corporations both to take part in nonpartisan registration and get out the vote activities that are not restricted to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, if such activities are jointly sponsored by the corporation and an organization that does not endorse candidates and are conducted by that organization; and to permit corporations, on their own, to engage in such activities restricted to executive or administrative personnel and stockholders and their families. The same rule, of course, applies to labor organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-1057, at 63-64 (1976). Indeed, a key phrase in this legislative history indicates that Congress intended to permit corporate funding of \"such activities as\" assisting eligible voters. Once again, rather than collapsing ambiguity, this legislative history confirms it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although our conclusion that the debate regulations coincide with congressional intent would be the same in any event, we note that this view is consistent with Congress's apparent acquiescence in the regulations under the \"report and wait\" requirements of the FECA. Nader's reliance on the admonition against inferring any intent from Congress's silence in 5 U.S.C.  801(g) is inappropriate, as that provision is limited to proposed rules submitted to Congress under the disapproval mechanism established in 5 U.S.C.  801 and 802, and hence does not apply to regulations promulgated by the FEC under 2 U.S.C.  438(d) long before the enactment of 5 U.S.C.  801 in 1996. Moreover, this is not a situation of complete congressional inaction; the failure to disapprove of the current debate regulations takes on additional significance in light of Congress's rejection of the FEC's initial proposal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus we conclude that the FECA expresses no clear congressional intent on the precise issue in this case -- the corporate sponsorship of qualified debate staging organizations to defray the costs of conducting candidate debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we have determined that the FECA does not answer the precise question at issue, the question thus becomes whether the FEC's efforts in the debate regulations to permit such corporate sponsorship, and to define the proper scope of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as used by the Act, reflect a permissible construction of the statute. Under Chevron, absent an unambiguously expressed congressional intent on the precise issue, the courts must defer to the Commission's construction if it is reasonable and not inconsistent with the statute. Duckworth v. Pratt &amp; Whitney, Inc., 152 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1998). The debate regulations at issue pass that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the debate regulations reflect a reasonable understanding of the purposes of the FECA, and in fact parallel the purposes of its express exceptions. In 1979, the Commission addressed the funding and sponsorship of candidate debates in a rulemaking. The Commission decided that since the legislative policy behind the express exceptions was to permit corporations and unions to fund activity directed to the general public to encourage voter participation so long as the activity is conducted primarily by a nonpartisan organization, \"permitting corporations and labor organizations to donate funds to nonprofit nonpartisan organizations for [debate] staging is consistent with congressional intent and policy.\" FEC, Explanation and Justification, Funding and Sponsorship of Federal Candidate Debates, 44 Fed. Reg. 74,734, at 76,736 (1979); see also 44 Fed. Reg. 39,348, at 39,349. The Commission concluded that \"[t]he educational purposes\" of a debate staged by such nonpartisan organizations \"is similar to the purpose underlying nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.\" Id. at 39,348. \"Unlike single candidate appearances, nonpartisan debates are designed to educate and inform voters rather than to influence the nomination or election of a particular candidate. Hence, funds received and expended [by certain nonprofit organizations] to defray costs incurred in staging nonpartisan public debates are not considered contributions or expenditures under the Act.\" Id. Moreover, the FEC's debate regulations are in accord with congressional expectations as expressed in the legislative history discussed above. It is certainly within the purview of agency discretion to accord respect to congressional intent as reflected in the legislative record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the debate regulations are not inconsistent with the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" provided by Section 441b. As the prohibition contained in Section 441b did not specifically address corporate donations to nonpartisan tax exempt organizations but rather addressed payments \"to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization,\" the Commission reasonably determined that the prohibition need not apply to corporate disbursements to nonpartisan tax exempt organizations for the limited purpose of staging candidate debates. The Commission's determinations that the prohibition was especially concerned with \"active electioneering\" to promote a particular candidate and that sponsoring a nonpartisan debate was not \"active electioneering\" were similarly permissible. And the fact that the regulations allow corporate contributions to candidate debates in order to encourage voter participation in a fashion not expressly permitted by the statute does not itself invalidate the regulation. \"Agencies often are allowed through rulemaking to regulate beyond the express substantial directives of the statute, so long as the statute is not contradicted.\" Clifton, 114 F.3d at 1312. Hence, the Commission's views are not unreasonable, nor are they inconsistent with the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that Nader's interpretation of the FECA is also not unreasonable. He argues that the debates in fact promote the campaigns of those invited to participate. As amicus CPD says, the goal of its debates \"is to afford the members of the public an opportunity to sharpen their views, in a focused debate format, of those candidates from among whom the next President and Vice President will be selected.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Insofar as such debates have the primary effect of showcasing the candidacies of those selected to participate, Nader reasonably concludes that corporate funding of the debates might be viewed as contributing in effect to the candidacies of the participants. But Congress gave the choice as to the preferred reasonable interpretation to the FEC, not to Nader. The task for the reviewing court under Chevron is only to undertake the narrow inquiry into whether the agency's construction is sufficiently reasonable to be accepted by the reviewing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debate regulations at issue do not contravene the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress, as reflected in the FECA statutory scheme, but rather fall within the scope of the policymaking authority Congress delegated to the FEC under the Act. Moreover, the regulations reflect a permissible construction of the statute, indeed one that easily falls within the reasonable ambit of the statutory terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Nader's challenge and affirm the district court judgment dismissing his suit.

Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477 (10th Cir. 1995), holding that a plaintiff must not only have standing at the time he brings suit, but must retain it throughout the litigation. The case has rightly been criticized for ignoring language in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), clearly indicating that standing is to be \"assessed under the facts existing when the complaint is filed.\" Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Babbitt, No. CV-99-1044-ST, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2269, at *9 (D. Or. Feb. 15, 2000) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 571, n.4). The problem with the approach taken in Powder River is that it conflates questions of standing with questions of mootness: while it is true that a plaintiff must have a personal interest at stake throughout the litigation of a case, such interest is to be assessed under the rubric of standing at the commencement of the case, and under the rubric of mootness thereafter. See, e.g., Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir.2000) (\"[S]tanding is based on the facts as they existed at the time the lawsuit was filed.\"); White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1236 (9th Cir.2000) (same); Advanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (same); see also Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., 484 U.S. 49, 69 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"Subject matter jurisdiction depends on the state of things at the time of the action brought; if it existed when the suit was brought, subsequent events cannot oust the court of jurisdiction.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \"The confusion is understandable, given [the Supreme Court's] repeated statements that the doctrine of mootness can be described as 'the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).'\" Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 120 S.Ct. 693, 708-09 (2000) (citations omitted). But questions of standing and questions of mootness are distinct, and it is important to treat them separately. See id. at 709-10.

Our holding is nowhere near so broad. Nader was not merely \"any political entrant\" in the presidential race. At the time he brought suit, he could have plausibly hoped to qualify for an invitation to the debates. Nor did he merely worry that \"someday\" corporate sponsorship of the debates would interfere with his campaign. At the time of filing, invitations to the debates were scheduled to be determined at a definite date, soon enough in the future to affect his present campaign plans.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Similarly flawed is the FEC's argument that Nader cannot claim standing on the basis that he has been put at a competitive disadvantage in the presidential race. The FEC cites a line of Second Circuit decisions in which competitive disadvantage in a political race has been recognized as a possible basis for standing, but only where the plaintiff has shown \"that he personally competes in the same arena with the party to whom the government has bestowed the assertedly illegal benefit.\" In re United States Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d 1020, 1029 (2d Cir. 1989), quoted in Fulani v. Bentsen, 35 F.3d 49, 54 (2d Cir. 1994); see also Gottlieb v. FEC, 143 F.3d 618, 620-21 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Fulani v. Brady, 935 F.2d 1324, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1991). The FEC argues that Nader cannot claim such standing, because he does not compete in the same arena with the CPD, which is the party to whom the FEC has bestowed the assertedly illegal benefit of access to corporate funding. Again, however, such argument unjustifiably ignores the consequences of the FEC's action: the corporate funds that the FEC has allowed the CPD to solicit in the end pay for free television exposure for the debate participants; and obviously Nader competes in the same arena with these other candidates.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The CPD announced on January 6, 2000 that Anheuser-Busch would serve as one of the national financial sponsors for its 2000 presidential debates, as well as the sole financial sponsor of the October 17 debate in St. Louis, Missouri.

But that is not what is wrong with the FEC's direct regulation theory. What is wrong with the FEC's theory is that it permits only those directly subject to the regulations to bring suit, when the very persons likely to be harmed by the regulations are not directly subject to them.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note also that Nader's choice is not wholly ideological; he objects to participating in corporate-sponsored debates not only because they offend his principles, but because, on his view, they are illegal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Nader's interest in this case is identical to that of his party (represented by plaintiffs Green Party USA and the Association of State Green Parties) and campaign organization (the Nader 2000 Primary Committee); together, they represent the Nader candidacy that has been injured by the FEC regulations as described in the preceding discussion.

Nationally televised debates serve predominantly as \"a critical campaign showpiece for participating candidates.\" Nader concedes that had Congress said that an exemption applies to corporate expenditures for activities \"such as\" voter registration, then the FEC would be in a stronger position. See U.S. v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 387 (1999).

See FEC Statement of Reasons, In the Matter of Commission on Presidential Debates (April 6, 1998) at 4.

The constitutional component of standing derived from Article III requires that \"a plaintiff . . . allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" Allen, 468 U.S. at 751. In other words, the plaintiff must show (1) \"actual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant's putatively illegal conduct,\" (2) \"that the injury may fairly be traced to the challenged action,\" and (3) \"that a favorable decision will redress the injury.\" Vote Choice Inc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1993). Although these concepts are admittedly \"not susceptible of precise definition,\" Allen, 468 U.S. at 751, our case law has provided a sufficient outline of the standing map to address this petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent and type of injury required for constitutional standing is not easily defined.

Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974)). As I read his claim, Nader asserts two distinct theories of injury. First, he claims an injury derived from the \"coercive choice\" potentially posed by the allegedly illegal debate regulations. According to Nader, if he is invited to participate in the debates, he will be forced into a Hobbesian choice: either compromise of his corporate watchdog platform or loss of an important avenue for communication. Second, Nader claims injury as a political competitor: opponents invited to the debate benefit directly from allegedly illegal corporate sponsorship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the majority approach, as I see it, is that the majority found standing here by collapsing these two very separate theories. If he had been invited to the debate, Nader may indeed have faced a choice between accepting corporate sponsorship and losing free national exposure. However, as he was not invited to the debate, he did not face this choice; he cannot be injured by any coercive effect it might have had, or by any strategic changes to his campaign such a choice might entail. Likewise, it is surely true that Nader was at a competitive disadvantage because his opponents participated in the debates. He may have had to alter his strategy to cope with the free air time that they receive. However, to the extent that Nader faces this problem, it is because he is a political competitor, not because he faces a coerced choice under the Vote Choice analysis; his unwillingness to participate in the debates if invited did not affect Nader's response to this free air time. And as I discuss below, his injury as a political competitor is not traceable to the challenged regulations because he cannot show that the debates likely would not occur without the corporate sponsorship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I began by addressing the \"coerced choice\" theory. Relying on Vote Choice, Nader claims that the allegedly impermissible regulation coercively impacted the strategy and conduct of his presidential campaign. In Vote Choice, Elizabeth Leonard, a Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate, challenged a set of state campaign finance laws that: (i) required candidates upon declaring their candidacy to make an irrevocable election whether to use public funds; (ii) forced candidates electing to use public funds to sign an irrevocable pledge to abide by various terms and conditions of the fund grant; and (iii) created significant differences in legally allowed contributions between those who accepted and those who did not accept public funding (a so-called \"contribution cap gap\"). Although Leonard had not accepted the public funding and never actually faced a publicly funded opponent, we found that she retained standing to challenge the public funding provisions. We reasoned that \"when declaring her candidacy, Leonard had to make an irrevocable commitment\" as to her use of public funding. Vote Choice, 4 F.3d at 36-37. As a result, she had to plan her campaign strategy based on the possibility that her opponent (perhaps an undeclared one) would make the opposite choice; \"the coerced choice between public and private financing colored her campaign strategy from the outset.\" Id. We concluded that \"such an impact on the strategy and conduct of an office-seeker's political campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to confer standing.

However, there is an important distinction between the two situations. Vote Choice did not grant Leonard standing simply because of the benefits given to her publicly funded opponents under Rhode Island campaign finance law. To do so would have premised standing on Leonard's injury as a political competitor; that is, it would have found injury due to the additional benefits accrued by her opponents. Such a theory may be viable here, and I discuss it below. Vote Choice, however, premised standing on the fact that Leonard's choice not to accept such benefits shaped her strategy throughout the race. In other words, because Rhode Island provided allegedly unlawful incentives to accept public funding, a candidate could challenge those incentives even if they did not ultimately rely on them. But in the present case, Nader was not coerced into making this choice - in fact, he has been saved from coercion by the lack of sufficient public support to meet the threshold set by the Commission on Public Debates (the \"CPD\"). Unlike Leonard, whose campaign strategy was altered by an irrevocable choice made at the start of her campaign, Nader never faced such a dilemma. If he had, I would have found standing under Vote Choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the majority finds potential coercion even when none actually exists. In my view, by creating a present harm from the possibility of a future one, they dangerously expand our standing jurisprudence. The majority begins with the theory that because Nader has chosen not to accept corporate contributions, he was barred from the debates at the time the CPD accepted corporate donations, whether he proved ultimately eligible or not. If the debates were not funded by corporations, however, Nader would have been able and willing to participate if he had been invited. This seems plausible to me. However, the majority continues, this \"threat\" of being forced to decline a debate invitation in the future \"had a palpable and immediate impact on [Nader's] campaign strategy and expenditures,\" namely that Nader spent \"more on advertising than he would [have] if there remained a chance that he could appear in the debate.\" I agree with the majority that it is not generally proper for this institution \"to second-guess a candidate's reasonable assessment of his own campaign.\" However, I am not willing to grant a petitioner seeking standing free reign to allege changes in strategy forced only by the possibility of future events. Much as our standing jurisprudence requires the injury to be \"distinct and palpable,\" Allen, 468 U.S. at 751, I believe that a strategic harm argued under Vote Choice must be more than a mere potentiality. And unlike the majority, I find something \"improbable\" about the proposition that a threatened choice three months in the future impacted Nader's strategy at the time of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me expand. In June of 2000, at the time he filed this complaint, Nader admittedly failed to meet the eligibility requirements set by the CPD in January of 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> Specifically, he had not reached the 15% popular opinion threshold, although some polls had him in the 6 % range. See Frank Newport, Gallup News Service, Poll Releases (October 23, 2000), available at http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr001023.asp. In June, Nader's potential strategies were thus either to attempt to reach the 15% threshold, so that he would be eligible for the free exposure of the debates, or not to attempt to reach the 15% threshold. However, given that he was running for President of the United States, the latter choice does not seem a viable one - whether or not he received a debate invitation. Moreover, Nader has never asserted that, because he would not accept a debate invitation under any circumstances, he resigned himself to a failed campaign that would never reach the 15% mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even ignoring the infirmities of this theory of strategic impact, I note that Nader has not alleged that his campaign strategy was so affected by the potential choice which he faced. His main brief merely asserts that \"Nader and his organizational supporters have been forced to adjust their campaign strategy to compensate for the benefits conferred upon Nader's competitors by the Debate Regulations\" (emphasis added). In Nader's reply brief, he explains the strategic impact of the regulations in slightly more detail: \"Nader has been forced to spend more of his campaign's money on advertising in order to overcome the free television time that candidates Bush and Gore have and will continue to receive as debate participants.\" In this regard, Nader is correct: the fact that his opponents will participate in the debates and that he will not (either because he is not invited or because he chooses not to) means he will have to spend additional advertising funds to match their free television time. However, Nader's phrasing indicates that the strategic impact of the debate regulations, in his mind, is only related to the receipt of illegal (according to him) money by his opponents. Nader says nothing about planning for the possibility of receiving free debate time; he has apparently assumed that he will not compete and formed his campaign strategy based on that assumption. This is very different from the strategic impact proposed by the majority, and it is also foreign to our analysis in Vote Choice. At base, Nader is claiming injury as a political competitor; the majority's attempt to dress it as a future choice with a present strategic impact is misguided and not supported by either appellant's brief or their approach at oral argument. Furthermore, unlike in Vote Choice, the district court here failed to make clear findings of strategy, simply noting that appellants had alleged a strategic harm. See Becker v. FEC, No. 00-11192-PBS, at 14 (D. Mass., September 1, 2000). Even if it is inappropriate for a court to evaluate the actual impact of a choice on a candidate's strategy, and even if a court should accept the candidate's assessment of the impact at face value with hardly any inquiry, we need not premise injury on a supposed strategic impact not even argued by the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, I find that theoretical injury caused by potential future choices is the type of injury the Supreme Court warned against in Lujan. In Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 1997), we noted specific hurdles for abstract harms such as this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The [Supreme] Court placed a special gloss on cases in which a party seeks exclusively injunctive or declaratory relief. In such purlieus, standing inheres only if the complainant can show that he has suffered (or has been threatened with) \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is . . . concrete and particularized,\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, together with \"a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a significant way,\" Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. In other words, the complainant must establish that the feared harm is \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. It bears noting that the imminence concept, while admittedly far reaching, is bounded by its Article III purpose: \"to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative.\" Id. at 564 n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not find that Nader has made a sufficient showing of a \"concrete and particularized\" injury; the unfocused \"threat\" of a coerced choice sometime hence is much like the overly speculative \"'some day' intentions\" that the Supreme Court found lacking in Lujan. Id. at 564.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem of abstractness and lack of imminence is further revealed by the opening the majority creates for future litigants. Because the majority analysis places its present harm in the possibility of a future choice, anyone that could face the future choice must have the same injury. No language in the majority necessarily restricts this to candidates with a significant chance of facing the future choice; presumably, the possibility of this choice affected Nader's strategy prior to June. It theoretically could have altered his decision even to enter the race. In expanding standing to Nader here, the majority grants standing to any political entrant to challenge any election regulation to which they might someday be subject.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader's second theory of standing is not based on the strategic underpinnings of his own campaign, but on the theory that the corporate contributions to the CPD impermissibly help his competitors, essentially providing Gore and Bush with inexpensive access to extensive media coverage. The theory that a political competitor incurs injury because of an impermissible benefit to his opponent is premised on a line of cases granting standing to economic competitors. See, e.g., Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n, 479 U.S. 308, 403 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have, however, been reluctant to adopt this \"political competitor\" theory of standing, not so much because the injury faced by a plaintiff is not a real one, but because that injury generally cannot be traced to the challenged regulation, nor is the injury usually redressable by invalidating the regulation. Three cases pursued by minor party candidate Lenora Fulani indicate the contours of this standing doctrine. In Fulani v. League of Women Voters Educ. Fund, 882 F.2d 621 (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit found that Fulani had standing to challenge the tax-exempt status of the League of Women Voters. Fulani claimed that the League's refusal to include her in debates deprived her of critical media exposure and competitive advantage, as well as the opportunity to communicate her political ideas to the electorate. The court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he loss of competitive advantage flowing from the League's exclusion of Fulani from the national debates constitutes sufficient \"injury\" for standing purposes, because such loss palpably impaired Fulani's ability to compete on an equal footing with other significant presidential candidates. To hold otherwise would tend to diminish the import of depriving a serious candidate for public office of the opportunity to compete equally for votes in an election, and would imply that such a candidate could never challenge the conduct of the offending agency or party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulani v. League, 882 F.2d at 626. The Second Circuit then found that the other prerequisites for standing were met, because removing the League's not-for-profit status would end the League's ability to sponsor debates, and probably would have meant the absence of any debates in the 1988 campaign season.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fulani v. Brady, 935 F.2d 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1991) and Fulani v. Bentsen, 35 F.3d 49 (2d Cir. 1994), both the Second and the D.C. Circuits cut back on this approach, in cases more nearly mirroring our own. In Fulani v. Brady, Fulani sought standing to challenge the tax-exempt status of the CPD based on its decision that she lacked a realistic chance of being elected President, and its concordant refusal to invite her to the 1988 presidential debates. The D.C. Circuit focused its inquiry on the fact that Fulani was challenging a tax exemption, and noted strong judicial precedent against the ability to challenge the tax treatment of a competitor. See id. at1327. In particular, Fulani could not meet the standing requirements of traceability and redressability: first, many factors beyond the tax-exempt status of the CPD were influential in excluding Fulani from the debates; second, revocation of the tax-exempt status of the CPD would not necessarily have any impact on the purportedly unfair provision of media coverage to the major party candidates. See id. at 1328-29. Although Nader is not challenging a tax exemption, his claim is once removed because it does not challenge the entity hosting the debate (the CPD) but that entity's source of funds. At best, a Nader victory here could require the CPD to find other sources of funds; it would not necessarily reduce his opponent's television exposure, nor would it likely cancel the debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fulani v. Bentsen, Fulani again challenged the tax status of the League. However, the Second Circuit, noting that the debate in question was co-sponsored by CNN, refused to find injury based on \"the alleged incremental advantage accorded participants in debates in which the League plays a sponsoring role.\" Id. at 52-53. In other words, the fact that Fulani's competitors might benefit from the accouterments of League sponsorship was insufficient to create standing. Similarly, the fact that Nader's competitors may gain incremental advantages through their association with corporate sponsors is an insufficient basis for standing, given that a decision by this Court will have little or no impact on the exposure they gain due to the debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Second Circuit has indicated that for a plaintiff to gain standing as a political competitor, he must \"personally compete in the same arena with the same party to whom the government has bestowed the assertedly illegal benefit.\" In re United States Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d 1020, 1029 (2d Cir. 1989). In this case, the benefit has perhaps been conferred upon the sponsoring corporations, who at the most are allowed to further their political viewpoint by sponsoring a two-person debate, and at least are given additional air-time for their beer and pretzels. Perhaps the benefit has been conferred upon CPD, the entity which receives the allegedly illegal contributions. Nader would argue that Gore and Bush receive the unlawful benefit, and that as their competitor he has standing. However, Fulani v. Bentsen explicitly refused to extend the competitive standing rule to encompass this removed level of competition. Id. at 54 (\"We decline to extend the rule of Catholic Conference to encompass not only a plaintiff's competitors in a defined arena, but also any entity that provides a tangential benefit to those competitors.\"). Nader does compete with Bush and Gore, who may or may not have received tangential benefits from corporate sponsorship of the debates; however, I fear that expanding competitor standing to this extent gives plaintiffs the ability to challenge a host of regulations that, while undoubtedly having incidental beneficial effects on their competitors, are not traceable to a concrete, particularized harm. See Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d at 1028; see also Gottlieb v. FEC, 143 F.3d 618, 621 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (AmeriPAC could not challenge matching funds received by the Clinton campaign, because it was never in a position to receive such matching funds itself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority rues the fact that this analysis \"leads to the result that no candidate could ever challenge the FEC regulations in question here, regardless of how likely he or she was to be invited to the debate.\" First, I dispute this premise. Although no candidate may be able to challenge the regulations under a political competitor theory of standing, it is certainly possible that a candidate would have standing under the Vote Choice theory, if he or she actually faced a coerced choice. If Nader had reached the 15% mark, been invited to debate, and then refused to do so, I would be tempted to find standing here. Al Gore or George W. Bush could potentially have challenged the regulations as well. Furthermore, under the competitor theory, a rival debate organization or a potential non-corporate sponsor that could not afford the CPD's sponsorship prices might have successfully defended their standing as an economic competitor. In any event, even in the majority's refusal to read Vote Choice as implying that \"the regulations might effectively be immune from judicial review,\" the majority admits that the fact that the plaintiff might be the best person to have standing does not in itself give them standing. See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 489 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not doubt \"the powerful beneficial effect that mass media exposure can have today on the candidacy of a significant aspirant seeking national political office.\" Fulani v. League, 882 F.2d at 626. But this effect alone is insufficient to confer standing on such an aspirant simply because his claim is related to this mass media exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority gives short shrift to the question of mootness, stating conclusively that \"this sort of case qualifies for the exception to mootness for disputes 'capable of repetition, yet evading review.'\" I have no quarrel with the claim that this case is capable of repetition: under the majority's theory of standing, in fact, it is all too capable of repetition as any candidate or potential candidate could claim that their strategy is affected by the potential that they will be subject to a choice down the campaign trail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has indicated that election cases are particularly privy to this mootness exception. See Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 737 n.8; Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 756 n.5 (1973); Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 333 n.2 (1972); Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 816 (1969). However, all of these cases involved burdens placed on candidates or voters in order for them to participate in the election process, an inherently time-sensitive issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> For example, in Storer, petitioners challenged ballot access and nomination procedures necessarily occurring between the primary and the general election. See id. at 726-28; see also Rockefeller, 410 U.S. at 752-56 (similar issue). Dunn involved a challenge to state residency requirements which a would-be voter might not be able to challenge until just before the election, and which would without the exception become moot immediately after the election. See id. at 333-34. In Fulani v. League, Fulani's standing arose only at the time she was not invited to the debates, which meant that not enough time remained to litigate prior to the debates being held. See id. at 628. It is ironic that the very rationale which the majority used to grant Nader standing should now (I believe) lead them to find mootness. Under the majority's new standing jurisprudence, Nader could have brought his suit at any time after announcing his candidacy and possibly before doing so. A future petitioner who faces this same strategic problem will have ample time to sue in a manner so that we can redress his injury if appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the procedural history of this case indicates that future cases in which standing arises will not necessarily evade our review. Nader's complaint was filed on June 29, 2000. However, oral argument was not until six weeks later, on August 14, 2000. The argument was delayed by both the recusal of the original assigned judge and by at least one unopposed motion to extend time (made by the FEC). Although the district court issued its Memorandum and Order relatively quickly, on September 1, 2000, two more weeks passed until a final judgment was entered on September 18, 2000. This Court granted expedited review and oral arguments were heard on October 5, 2000. Although we have not issued our opinion until now, we certainly could have done so with more alacrity if it had proved necessary. Given the procedural history of this case, it can hardly be said that an Article III case or controversy on the issues raised would not be capable of full litigation and appellate review in a sufficient time to prevent mootness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case should never have reached the merits of the challenge to the FEC regulation. Nader lacked standing, either because his injury was hypothetical, or because his injury, although potentially real, was not traceable to the challenged regulations and not redressable by the invalidation of the challenged regulations. Moreover, by the time the litigation reached this court, Nader's harm had become moot. Although I agree with the majority that this appeal should be dismissed, I would not have reached the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because I find that Nader lacks the constitutional requirements for standing, I have not addressed the issue of prudential standing. However, a plaintiff generally has prudential standing under  10(a) of the APA when his interest is \"arguably\" within the \"zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statue in question.\" National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 489 (1998) (quoting Assoc. of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., 397 U.S. 150, 153). Given that this section of the FECA is designed to prevent corruption in campaign finance, see, e.g., FEC v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 209 (1982), and that Nader challenges it not based on corruption per se, but because it provides additional advantages to his competitors, his injury at first blush lies outside the statutory zone of protection. The fact that Nader personally is concerned with corruption in politics is particularly irrelevant to the standing question. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 573-74 (1992) (\"[A] citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws . . . does not state an Article III case or controversy.\"); United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"A mere interest in an event--no matter how passionate or sincere the interest and no matter how charged with public import the event--will not substitute for an actual injury.\").</p>\n        <p>Furthermore, to the extent the district court viewed the prudential analysis as considerations \"weighing\" in Nader's favor, the court made an error of law. If the plaintiff fails to meet the constitutional standing guidelines, no assessment of his personal concern can create an Article III case or controversy. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (three elements are the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Throughout, the majority examines Nader's situation in June, when this lawsuit was filed, under the assumption that standing is measured only at the time of filing. Although some cases hold that standing is only measured at that time, other cases point in the opposite direction, i.e., that a petitioner must retain standing throughout the litigation. See, e.g., Powder River Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, 54 F.3d 1477, 1485 (10th Cir. 1995). Such a conclusion would seriously complicate the majority's approach; far before oral argument it was quite clear that Nader would not receive an invitation to the debate, and thus his campaign strategy was determined without any influence of a potential choice.</p>\n        <p>Although the majority suggests that Powder River no longer provides any authority because of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 120 S. Ct. 693 (2000), I note that although the Court described standing as \"[t]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation,\" id. at 709, it also did \"not license courts to retain jurisdiction over cases in which one or both parties plainly lacks a continuing interest,\" id. at 710. Friends of the Earth thus distinguished standing from mootness, but primarily to indicate that because the mootness analysis occurs at the end of litigation, there are important differences between the two doctrines. See id. My point here, which is supported by Powder River and not directly contradicted by Friends of the Earth, is that when standing disappears in the early stages of litigation, we should perhaps dismiss for lack of standing even if it may have existed at the time of the complaint.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> These eligibility requirements were: (i) constitutional eligibility; (ii) appearance on a sufficient number of state ballots to achieve an Electoral College majority; and (iii) a level of support exceeding 15% according to major national polls. See Joint Appendix 174-76.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the majority contends that its holding is \"nowhere near so broad\" as I have suggested, I am unconvinced. Their basic point is that potential choices in the future can alter strategy today, and that forced changes in strategy today can meet the injury requirement for standing. I see no clear way of distinguishing Nader's \"plausible\" hope that he would be invited to the debates \"at a definite date\" in the future, from perhaps slightly less plausible (but still possible) hopes that may occur at a more distant time.</p>\n        <p>For example, Nader is running for President. Presumably, issues affecting the President of the United States inform his decision to run, which is undoubtedly part and parcel of his campaign strategy. Yet I doubt very much that the majority would grant Nader standing to challenge, say, the calculation of the presidential salary, simply because he may potentially be subject to its dictates. However, I believe that the majority's theory of standing would require them to do so if Nader asserted that such issues altered his current campaign strategy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In addition, these election exceptions to mootness involved First Amendment constitutional challenges, an area afforded special treatment by the Court's standing and mootness jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991) In contrast, Nader does not raise a First Amendment challenge of any sort, but simply challenges the legality of FEC regulations. The majority recognizes this distinction, but chooses to rely upon it to find an exception here.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Those regulations permit corporations to make contributions from their general treasuries to qualified nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations staging federal candidate debates. Suit was brought in anticipation of the debates to be staged by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) before the November 2000 Presidential Election. The district court dismissed Nader's claims on the merits and entered judgment on September 14, 2000. Nader appealed and this court granted expedited review. We hold, contrary to the FEC, that we have Article III jurisdiction and, contrary to Nader, that the plaintiffs' facial challenge to the debate regulations fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the 2000 presidential debates on the horizon, Nader, nominee of the Green Party, together with organizations supporting his campaign, as well as both supportive and uncommitted individual voters, brought this action on June 19, 2000 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs challenge as ultra vires two FEC regulations, 11 C.F.R.  110.13 and 114.4(f), which allow qualified nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations to accept corporate donations in staging presidential debates and allow corporations to make such donations. The plaintiffs claim that the regulations violate a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C.  431 et seq. , which makes it unlawful for a corporation to make any \"contribution or expenditure in connection with\" the presidential elections. Id.  441b(a). The Act defines \"contribution or expenditure\" to include \"any direct or indirect payment . . . or gift of money, or any services, or anything of value . . . to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization.\" Id.  441b(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 29, the plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin the FEC from implementing the challenged regulations and requested that the district court order the FEC to enforce the FECA's prohibition on corporate contributions so as to prevent corporate sponsorship of the presidential debates. The FEC moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that none of the plaintiffs could demonstrate Article III standing and that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After holding oral argument on both motions on August 14, 2000, the district court on September 1 denied the FEC's motion to dismiss, concluding that Nader and the Green Party had standing to challenge the FEC's debate regulations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that plaintiffs were entitled to review because the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act applied. The court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, however, finding no likelihood of success on the merits, on the basis that the regulations were based on a reasonable interpretation of the FECA entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, the district court entered final judgment in accordance with a stipulation of the parties, and plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited review in this court, which the FEC opposed. We granted plaintiffs' motion on September 26, 2000, ordered expedited briefing, and heard oral argument on October 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address the FEC's argument that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Like the district court, we think the plaintiffs are not required to petition the FEC before bringing a facial challenge to the agency's regulations. Because the FECA itself has no provisions governing judicial review of FEC regulations, the judicial review procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  701 et seq., apply to a facial challenge to the FECA's implementing regulations.

Standing doctrine involves \"a blend of constitutional requirements and prudential considerations.\" Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 471 (1982). The constitutional component of standing stems directly from Article III's limitation of federal judicial power to deciding justiciable cases or controversies. See Allen v. Wright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 751(1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> To establish standing, it does not suffice for plaintiffs to show merely that they bring a justiciable issue before the court; they must show further that they have a sufficiently personal stake in the issue. This means that plaintiffs must show: (1) that they have suffered or are in danger of suffering some injury that is both concrete and particularized to them; (2) that this injury is fairly traceable to the allegedly illegal conduct of the defendant; and (3) that a favorable decision will likely redress the injury. See Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 472; see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629116\"><a href=\"/opinion/629116/vote-choice-inc-v-joseph-distefano-etc-elizabeth-leonard-vote/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir. 1993). We first determine whether Nader has standing; we then turn to the voter plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Whether Nader Has Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues that the FEC regulations allowing corporate sponsorship of the presidential debates have injured him by making corporate contributions available to his opponents (in the form of free television exposure during the debates) when such contributions are not available to him. Consequently, Nader has been put at a competitive disadvantage in the presidential race, and as a result he has had to alter his campaign strategy and spend more on advertising in order to compensate for this disadvantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC's central counterargument is that the injuries Nader alleges are not fairly traceable to the FEC regulations he challenges. Nader's standing theory is misplaced, the FEC contends: while it might be true that Nader's exclusion from the debates puts him at a competitive disadvantage, Nader is not challenging his exclusion from the debates. As plaintiffs state in their brief: \"This is a lawsuit about the funding of presidential debates, not a challenge to the rules governing participation in debates.\" Moreover, Nader concedes that, even if FEC regulations did not allow corporate sponsorship of the debates, the debates would likely be held anyway, with funding coming from public sources or the media; and Nader makes no claim that in such event he would have a better chance of being invited to participate. Thus Nader has failed to show, the FEC concludes, that there is a causal nexus between corporate sponsorship of the debates and the injuries he alleges as his basis for standing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reply, Nader argues that there is such a causal nexus. At the time that he brought this suit, Nader still stood a chance of being invited to participate in the debates. Yet if he were invited, he says, he would be forced to decline the invitation due to his principled stand against accepting corporate contributions. The consequences of this Faustian dilemma, he argues, suffice for standing: not only did it create the potential injury of having to cede to his opponents the advantage of free television exposure, but it also forced him presently to conduct his campaign and make advertising expenditures on the assumption that no such exposure would be available to him. In this sense, corporate sponsorship threatened to exclude him from the debates and had a palpable and immediate impact on his campaign strategy and expenditures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his position, Nader cites Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629116\"><a href=\"/opinion/629116/vote-choice-inc-v-joseph-distefano-etc-elizabeth-leonard-vote/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir. 1993). In that case, Elizabeth Leonard, a Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate, challenged a state campaign finance law requiring all candidates, at the time they declared their candidacies, to choose whether to accept public funding for their campaigns. The law at issue attached certain benefits to the acceptance of public funding, such as free air time on community television and higher caps on campaign contributions. See id. at 29-30. Leonard chose to decline public funding and thereby to forego the accompanying benefits. As a result, this court held, she had standing. Given Leonard's choice not to accept public funding, the law put her at a potential disadvantage as to any publicly funded opponents she might face, forcing her to structure her campaign to anticipate and offset that disadvantage. See id. at 36-37. \"In our view,\" we held, \"such an impact on the strategy and conduct of an office-seeker's political campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to confer standing.\" Id. at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues, and the district court agreed, that his case is analogous: given Nader's choice not to accept corporate contributions, the FEC's regulations allowing corporate sponsorship of the debates effectively bar him from participating even if he qualifies for an invitation. He is thus put at a potential disadvantage in the event that he is invited and forced by his principles to decline the invitation; and he suffers a consequent present harm, in that he has been forced to structure his campaign to offset this potential disadvantage -- e.g., by spending more on advertising than he would if there remained a chance that he could appear in the debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the question is close, we find that Nader does have standing under Vote Choice. Nader has been and continues to be a significant candidate in the 2000 presidential race. At the time he brought this suit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> it was a genuinely open question whether he would be invited to the debates: Nader brought suit in June 2000; the CPD's first determination of which candidates would be invited to the debates was scheduled for Labor Day; within that time, it was certainly possible that Nader would be able to meet the CPD's eligibility threshold of a fifteen-percent showing of support in the national polls. Nader thus reasonably claims that, at the time he brought suit, corporate sponsorship of the debates loomed as a potential stumbling block in the path of his campaign, which forced him to make significant adjustments to his campaign strategy and use of funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> \"[W]e see nothing 'improbable' about the proposition,\" and we do not think it proper to second-guess a candidate's reasonable assessment of his own campaign. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 706 (2000) (finding standing to turn on the reasonableness of plaintiffs' fear that defendant's conduct would interfere with their activity). We similarly granted credence in Vote Choice to plaintiff Leonard's claim that she had to adjust her campaign to account for the possibility of facing a publicly funded opponent, even though in the end that possibility did not materialize. Vote Choice, 4 F.3d at 37; see also Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 814 F. Supp 195, 204 (D.R.I. 1993). To probe any further into these situations would require the clairvoyance of campaign consultants or political pundits -- guises that members of the apolitical branch should be especially hesitant to assume.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC attempts to distinguish Vote Choice from this case on the grounds that the plaintiff in Vote Choice was directly subject to the law she challenged: the law specifically required all candidates to choose whether to accept public funding. By contrast, the FEC regulations in question here regulate not candidates, but rather debate staging organizations, such as the CPD, and their corporate donors. Thus, the FEC argues, the regulations could not possibly have put Nader to a \"coerced choice,\" as was at issue in Vote Choice, see 4 F.3d at 37, simply because the regulations do not apply to Nader at all. In short, the argument goes, the plaintiff's choice in Vote Choice was coerced by law, while Nader's choice is wholly self-imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC's formalistic distinction, however, does not withstand scrutiny. The FEC regulations Nader challenges allow the CPD to accept corporate funds; the CPD's acceptance of corporate funds in turn presents Nader with a choice of whether to participate in corporate-sponsored debates. Thus, but for the regulations, Nader would not be coerced to make the choice. Granted, the coercion wrought by the regulations is indirect, but that makes no difference; the choice is still fairly traceable to the regulations. Cf. Fulani v. League of Women Voters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527787\"><a href=\"/opinion/527787/dr-lenora-b-fulani-lenora-b-fulanis-committee-for-fair-elections-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 628 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding candidate's exclusion from debates traceable to government's refusal to revoke League's tax-exempt status, where \"[b]ut for the government's refusal . . . the League, as a practical matter, would have been unable to sponsor [the debates]\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, this is not a case like Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span> (1992), where the agency is alleged to have unlawfully regulated a third party, and the plaintiff's standing depends on an unpredictable question of whether the third party will use its discretion under the regulation so as to harm the plaintiff. See id. at 562. In this case, whether the CPD will choose to accept corporate funds to help stage the 2000 presidential debates is not unpredictable; the CPD had already chosen to do so by the time Nader brought suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the FEC's analysis of Vote Choice, as the FEC itself suggested at oral argument, leads to the result that no candidate could ever challenge the FEC regulations in question here, regardless of how likely he or she was to be invited to debate. If the FEC is right that only those directly governed by the regulations can challenge them, then only debate staging organizations such as the CPD or their corporate donors could ever bring challenge. But these parties are beneficiaries of the regulations, and the regulations are permissive with respect to them. Hence, these parties are unlikely ever to have any incentive -- or, likewise, standing -- to seek to invalidate the regulations insofar as they permit corporate sponsorship of the debates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In this respect, then, the regulations might effectively be immune from judicial review. We see no reason to read Vote Choice to imply this result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the FEC's suggestion in its brief that Nader's choice is self-imposed, that it \"only exists because he perceives a dilemma, not because it appears anywhere in the regulations.\" Such a view would raise too high a bar for standing; clearly, one who challenges a governmental action may not be denied standing merely because his challenge in a sense stems from his own choosing. For example, if instead of involving corporate sponsorship, this case instead involved regulations allowing the CPD to impose speech restrictions on debate participants -- e.g., a requirement that the participants say a word of gratitude to the CPD's underwriters -- there would hardly be question that the debate participants would have standing to challenge such regulations, even though their objection might stem purely from a choice of conscience. Cf., e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span> (1991) (no standing question raised where doctors challenged regulations conditioning receipt of funds on compliance with speech restrictions); Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111985\"><a href=\"/opinion/111985/virginia-v-american-booksellers-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 393 (1988) (self-censorship is harm sufficient for standing).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the FEC regulations Nader challenges have caused him sufficient injury for the purposes of standing. By allowing corporate sponsorship of the debates, the regulations threatened to force Nader to decline an invitation to participate in the debates, and that threat affected the conduct of his campaign. In light of the FECA's concern with ensuring that corporate funds do not undermine the fairness of federal elections, we find that Nader has claimed sufficient unfairness to his campaign to establish standing. \"To hold otherwise would tend to diminish the import of depriving a serious candidate for public office of the opportunity to compete equally for votes in an election,\" and would make it too difficult for candidates in Nader's position to challenge FEC regulations thought to impinge on that opportunity. See Fulani v. League of Women Voters Education Fund, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527787\"><a href=\"/opinion/527787/dr-lenora-b-fulani-lenora-b-fulanis-committee-for-fair-elections-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 626 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains, however, a question of redressibility. At the time he brought suit, Nader could have been provided with relief that would have redressed his injury -- namely, a judgment in effect preventing corporate sponsorship of the debates in time to preserve the possibility of his participation. Now that the 2000 presidential debates are over, such relief is no longer available. However, this subsequent redressibility problem is one of mootness, not standing. See Advanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185152\"><a href=\"/opinion/185152/advn-mgmt-technol-v-faa/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span>, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (noting that \"[s]tanding is assessed at the time the action commences,\" whereas mootness concerns whether \"a judiciable controversy existed but no longer remains\") (citing Friends of the Earth, 120 S.Ct. at 709) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the FEC conceded at oral argument that Nader's case is not moot. As other courts have held in similar cases, this sort of case qualifies for the exception to mootness for disputes \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\": corporate sponsorship of the debates is sure to be challenged again in future elections, yet, as here, the short length of the campaign season will make a timely resolution difficult. See Storer v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108993\"><a href=\"/opinion/108993/storer-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 737 n.8 (1974); Fulani v.

Hence, Nader's case is not moot, and he has satisfied the requirements for standing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Whether Voters Have Standing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The voter plaintiffs assert two grounds for standing. First, they argue that, as voters, they are harmed directly by the corruption of the political process allegedly caused by corporate sponsorship of the debates. Second, the voters who have decided to vote for Nader argue that, as supporters of Nader, they suffer derivatively from any injury the FEC regulations cause him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first argument, the harm done to the general public by corruption of the political process is not a sufficiently concrete, personalized injury to establish standing. Plaintiffs cite to FEC v. Akins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span> (1998), for the proposition that any voting-related injury is per se sufficiently concrete and personalized to establish standing. But Akins does not open the door so wide. Akins held that individual voters had standing to challenge the FEC's decision not to subject the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to certain disclosure requirements. The Court's decision did not rest merely on the fact that the voters there had suffered a \"voting-related\" injury. Rather, what was important was that the voters had been denied access to information that would have helped them evaluate candidates for office, when such information was specifically required by statute to be disclosed to the public. See Akins, 524 U.S. at 21; see also Common Cause v. FEC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737398\"><a href=\"/opinion/737398/common-cause-v-federal-election-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 418 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (limiting \"informational standing\" under FECA to cases in which plaintiffs are denied information that is \"both useful in voting and required by Congress to be disclosed\"). In contrast, the plaintiffs here allege no such particularized burden they will suffer as a result of corporate sponsorship of the debates. Their concern for corruption of the political process \"is not only widely shared, but is also of an abstract and indefinite nature,\" comparable to \"the common concern for obedience to law.\" Akins, 524 U.S. at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the argument of Nader's supporters that they suffer derivatively from his injury, again, such argument sweeps too broadly. Regardless of Nader's injury, his supporters remain fully able to advocate for his candidacy and to cast their votes in his favor. Compare Buckley v. Valeo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 94 (1976) (\"[T]he denial of public financing to some Presidential candidates is not restrictive of voters' rights . . . .\"), and Gottlieb v.

The issue before us is a narrow one: whether the FEC debate regulations allowing corporate funding of certain debate staging organizations, 11 C.F.R.  110.13 and 114.4(f), violate, on their face, the FECA. The exclusion of Nader from the 2000 Presidential election debates is not at issue, nor is any constitutional claim asserted. We review de novo the district court's decision to uphold the regulations, a question of law. Strickland v.

Chevron governs the judicial review of agency regulations to ensure that they comply with the applicable statutory scheme, and entails a two step analysis. If Congress has spoken to the precise question at issue and the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter. Id. at 842. Agency regulations in accord with that unambiguously expressed intent are upheld; those that contravene that intent are invalid. But if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the precise issue, then the question becomes whether the agency's regulations are based on a permissible construction of the statute. Id. at 843. In assessing the agency's construction of an ambiguous provision, courts, under this second step of Chevron, must defer to reasonable agency interpretation and implementation of the provision.

The FECA prohibits corporations from making any contribution or expenditure \"in connection with\" any federal election, 2 U.S.C.  441b(a), and defines \"contribution or expenditure\" to include \"any direct or indirect payment . . . or gift . . . to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization,\" id.  441b(b)(2). This general prohibition is subject to three exceptions, which permit corporate funds to be used (1) for internal corporate communications; (2) for nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns by a corporation directed to its stockholders and executive and administrative personnel and their families; and (3) for the establishment of a separate segregated fund used for political purposes. Id.  441b(b)(2)(A)-(C). In addition, the FECA's general definition section also addresses the term \"expenditure,\" defining it to include any payments made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\" id.  431(9)(A)(i), but not to include \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote,\" id.  431(9)(B)(ii).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Implementing these statutory provisions, in 1980 the FEC promulgated debate regulations to govern contributions and expenditures made in sponsorship of candidate debates; in 1996, it revised them. Under the FEC's regulatory scheme, corporate contributions and expenditures may be made to defray the costs of conducting candidate debates where those debates are held by nonpartisan organizations so long as those organizations and the structure of the debate meet certain criteria. Two interrelated regulations produce this result. First, Section 110.13 delineates the requirements for debate staging organizations, debate structure, and criteria for candidate selection necessary to qualify for exemption from the contribution and expenditure restrictions. Debate staging organizations must either be nonprofit organizations that \"do not endorse, support, or oppose political candidates or political parties,\" or broadcasters that are \"not owned or controlled by a political party, political committee or candidate.\" 11 C.F.R.  110.13(a). The candidate debate must include at least two candidates and not be structured \"to promote or advance one candidate over another.\" 11 C.F.R.  110.13(b). Finally, debate staging organizations are required to use \"pre-established objective criteria to determine which candidates may participate in the debate\" and may not rely solely on nomination by particular parties. 11 C.F.R.  110.13(c). Second, Section 114.4(f) allows nonprofit debate staging organizations to accept funds donated by corporations to defray costs incurred in staging candidate debates and, on the flipside, expressly permits corporations to make such donations to qualifed debate staging organizations. 11 C.F.R.  114.4(f). Complementing these sections, the FEC regulations defining the terms \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as covered by the Act expressly exempt the funds used in staging a qualified candidate debate from the \"contributions\" and \"expenditures\" regulated by the FECA. See 11 C.F.R.  100.7(b)(21) (not included in \"contributions\"); id.  100.8(b)(23) (not included in \"expenditures\"). In accordance with the requirements of the FECA, 2 U.S.C.  438(d), the proposed regulations, along with the FEC's analysis, were sent to Congress and did not become final until Congress had opportunity to express disapproval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues that these debate regulations permit corporate contributions to flow to candidates in violation of the general prohibition of Section 441b(a) and that such contributions do not fall within the limited exceptions of Section 441b(b)(2)(A)-(C); further, he rejects the FEC's contention that the regulations permissibly construe ambiguities in what corporate disbursements qualify as \"contributions and expenditures\" under the Act. Nader argues the FEC's position must be rejected for several reasons. First, Nader contends that the general prohibition against corporate contributions and expenditures in Section 441b(a) stands alone and is not at all ambiguous. This prohibition, he says, reflects a clear congressional intent that corporate monies not go toward political activities unless they fall into one of the three narrowly drawn exceptions in Section 441b(b), none of which is applicable to candidate debates. Hence this provision reveals an unambiguous congressional intent that corporate monies not be used to sponsor candidate debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Nader argues that when Congress enacted the more specific rules contained in Section 441b governing the use of general treasury corporate funds in 1976, it narrowed the exemption from the prohibition on corporate contributions so as to permit only those \"nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns\" that are aimed at the corporations' own \"shareholders and executive or administrative personnel and their families.\" 2 U.S.C.  441b(b)(2). While Nader acknowledges that Section 431(9)(B)(ii) contains a more general exception permitting funding for \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote,\" that \"permission\" comes in the form of an exemption to the FECA's general definition of \"expenditure.\" Nader maintains that the enactment of a specific provision dealing with corporate contributions and expenditures and defining those terms for that purpose renders the general definition inapposite, citing the principle that a specific statute governs over a more general one. See HCSC-Laundry v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110412\"><a href=\"/opinion/110412/hcsc-laundry-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific exception in Section 441b(b)(2) for \"nonpartisan registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns by a corporation aimed at its stockholders and executive and administrative personnel and their families,\" Nader argues, clearly does not exempt funding of candidate debates. Moreover, even if read in tandem with the general exemption excluding expenditures for \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote\" in Section 431(9)(B)(ii), Nader maintains that the statute still contains no ambiguity regarding the legality of expenditures for candidate debates because a debate cannot reasonably be described as such an activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Since sponsoring candidate debates does not fall into these exceptions to the prohibition of Section 441b(a), he contends that the clear intent of Congress as expressed in that prohibition must govern. Thus, Nader argues, there is no ambiguity in the statute that would permit the FEC, under the Chevron doctrine, to make policy interstitially. While disavowing any need to look at legislative history to clarify what Congress meant, Nader says that nothing in that history supports the FEC's reading. And so, Nader concludes, there is no gap in the statute on the precise question of whether corporate funds can be used to finance electoral debates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Nader argues that even under the second stage of Chevron these regulations should fail. Nader maintains that the regulations cannot be a permissible construction of the statute because they are inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Nader alleges that the FECA seeks to restrict the influence of corporate monies in political elections in order to protect the integrity of the electoral system. Since the debate regulations instead promote corporate involvement in political activity, they are not a reasonable interpretation of the FECA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Nader responds to the common sense observation that these debate regulations have been in place for more than twenty years, that they have governed many well-publicized debates, and that Congress never once intimated that the FEC rules were contrary to its intention. Nader says that this \"silence\" proves nothing: a busy Congress cannot be expected to police every agency action; indeed, in 5 U.S.C.  801(g) Congress forbade the courts to infer any such intent from its silence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC responds that Nader's emphasis on the narrowness of the exceptions in Section 441b(b)(2)(B) and Section 431(9)(B)(ii) is misplaced: the debate regulations do not interpret the scope of these exceptions, the FEC contends; rather, they interpret what types of corporate disbursements count as \"contributions and expenditures\" in the first instance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The FEC relies on asserted ambiguities in Section 441b as well as Section 431(9) to justify its policymaking activity with regard to candidate debates. The general language of those sections, the FEC contends, says nothing indicating any congressional consideration, much less a clear congressional intent, about whether (or in what circumstances) sponsorship of candidate debates should be treated as a \"contribution\" or \"expenditure,\" which the FEC claims is the \"precise question at issue\" in this case. Since the general provisions leave this question open, the FEC argues that the FECA effectively delegates that question to the policymaking authority of the agency. Moreover, the FEC suggests that its construction of the statute is reasonable in three additional respects: first, the narrow construction of the prohibitory language of the Act serves to protect First Amendment interests otherwise potentially implicated by it; second, the construction of the Act accords with Congressional intent as expressed in the legislative record; and third, the debate regulations serve purposes akin to those served by the existing exceptions to the statute's prohibitions. Thus the FEC insists that the debate regulations reflect a reasonable construction of the FECA that is due Chevron deference. Finally, the FEC also points to the fact that the debate regulations were submitted to Congress, which did not disapprove them, and have been in force quite publicly for twenty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis under Chevron begins with the question of whether the FECA statutory scheme reveals a clear congressional intent to ban the particular activity of corporate sponsorship of the debates as permitted under the regulations. We conclude that several aspects of the statutory scheme, rather than indicating a clear congressional intent on the issue, in fact foster ambiguity. As a primary matter, it is not clear on the face of the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" that corporate disbursements to nonpartisan debate staging organizations even fall within the scope of the Act's coverage in the first instance. Section 441b bars corporate contributions or expenditures \"in connection with any election,\" 2 U.S.C. 441b(a), including direct or indirect corporate payments or gifts \"to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization.\" Id.  441b(b)(2). Section 431(9) defines \"expenditures\" as any payments made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" Id.  431(9)(a)(i). In neither case is it clear that corporate disbursements to nonprofit debate staging organizations fall within the ambit of the respective definitions, as such payments are not clearly \"in connection with any election,\" nor are they clearly \"indirect payments . . . to any candidate,\" nor are they clearly made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" These imprecise definitional phrases display the ambiguity present in the statutory scheme. The Supreme Court itself has observed (in a different context) that the phrase, \"for the purpose of influencing any election,\" is ambiguous. See Buckley v. Valeo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 79-80 (1976). In light of this uncertainty, the statute taken as a whole does not express a clear congressional intent with respect to the precise question at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other language in the FECA reinforces our finding that the statute is ambiguous. First, that Congress intended to delegate broad policymaking discretion to the FEC is confirmed by the statutory charge that the FEC shall \"formulate policy under the Act.\" 2 U.S.C.  437. Congress also lodged a degree of flexibility in the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" in particular where it defined them to \"include\" certain uses and phrased the exceptions to their general prohibitions as enumerating activities that the terms \"shall not include.\" See id.  441b. The Supreme Court has recognized an element of flexibility in the term \"include,\" as it indicates that \"activities not specifically enumerated in that section may nonetheless be encompassed by it.\" FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens For Life, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-for-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 246 (1986). Thus the definitions are not only of uncertain scope but also employ language suggestive of flexibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language and structure of the exceptions to the prohibitions also suggest ambiguity. The statutory phrase \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or register to vote\" at Section 431(9)(B)(ii) gives the Commission some leeway to interpret the term \"activity\" and to decide which activities so \"encourage\" people. In addition, the statutory structure gives rise to a second question: how the specific corporate funding prohibition and exception in Section 441b(b)(2)(B) are meant to operate with the more general \"encouraging activity\" provision of Section 431(9)(B)(ii). It is unclear whether the specific provision trumps the earlier \"encouraging activity\" exception by limiting it and removing any leeway in the Commission, as Nader contends, or whether Congress intended the two sections to work together and to provide some flexibility to the Commission. In light of these questions, we find the statute is not clear on its face and rules of statutory interpretation do not compel any one particular answer to the precise question at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resort to the legislative history, even if appropriate, fails to dispel this uncertainty and provide a clear Congressional intent. We explain, beginning with the amendments Congress has made to the Act in response to judicial developments. Although the language of the statute is seemingly broad, that language has often been reviewed by courts in light of constitutional constraints, that is, the First Amendment rights of those regulated.

C.I.O., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104588\"><a href=\"/opinion/104588/united-states-v-cio/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 123-24 (1948) (union political endorsements directed to union members are not contributions or expenditure covered by the predecessor of the Act); MCFL, 479 U.S. at 249 (corporate communications about candidates that do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate); Maine Right to Life Committee, Inc. v.

As the FEC notes, the statute has changed over time so as to mesh more smoothly with subsequent court decisions and other related statutes. The exceptions to the prohibition now set out in Section 441b(b) were added to the predecessor of Section 441b in 1971 largely to codify earlier court decisions. See, e.g., Pipefitters Local Union No. 562 v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108586\"><a href=\"/opinion/108586/pipefitters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 409-13, 421-27 (1972) (exception allowing segregated political fund codified prior case law). Congress then refined the exceptions in 1974, excepting \"nonpartisan activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to vote.\" See 2 U.S.C.  431(9)(B)(ii). Finally, in 1976, Congress incorporated the prohibitions on corporate expenditures and the concomitant exceptions previously codified at 18 U.S.C.  610 into the FECA with the enactment of Section 441b, which specifically excepted from the prohibition on corporate expenditures the internal registration and get-out-the-vote activities described earlier. See 2 U.S.C.  441b(b)(2)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FEC says that Congress illuminated how these provisions were meant to work together in the legislative history:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conferees' intent with regard to the inter-relationship between sections [2 U.S.C. 431(9)(B)(ii)] and [2 U.S.C. 441b(b)(2)(B)] which permit such activities as assisting eligible voters to register and get to the polls, so long as these services are made available without regard to the voter's political preference, is the following: these provisions should be read together to permit corporations both to take part in nonpartisan registration and get out the vote activities that are not restricted to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, if such activities are jointly sponsored by the corporation and an organization that does not endorse candidates and are conducted by that organization; and to permit corporations, on their own, to engage in such activities restricted to executive or administrative personnel and stockholders and their families. The same rule, of course, applies to labor organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R. Conf. Rep.

Nader's reliance on the admonition against inferring any intent from Congress's silence in 5 U.S.C.  801(g) is inappropriate, as that provision is limited to proposed rules submitted to Congress under the disapproval mechanism established in 5 U.S.C.  801 and 802, and hence does not apply to regulations promulgated by the FEC under 2 U.S.C.  438(d) long before the enactment of 5 U.S.C.  801 in 1996. Moreover, this is not a situation of complete congressional inaction; the failure to disapprove of the current debate regulations takes on additional significance in light of Congress's rejection of the FEC's initial proposal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus we conclude that the FECA expresses no clear congressional intent on the precise issue in this case -- the corporate sponsorship of qualified debate staging organizations to defray the costs of conducting candidate debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we have determined that the FECA does not answer the precise question at issue, the question thus becomes whether the FEC's efforts in the debate regulations to permit such corporate sponsorship, and to define the proper scope of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as used by the Act, reflect a permissible construction of the statute. Under Chevron, absent an unambiguously expressed congressional intent on the precise issue, the courts must defer to the Commission's construction if it is reasonable and not inconsistent with the statute. Duckworth v. Pratt &amp; Whitney, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757017\"><a href=\"/opinion/757017/mark-duckworth-v-pratt-whitney-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1998). The debate regulations at issue pass that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the debate regulations reflect a reasonable understanding of the purposes of the FECA, and in fact parallel the purposes of its express exceptions. In 1979, the Commission addressed the funding and sponsorship of candidate debates in a rulemaking. The Commission decided that since the legislative policy behind the express exceptions was to permit corporations and unions to fund activity directed to the general public to encourage voter participation so long as the activity is conducted primarily by a nonpartisan organization, \"permitting corporations and labor organizations to donate funds to nonprofit nonpartisan organizations for [debate] staging is consistent with congressional intent and policy.\" FEC, Explanation and Justification, Funding and Sponsorship of Federal Candidate Debates, 44 Fed. Reg. 74,734, at 76,736 (1979); see also 44 Fed. Reg. 39,348, at 39,349. The Commission concluded that \"[t]he educational purposes\" of a debate staged by such nonpartisan organizations \"is similar to the purpose underlying nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns.\" Id. at 39,348. \"Unlike single candidate appearances, nonpartisan debates are designed to educate and inform voters rather than to influence the nomination or election of a particular candidate. Hence, funds received and expended [by certain nonprofit organizations] to defray costs incurred in staging nonpartisan public debates are not considered contributions or expenditures under the Act.\" Id. Moreover, the FEC's debate regulations are in accord with congressional expectations as expressed in the legislative history discussed above. It is certainly within the purview of agency discretion to accord respect to congressional intent as reflected in the legislative record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the debate regulations are not inconsistent with the definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" provided by Section 441b. As the prohibition contained in Section 441b did not specifically address corporate donations to nonpartisan tax exempt organizations but rather addressed payments \"to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization,\" the Commission reasonably determined that the prohibition need not apply to corporate disbursements to nonpartisan tax exempt organizations for the limited purpose of staging candidate debates. The Commission's determinations that the prohibition was especially concerned with \"active electioneering\" to promote a particular candidate and that sponsoring a nonpartisan debate was not \"active electioneering\" were similarly permissible. And the fact that the regulations allow corporate contributions to candidate debates in order to encourage voter participation in a fashion not expressly permitted by the statute does not itself invalidate the regulation. \"Agencies often are allowed through rulemaking to regulate beyond the express substantial directives of the statute, so long as the statute is not contradicted.\" Clifton, 114 F.3d at 1312.

As I read his claim, Nader asserts two distinct theories of injury. First, he claims an injury derived from the \"coercive choice\" potentially posed by the allegedly illegal debate regulations. According to Nader, if he is invited to participate in the debates, he will be forced into a Hobbesian choice: either compromise of his corporate watchdog platform or loss of an important avenue for communication. Second, Nader claims injury as a political competitor: opponents invited to the debate benefit directly from allegedly illegal corporate sponsorship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with the majority approach, as I see it, is that the majority found standing here by collapsing these two very separate theories. If he had been invited to the debate, Nader may indeed have faced a choice between accepting corporate sponsorship and losing free national exposure. However, as he was not invited to the debate, he did not face this choice; he cannot be injured by any coercive effect it might have had, or by any strategic changes to his campaign such a choice might entail. Likewise, it is surely true that Nader was at a competitive disadvantage because his opponents participated in the debates. He may have had to alter his strategy to cope with the free air time that they receive. However, to the extent that Nader faces this problem, it is because he is a political competitor, not because he faces a coerced choice under the Vote Choice analysis; his unwillingness to participate in the debates if invited did not affect Nader's response to this free air time. And as I discuss below, his injury as a political competitor is not traceable to the challenged regulations because he cannot show that the debates likely would not occur without the corporate sponsorship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I began by addressing the \"coerced choice\" theory. Relying on Vote Choice, Nader claims that the allegedly impermissible regulation coercively impacted the strategy and conduct of his presidential campaign. In Vote Choice, Elizabeth Leonard, a Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate, challenged a set of state campaign finance laws that: (i) required candidates upon declaring their candidacy to make an irrevocable election whether to use public funds; (ii) forced candidates electing to use public funds to sign an irrevocable pledge to abide by various terms and conditions of the fund grant; and (iii) created significant differences in legally allowed contributions between those who accepted and those who did not accept public funding (a so-called \"contribution cap gap\"). Although Leonard had not accepted the public funding and never actually faced a publicly funded opponent, we found that she retained standing to challenge the public funding provisions. We reasoned that \"when declaring her candidacy, Leonard had to make an irrevocable commitment\" as to her use of public funding. Vote Choice, 4 F.3d at 36-37. As a result, she had to plan her campaign strategy based on the possibility that her opponent (perhaps an undeclared one) would make the opposite choice; \"the coerced choice between public and private financing colored her campaign strategy from the outset.\" Id. We concluded that \"such an impact on the strategy and conduct of an office-seeker's political campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to confer standing. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader argues, and the majority agrees, that the allegedly illegal corporate contributions to the debate organizing entity create a coercive choice of the type in Vote Choice, and thus standing follows. However, there is an important distinction between the two situations. Vote Choice did not grant Leonard standing simply because of the benefits given to her publicly funded opponents under Rhode Island campaign finance law. To do so would have premised standing on Leonard's injury as a political competitor; that is, it would have found injury due to the additional benefits accrued by her opponents. Such a theory may be viable here, and I discuss it below. Vote Choice, however, premised standing on the fact that Leonard's choice not to accept such benefits shaped her strategy throughout the race. In other words, because Rhode Island provided allegedly unlawful incentives to accept public funding, a candidate could challenge those incentives even if they did not ultimately rely on them. But in the present case, Nader was not coerced into making this choice - in fact, he has been saved from coercion by the lack of sufficient public support to meet the threshold set by the Commission on Public Debates (the \"CPD\"). Unlike Leonard, whose campaign strategy was altered by an irrevocable choice made at the start of her campaign, Nader never faced such a dilemma. If he had, I would have found standing under Vote Choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the majority finds potential coercion even when none actually exists. In my view, by creating a present harm from the possibility of a future one, they dangerously expand our standing jurisprudence. The majority begins with the theory that because Nader has chosen not to accept corporate contributions, he was barred from the debates at the time the CPD accepted corporate donations, whether he proved ultimately eligible or not. If the debates were not funded by corporations, however, Nader would have been able and willing to participate if he had been invited. This seems plausible to me. However, the majority continues, this \"threat\" of being forced to decline a debate invitation in the future \"had a palpable and immediate impact on [Nader's] campaign strategy and expenditures,\" namely that Nader spent \"more on advertising than he would [have] if there remained a chance that he could appear in the debate.\" I agree with the majority that it is not generally proper for this institution \"to second-guess a candidate's reasonable assessment of his own campaign.\" However, I am not willing to grant a petitioner seeking standing free reign to allege changes in strategy forced only by the possibility of future events. Much as our standing jurisprudence requires the injury to be \"distinct and palpable,\" Allen, 468 U.S. at 751, I believe that a strategic harm argued under Vote Choice must be more than a mere potentiality. And unlike the majority, I find something \"improbable\" about the proposition that a threatened choice three months in the future impacted Nader's strategy at the time of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me expand. In June of 2000, at the time he filed this complaint, Nader admittedly failed to meet the eligibility requirements set by the CPD in January of 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> Specifically, he had not reached the 15% popular opinion threshold, although some polls had him in the 6 % range. See Frank Newport, Gallup News Service, Poll Releases (October 23, 2000), available at http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr001023.asp. In June, Nader's potential strategies were thus either to attempt to reach the 15% threshold, so that he would be eligible for the free exposure of the debates, or not to attempt to reach the 15% threshold. However, given that he was running for President of the United States, the latter choice does not seem a viable one - whether or not he received a debate invitation. Moreover, Nader has never asserted that, because he would not accept a debate invitation under any circumstances, he resigned himself to a failed campaign that would never reach the 15% mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even ignoring the infirmities of this theory of strategic impact, I note that Nader has not alleged that his campaign strategy was so affected by the potential choice which he faced. His main brief merely asserts that \"Nader and his organizational supporters have been forced to adjust their campaign strategy to compensate for the benefits conferred upon Nader's competitors by the Debate Regulations\" (emphasis added). In Nader's reply brief, he explains the strategic impact of the regulations in slightly more detail: \"Nader has been forced to spend more of his campaign's money on advertising in order to overcome the free television time that candidates Bush and Gore have and will continue to receive as debate participants.\" In this regard, Nader is correct: the fact that his opponents will participate in the debates and that he will not (either because he is not invited or because he chooses not to) means he will have to spend additional advertising funds to match their free television time. However, Nader's phrasing indicates that the strategic impact of the debate regulations, in his mind, is only related to the receipt of illegal (according to him) money by his opponents. Nader says nothing about planning for the possibility of receiving free debate time; he has apparently assumed that he will not compete and formed his campaign strategy based on that assumption. This is very different from the strategic impact proposed by the majority, and it is also foreign to our analysis in Vote Choice. At base, Nader is claiming injury as a political competitor; the majority's attempt to dress it as a future choice with a present strategic impact is misguided and not supported by either appellant's brief or their approach at oral argument. Furthermore, unlike in Vote Choice, the district court here failed to make clear findings of strategy, simply noting that appellants had alleged a strategic harm. See Becker v. FEC, No. 00-11192-PBS, at 14 (D. Mass., September 1, 2000). Even if it is inappropriate for a court to evaluate the actual impact of a choice on a candidate's strategy, and even if a court should accept the candidate's assessment of the impact at face value with hardly any inquiry, we need not premise injury on a supposed strategic impact not even argued by the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, I find that theoretical injury caused by potential future choices is the type of injury the Supreme Court warned against in Lujan. In Berner v. Delahanty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197623\"><a href=\"/opinion/197623/berner-v-delahanty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1997), we noted specific hurdles for abstract harms such as this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The [Supreme] Court placed a special gloss on cases in which a party seeks exclusively injunctive or declaratory relief. In such purlieus, standing inheres only if the complainant can show that he has suffered (or has been threatened with) \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is . . . concrete and particularized,\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, together with \"a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a significant way,\" Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. In other words, the complainant must establish that the feared harm is \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. It bears noting that the imminence concept, while admittedly far reaching, is bounded by its Article III purpose: \"to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative.\" Id. at 564 n.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not find that Nader has made a sufficient showing of a \"concrete and particularized\" injury; the unfocused \"threat\" of a coerced choice sometime hence is much like the overly speculative \"'some day' intentions\" that the Supreme Court found lacking in Lujan. Id. at 564.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem of abstractness and lack of imminence is further revealed by the opening the majority creates for future litigants. Because the majority analysis places its present harm in the possibility of a future choice, anyone that could face the future choice must have the same injury. No language in the majority necessarily restricts this to candidates with a significant chance of facing the future choice; presumably, the possibility of this choice affected Nader's strategy prior to June. It theoretically could have altered his decision even to enter the race. In expanding standing to Nader here, the majority grants standing to any political entrant to challenge any election regulation to which they might someday be subject.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nader's second theory of standing is not based on the strategic underpinnings of his own campaign, but on the theory that the corporate contributions to the CPD impermissibly help his competitors, essentially providing Gore and Bush with inexpensive access to extensive media coverage. The theory that a political competitor incurs injury because of an impermissible benefit to his opponent is premised on a line of cases granting standing to economic competitors. See, e.g., Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass'n, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></span>, 403 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have, however, been reluctant to adopt this \"political competitor\" theory of standing, not so much because the injury faced by a plaintiff is not a real one, but because that injury generally cannot be traced to the challenged regulation, nor is the injury usually redressable by invalidating the regulation. Three cases pursued by minor party candidate Lenora Fulani indicate the contours of this standing doctrine. In Fulani v. League of Women Voters Educ. Fund, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527787\"><a href=\"/opinion/527787/dr-lenora-b-fulani-lenora-b-fulanis-committee-for-fair-elections-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span> (2d Cir. 1989), the Second Circuit found that Fulani had standing to challenge the tax-exempt status of the League of Women Voters. Fulani claimed that the League's refusal to include her in debates deprived her of critical media exposure and competitive advantage, as well as the opportunity to communicate her political ideas to the electorate. The court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he loss of competitive advantage flowing from the League's exclusion of Fulani from the national debates constitutes sufficient \"injury\" for standing purposes, because such loss palpably impaired Fulani's ability to compete on an equal footing with other significant presidential candidates. To hold otherwise would tend to diminish the import of depriving a serious candidate for public office of the opportunity to compete equally for votes in an election, and would imply that such a candidate could never challenge the conduct of the offending agency or party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulani v. League, 882 F.2d at 626. The Second Circuit then found that the other prerequisites for standing were met, because removing the League's not-for-profit status would end the League's ability to sponsor debates, and probably would have meant the absence of any debates in the 1988 campaign season.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fulani v. Brady, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563195\"><a href=\"/opinion/563195/lenora-b-fulani-dr-v-nicholas-f-brady-secretary-of-the-treasury-fred/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1324</span></a></span> (D.C. Cir. 1991) and Fulani v. Bentsen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677827\"><a href=\"/opinion/677827/dr-lenora-b-fulani-and-lenora-b-fulani-for-president-v-lloyd-bentsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span> (2d Cir. 1994), both the Second and the D.C. Circuits cut back on this approach, in cases more nearly mirroring our own. In Fulani v. Brady, Fulani sought standing to challenge the tax-exempt status of the CPD based on its decision that she lacked a realistic chance of being elected President, and its concordant refusal to invite her to the 1988 presidential debates. The D.C. Circuit focused its inquiry on the fact that Fulani was challenging a tax exemption, and noted strong judicial precedent against the ability to challenge the tax treatment of a competitor. See id. at1327. In particular, Fulani could not meet the standing requirements of traceability and redressability: first, many factors beyond the tax-exempt status of the CPD were influential in excluding Fulani from the debates; second, revocation of the tax-exempt status of the CPD would not necessarily have any impact on the purportedly unfair provision of media coverage to the major party candidates. See id. at 1328-29. Although Nader is not challenging a tax exemption, his claim is once removed because it does not challenge the entity hosting the debate (the CPD) but that entity's source of funds. At best, a Nader victory here could require the CPD to find other sources of funds; it would not necessarily reduce his opponent's television exposure, nor would it likely cancel the debates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fulani v. Bentsen, Fulani again challenged the tax status of the League. However, the Second Circuit, noting that the debate in question was co-sponsored by CNN, refused to find injury based on \"the alleged incremental advantage accorded participants in debates in which the League plays a sponsoring role.\" Id. at 52-53. In other words, the fact that Fulani's competitors might benefit from the accouterments of League sponsorship was insufficient to create standing. Similarly, the fact that Nader's competitors may gain incremental advantages through their association with corporate sponsors is an insufficient basis for standing, given that a decision by this Court will have little or no impact on the exposure they gain due to the debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Second Circuit has indicated that for a plaintiff to gain standing as a political competitor, he must \"personally compete in the same arena with the same party to whom the government has bestowed the assertedly illegal benefit.\" In re United States Catholic Conference, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529719\"><a href=\"/opinion/529719/in-re-united-states-catholic-conference-uscc-and-national-conference-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1029 (2d Cir. 1989). In this case, the benefit has perhaps been conferred upon the sponsoring corporations, who at the most are allowed to further their political viewpoint by sponsoring a two-person debate, and at least are given additional air-time for their beer and pretzels. Perhaps the benefit has been conferred upon CPD, the entity which receives the allegedly illegal contributions. Nader would argue that Gore and Bush receive the unlawful benefit, and that as their competitor he has standing. However, Fulani v. Bentsen explicitly refused to extend the competitive standing rule to encompass this removed level of competition. Id. at 54 (\"We decline to extend the rule of Catholic Conference to encompass not only a plaintiff's competitors in a defined arena, but also any entity that provides a tangential benefit to those competitors.\"). Nader does compete with Bush and Gore, who may or may not have received tangential benefits from corporate sponsorship of the debates; however, I fear that expanding competitor standing to this extent gives plaintiffs the ability to challenge a host of regulations that, while undoubtedly having incidental beneficial effects on their competitors, are not traceable to a concrete, particularized harm. See Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d at 1028; see also Gottlieb v. FEC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184523\"><a href=\"/opinion/184523/gottlieb-alan-v-fec/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 621 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (AmeriPAC could not challenge matching funds received by the Clinton campaign, because it was never in a position to receive such matching funds itself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority rues the fact that this analysis \"leads to the result that no candidate could ever challenge the FEC regulations in question here, regardless of how likely he or she was to be invited to the debate.\" First, I dispute this premise. Although no candidate may be able to challenge the regulations under a political competitor theory of standing, it is certainly possible that a candidate would have standing under the Vote Choice theory, if he or she actually faced a coerced choice. If Nader had reached the 15% mark, been invited to debate, and then refused to do so, I would be tempted to find standing here. Al Gore or George W. Bush could potentially have challenged the regulations as well. Furthermore, under the competitor theory, a rival debate organization or a potential non-corporate sponsor that could not afford the CPD's sponsorship prices might have successfully defended their standing as an economic competitor. In any event, even in the majority's refusal to read Vote Choice as implying that \"the regulations might effectively be immune from judicial review,\" the majority admits that the fact that the plaintiff might be the best person to have standing does not in itself give them standing. See Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110599\"><a href=\"/opinion/110599/valley-forge-christian-college-v-americans-united-for-separation-of-church/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, 489 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not doubt \"the powerful beneficial effect that mass media exposure can have today on the candidacy of a significant aspirant seeking national political office.\" Fulani v.

However, all of these cases involved burdens placed on candidates or voters in order for them to participate in the election process, an inherently time-sensitive issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> For example, in Storer, petitioners challenged ballot access and nomination procedures necessarily occurring between the primary and the general election. See id. at 726-28; see also Rockefeller, 410 U.S. at 752-56 (similar issue). Dunn involved a challenge to state residency requirements which a would-be voter might not be able to challenge until just before the election, and which would without the exception become moot immediately after the election. See id. at 333-34. In Fulani v. League, Fulani's standing arose only at the time she was not invited to the debates, which meant that not enough time remained to litigate prior to the debates being held. See id. at 628. It is ironic that the very rationale which the majority used to grant Nader standing should now (I believe) lead them to find mootness. Under the majority's new standing jurisprudence, Nader could have brought his suit at any time after announcing his candidacy and possibly before doing so. A future petitioner who faces this same strategic problem will have ample time to sue in a manner so that we can redress his injury if appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the procedural history of this case indicates that future cases in which standing arises will not necessarily evade our review. Nader's complaint was filed on June 29, 2000. However, oral argument was not until six weeks later, on August 14, 2000. The argument was delayed by both the recusal of the original assigned judge and by at least one unopposed motion to extend time (made by the FEC). Although the district court issued its Memorandum and Order relatively quickly, on September 1, 2000, two more weeks passed until a final judgment was entered on September 18, 2000. This Court granted expedited review and oral arguments were heard on October 5, 2000. Although we have not issued our opinion until now, we certainly could have done so with more alacrity if it had proved necessary. Given the procedural history of this case, it can hardly be said that an Article III case or controversy on the issues raised would not be capable of full litigation and appellate review in a sufficient time to prevent mootness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case should never have reached the merits of the challenge to the FEC regulation. Nader lacked standing, either because his injury was hypothetical, or because his injury, although potentially real, was not traceable to the challenged regulations and not redressable by the invalidation of the challenged regulations. Moreover, by the time the litigation reached this court, Nader's harm had become moot. Although I agree with the majority that this appeal should be dismissed, I would not have reached the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because I find that Nader lacks the constitutional requirements for standing, I have not addressed the issue of prudential standing. However, a plaintiff generally has prudential standing under  10(a) of the APA when his interest is \"arguably\" within the \"zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statue in question.\" National Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118174\"><a href=\"/opinion/118174/national-credit-union-admin-v-first-nat-bank-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 489 (1998) (quoting Assoc. of Data Processing Serv.

Given that this section of the FECA is designed to prevent corruption in campaign finance, see, e.g., FEC v.

The fact that Nader personally is concerned with corruption in politics is particularly irrelevant to the standing question. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 573-74 (1992) (\"[A] citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws . . . does not state an Article III case or controversy.\"); United States v.

If the plaintiff fails to meet the constitutional standing guidelines, no assessment of his personal concern can create an Article III case or controversy. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (three elements are the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Throughout, the majority examines Nader's situation in June, when this lawsuit was filed, under the assumption that standing is measured only at the time of filing. Although some cases hold that standing is only measured at that time, other cases point in the opposite direction, i.e., that a petitioner must retain standing throughout the litigation. See, e.g., Powder River Basin Resource Council v. Babbitt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696240\"><a href=\"/opinion/696240/powder-river-basin-resource-council-v-bruce-babbitt-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1477</span></a></span>, 1485 (10th Cir. 1995). Such a conclusion would seriously complicate the majority's approach; far before oral argument it was quite clear that Nader would not receive an invitation to the debate, and thus his campaign strategy was determined without any influence of a potential choice.</p>\n        <p>Although the majority suggests that Powder River no longer provides any authority because of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.

Friends of the Earth thus distinguished standing from mootness, but primarily to indicate that because the mootness analysis occurs at the end of litigation, there are important differences between the two doctrines. See id. My point here, which is supported by Powder River and not directly contradicted by Friends of the Earth, is that when standing disappears in the early stages of litigation, we should perhaps dismiss for lack of standing even if it may have existed at the time of the complaint.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> These eligibility requirements were: (i) constitutional eligibility; (ii) appearance on a sufficient number of state ballots to achieve an Electoral College majority; and (iii) a level of support exceeding 15% according to major national polls. See Joint Appendix 174-76.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the majority contends that its holding is \"nowhere near so broad\" as I have suggested, I am unconvinced. Their basic point is that potential choices in the future can alter strategy today, and that forced changes in strategy today can meet the injury requirement for standing. I see no clear way of distinguishing Nader's \"plausible\" hope that he would be invited to the debates \"at a definite date\" in the future, from perhaps slightly less plausible (but still possible) hopes that may occur at a more distant time.</p>\n        <p>For example, Nader is running for President. Presumably, issues affecting the President of the United States inform his decision to run, which is undoubtedly part and parcel of his campaign strategy. Yet I doubt very much that the majority would grant Nader standing to challenge, say, the calculation of the presidential salary, simply because he may potentially be subject to its dictates. However, I believe that the majority's theory of standing would require them to do so if Nader asserted that such issues altered his current campaign strategy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In addition, these election exceptions to mootness involved First Amendment constitutional challenges, an area afforded special treatment by the Court's standing and mootness jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span> (1991) In contrast, Nader does not raise a First Amendment challenge of any sort, but simply challenges the legality of FEC regulations. The majority recognizes this distinction, but chooses to rely upon it to find an exception here.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
