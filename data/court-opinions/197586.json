Kimball Towers\r\n\nCondominium Association  (Kimball) was  insured by  Preferred\r\n\nMutual Insurance  Company (Preferred) under a Business Owners\r\n\nSpecial Property  Policy that  covered its  property broadly,\r\n\nwith a limit of $11,340,000 and an annual premium of $40,484.\r\n\nWith some exceptions,  the policy did not cover  steam or hot\r\n\nwater  boilers and their equipment.  Kimball was also insured\r\n\nby Travelers Company (Travelers) under a Boiler and Machinery\r\n\nPolicy.    Boiler provisions  complementary  with Preferred's\r\n\nhave been noted.  Travelers' policy had no dollar limitation;\r\n\nthe annual \"Provisional  Premium\"1 was $875.   Preferred paid\r\n\nthis loss,2 in the amount of $357,279, and now sues Travelers\r\n\nfor this amount as the \"primary insurer,\" or, at least, for a\r\n\nshare.   A condition precedent  is that Travelers  would have\r\n\nbeen liable for the loss.  The district court held that there\r\n\nwas  no  such  coverage,  so  that  neither  alternative  was\r\n\ncorrect,  and granted  summary judgment  to  Travelers in  an\r\n\nextensive opinion.  See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v.  Travelers\r                                                                         \r\n\nCos., 955 F. Supp.  9 (D. Mass. 1997).

A  leaky  seal in  the  fuel pump,  that\r\n\nsupplied  oil to the  burner that heated  the boiler, allowed\r\n\noil to be propelled, with air, into the burner tube.  Here it\r\n\ncaught fire.  This fire caused a melt, allowing the burner to\r\n\nfall,  damaging the  oil line.    This released  oil, fed  by\r\n\ngravity from the storage supply, that caught fire  and burned\r\n\nuntil ultimately extinguished by the fire department.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          The relevant  Travelers' policy  provisions (quoted\r\n\nout of order) are these.\r\n\n          A.

If the fire fell within the  provisions of section B4a\r\n\nit  is  not  covered  even  though it  also  met  some  other\r\n\ndefinitions.  Cf. Jussim  v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co.,  415\r                                                                   \r\n\nMass. 24, 27-28, 610  N.E.2d 954, 955-56 (1993)  (noting that\r\n\nif the  proximate cause  \"is an insured  risk, there  will be\r\n\ncoverage even though  the final form of  the property damage,\r\n\nproduced by a  series of related events, appears  to take the\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nloss outside the  terms of the policy\").   Preferred says the\r\n\npresent  issue lies in provision 4a's second sentence because\r\n\nthe  loss was caused  by the breakdown of  the fuel pump that\r\n\nwas  \"electrical equipment\"  because it  was  operated by  an\r\n\nelectric   motor.     Although  there  was   some  struggling\r\n\nvocalizing  by Preferred's expert, we can not possibly agree.\r\n\nWe do  not rely on the much mentioned  fact that the pump and\r\n\nthe  motor were  by different  manufacturers,  but they  were\r\n\nindependent articles, connected only by the power shaft, with\r\n\nno electricity reaching  the pump.  Manifestly there  must be\r\n\nsome purpose for the alternative clause in provision 4a, and,\r\n\nequally  manifestly, electricity must play a meaningful part.\r\n\nTo characterize the pump as electrical is nonsense.\r\n\n          Turning,   therefore,  to   4a's  first   sentence,\r\n\nconcededly the leak in the pump was an accident to an object.\r\n\nWhether or  not  the broken  supply line  also be  considered\r\n\naccessory   equipment,  the  burning   of  the   fuel  supply\r\n\nunquestionably \"ensue[d] from an 'accident.'\"  It was plainly\r\n\nexcluded.\r\n\n          In  this  posture  Preferred  complains  that  this\r\n\nconclusion \"result[s] in  coverage to the insured  which [i]s\r\n\nunrealistically limited.\"  Support is offered by an affidavit\r\n\nof  Kimball's  \"property  manager,\"  who   had  obtained  the\r\n\npolicies:\r\n\n               It    has    been    my    continued\r\n          understanding and  expectation that  fire\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          originating  from   the  boiler   or  its\r\n          accessory  equipment  would   be  covered\r\n          under  Travelers'  Boiler  and  Machinery\r\n          Policy.\r\n\n          Thus we have an insurer that had received a premium\r\n\nof $40,484, claiming it  was unreasonable for an  insurer who\r\n\nhad received a  premium of $875  not to  pay it $357,279,  in\r\n\npart, if not in whole.  The lion would lie down with the lamb\r\n\n-- for dinner.\r\n\n          The Boiler  and Machinery policy  covered accidents\r\n\nto  the  boiler  and  accessory  equipment,  and,  in  terms,\r\n\nexcluded \"fire . . .  that ensues from an 'accident.'\"  There\r\n\nwas  an accident, and fire ensued.   Plaintiff, who is in the\r\n\nbusiness  of writing  and  interpreting insurance  contracts,\r\n\nsues therefor.  We give notice that if it wishes to object to\r\n\nour assessing double costs it do so, with grounds, within ten\r\n\ndays of  the date hereof.  See Fed. R.

Kimball Towers Condominium Association (Kimball) was insured by Preferred Mutual Insurance Company (Preferred) under a Business Owners Special Property Policy that covered its property broadly, with a limit of $11,340,000 and an annual premium of $40,484.  With some exceptions, the policy did not cover steam or hot water boilers and their equipment.  Kimball was also insured by Travelers Company (Travelers) under a Boiler and Machinery Policy.  Boiler provisions complementary with Preferred's have been noted.  Travelers' policy had no dollar limitation;  the annual \"Provisional Premium\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was $875.  Preferred paid this loss,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in the amount of $357,279, and now sues Travelers for this amount as the \"primary insurer,\" or, at least, for a share.  A condition precedent is that Travelers would have been liable for the loss.  The district court held that there was no such coverage, so that neither alternative was correct, and granted summary judgment to Travelers in an extensive opinion.  See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Cos., 955 F.Supp. 9 (D.Mass.1997).  Without deciding, it assumed that Travelers' policy's general provisions covered the loss--an assumption not contested, and that we adopt--but concluded that it fell within the stated exclusions.

Preferred says the present issue lies in provision 4a's second sentence because the loss was caused by the breakdown of the fuel pump that was \"electrical equipment\" because it was operated by an electric motor.  Although there was some struggling vocalizing by Preferred's expert, we can not possibly agree.  We do not rely on the much mentioned fact that the pump and the motor were by different manufacturers, but they were independent articles, connected only by the power shaft, with no electricity reaching the pump.

Kimball Towers Condominium Association (Kimball) was insured by Preferred Mutual Insurance Company (Preferred) under a Business Owners Special Property Policy that covered its property broadly, with a limit of $11,340,000 and an annual premium of $40,484.  With some exceptions, the policy did not cover steam or hot water boilers and their equipment.  Kimball was also insured by Travelers Company (Travelers) under a Boiler and Machinery Policy.  Boiler provisions complementary with Preferred's have been noted.  Travelers' policy had no dollar limitation;  the annual \"Provisional Premium\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was $875.  Preferred paid this loss,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in the amount of $357,279, and now sues Travelers for this amount as the \"primary insurer,\" or, at least, for a share.  A condition precedent is that Travelers would have been liable for the loss.  The district court held that there was no such coverage, so that neither alternative was correct, and granted summary judgment to Travelers in an extensive opinion.  See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Cos., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></span> (D.Mass.1997).  Without deciding, it assumed that Travelers' policy's general provisions covered the loss--an assumption not contested, and that we adopt--but concluded that it fell within the stated exclusions.  On this basis we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment we of course take the facts most favorably to plaintiff Preferred, but review the court's legal conclusions de novo.
