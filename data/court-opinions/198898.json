Stern, United States Attorney, and Cherie L. Krigsman,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, for appellee.\n\n\n                        ____________________\n\n                           April 14, 2000\n\f____________________\n\n\n\n\n        -2-\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. In pleading guilty to conspiracy\nto distribute a controlled substance and distribution of a\ncontrolled substance, see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846, defendant\nHerrera-Gonzalez admitted he was part of a cocaine distribution\nconspiracy but denied that his conspiracy included any agreement\nto   distribute   crack   cocaine.      After   hearing   evidence    at\nsentencing, the district court concluded to the contrary -- that\nHerrera could reasonably foresee the sale of crack by his\nbusiness partner Celso DelRosario and that Herrera continued to\nbe part of the conspiracy, despite his trips to the Dominican\nRepublic.    And so the district court attributed the crack to\nHerrera and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum for crack\ncocaine distribution involving fifty or more grams: 120 months.\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).\n\n            The question on appeal is whether the district court's\n\nconclusions were clearly erroneous. See United States v. Elwell,\n\n984 F.2d 1289, 1297-98 (1st Cir. 1993).         They were not.       The\n\ncourt found the testimony of the undercover agent credible; that\n\nagent testified that the defendant had offered to sell the agent\n\ncrack cocaine for a quoted price and to arrange for the agent to\n\nreceive a sample of crack at the next meeting.       That sample was\n\nprovided at the next meeting (albeit by defendant's business\n\npartner DelRosario).      Further, Herrera and DelRosario each said\n\nthat either of them could be contacted about placing orders and\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe quality of the merchandise; additionally, DelRosario and\n\nHerrera shared   a    cell   phone    and   an   address.   Credibility\n\ndeterminations were for the district court, see United States v.\n\nSandoval, 204 F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir. 2000), and the record amply\n\njustifies the conclusion that the defendant could reasonably\n\nforesee the sale of this crack to defendant.          See United States\n\nv. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          The same is true for the district court's conclusion\n\nthat Herrera had not withdrawn from the conspiracy before the\n\nsale of the crack to the undercover agent.           A lull in activity\n\ndoes not mean a break with one's business partners in crime. See\n\nUnited States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 162 (1st Cir. 1993).          After\n\nhis arrest, Herrera said that he had resumed the drug trade\n\nfollowing his journeying to the Dominican Republic.            His own\n\nwords, again, provided adequate support for the district court's\n\nconclusion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
