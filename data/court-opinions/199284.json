Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n               Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mark B. Laroche, by appointment of the court, for defendant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P.\nMadden, Assistant United States Attorney, were on consolidated\nbrief for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                       February 23, 2001\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.            The question is whether a\n\ndistrict court may depart downward to save taxpayers the expense\n\nof imprisoning a defendant who is likely to be deported after\n\ncompleting his sentence.      In this instance, Guillermo Maldonado\n\n(who says his real name is Miguel Angel Soto) pled guilty, in\n\nAugust 1997, to federal charges of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine and heroin.       21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)(1994).          In\n\nMarch 1998, Maldonado was sentenced to 210 months in prison, the\n\nminimum prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines as computed by\n\nthe district court.\n\n          Maldonado's counsel filed a timely notice of appeal but\n\ndid not pursue the appeal, and this court dismissed the appeal\n\nfor want of prosecution in July 1998.             Maldonado then filed a\n\nsection   2255   petition,    28   U.S.C.    §    2255   (Supp.   II   1996),\n\nalleging ineffectiveness of counsel in allowing the appeal to\n\nlapse; and, with the government's agreement, the district court\n\ngranted   the    petition    and   ordered       resentencing     to   permit\n\nMaldonado to take a direct appeal.                See Bonneau v. United\n\nStates, 961 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1992).           However, the court did\n\nnot mechanically impose the same sentence, as it could have\n\ndone.\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f              Instead, on the day of the resentencing hearing (March\n\n20, 2000), Maldonado filed a motion seeking a downward departure\n\nbased   on     evidence      of    rehabilitation.                 U.S.S.G.      §    5K2.0.\n\nAttached were copies of a high school equivalency diploma and\n\ncertificates        evidencing         completion       of   a     number      of    courses\n\nMaldonado had taken in 1998 and 1999 while in prison.                                      The\n\ngovernment      opposed    the         downward     departure,       saying         that   the\n\nevidence       did     not        show         extraordinary          post-sentencing\n\nrehabilitation.         Maldonado's counsel argued in favor of the\n\ndeparture, adding that a downward departure might also address\n\na   concern    mentioned      by       the   court      at   the    first   sentencing,\n\nnamely,      that    taxpayers         would       be   paying      for   17     years      of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n              The district court then sentenced Maldonado to 120\n\nmonths'      imprisonment,         a    downward        departure      of   90       months,\n\nstating:\n\n              What troubles me about these cases is that\n              210 months in federal prison for someone\n              who's going to be deported is a waste of\n              taxpayer money, some $20,000 a year just to\n              keep him in federal prison.      Recently, I\n              have been departing downward when the\n              sentence of a deportable felon is in the\n              higher ranges because of the concern I have\n              for the taxpayers paying for someone in a\n              federal prison when that person will be\n              deported. Obviously the defendant has been\n              doing some things to help himself while he's\n              in prison, and that's commendable. But the\n              real reason I'm going to depart downward\n\n                                             -3-\n\f            here is because I don't want the taxpayers\n            to pay for him unnecessarily.\n\n            Maldonado   now   appeals,     arguing      that   the    guideline\n\ncalculation    originally     adopted     by    the    district   court      (and\n\neffectively reaffirmed on resentencing) was mistaken in several\n\nrespects, and that Maldonado's guilty plea was defective.                     The\n\ngovernment cross-appeals, arguing that the district court had no\n\nauthority     to   consider    a    downward          departure      after   the\n\nresentencing and, in any event, erred in granting the departure\n\non the basis of expense to the taxpayer.\n\n            We start with the government's appeal. Its first claim\n\nis that the district court had no right after granting the\n\nsection 2255 motion to do anything more than to reimpose the\n\noriginal sentence.      The government is correct that reimposing\n\nthe original sentence without more would remedy the assumed\n\nconstitutional defect, so the district court could have declined\n\nto reexamine the sentence.         See United States v. Torres-Otero,\n\n232 F.3d 24, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2000).            The more difficult question\n\nis whether, as the government now urges, the district court was\n\nforbidden from sentencing the defendant afresh and imposing a\n\ndifferent sentence.\n\n            The government first argues that the plain language of\n\nsection 2255 requires that the \"error\" to which the petition is\n\naddressed must fit in one of the pigeonholes in the first\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsentence of section 2255.1        Perhaps so; but if this is the case,\n\nthe petition--which the government agreed should be granted--can\n\nbe taken to claim that the sentence was \"otherwise subject to\n\ncollateral attack\" because the negligence of counsel thwarted an\n\nappeal from the original conviction.               Cf. Bonneau, 961 F.2d at\n\n23.    On this premise, section 2255 gave the district court power\n\n\"to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\"                   28 U.S.C. §\n\n2255.\n\n            Nothing in the statute's language resolves the question\n\nwhether the district court in such a situation is precluded from\n\ncalculating the proper sentence anew.              The choice resembles that\n\npresented where, on direct appeal, a court of appeals sets aside\n\na    sentence   for    some   defect   in    the   calculation    but   neither\n\nexplicitly nor implicitly limits the district court in the scope\n\nof its resentencing.          Once again, the district court is not\n\nordinarily required to go beyond correcting the error identified\n\nby    the   court     of   appeals,    e.g.,   United    States   v.    Rivera-\n\nMaldonado, 124 F. Supp. 2d 788, 791 (D.P.R. 2000), but that does\n\nnot answer the question whether it may do so if it wishes.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n     Namely, that the sentence was unlawful or the court was\nwithout jurisdiction to impose it, or \"that the sentence was in\nexcess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject\nto collateral attack . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            In both situations, it is a windfall to a defendant if\n\nin resentencing the district court goes beyond correction of the\n\noriginal error and gives the defendant a lower sentence by\n\nvirtue of a new calculation on an unrelated aspect of the\n\nsentence.    The tension is between an idiosyncratic benefit for\n\none defendant not available to others and a desire to sentence\n\nproperly even if this involves giving the lucky defendant a\n\nbreak.   Since circumstances vary, one might well think that this\n\nis a choice that should be left to the district judge unless\n\nCongress or an appellate court directs otherwise.             Cf. Torres-\n\nOtero, 232 F.2d at 30; United States v. Rodriguez, 112 F.3d 26,\n\n29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 895 (1997).\n\n            The   government   points   out   that   there    are   severe\n\nrestrictions on the district court's right to revisit a sentence\n\npreviously imposed.     See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) (1994 & Supp. II\n\n1996) (retroactive application of guideline changes limited);\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 35 (seven-day limit on correction errors; one-\n\nyear limit on substantial assistance reductions).            This is quite\n\ntrue where a sentence has become final; but we are concerned\n\nwith a resentencing where the original sentence was invalidated.\n\nThe issue here is not whether there will be a resentencing--\n\nsection 2255 permits it, as does a remand, see Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n35(a)--but rather of its permissible scope.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            The     government     suggests    that   existing        precedent\n\nprohibits de novo resentencing, but we read the authorities\n\ndifferently.        The   more    common    case--that     of   a    remand   for\n\nresentencing after an appeal--is handled variously in different\n\ncircuits.     In some, it appears the district judge may go beyond\n\ncorrecting the error but is not required to do so.                  E.g., United\n\nStates v. Whren, 111 F.3d 956, 958-60 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert.\n\ndenied, 522 U.S. 1119 (1998).2         But it is hard to find an appeals\n\ncourt forbidding de novo resentencing, unless the mandate has\n\naffirmatively restricted the remand, e.g., United States v.\n\nParker, 101 F.3d 527, 528 (7th Cir. 1996); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n35(a)(1).\n\n            Criminal procedure, like the rest of life, is filled\n\nwith situations in which fortuities work to the benefit or\n\ndisadvantage of a prosecutor or defendant.                For example, where\n\na   retrial    is     ordered     because     of   some    mistake      in    the\n\ninstructions, witnesses may have died in the interval or new\n\nones been discovered, so that the evidence at the new trial is\n\nquite    different,       sometimes    favoring     the    prosecution        and\n\nsometimes the defense.           Section 2255 being silent, it seems to\n\n\n\n     2In two cases, somewhat surprisingly, the Second Circuit has\nrequired resentencing de novo.     United States v. Harris, 209\nF.3d 156, 162-63 (2d Cir. 2000); Soto v. United States, 185 F.3d\n48, 54 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n                                      -7-\n\fus that the best approach is to retain some flexibility.                         See\n\nUnited States v. Handa, 122 F.3d 690, 691 (9th Cir. 1997), cert.\n\ndenied, 522 U.S. 1083 (1998).\n\n              Although the district court was thus free to consider\n\na downward departure for any legitimate reason, we think that it\n\nerred in granting a departure on the grounds given.                     The court\n\nsaid that it was \"a waste of taxpayer money\" to impose a lengthy\n\nprison term on \"someone who's going to be deported.\"                    The court\n\ndid not say why, perhaps deeming it to be obvious.                     It is not;\n\nthere are several possibilities, and the most likely turn out to\n\ndepend very much on particular circumstances.\n\n              One    rationale       is    that    deportation   is    additional\n\npunishment added on to the term of imprisonment.                       If so, one\n\nmight think that adequate deterrence of drug crimes by aliens,\n\nwhere deportation is quite likely, is provided by threatening\n\naliens with a shorter sentence.               The argument assumes, however,\n\nthat   the     alien       knows     before       committing   the    crime     that\n\ndeportation will follow if he is caught and convicted and,\n\nfurther,      that    he     knows    that       deportation   will    be     highly\n\ndisadvantageous to him.             One might expect these factors to vary\n\nfrom   case    to    case,    and    the    absence    of   either    defeats    the\n\nargument.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f            Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, the district\n\ncourt may have been assuming that deportation would at least\n\nprotect the public against future crimes by the defendant after\n\nhis shortened term of imprisonment.              But even if the interest of\n\nforeign citizens is disregarded, the premise that the deported\n\nalien is gone for good is somewhat doubtful.                 American borders\n\nremain fairly porous.         There are already many prosecutions for\n\nillegal reentry after deportation, e.g., United States v. Luna-\n\nDiaz, 222 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2000), and, even more troubling,\n\nfor   criminal      acts    committed    after     illegal   entry    following\n\ndeportation, e.g., United States v. Cuevas, 75 F.3d 778, 779\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Strictly speaking, nothing in the guidelines addresses-\n\n-let alone forbids--consideration of the general approach taken\n\nby the district court or shows that the Sentencing Commission\n\nconsidered and rejected it.              Cf. United States v.          Alvarez-\n\nCardenas, 902 F.2d 734, 737 (9th Cir. 1990).                        In fact, in\n\n\"extraordinary\" cases, the guidelines themselves indicate that\n\nexpense    may   be   considered,       U.S.S.G.    §   5H1.1   (\"elderly   and\n\ninfirm\"); id. § 5H1.4 (\"extraordinary physical impairment\"); and\n\nwhile     hedging     the    matter,     some     courts     have    said   that\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fdeportability might, in some situations and for varying reasons,\n\nbe pertinent to a decision to depart.3\n\n            This      juxtaposition     of    the   \"general\"      with     the\n\n\"extraordinary\" is the key to our own problem.               Although the\n\nCommission      did   not   proscribe   the   district   court's    approach\n\n(\"[r]ecently, I have been departing downward when . . .\"), it\n\nobviously knew that deportable aliens commit crimes, that drug\n\nsentences are lengthy and that prisons are expensive.                     It is\n\nthus hard to avoid treating the Commission's failure to provide\n\na discount as equivalent to rejecting a discount as a matter of\n\ncourse.     Cf. United States v. Clase-Espinal, 115 F.3d 1054,\n\n1057-59 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 957 (1997).\n\n            In short, a deportable alien who commits a crime is\n\nstill within the \"heartland\" of the guidelines, absent something\n\nmore.     See   United States v. Garay, 235 F.3d 230, 233-34 (5th\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Farouil, 124 F.3d 838, 847 (7th\n\nCir. 1997).      If deportability, expense, or some combination of\n\nthe two justifies a departure, it would have to be based on\n\ncase-specific findings that made the case unusual.              Cf. United\n\n\n    3 See, e.g., United States v. Tejeda, 146 F.3d 84, 88 (2d\nCir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. Farouil, 124 F.3d 838,\n847 (7th Cir. 1997) (cited with approval in United States v.\nDeBeir, 186 F.3d 561, 569 (4th Cir. 1999)); United States\nv.

United   States,    518   U.S.    81,   96   (1996),   the   Sentencing\n\nCommission's silence might give the district court latitude in\n\nthe extraordinary case; but the common facts of a long sentence\n\nand likely deportation are not by themselves extraordinary.\n\nAccord United States v. Tejeda, 146 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir. 1998)\n\n(per curiam).    And that is all that was present here.\n\n          Because the departure was impermissible, we must remand\n\nfor resentencing.       The district judge did not formally rule on\n\nMaldonado's original request for a downward departure based on\n\npost-sentence rehabilitation.           In the past, this circuit and\n\nothers have held that a district court may depart downward in\n\nresentencing because of extraordinary circumstances reflecting\n\nrehabilitation after an earlier (now vacated) sentence for the\n\nsame crime.     See United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 78\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).4\n\n          The Commission has recently precluded this practice\n\nprecisely because it does give previously sentenced prisoners a\n\n\n\n      4\n     Accord United States v.

In this instance, Guillermo Maldonado (who says his real name is Miguel Angel Soto) pled guilty, in August 1997, to federal charges of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1)(1994). In March 1998, Maldonado was sentenced to 210 months in prison, the minimum prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines as computed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maldonado's counsel filed a timely notice of appeal but did not pursue the appeal, and this court dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution in July 1998. Maldonado then filed a section 2255 petition, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (Supp. II 1996), alleging ineffectiveness of counsel in allowing the appeal to lapse; and, with the government's agreement, the district court granted the petition and ordered resentencing to permit Maldonado to take a direct appeal. See Bonneau v. United States, 961 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1992). However, the court did not mechanically impose the same sentence, as it could have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, on the day of the resentencing hearing (March 20, 2000), Maldonado filed a motion seeking a downward departure based on evidence of rehabilitation. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0. Attached were copies of a high school equivalency diploma and certificates evidencing completion of a number of courses Maldonado had taken in 1998 and 1999 while in prison. The government opposed the downward departure, saying that the evidence did not show extraordinary post-sentencing rehabilitation. Maldonado's counsel argued in favor of the departure, adding that a downward departure might also address a concern mentioned by the court at the first sentencing, namely, that taxpayers would be paying for 17 years of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then sentenced Maldonado to 120 months' imprisonment, a downward departure of 90 months, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What troubles me about these cases is that 210 months in federal prison for someone who's going to be deported is a waste of taxpayer money, some $20,000 a year just to keep him in federal prison. Recently, I have been departing downward when the sentence of a deportable felon is in the higher ranges because of the concern I have for the taxpayers paying for someone in a federal prison when that person will be deported. Obviously the defendant has been doing some things to help himself while he's in prison, and that's commendable. But the real reason I'm going to depart downward here is because I don't want the taxpayers to pay for him unnecessarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maldonado now appeals, arguing that the guideline calculation originally adopted by the district court (and effectively reaffirmed on resentencing) was mistaken in several respects, and that Maldonado's guilty plea was defective. The government cross-appeals, arguing that the district court had no authority to consider a downward departure after the resentencing and, in any event, erred in granting the departure on the basis of expense to the taxpayer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the government's appeal. Its first claim is that the district court had no right after granting the section 2255 motion to do anything more than to reimpose the original sentence. The government is correct that reimposing the original sentence without more would remedy the assumed constitutional defect, so the district court could have declined to reexamine the sentence. See United States v. Torres-Otero, 232 F.3d 24, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2000). The more difficult question is whether, as the government now urges, the district court was forbidden from sentencing the defendant afresh and imposing a different sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government first argues that the plain language of section 2255 requires that the \"error\" to which the petition is addressed must fit in one of the pigeonholes in the first sentence of section 2255.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Perhaps so; but if this is the case, the petition--which the government agreed should be granted--can be taken to claim that the sentence was \"otherwise subject to collateral attack\" because the negligence of counsel thwarted an appeal from the original conviction. Cf. Bonneau, 961 F.2d at 23. On this premise, section 2255 gave the district court power \"to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the statute's language resolves the question whether the district court in such a situation is precluded from calculating the proper sentence anew. The choice resembles that presented where, on direct appeal, a court of appeals sets aside a sentence for some defect in the calculation but neither explicitly nor implicitly limits the district court in the scope of its resentencing. Once again, the district court is not ordinarily required to go beyond correcting the error identified by the court of appeals, e.g., United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 124 F. Supp. 2d 788, 791 (D.P.R. 2000), but that does not answer the question whether it may do so if it wishes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In both situations, it is a windfall to a defendant if in resentencing the district court goes beyond correction of the original error and gives the defendant a lower sentence by virtue of a new calculation on an unrelated aspect of the sentence. The tension is between an idiosyncratic benefit for one defendant not available to others and a desire to sentence properly even if this involves giving the lucky defendant a break. Since circumstances vary, one might well think that this is a choice that should be left to the district judge unless Congress or an appellate court directs otherwise. Cf. Torres-Otero, 232 F.2d at 30; United States v. Rodriguez, 112 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 895 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points out that there are severe restrictions on the district court's right to revisit a sentence previously imposed. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c) (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996) (retroactive application of guideline changes limited); Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 (seven-day limit on correction errors; one-year limit on substantial assistance reductions). This is quite true where a sentence has become final; but we are concerned with a resentencing where the original sentence was invalidated. The issue here is not whether there will be a resentencing--section 2255 permits it, as does a remand, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a)--but rather of its permissible scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that existing precedent prohibits de novo resentencing, but we read the authorities differently. The more common case--that of a remand for resentencing after an appeal--is handled variously in different circuits. In some, it appears the district judge may go beyond correcting the error but is not required to do so. E.g., United States v. Whren, 111 F.3d 956, 958-60 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1119 (1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But it is hard to find an appeals court forbidding de novo resentencing, unless the mandate has affirmatively restricted the remand, e.g., United States v. Parker, 101 F.3d 527, 528 (7th Cir. 1996); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Criminal procedure, like the rest of life, is filled with situations in which fortuities work to the benefit or disadvantage of a prosecutor or defendant. For example, where a retrial is ordered because of some mistake in the instructions, witnesses may have died in the interval or new ones been discovered, so that the evidence at the new trial is quite different, sometimes favoring the prosecution and sometimes the defense. Section 2255 being silent, it seems to us that the best approach is to retain some flexibility. SeeUnited States v. Handa, 122 F.3d 690, 691 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1083 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court was thus free to consider a downward departure for any legitimate reason, we think that it erred in granting a departure on the grounds given. The court said that it was \"a waste of taxpayer money\" to impose a lengthy prison term on \"someone who's going to be deported.\" The court did not say why, perhaps deeming it to be obvious. It is not; there are several possibilities, and the most likely turn out to depend very much on particular circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One rationale is that deportation is additional punishment added on to the term of imprisonment. If so, one might think that adequate deterrence of drug crimes by aliens, where deportation is quite likely, is provided by threatening aliens with a shorter sentence. The argument assumes, however, that the alien knows before committing the crime that deportation will follow if he is caught and convicted and, further, that he knows that deportation will be highly disadvantageous to him. One might expect these factors to vary from case to case, and the absence of either defeats the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, the district court may have been assuming that deportation would at least protect the public against future crimes by the defendant after his shortened term of imprisonment. But even if the interest of foreign citizens is disregarded, the premise that the deported alien is gone for good is somewhat doubtful. American borders remain fairly porous. There are already many prosecutions for illegal reentry after deportation, e.g., United States v. Luna-Diaz, 222 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2000), and, even more troubling, for criminal acts committed after illegal entry following deportation, e.g., United States v. Cuevas, 75 F.3d 778, 779 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, nothing in the guidelines addresses--let alone forbids--consideration of the general approach taken by the district court or shows that the Sentencing Commission considered and rejected it. Cf. United States v. Alvarez-Cardenas, 902 F.2d 734, 737 (9th Cir. 1990). In fact, in \"extraordinary\" cases, the guidelines themselves indicate that expense may be considered, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.1 (\"elderly and infirm\"); id. &#167; 5H1.4 (\"extraordinary physical impairment\"); and while hedging the matter, some courts have said that deportability might, in some situations and for varying reasons, be pertinent to a decision to depart.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This juxtaposition of the \"general\" with the \"extraordinary\" is the key to our own problem. Although the Commission did not proscribe the district court's approach (\"[r]ecently, I have been departing downward when . . .\"), it obviously knew that deportable aliens commit crimes, that drug sentences are lengthy and that prisons are expensive.It is thus hard to avoid treating the Commission's failure to provide a discount as equivalent to rejecting a discount as a matter of course. Cf. United States v. Clase-Espinal, 115 F.3d 1054, 1057-59 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 957 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, a deportable alien who commits a crime is still within the \"heartland\" of the guidelines, absent something more. See United States v. Garay, 235 F.3d 230, 233-34 (5th Cir. 2000); United States v. Farouil, 124 F.3d 838, 847 (7th Cir. 1997). If deportability, expense, or some combination of the two justifies a departure, it would have to be based on case-specific findings that made the case unusual. Cf. United States v. Wong, 127 F.3d 725, 728 (8th Cir. 1997). Under Koons v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 96 (1996), the Sentencing Commission's silence might give the district court latitude in the extraordinary case; but the common facts of a long sentence and likely deportation are not by themselves extraordinary. Accord United States v. Tejeda, 146 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam). And that is all that was present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the departure was impermissible, we must remand for resentencing. The district judge did not formally rule on Maldonado's original request for a downward departure based on post-sentence rehabilitation. In the past, this circuit and others have held that a district court may depart downward in resentencing because of extraordinary circumstances reflecting rehabilitation after an earlier (now vacated) sentence for the same crime. See United States v. Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76, 78 (1st Cir. 2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has recently precluded this practice precisely because it does give previously sentenced prisoners a windfall. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.19 (Appendix X, amendment 602, effective November 1, 2000). This is a judgment that the Commission is entitled to make, but we ordinarily employ the guidelines in effect at sentencing only where they are as lenient as those in effect at the time of the offense; when the guidelines have been made more severe in the interim, the version in effect at the time of the crime is normally used, as a matter of policy and to avoid any hint of ex post facto increase in penalty. See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Commission's's more recent change does not persuade us that we erred in our original decision, Bradstreet, 207 F.3d at 78--to allow departures for extraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation--but only that the guidelines have been changed prospectively. Thus, on remand, Maldonado may argue to the district judge that such a departure is justified. It is far from clear that anything urged by Maldonado constituted extraordinary circumstances; but we decline to anticipate the issue since it has not been briefed by either side and may never be presented to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Maldonado says that his original guilty plea was rendered ineffective by defects in the colloquy and that his original guideline sentence was miscomputed. As to the guilty plea, there was no effort before or at either of the sentencings to withdraw the plea, which means that review even on direct appeal is limited to plain error, United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). The gist of the claim of error, which is not well developed, concerns the government's charge that Maldonado possessed heroin that was found in a car in a rolled up T-shirt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the plea colloquy, the government proffered that a police officer had seen Maldonado place the T-shirt in the car and shortly after the police stopped the car, discovered two packages of heroin in the T-shirt. When these facts were adduced at the plea hearing, Maldonado agreed with this summary of evidence, objecting only to the characterization of cocaine later found in his apartment as crack. Although counsel says that the court should have explained the alleged facts further because they were filtered through an interpreter, there is no indication that they were inadequately explained or that Maldonado misunderstood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maldonado also objects to the sentencing calculations on several grounds: to the inclusion of the drugs found in the T-shirt, to treating as crack cocaine some of the drugs later found in his apartment, to the addition of two levels for obstruction of justice for giving a false name to the Probation Department and lying to the court, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, and to the failure to give Maldonado a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, id. &#167; 3E1.1(a). The government's able brief refutes each of these claims in detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is vacated and the matter remanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Namely, that the sentence was unlawful or the court was without jurisdiction to impose it, or \"that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In two cases, somewhat surprisingly, the Second Circuit has required resentencing de novo.

In this instance, Guillermo Maldonado (who says his real name is Miguel Angel Soto) pled guilty, in August 1997, to federal charges of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1)(1994). In March 1998, Maldonado was sentenced to 210 months in prison, the minimum prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines as computed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maldonado's counsel filed a timely notice of appeal but did not pursue the appeal, and this court dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution in July 1998. Maldonado then filed a section 2255 petition, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (Supp. II 1996), alleging ineffectiveness of counsel in allowing the appeal to lapse; and, with the government's agreement, the district court granted the petition and ordered resentencing to permit Maldonado to take a direct appeal. See Bonneau v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580919\"><a href=\"/opinion/580919/dennis-bonneau-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1992). However, the court did not mechanically impose the same sentence, as it could have done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, on the day of the resentencing hearing (March 20, 2000), Maldonado filed a motion seeking a downward departure based on evidence of rehabilitation. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0. Attached were copies of a high school equivalency diploma and certificates evidencing completion of a number of courses Maldonado had taken in 1998 and 1999 while in prison. The government opposed the downward departure, saying that the evidence did not show extraordinary post-sentencing rehabilitation. Maldonado's counsel argued in favor of the departure, adding that a downward departure might also address a concern mentioned by the court at the first sentencing, namely, that taxpayers would be paying for 17 years of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then sentenced Maldonado to 120 months' imprisonment, a downward departure of 90 months, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What troubles me about these cases is that 210 months in federal prison for someone who's going to be deported is a waste of taxpayer money, some $20,000 a year just to keep him in federal prison. Recently, I have been departing downward when the sentence of a deportable felon is in the higher ranges because of the concern I have for the taxpayers paying for someone in a federal prison when that person will be deported. Obviously the defendant has been doing some things to help himself while he's in prison, and that's commendable. But the real reason I'm going to depart downward here is because I don't want the taxpayers to pay for him unnecessarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maldonado now appeals, arguing that the guideline calculation originally adopted by the district court (and effectively reaffirmed on resentencing) was mistaken in several respects, and that Maldonado's guilty plea was defective. The government cross-appeals, arguing that the district court had no authority to consider a downward departure after the resentencing and, in any event, erred in granting the departure on the basis of expense to the taxpayer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the government's appeal. Its first claim is that the district court had no right after granting the section 2255 motion to do anything more than to reimpose the original sentence. The government is correct that reimposing the original sentence without more would remedy the assumed constitutional defect, so the district court could have declined to reexamine the sentence. See United States v. Torres-Otero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771073\"><a href=\"/opinion/771073/united-states-v-luis-angel-torres-otero-aka-el-enamo-aka-little/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2000). The more difficult question is whether, as the government now urges, the district court was forbidden from sentencing the defendant afresh and imposing a different sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government first argues that the plain language of section 2255 requires that the \"error\" to which the petition is addressed must fit in one of the pigeonholes in the first sentence of section 2255.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Perhaps so; but if this is the case, the petition--which the government agreed should be granted--can be taken to claim that the sentence was \"otherwise subject to collateral attack\" because the negligence of counsel thwarted an appeal from the original conviction. Cf. Bonneau, 961 F.2d at 23. On this premise, section 2255 gave the district court power \"to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the statute's language resolves the question whether the district court in such a situation is precluded from calculating the proper sentence anew. The choice resembles that presented where, on direct appeal, a court of appeals sets aside a sentence for some defect in the calculation but neither explicitly nor implicitly limits the district court in the scope of its resentencing. Once again, the district court is not ordinarily required to go beyond correcting the error identified by the court of appeals, e.g., United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569516\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569516/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 791 (D.P.R. 2000), but that does not answer the question whether it may do so if it wishes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In both situations, it is a windfall to a defendant if in resentencing the district court goes beyond correction of the original error and gives the defendant a lower sentence by virtue of a new calculation on an unrelated aspect of the sentence. The tension is between an idiosyncratic benefit for one defendant not available to others and a desire to sentence properly even if this involves giving the lucky defendant a break. Since circumstances vary, one might well think that this is a choice that should be left to the district judge unless Congress or an appellate court directs otherwise. Cf. Torres-Otero, 232 F.2d at 30; United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197336\"><a href=\"/opinion/197336/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></span> (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points out that there are severe restrictions on the district court's right to revisit a sentence previously imposed. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c) (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996) (retroactive application of guideline changes limited); Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 (seven-day limit on correction errors; one-year limit on substantial assistance reductions). This is quite true where a sentence has become final; but we are concerned with a resentencing where the original sentence was invalidated. The issue here is not whether there will be a resentencing--section 2255 permits it, as does a remand, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a)--but rather of its permissible scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government suggests that existing precedent prohibits de novo resentencing, but we read the authorities differently. The more common case--that of a remand for resentencing after an appeal--is handled variously in different circuits. In some, it appears the district judge may go beyond correcting the error but is not required to do so. E.g., United States v. Whren, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739902\"><a href=\"/opinion/739902/united-states-v-michael-a-whren/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 958-60 (D.C. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></span> (1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But it is hard to find an appeals court forbidding de novo resentencing, unless the mandate has affirmatively restricted the remand, e.g., United States v. Parker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729976\"><a href=\"/opinion/729976/united-states-v-clinton-s-parker-also-known-as-spanky/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 528 (7th Cir. 1996); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Criminal procedure, like the rest of life, is filled with situations in which fortuities work to the benefit or disadvantage of a prosecutor or defendant. For example, where a retrial is ordered because of some mistake in the instructions, witnesses may have died in the interval or new ones been discovered, so that the evidence at the new trial is quite different, sometimes favoring the prosecution and sometimes the defense. Section 2255 being silent, it seems to us that the best approach is to retain some flexibility. SeeUnited States v. Handa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744845\"><a href=\"/opinion/744845/united-states-v-howard-handa/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 691 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span> (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court was thus free to consider a downward departure for any legitimate reason, we think that it erred in granting a departure on the grounds given. The court said that it was \"a waste of taxpayer money\" to impose a lengthy prison term on \"someone who's going to be deported.\" The court did not say why, perhaps deeming it to be obvious. It is not; there are several possibilities, and the most likely turn out to depend very much on particular circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One rationale is that deportation is additional punishment added on to the term of imprisonment. If so, one might think that adequate deterrence of drug crimes by aliens, where deportation is quite likely, is provided by threatening aliens with a shorter sentence. The argument assumes, however, that the alien knows before committing the crime that deportation will follow if he is caught and convicted and, further, that he knows that deportation will be highly disadvantageous to him. One might expect these factors to vary from case to case, and the absence of either defeats the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, the district court may have been assuming that deportation would at least protect the public against future crimes by the defendant after his shortened term of imprisonment. But even if the interest of foreign citizens is disregarded, the premise that the deported alien is gone for good is somewhat doubtful. American borders remain fairly porous. There are already many prosecutions for illegal reentry after deportation, e.g., United States v. Luna-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199022\"><a href=\"/opinion/199022/united-states-v-luna-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 2000), and, even more troubling, for criminal acts committed after illegal entry following deportation, e.g., United States v. Cuevas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 779 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strictly speaking, nothing in the guidelines addresses--let alone forbids--consideration of the general approach taken by the district court or shows that the Sentencing Commission considered and rejected it. Cf. United States v. Alvarez-Cardenas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540891\"><a href=\"/opinion/540891/united-states-v-rene-alvarez-cardenas/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 737 (9th Cir. 1990). In fact, in \"extraordinary\" cases, the guidelines themselves indicate that expense may be considered, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5H1.1 (\"elderly and infirm\"); id. &#167; 5H1.4 (\"extraordinary physical impairment\"); and while hedging the matter, some courts have said that deportability might, in some situations and for varying reasons, be pertinent to a decision to depart.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This juxtaposition of the \"general\" with the \"extraordinary\" is the key to our own problem. Although the Commission did not proscribe the district court's approach (\"[r]ecently, I have been departing downward when . . .\"), it obviously knew that deportable aliens commit crimes, that drug sentences are lengthy and that prisons are expensive.It is thus hard to avoid treating the Commission's failure to provide a discount as equivalent to rejecting a discount as a matter of course. Cf. United States v. Clase-Espinal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197424\"><a href=\"/opinion/197424/united-states-v-clase-espinal/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1057-59 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></span> (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, a deportable alien who commits a crime is still within the \"heartland\" of the guidelines, absent something more. See United States v. Garay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"22477\"><a href=\"/opinion/22477/united-states-v-garay/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 233-34 (5th Cir. 2000); United States v. Farouil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746259\"><a href=\"/opinion/746259/united-states-v-honore-fred-farouil-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span>, 847 (7th Cir. 1997). If deportability, expense, or some combination of the two justifies a departure, it would have to be based on case-specific findings that made the case unusual. Cf. United States v. Wong, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747217\"><a href=\"/opinion/747217/united-states-v-bing-wong-also-known-as-randy-shaw-also-known-as-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 728 (8th Cir. 1997). Under Koons v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 96 (1996), the Sentencing Commission's silence might give the district court latitude in the extraordinary case; but the common facts of a long sentence and likely deportation are not by themselves extraordinary. Accord United States v. Tejeda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755148\"><a href=\"/opinion/755148/united-states-v-luis-tejeda-ramon-frias/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 88 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam). And that is all that was present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the departure was impermissible, we must remand for resentencing. The district judge did not formally rule on Maldonado's original request for a downward departure based on post-sentence rehabilitation. In the past, this circuit and others have held that a district court may depart downward in resentencing because of extraordinary circumstances reflecting rehabilitation after an earlier (now vacated) sentence for the same crime. See United States v. Bradstreet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768063\"><a href=\"/opinion/768063/united-states-v-bernard-f-bradstreet/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir. 2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission has recently precluded this practice precisely because it does give previously sentenced prisoners a windfall. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.19 (Appendix X, amendment 602, effective November 1, 2000). This is a judgment that the Commission is entitled to make, but we ordinarily employ the guidelines in effect at sentencing only where they are as lenient as those in effect at the time of the offense; when the guidelines have been made more severe in the interim, the version in effect at the time of the crime is normally used, as a matter of policy and to avoid any hint of ex post facto increase in penalty. See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Commission's's more recent change does not persuade us that we erred in our original decision, Bradstreet, 207 F.3d at 78--to allow departures for extraordinary post-sentence rehabilitation--but only that the guidelines have been changed prospectively. Thus, on remand, Maldonado may argue to the district judge that such a departure is justified. It is far from clear that anything urged by Maldonado constituted extraordinary circumstances; but we decline to anticipate the issue since it has not been briefed by either side and may never be presented to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Maldonado says that his original guilty plea was rendered ineffective by defects in the colloquy and that his original guideline sentence was miscomputed. As to the guilty plea, there was no effort before or at either of the sentencings to withdraw the plea, which means that review even on direct appeal is limited to plain error, United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199077\"><a href=\"/opinion/199077/united-states-v-gandia-maysonet/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 2000). The gist of the claim of error, which is not well developed, concerns the government's charge that Maldonado possessed heroin that was found in a car in a rolled up T-shirt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the plea colloquy, the government proffered that a police officer had seen Maldonado place the T-shirt in the car and shortly after the police stopped the car, discovered two packages of heroin in the T-shirt. When these facts were adduced at the plea hearing, Maldonado agreed with this summary of evidence, objecting only to the characterization of cocaine later found in his apartment as crack. Although counsel says that the court should have explained the alleged facts further because they were filtered through an interpreter, there is no indication that they were inadequately explained or that Maldonado misunderstood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maldonado also objects to the sentencing calculations on several grounds: to the inclusion of the drugs found in the T-shirt, to treating as crack cocaine some of the drugs later found in his apartment, to the addition of two levels for obstruction of justice for giving a false name to the Probation Department and lying to the court, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, and to the failure to give Maldonado a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, id. &#167; 3E1.1(a).
