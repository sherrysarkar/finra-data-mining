Petitioner  Jimmy Batiste  appeals pro  se\r                           \r\n\nfrom a  district court  judgment dismissing  his 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2254  habeas corpus petition.   Two  successive Massachusetts\r\n\nstate court  convictions are  here at  issue.   Both involved\r\n\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon; both resulted in\r\n\nprison  terms.   Petitioner  seeks  to  challenge  his  first\r\n\nconviction.  Yet the district  court determined that, at  the\r\n\ntime the instant petition  was filed, the first sentence  had\r\n\nexpired and petitioner was serving his  second sentence.  The\r\n\ncourt therefore  dismissed the  petition on  the ground  that\r\n\npetitioner  was not \"in  custody\" pursuant to  the conviction\r\n\nand sentence under attack.  See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488,\r                                                          \r\n\n490-91 (1989) (per  curiam) (citing 28 U.S.C.     2241(c)(3),\r\n\n2254(a)).  Petitioner has offered nothing, either below or on\r\n\nappeal, to  call this  conclusion into  question.  We  affirm\r\n\nsubstantially  for the reasons recited by the district court,\r\n\nadding  only the following comments for purposes of emphasis.\r\n\n     Contrary  to petitioner's  assertion, the  two sentences\r\n\ndid not run consecutively.   His second sentence, rather than\r\n\nconstituting a \"from and after\" sentence under Mass. G.L.  c.\r\n\n279    8A, was imposed pursuant to Mass. G.L.  c. 279   27 to\r\n\ntake  effect   \"forthwith  and  notwithstanding\"   the  first\r\n\nsentence.   See Dale v.  Commissioner of Correction, 17 Mass.\r                                                               \r\n\nApp.  Ct. 247, 249  (1983) (noting that  \"forthwith\" sentence\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nimposed under  this provision \"terminate[s]\"  the preexisting\r\n\nsentence); In re Kinney, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 457, 461 n.3 (1977)\r                                   \r\n\n(same).   As consecutive  sentences were  not involved  here,\r\n\npetitioner's reliance  on Garlotte  v. Fordice,  515 U.S.  39\r                                                          \r\n\n(1995), and Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54 (1968), is misplaced.\r                                      \r\n\n     Alternatively, petitioner contends that he is still able\r\n\nto challenge  his  first conviction,  by  means of  a  habeas\r\n\npetition directed  at his  second sentence,  inasmuch as  the\r\n\nfirst conviction  was used  to enhance  the second  sentence.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Young  v. Vaughn, 83 F.3d 72, 75-76, 78 (3d Cir.),\r                                       \r\n\ncert. denied,  117 S.  Ct. 333 (1996);  see also  Maleng, 490\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. at 494 (leaving question open).  We need not address the\r\n\npropriety  of  such  a procedure,  however,  because  no such\r\n\nenhancement has been shown to have occurred here.   Certainly\r\n\nno  formal  sentencing enhancement  mechanism--such  as those\r\n\nappearing in Mass. G.L. c. 265   15A(a); id. c. 279   25--was\r                                                        \r\n\ntriggered;  despite  petitioner's  initial  reliance  on  the\r\n\nformer,  those  provisions  are  inapplicable  by  their very\r\n\nterms.    Petitioner  instead  suggests  that  some  sort  of\r\n\ninformal  enhancement was  undertaken.   Yet  various factors\r\n\nbelie such speculation--such as that the minimum term of  the\r\n\nsecond  sentence (which  called  for  2 1/2  to  10 years  in\r\n\nprison) was the lowest then permitted, and that  the superior\r\n\ncourt  judge  eschewed  a  consecutive  sentence.    Nor  has\r\n\npetitioner provided any  basis for suspecting that  the first\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nconviction influenced the maximum term of the second sentence\r\n\nor the timing of his eventual release.\r\n\n     Petitioner is correct  in observing that, had  the first\r\n\nconviction not occurred,  there would have been  no reason to\r\n\nimpose a \"forthwith\" sentence for his second conviction.  But\r\n\nthis assertion accomplishes  nothing.  It does not mean that,\r\n\nwere  petitioner able to  overturn his first  conviction, the\r\n\nforthwith sentence would  have been invalidly imposed.   More\r\n\nimportant, it does not mean that his second sentence would be\r\n\nreduced as a result.  \r\n\n     For these reasons, which the district court explained at\r\n\ngreater length, petitioner's contention that he satisfied the\r\n\n\"in  custody\"  requirement  proves  mistaken.    His  further\r\n\ncomplaint--that  the  cancellation  of  a  scheduled  hearing\r\n\ndeprived him  of an  adequate opportunity  to articulate  his\r\n\nviews--is belied by the record. \r\n\n     Affirmed.
