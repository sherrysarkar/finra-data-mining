The federal Safe Water\n\nDrinking    Act    (SDWA    or    Act)   authorizes     the   Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (EPA) to prescribe criteria specifying when\n\npublic water systems are \"required\" to install a filtration\n\nsystem.    The Act also provides, however, that courts asked to\n\nissue an injunction enforcing the EPA's filtration standards\n\n\"may enter . . . such judgment as protection of public health\n\nmay require . . . .\"         This appeal requires us to resolve the\n\napparent tension between these two provisions.            Specifically, we\n\nmust   decide     whether   the   SDWA   requires    courts   to    order   the\n\nstatutorily prescribed remedy of filtration for violations of\n\nits    substantive    provisions     and    the   regulations      promulgated\n\nthereunder, or, alternatively, whether courts have the authority\n\nin SDWA cases not to order such remedies in those instances\n\nwhere the equities are found to counsel forbearance.                Suffice it\n\nto say, we are not faced with an imminent threat to the public\n\nhealth in this case; none has been alleged by the United States\n\non appeal.        Rather, this dispute mainly has to do with the\n\noperation of an EPA rule that purports to oblige public water\n\nsystems to install a filtration system if they fail to meet\n\ncertain regulatory standards by a prescribed deadline -- an\n\n                                      -2-\n\fobligation that extends into the future indefinitely, and that\n\ndoes not account for the present and future safety of the\n\nsystem's drinking water.\n\n          Based on our reading of the Act, we find that the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion by declining to order\n\nthat the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) install\n\na filtration system.     We therefore affirm its judgment.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n          The facts surrounding this controversy are laid out in\n\nextensive detail in the district court's two written opinions,\n\nUnited States v. Mass. Water Res. Auth., 48 F. Supp. 2d 65 (D.\n\nMass. 1999) (MWRA I) (holding that district court had equitable\n\ndiscretion not to order filtration remedy for SDWA violation);\n\nUnited States v. Mass. Water Res. Auth., 97 F. Supp. 2d 155 (D.\n\nMass. 2000) (MWRA II) (declining to order filtration remedy\n\nbased on equities of the case), and so we confine our recitation\n\nto those facts bearing specifically upon this appeal.\n\nA.        Regulatory Regime\n\n          In 1974, Congress, legislating in an area that had\n\npreviously received scant attention under federal law, passed\n\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, Pub. L. No. 93-523, 88 Stat. 1660\n\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f to 300j-8 (1991 &\n\nSupp. 2000)), with the basic goal of protecting the purity of\n\nthe   drinking   water   provided    by   the   nation's   public   water\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fsystems.1      To this end, the Act vests authority in the EPA to\n\npromulgate and enforce two types of water-purity standards:\n\nmaximum contaminant levels (MCLs) and treatment techniques.\n\nUnder    the    Act,    the   EPA   is    to     regulate    the   majority   of\n\ncontaminants in drinking water by formulating MCLs -- numerical\n\nstandards that represent the agency's expert determination as to\n\n\"the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on\n\nthe health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin\n\nof safety.\"      Id. § 300g-1(b)(4)(A).              By contrast, the EPA only\n\nmay require the implementation of specific treatment techniques,\n\nconsisting of engineering or design standards, in instances\n\nwhere the Administrator deems it infeasible, for technological\n\nor economic reasons, to ascertain an acceptable concentration\n\nlevel    for    the    contaminant.            Id.   §   300g-1(b)(7)(A).     As\n\noriginally written, the SDWA did not specifically require that\n\nthe EPA develop either MCLs or treatment techniques with respect\n\nto any particular contaminant.                 As a result, between 1974 and\n\n1986 the EPA promulgated regulations concerning only twenty-\n\nthree drinking water contaminants, and of these pollutants, all\n\nbut one had previously been subject to regulations issued by the\n\n\n\n     1Under the SDWA, the term \"public water system\" encompasses\nany \"system for the provision to the public of piped water for\nhuman   consumption   through   pipes   or   other   constructed\nconveyances, if such system has at least fifteen service\nconnections   or   regularly   serves   at   least   twenty-five\nindividuals.\" 42 U.S.C. § 300f(4)(A).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fPublic Health Service.          James Kavanaugh, Comment, To Filter or\n\nNot to Filter: A Discussion and Analysis of the Massachusetts\n\nFiltration Conflict in the Context of the Safe Drinking Water\n\nAct, 26 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 809, 814 (1999).\n\n            In 1986, however, Congress amended the Act so as to\n\nrequire (rather than merely to authorize) the EPA to develop\n\ntreatment    regimes      with       respect      to   scores       of    additional\n\ncontaminants,      and   to    require     that    violations       of    the   Act's\n\nsubstantive provisions and the rules promulgated thereunder be\n\nprosecuted by either the states or the EPA.                      Id. at 814-15.\n\nThese amendments were prompted by the EPA's perceived laxity in\n\nissuing rules under and enforcing the SDWA, see 2 William H.\n\nRodgers, Jr., Environmental Law, § 4.20A, at 152 (Supp. 2001)\n\n(\"In making these changes Congress [was] convinced that it\n\n[could]    control   prosecutorial         options      [under      the    SDWA]   by\n\nreplacing     'mays'          with     'shalls'        in     its        enforcement\n\ninstructions.\"), and by anecdotal evidence suggesting a rise in\n\nbiological and chemical contamination of public water supplies\n\nthroughout the United States.\n\n            Through these amendments, Congress also expressed a\n\ngrowing preference for the employment of specific treatment\n\ntechniques, as opposed to the promulgation of MCLs, to solve the\n\nproblem of contaminated drinking water.                      This policy shift\n\noccurred      as   the    result      of   mounting         scientific      evidence\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdemonstrating      the   efficacy   of    filtration    and    disinfection\n\ntechniques    in     reducing   waterborne      viral        and   bacterial\n\ncontamination.      Id., § 4.20A, at 151.        Reflecting this view,\n\nCongress specifically required that disinfection be employed by\n\nall public water systems to reduce the live quantities of those\n\npathogens, except for systems specifically eligible to receive\n\na variance from the EPA.        42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(8).           Congress\n\nalso changed the SDWA to provide for filtration of public water\n\nsystems.   Id. § 300g-1(b)(7)(C)(i).        But unlike the disinfection\n\nmandate, filtration was not directly imposed upon all public\n\nwater systems; rather, Congress provided that the EPA \"shall\n\npropose and promulgate . . . criteria under which filtration .\n\n. . is required as a treatment technique for public water\n\nsystems supplied by surface water sources.\"             Id.\n\n           On June 29, 1989, pursuant to this statutory command,\n\nthe EPA promulgated the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR or\n\nRule), 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.70-.73.            The SWTR focuses on public\n\nsystems that draw their water in some measure from above-ground\n\nsources.   It seeks to reduce the risk of illness from waterborne\n\npathogens to one yearly occurrence per 10,000 consumers of water\n\nfrom covered public systems.

Specifically, the Rule requires\n\nthat all public systems achieve a three-log (99.9 percent)\n\nreduction in the Giardia lamblia parasite and a four-log (99.99\n\npercent)   reduction   in   viral     contamination,    40   C.F.R.   §\n\n141.70(a); establishes a mandatory disinfection requirement for\n\nall systems, subject to the granting of variances by the EPA,\n\nid. § 141.72; specifies the standards according to which all\n\nfiltration systems must be constructed, id. § 141.73; and sets\n\nout eleven \"avoidance criteria\" for levels of certain waterborne\n\ncontaminants that all public water systems hoping to forego\n\nfiltration must satisfy, id. §§ 141.71(a)-(b).2        On December 16,\n\n1998, in response to an additional amendment to the SDWA passed\n\nin 1996, see 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(2)(C) (Supp. 2000), the EPA\n\npromulgated the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule\n\n(IESWTR), 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.170-.173, which requires that public\n\nwater systems implement treatment techniques with respect to the\n\nprotozoan Cryptosporidium larvum, whose presence in public water\n\nsystems has risen in the past two decades and which has been\n\ndemonstrated to cause significant health problems, particularly\n\nfor those individuals with weakened immune systems.          This Rule,\n\nwhose requirements must be met by public water systems by the\n\n\n\n    2 Of the eleven \"avoidance criteria,\" two relate to source\nwater quality, four concern minimum levels of disinfection, and\nfive involve system-specific watershed protection and operations\nrequirements. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.71(a)-(b).\n\n                                -7-\n\fend   of    2001,   requires     a    two-log       (99    percent)    reduction     in\n\nCryptosporidium by all water systems that employ filtration, and\n\nan extension of watershed controls to cover Cryptosporidium for\n\nall unfiltered water systems.             Id. § 141.173(b).\n\n              The   filtration       mandate       in   the   SWTR    is   written   in\n\nunequivocal -- and, in the context of federal regulations,\n\nunusually broad -- terms.               Tracking the pertinent deadlines\n\nembodied in the Act, the Rule requires that public water systems\n\nnot meeting all of the avoidance criteria by December 30, 1991,\n\n\"must provide treatment consisting of both disinfection . . .\n\nand filtration\" by June 29, 1993, or, if the violation occurs\n\nafter December 30, 1991, within eighteen months of the date that\n\nthe violation has been established.                       Id. § 141.73 (emphasis\n\nadded).       Moreover, filtration decisions under the Rule are\n\nfinal, in that the Rule provides no mechanism by which a public\n\nwater      system   may   petition     for     a    reopening    of    a   filtration\n\ndetermination.       See id.     The upshot of this regulatory scheme is\n\nthat once a public water system has been found to have violated\n\none of the avoidance criteria, it forever remains subject to an\n\nenforcement suit requesting the installation of a filtration\n\nsystem.3      This result obtains no matter how safe the system's\n\n\n      3\n     The SDWA contains no statute of limitations, and \"an action\non behalf of the United States in its governmental capacity . .\n. is subject to no time limitation, in the absence of\ncongressional enactment clearly imposing it.\" E.I. Dupont de\nNemours & Co. v. Davis, 264 U.S. 456, 462 (1924); cf. United\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdrinking water is following the violation, and regardless of how\n\ndiligent the water system is in remedying the problems that\n\ncaused the avoidance-criteria failures in the first place.\n\n             Despite the mandatory nature of the Rule regarding the\n\nneed for filtration, the EPA cannot compel a violator to comply\n\nwith its provisions merely by issuing its own enforcement order.4\n\nRather, the agency must bring suit in federal district court to\n\nrequest that a remedy provided for elsewhere in the Act, such as\n\nthe construction of a filtration facility, be ordered.                See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 300g-3(b) (\"The [EPA] Administrator may bring a civil\n\naction   .    .   .     to    require   compliance   with   any   applicable\n\nrequirement . . . .\").            And the Act provides that in deciding\n\nsuch suits, courts \"may enter . . . such judgment as protection\n\nof public health may require, taking into consideration the time\n\nnecessary to comply and the availability of alternative water\n\nsupplies.\"        Id.        The language of this judicial-enforcement\n\n\n\n\nStates v. Telluride Co., 146 F.3d 1241 (10th Cir. 1998)\n(refusing to apply general five-year statute of limitations for\ncivil actions by the United States to enforcement suits under\nClean Water Act because statute of limitations does not cover\nclaims for equitable relief).\n     4\n     Without resort to judicial process, however, the EPA may\nimpose a civil penalty not exceeding $25,000 per day for\nviolations of administrative orders.      42 U.S.C. § 300g-\n3(g)(3)(A).\n\n                                        -9-\n\fprovision has remained untouched, in pertinent part, since the\n\nAct's original passage in 1974.5\n\n               As a practical matter, much of the burden of enforcing\n\nthe     SDWA    falls    on    the    shoulders         of   state    environmental\n\nauthorities,        such       as     the     Massachusetts          Department    of\n\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP).                    This is so because, under the\n\nAct, state agencies that adopt drinking water regulations deemed\n\nby the EPA to be at least as stringent as its own may assume\n\nprimary responsibility for identifying violations of the EPA's\n\nregulations and for enforcing the filtration requirement against\n\nthe violators.       Id. § 300g-2(a).              The Act provides that within\n\nthirty months of the promulgation of the SWTR, those state\n\nagencies that participate in SDWA enforcement must identify the\n\nwater     systems       that    are     required        to   install     filtration\n\nfacilities.6        Id.    §    300g-1(b)(7)(C)(iii).                Although   state\n\n\n      5\n      In 1986, Congress amended § 300g-3(b) by increasing the\nmaximum available civil penalties under the Act from $5,000 per\nday to $25,000 per day, and by eliminating the requirement that\nan SDWA violation must be \"willful\" in order to be the basis for\ncivil penalties.   And in 1996, Congress substituted the term\n\"any applicable requirement\" for \"a national primary drinking\nwater regulation\" to reflect the semantic changes effected by\nthe 1986 amendments to the Act.\n      6\n     In 1996 Congress once again amended the SDWA to permit the\nEPA to excuse from filtration certain public water systems that\ndraw water from uninhabited, undeveloped watersheds over which\nthe public water system has \"consolidated\" (i.e., sole)\nownership of the surrounding lands.         42 U.S.C. § 300g-\n1(b)(7)(C)(v).   The MWRA, however, does not qualify to take\nadvantage of the exception because it does not have consolidated\nownership of the land surrounding its reservoirs.\n\n                                            -10-\n\fauthorities are afforded the first opportunity under this system\n\nto make formal determinations regarding the need for filtration,\n\nthe EPA must bring its own enforcement action in the absence of\n\nsuch a state determination, provided the state agency and the\n\nviolating water system are given thirty days' notice and an\n\nopportunity      for     consultation       with    the     EPA.        Id.    §   300g-\n\n3(a)(1)(B).\n\n              On June 28, 1993, after the DEP adopted drinking water\n\nregulations requiring filtration whenever a public water system\n\nfails to satisfy the SWTR's avoidance criteria, see Mass. Regs.\n\nCode   tit.    310,    §§     22.20A(2),    (4),     the    EPA    granted       primary\n\nenforcement      responsibility         to     the     DEP.             Public     Water\n\nSupervision: Program Revision for Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n58 Fed. Reg. 34,583 (June 28, 1993).\n\nB.            The MWRA\n\n              Established in 1984, the MWRA owns and operates the\n\npublic water system that provides most of the drinking water for\n\nthe city of Boston and surrounding communities.                               Its water\n\nsystem serves approximately two million customers in over forty\n\nMassachusetts         cities    and    towns.         The     MWRA       has     primary\n\nresponsibility for treating its drinking water and transporting\n\nthat water from its reservoirs to the distribution systems of\n\nthe local communities it serves.                   In providing water to its\n\ncustomers,      the    MWRA    works   in    tandem    with       the    Metropolitan\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fDistrict    Commission    (MDC),   an   organization      responsible   for\n\nmonitoring the quality of water in the MWRA system and managing\n\nthe watersheds surrounding the principal sources of the MWRA's\n\nwater supply.7\n\n           The MWRA's water system, which was originally designed\n\nby the Massachusetts Board of Health in the late nineteenth\n\ncentury, consists of three large reservoirs connected by a\n\nnetwork of 265 miles of water mains and 130 miles of aqueducts.\n\nFeeding into the system are two above-ground bodies of water in\n\ncentral Massachusetts, the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs,\n\nwhich collectively contain approximately 475 billion gallons of\n\nwater.     The Quabbin Reservoir, by far the larger of the two\n\nbodies of water, empties into the Wachusett Reservoir.             The MWRA\n\ndraws water from the eastern edge of the Wachusett Reservoir at\n\nthe Cosgrove Intake, and transports the water through a series\n\nof   tunnels   and    aqueducts    until   it   reaches    the    Norumbega\n\nReservoir,     an     intermediate      storage    basin     in     Weston,\n\nMassachusetts.       From there the water travels in all directions,\n\nthrough a complex, 6,700-mile web of additional tunnels, pipes,\n\n\n\n     7Even though the MDC was named as a defendant in this\nlawsuit by virtue of its ownership and control of many of the\nwater-treatment facilities in question, the United States did\nnot allege in the district court, nor does it allege before this\ncourt, that the MDC violated any laws with respect to this\ncontroversy.   We therefore refer to the appellees throughout\nthis opinion as \"the MWRA,\" except where it is necessary to\ndistinguish between the two entities.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fand aqueducts, ultimately connecting to the local distribution\n\ncenters in the various communities that the MWRA serves.\n\n           For    some   time,     the   MWRA    has   employed     two    basic\n\ntechniques to treat its drinking water: disinfection, used to\n\nkill live contaminants, and corrosion control, used to minimize\n\nthe leaching of metals (such as lead) into the water from the\n\nantiquated pipes through which the water travels before reaching\n\nthe taps of consumers.        The water supply undergoes disinfection\n\nas it enters the distribution system through the Cosgrove Intake\n\nand again as it departs the primary distribution system at the\n\nNorumbega Reservoir.         In the mid-1990s, the MWRA replaced the\n\nchloramine disinfection treatment it used at the Cosgrove Intake\n\nwith an alternative disinfection treatment of ozonation, which\n\nconsists   of    the   injection    of   ozone    bubbles   into    the    water\n\nsupply.8   According to the MWRA, ozonation kills a wider range\n\nof pathogens than do the traditional disinfection techniques,\n\nand the process        provides the added benefit of improving the\n\ntaste    and    coloration    of    treated      water.     While    the     EPA\n\nacknowledges the general effectiveness of ozonation, the agency\n\nhas taken the position that it is not, by itself, an effective\n\nsubstitute for filtration.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n     The MWRA continues to use chloramine disinfection at the\nNorumbega Reservoir site.\n\n                                     -13-\n\f         In the months following the EPA's formulation of the\n\nSWTR, the MWRA determined that it would not be able to fulfill\n\nall of the avoidance criteria by the December 30, 1991 deadline.\n\nIn particular, the MWRA concluded that occasional spikes in\n\nfecal coliform bacteria that had been measured in the Wachusett\n\nReservoir in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a phenomenon later\n\nattributed to the seasonal roosting habits of gulls, could not\n\nbe controlled by that date.   Consequently, the MWRA did not seek\n\na formal avoidance determination from the DEP.     On January 24,\n\n1992, the DEP notified the MWRA that, according to the terms of\n\nthe SDWA, it would be required to install a filtration system by\n\nJune 30, 1993.\n\n         By early 1993, after it became clear that the MWRA\n\ncould not design and install a filtration system before June\n\n1993, the MWRA, the MDC, and the DEP entered into negotiations\n\non an administrative consent order (ACO) to govern the MWRA's\n\ncompliance with the SWTR.     Rather than requiring the immediate\n\ninstallation of a filtration system, the ACO established a\n\n\"dual-track\" approach for compliance.     Under this scheme, the\n\nMWRA was permitted in the short term to employ a treatment\n\nregime consisting of disinfection, ozonation, and covered water\n\nstorage facilities, while at the same time embarking upon an\n\naggressive   watershed   protection   plan   for   the   Wachusett\n\nReservoir.   The MWRA also was expected to continue its campaign\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fof \"gull harassment,\" a policy meant to scare away birds so as\n\nto prevent them from defecating in the reservoir.                 If the MWRA\n\nproperly   pursued    these    endeavors,     it    would    be    given   the\n\nopportunity under the ACO to petition, on or before August 3,\n\n1998, for a \"reopener\" establishing that the avoidance criteria\n\nhad been met and that filtration was not required.9               At the same\n\ntime as it pursued the watershed protection strategy, however,\n\nthe MWRA also was obligated to plan the siting and design of the\n\nfiltration facility that it would be required to install in the\n\nevent that it could not establish its eligibility for filtration\n\navoidance by August 1998.      The MWRA, the MDC, and the DEP signed\n\nthe ACO on June 11, 1993.\n\n           Given that the ACO essentially excused the MWRA from\n\ncomplying with a key component of the SWTR, it seems rather\n\nsurprising at first blush that the EPA, while aware of the\n\nnegotiations   over    the    ACO,    did   not    attempt   to    block   its\n\nimplementation.       In fact, despite having written the Rule's\n\nfiltration requirement in mandatory terms (and despite the Act's\n\nmandate that there be filtration when the Rule's standards were\n\nnot met), the EPA's actual practice has been to enforce the\n\nfiltration mandate with less than the unswerving rigor that the\n\nstatutory and regulatory language would seem to require.                   For\n\n\n    9A subsequent amendment to the ACO pushed back to October\n31, 1998, the MWRA's target date for demonstrating compliance\nwith the avoidance criteria.\n\n                                     -15-\n\finstance, notwithstanding the filtration command in the SWTR, in\n\n1992 the EPA issued an internal guidance memorandum that gave\n\nstate enforcement authorities the discretion to postpone final\n\nfiltration determinations if a water system is able to prove\n\nthat    it     could    later   meet     the   avoidance       criteria      through\n\nintermediate      measures.       And     while    the   EPA    never      expressly\n\nacquiesced       in    the   provision    in     the   ACO    that    created    the\n\npotential for the MWRA to eventually avoid filtration (in fact,\n\nit stated in a letter to the parties to the ACO that it reserved\n\nthe right to bring an enforcement action at a later date), it\n\ndid promise the DEP and the MWRA that it would abstain, at least\n\nin the short term, from filing its own enforcement suit once the\n\nACO was executed.\n\n             Consistent with this approach, the EPA worked closely\n\nwith the MWRA in its implementation of both compliance tracks in\n\nthe    three    years     following     the    signing   of     the   ACO.      This\n\nassistance included the agency's advice on steps to be taken by\n\nthe MWRA to satisfy the avoidance criteria.                    In November 1996,\n\nJohn DeVillars, the EPA Regional Administrator, wrote a letter\n\nto the MWRA in which he generally commended the MWRA on its\n\nprogress but cautioned that \"in order to avoid filtration, more\n\nstill needs to be done\"         (emphasis added).          At least through the\n\nend of 1996, this statement epitomized the EPA's deliberately\n\nambiguous       posture      vis-à-vis     the    MWRA's       need   to     install\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\ffiltration: the agency generally supported the MWRA's efforts to\n\nachieve compliance with the avoidance criteria by alternative\n\nmeans, even as it held out the threat of suing to require\n\nfiltration if it later found itself unsatisfied with the MWRA's\n\nperformance.\n\n          In early 1997, after the MWRA acknowledged that it\n\ncould not meet several interim deadlines contained in the ACO,\n\nthe EPA began to lose patience, and the working relationship\n\nbetween the MWRA and the EPA quickly deteriorated.           In two\n\nletters to the MWRA dated January 8, 1997, and May 15, 1997, the\n\nEPA Regional Administrator expressed \"extreme concern\" for the\n\nMWRA's failure to produce adequate design plans for a Wachusett\n\nReservoir filtration facility, and reminded the MWRA that it was\n\nstill in technical violation of the SWTR for its failure to\n\ninstall a filtration system back in 1993.     The EPA's displeasure\n\nwith the MWRA's approach was only exacerbated by a September 18,\n\n1997 agreement between the DEP and the MWRA that amended the ACO\n\nto delay the completion of the design of the filtration plant\n\nuntil January 31, 2002.\n\n          On October 1, 1997, over a year before the MWRA was to\n\nhave   submitted   its    petition    to   reopen   the   filtration\n\ndetermination, the MWRA and the MDC filed with the DEP an early\n\n\"Request for Review and Revision of DEP Determination that\n\nFiltration is Required for Wachusett Reservoir.\"      This document\n\n\n                               -17-\n\frequested that the MWRA be excused from further pursuing the\n\nfiltration track by the end of 1997 if it could establish\n\nprospective compliance with the SWTR's avoidance criteria.              The\n\nEPA, which was not consulted by the MWRA prior to the filing of\n\nthis request, responded critically upon learning of it.               In a\n\nDecember 9, 1997 letter to the MWRA, the MDC, and the DEP, the\n\nEPA Regional Administrator revealed that he had asked the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice to bring an SDWA enforcement action to\n\nrequire \"filtration . . . [and] measures to enhance protection\n\nof the Wachusett reservoirs . . . according to a clear, binding\n\nand expeditious schedule.\"       Such legal action was necessary, in\n\nhis   opinion,   because   the   MWRA   \"did   not   meet   the   avoidance\n\ncriteria in 1991, has not met them to this day, and will not\n\nmeet them by next summer, either.\"\n\n           Three days after the EPA Regional Administrator sent\n\nthis letter, the DEP issued a noncommittal response to the\n\nMWRA's request to forego filtration.           While refusing to allow\n\nwork on the filtration track to be terminated in light of the\n\nMWRA's acknowledgment that it could not meet the avoidance\n\ncriteria regarding Giardia, viruses, and total coliform counts\n\nby the end of 1997, the DEP did grant the MWRA until October 31,\n\n1998, or nearly three months later than allowed by the ACO, to\n\nreapply for a filtration waiver.        Accepting that invitation, the\n\nMWRA submitted a follow-up request to the DEP on October 30,\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f1998.    In that request, the MWRA sought permission to treat its\n\nwater using ozonation and chloramine disinfection only.                          The\n\nMWRA also proposed that the savings realized from not installing\n\na filtration facility be spent on a pipeline replacement plan\n\nand stepped-up monitoring program.                On November 13, 1998, the\n\nDEP formally approved the request, finding that the MWRA had\n\ncome into compliance with all of the SWTR's avoidance criteria\n\nand concluding that the MWRA had developed satisfactory plans\n\nfor improving the quality of its water.                      The DEP's action\n\neffectively excused the MWRA from having to install a filtration\n\nsystem for the time being; however, the approval made clear that\n\nany future violation of any of the avoidance criteria would\n\nresult in revocation of the waiver and reimposition of the\n\nfiltration requirement.\n\nC.          The Proceedings Below\n\n            Meanwhile, on February 12, 1998, the United States had\n\nfiled the instant SDWA lawsuit on behalf of the EPA.                             The\n\nlawsuit sought an injunction ordering the MWRA to comply with\n\nthe filtration requirement set out in the Act and the Rule.                      The\n\ndistrict     court,        while    permitting    some     initial      discovery,\n\neffectively        stayed     the    case   for   nearly     a   full     year    in\n\nanticipation of the DEP's disposition of the MWRA's filtration-\n\nwaiver request.        Once the DEP approved the request, the United\n\nStates     moved     for     summary    judgment,    citing      uncontradicted\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fevidence of the MWRA's past failures to meet the avoidance\n\ncriteria and its continued refusal to install a filtration\n\nsystem.          Its position was augmented by the MWRA's acknowledgment\n\nthat,       in    January   1999,    it   had    failed   to   meet   one    of   the\n\navoidance criteria at the Wachusett Reservoir -- in this case,\n\nthe standard relating to fecal coliform concentration.10                     The EPA\n\nsubsequently asked the DEP to revoke the MWRA's filtration\n\nwaiver based on this violation, but the DEP declined to do so.\n\nSince the January 1999 avoidance-criteria failure, the MWRA's\n\nrecord of providing safe drinking water has been unblemished.\n\n                 On May 3, 1999, the district court ruled on the United\n\nStates's motion for summary judgment.                 While noting the DEP's\n\nNovember 1998 finding that the MWRA had come into compliance\n\nwith     all       the   avoidance    criteria      and   opining     that    \"this\n\nconclusion might have been conclusive of the litigation,\" the\n\ncourt found that the           MWRA's January 1999 violation \"entitles\n\nthe EPA to a judicial declaration that the MWRA is liable under\n\n\n\n       10\n      The MWRA asserts that the January 1999 fecal coliform\nfailure was illusory, in that the relevant water samples barely\nmissed meeting the acceptable levels of bacterial colonies and\nthat the testing during that period was conducted at tolerance\nlevels and frequencies far more rigorous than those required by\nthe SWTR and other EPA guidelines. The district court noted,\nhowever, that the MWRA failed to raise the testing-technique\nissue in opposition to the United States's motion for partial\nsummary judgment.      MWRA II, 97 F. Supp. 2d at 176.\nConsequently, it found the testing method used by the MWRA in\nJanuary 1999 to be \"a fact of no legal significance.\" Id. at\n189.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fthe SDWA for injunctive relief and civil penalties.\"               MWRA I, 48\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 70.\n\n           The district court went on to hold, however, that,\n\nbased on the principle that the discretion of courts to fashion\n\nequitable remedies as appropriate may only be circumvented by a\n\n\"clear legislative command,\" the court retained the discretion\n\nto determine the type of relief that should be granted.                  Id. at\n\n71 (citing Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 313\n\n(1982)).        While   acknowledging        a   statement   in    the    Act's\n\nlegislative history to the effect that courts shall not use\n\n\"traditional balancing principles used by equity courts\" in\n\nruling on SDWA suits, id. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 93-1185 (1974),\n\nreprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6454, 6476), the court determined\n\nthat the judicial-enforcement provision of the Act contained\n\nlanguage \"descriptive of the traditional powers of a court of\n\nchancery\" and that the statute did not \"impos[e] the same narrow\n\nmandate\" on courts to enforce violations of its substantive\n\nprovisions that it placed on the EPA to promulgate rules.                   Id.\n\nat 71.     In the final analysis, the court discerned no clear\n\ncommand    that     courts     \"limit       [themselves]     to    mechanical\n\nenforcement of EPA compliance orders,\" id., although it did find\n\na \"presumption expressed by Congress in the SDWA that filtration\n\nwill   almost    always   be   the   preferred      remedy   for   a[n]    SWTR\n\nviolation.\"     Id. at 72.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            Having   determined       that    it   possessed    the    equitable\n\ndiscretion to withhold the filtration remedy, the district court\n\nordered a bench trial to determine whether, in fact, it was\n\nappropriate to exercise such discretion with respect to the\n\nMWRA.   As the court saw it, the issue to be tried was whether\n\n\"the MWRA's alternative strategy of ozonation, chlorination, and\n\npipe replacement [will] better serve Congress's objective of\n\nproviding 'maximum feasible protection of the public health'\n\nthan will the EPA's insistence on filtration.\"                  Id.\n\n            Between December 1999 and February 2000, the district\n\ncourt presided over a twenty-four day bench trial in which it\n\nheard from twenty-three witnesses and entered 524 exhibits into\n\nevidence.     At trial, the United States sought to establish that\n\nfiltration combined with disinfection is much more effective\n\nagainst highly treatment-resistant pathogens, such as Giardia\n\nand Cryptosporidium, than the ozonation alternative favored by\n\nthe   MWRA.     It   also    sought    to    prove      that   the    process    of\n\nozonation, while generally effective in combating most forms of\n\nlive waterborne pathogens, may produce microbes that nourish\n\ncertain types of bacteria, thereby creating the potential for\n\n\"regrowth\" of certain pathogens in the water supply.                     For its\n\npart,   the   MWRA   noted    that    it     was   in   compliance      with    the\n\navoidance criteria at the time of trial, thereby removing the\n\nurgency of installing a filtration system.               It further attempted\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fto     demonstrate     that   its    proposed     approach     of    pipeline\n\nrehabilitation, watershed protection, and ozone and chloramine\n\ndisinfection treatments would provide more comprehensive water\n\npurification than filtration alone.\n\n              The district court issued its findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law on May 5, 2000, holding, for the first time,\n\nthat the MWRA would not be required to install a filtration\n\nsystem under present circumstances.             MWRA II, 97 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n188.       While finding that filtration combined with disinfection\n\nwas    a    superior   treatment    technique    to   the   MWRA's   proposed\n\n\"ozonation-only\" strategy, the court determined that, given the\n\nlack of an actual health issue in light of the MWRA's compliance\n\nwith the avoidance criteria at the time of trial, \"[a]ny risk to\n\npublic health entailed by selection of the 'ozone-only' option\n\nis within acceptable levels.\" Id.           In making this determination,\n\nthe court relied heavily on studies introduced at trial by the\n\nMWRA indicating that the ozonation technique could successfully\n\nkeep the concentrations of pathogens in the water supply at or\n\nbelow      the   safety   levels    specified    by   the   SWTR     avoidance\n\ncriteria.        Id.   It further found that, while the threat of\n\nbacterial \"regrowth\" posed by ozonation was real, that threat\n\ncould more effectively be addressed through pipe rehabilitation,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fflushing, and corrosion control than through filtration.11                       Id.\n\nMoreover, the court, noting the tremendous sums that the MWRA\n\nwas spending and had pledged to spend in subsequent years on\n\nhealth-related       system    improvements, 12           accepted    the     MWRA's\n\nargument that the installation of a $180 million filtration\n\nsystem would severely complicate the MWRA's efforts to take on\n\nother water purification projects, such as pipe replacement,\n\nthat    would   be   needed    with    or     without      the     presence    of   a\n\nfiltration      system.       Id.      As     to    the    issue     of   watershed\n\nprotection, the court agreed with the MWRA that the plan of\n\nacquiring lands close to the Wachusett Reservoir had proven\n\nsuccessful in creating an effective barrier against manmade\n\ncontamination, and that the implementation of a filtration plan\n\nwould       reduce   popular        support        for     maintaining        strict\n\nenvironmental protection of the protected areas.                   Id. at 187-88.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      The district court noted that the possibility of\n\"regrowth,\"   without actual evidence of heightened levels of\nbacteria, was not     a component of the SWTR's filtration-\navoidance criteria. Id. at 189.\n       12\n      In particular, the court found that the MWRA had budgeted\napproximately $1.7 billion for four major (and needed) capital\nimprovement projects: a new water supply tunnel; a covered-\nstorage facility for treated water; a new disinfection facility;\nand an ongoing water-main rehabilitation project. Id. at 169.\nAdditionally, the district court found that the MWRA had\ninstituted a successful grant program in which it was providing\n$25 million per year to its constituent cities and towns to\nimprove the safety of their local water delivery systems. Id.\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\f          In sum, the district court found the MWRA's proposed\n\ntreatment plan to be a \"sound alternative to . . . filtration\n\nwhen competing demands for limited resources and the level of\n\nrisk from all potential threats to the safety of MWRA water are\n\nconsidered.\"     Id. at 189.   The court determined that, in light\n\nof the ACO, only one avoidance criteria violation remained\n\nrelevant -- the fecal coliform violation in January 1999 -- and\n\nthat, based on that single SWTR violation and the myriad efforts\n\nundertaken by the MWRA to improve the quality of its water, the\n\nUnited States had not demonstrated that reallocating funds from\n\nthe   MWRA's    planned   health-related   system   improvements   to\n\nfiltration was warranted.      Id.   Consequently, the court denied\n\nthe United States's request for injunctive relief.          Id.    It\n\nretained jurisdiction, however, to facilitate reexamination of\n\nthe decision in the event that future circumstances warrant it.\n\nId.   This appeal followed.\n\n               II. Equitable Discretion under the SDWA\n\n          On appeal, the United States does not challenge any of\n\nthe district court's factual findings, including the court's\n\ndetermination that the MWRA's \"ozonation-only\" approach is an\n\nacceptable alternative to filtration.         Nor does the United\n\nStates assert that the district court        abused its equitable\n\ndiscretion by declining to order filtration in light of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fMWRA's history of avoidance-criteria noncompliance.13                            Instead,\n\nits appeal essentially is confined to one argument: that under\n\nthe SDWA, courts have no discretion to withhold indefinitely a\n\nprovided-for     remedy,       such       as    filtration,        if     it   has   been\n\ndemonstrated     that    a     public          water    system      has    violated     a\n\nsubstantive     requirement         of    the    Act.        The    district     court's\n\ndetermination regarding the scope of its equitable discretion\n\npresents    a   pure     issue       of    law,        and   so     we    review     that\n\ndetermination de novo.           Fergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            In this case, the United States seeks to bring the MWRA\n\ninto compliance with the filtration requirement by resort to the\n\nSDWA's statutory injunction provision, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b).\n\nThe role a court plays in deciding whether to grant a statutory\n\ninjunction is different than the one it plays when it weighs the\n\nequitable    claims     of    two    private      parties      in    a    suit    seeking\n\ninjunctive relief.           Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 441\n\n\n\n    13The United States does suggest that the district court\nerred by discounting the MWRA's pre-1999 avoidance-criteria\nviolations in its decision not to order filtration.      It also\ncontends that it has not been estopped from pointing out the\nMWRA's pre-1999 violations by its failure to block the ACO.\nHowever, as the United States states in its brief, under its\ntheory of the case -- that a district court does not have the\ndiscretion to excuse SWTR violations -- the additional\nviolations are essentially irrelevant, as even one failure to\nmeet the avoidance criteria after the December 30, 1991 deadline\ncreates an ongoing violation that triggers the filtration\nobligation under the Rule.\n\n                                          -26-\n\f(1944).   This is so because a court asked to order a statutory\n\ninjunction     must   reconcile     two    sets    of    competing      concerns.\n\nCourts asked to issue an injunction must ordinarily assume the\n\nrole of a court of chancery -- a role that requires them to\n\ndetermine whether the equities of the case favor, and whether\n\nthe   public    interest    would    be    served       by,   the   granting   of\n\ninjunctive     relief.      See   United    States       v.   Oakland    Cannabis\n\nBuyers' Coop., ___ U.S. ___, 121 S. Ct. 1711, 1720 (2001) (\"In\n\nexercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay\n\nparticular regard for the public consequences in employing the\n\nextraordinary remedy of injunction.\") (quoting Romero-Barcelo,\n\n456 U.S. at 312).        But in the context of statutory injunctions,\n\nthe court's freedom to make an independent assessment of the\n\nequities and the public interest is circumscribed to the extent\n\nthat Congress has already made such assessments with respect to\n\nthe type of case before the court.              Burlington N. R.R. v. Bair,\n\n957 F.2d 599, 601-02 (8th Cir. 1992) (citing Atchison, Topeka &\n\nSanta Fe Ry. v. Lennen, 640 F.2d 255, 259 (10th Cir. 1981) (per\n\ncuriam)); cf. Clark v. Smith, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 195, 203 (1839)\n\n(finding \"inherent in the Courts of Equity a jurisdiction to .\n\n. . give effect to the policy of the legislature\").\n\n          In its decisions addressing this complicated area of\n\nlaw, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly that the retention of\n\na   court's    discretion    to   shape    an    injunction     authorized     by\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fstatute to the equities of the case -- or not to issue an\n\ninjunction    at       all   --   is   to    be   presumed,    but     that   this\n\npresumption may be overcome by a proper showing of congressional\n\nintent.     \"The grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a\n\nstatute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and\n\nall circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is\n\nnot mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every\n\nviolation of law.\"           Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. at 313; see also\n\nid.   at    322    (Stevens,       J.,      dissenting)     (\"Unless    Congress\n\nspecifically commands a particular form of relief, the question\n\nof remedy remains subject to a court's equitable discretion.\");\n\nTown of Huntington v. Marsh, 884 F.2d 648, 651 (2d Cir. 1989)\n\n(\"[I]n the area of environmental statutes, the Supreme Court has\n\nexplicitly rejected the notion that an injunction follows as a\n\nmatter of course upon a finding of a statutory violation.\").\n\nAnd while Congress certainly may intervene and guide or control\n\nthe exercise of the courts' discretion, or even extinguish it\n\nentirely, courts measuring the quantum of equitable discretion\n\npreserved    in    a    statute    are    \"not    lightly   [to]     assume   that\n\nCongress has intended to depart from established principles.\"\n\nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. at 313 (citing Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321\n\nU.S. 321, 329 (1944)).            This default rule can be justified, at\n\nleast in part, by the fact that \"[w]hen Congress entrusts to an\n\nequity court the enforcement of prohibitions contained in a\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fregulatory enactment, it must be taken to have acted cognizant\n\nof the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in\n\nlight of the statutory purposes.\"                Mitchell v. Robert DeMario\n\nJewelry, Inc., 361 U.S. 288, 291-92 (1960).                   In this vein, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that if Congress wishes to circumscribe\n\nthese equitable powers, it must do so with clarity: \"Unless a\n\nstatute in so many words, or by a                 necessary and inescapable\n\ninference, restricts the court's jurisdiction in equity, the\n\nfull   scope     of    that       jurisdiction    is    to   be    recognized      and\n\napplied.\"        Porter v.        Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398\n\n(1946) (emphasis added).\n\n            In    order      to    ascertain     whether     Congress      meant    to\n\nconstrain    the      equitable      discretion    afforded       courts    in   SDWA\n\ncases, our examination begins -- and, for the most part, ends --\n\nwith the SDWA itself.              This is so because the discretion that\n\ninheres in a statutory injunction provision is, by definition,\n\na product of the statute, and accordingly must be cabined by the\n\npurposes for which the statute was created.                       United States v.\n\nMonsanto,    491      U.S.    600,    613   (1989).       Where,    as   here,     the\n\nstatutory injunction provision does not explicitly delimit the\n\ncourt's equitable authority, it is necessary to \"look to the\n\n[statute's] remedial framework as a whole.\"                  Williams v. Jones,\n\n11 F.3d 247, 256 (1st Cir. 1993).                      This task requires that\n\ncourts not only consider the \"language, history and structure\"\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fof the legislation, TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 174 (1978), but\n\nalso the \"underlying substantive policy\" that the statutory\n\nprocedures are designed to further, Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village\n\nof Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 544 (1987).               Under this analysis, the\n\nlanguage     and    structure   of   the   Rule     regarding   the    need    for\n\nfiltration     reflect    policy     judgments      made   by   the    EPA,    not\n\nCongress, and as such, are not relevant indicia of legislative\n\nintent.    Cf. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\n467   U.S.    837,    842-43    &    n.9   (1984)    (directing       courts    to\n\ndistinguish between agency policy and congressional intent and\n\nto reject administrative constructions that do not give effect\n\nto the intent of Congress).\n\n             The United States does not quibble with this analytical\n\nframework.         Rather, it argues that the judicial-enforcement\n\nprovision of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b), when read along\n\nwith the rest of the Act, admits of only one appropriate outcome\n\nin cases where a water system fails an avoidance criterion: the\n\ndelinquent water system must be directed to install a filtration\n\nsystem.    Accordingly, in the United States's view, the SDWA does\n\ncreate a \"necessary and inescapable inference\" that courts may\n\nnot decline to order filtration whenever a violation of the Act\n\nor the rules promulgated thereunder has been established.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\f            In reaching this conclusion, the United States focuses\n\non the SDWA's judicial-enforcement provision, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-\n\n3(b), which states, in relevant part:\n\n            The [EPA] Administrator may bring a civil\n            action in the appropriate United States\n            district court to require compliance with\n            any applicable requirement [of the Act] . .\n            . . The court may enter, in an action\n            brought under this subsection, such judgment\n            as protection of public health may require,\n            taking into consideration the time necessary\n            to   comply   and    the   availability   of\n            alternative water supplies . . . .\n\n            As the United States sees it, the key words in this\n\npassage are \"compliance\" and \"comply.\"          Based on their presence,\n\nas   well   as    on   the    Act's   command    that   the   EPA    delimit\n\ncircumstances under which filtration is \"required,\" id. § 300g-\n\n1(b)(7)(C)(i), the United States contends that, while § 300g-\n\n3(b) may not have abrogated courts' equitable powers to specify\n\nwhen (\"the time necessary to comply\") and how (\"the availability\n\nof alternative water supplies\") a violator is to comply with the\n\nfiltration requirement, the provision does deprive courts of the\n\nauthority    to   allow      SDWA   violators   to   remain   in    permanent\n\nnoncompliance.     In this respect, the United States contends that\n\nthe case at bar is most akin to Hill, a decision in which the\n\nSupreme Court found that the district court did not have the\n\nequitable discretion under the Endangered Species Act to decline\n\nthe issuance of an injunction if it found that a violation of\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fthe statute's substantive provisions had occurred.               437 U.S. at\n\n193-95.\n\n          To bolster this argument, the United States adverts to\n\na   passage    from   §    300g-3(b)'s    legislative      history    that,   it\n\nargues,   evinces         congressional     intent   to    diminish    courts'\n\nequitable discretion under the SDWA.           This passage, appearing in\n\nthe   report    of    the    House   Interstate      and   Foreign    Commerce\n\nCommittee (which authored the version of the Act that ultimately\n\nbecame law in 1974), states:\n\n          [T]he Committee intends that courts which\n          are considering remedies in enforcement\n          actions under [§ 300g-3] are not to apply\n          traditional balancing principles used by\n          equity courts. Rather, they are directed to\n          give utmost weight to the Committee's\n          paramount objective of providing maximum\n          feasible protection of the public health at\n          the times specified in the bill.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 93-1185 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n\n6454, 6476.\n\n          The Second Circuit has accepted this analysis, albeit\n\nin dicta, and concluded that, for largely the same reasons\n\nadvanced by the United States, courts may not consider the\n\npropriety vel non of filtration in individual SDWA cases.                     In\n\nUnited States v. City of New York, 198 F.3d 360 (2d Cir. 1999),\n\na case in which a citizens' group sued to undo a consent\n\nagreement between New York City and the EPA that required the\n\ninstallation of a filtration system, the court in dicta stated:\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\f          [T]he decision to filtrate or not is a\n          policy choice that Congress seems to have\n          made and that, in any event, is beyond our\n          judicial function.    Our conclusion is not\n          altered by appellants' interesting, but\n          ultimately   unpersuasive,  argument   that,\n          since the SDWA authorizes a court to enter\n          \"such judgment as protection of public\n          health may require,\" 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b),\n          the district court has the power to refuse\n          to order filtration in this action . . . .\n          We think that the equitable power vested in\n          the district court is more circumscribed\n          than intervenors propose; it is available to\n          ensure compliance with the statute and the\n          regulations promulgated thereunder, not to\n          rework or reject these legislative and\n          regulatory determinations.\n\nId. at 366.14\n\n          While we agree that the SDWA's text and legislative\n\nhistory provide evidence of Congress's intent not to allow\n\ncourts in SDWA cases to apply the traditional test for issuing\n\ninjunctions,15 we are not convinced that such evidence gives rise\n\n\n     14\n      This passage was dicta because the court disposed of the\nproposed intervenors' appeal on the alternative ground that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by denying the\norganization's requests for intervention as a matter of right\nand for permissive intervention. See id. at 367-68.\n     15\n      In order to issue a permanent injunction, a district court\ntypically must find that (1) the plaintiff has demonstrated\nactual success on the merits of its claims; (2) the plaintiff\nwould be irreparably injured in the absence of injunctive\nrelief; (3) the harm to the plaintiff from defendant's conduct\nwould exceed the harm to the defendant accruing from the\nissuance of an injunction; and (4) the public interest would not\nbe adversely affected by an injunction. E.g., A.W. Chesterton\nCo. v. Chesterton, 128 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997). At least with\nrespect to some statutory injunction provisions, however, courts\nhave found that when Congress decides to make available the\nremedy of injunction for violations of a statute's substantive\n\n                              -33-\n\fto a \"necessary and inescapable inference\" that the substantive\n\nremedies made available under the Act must always be ordered\n\nwhenever   a   regulation   promulgated   under   the   Act   has   been\n\nviolated.16 Rather, we believe that as long as a court issues a\n\n\"judgment as public health may require,\" 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b),\n\nthereby ensuring that the public system provides water that is\n\nsafe according to standards identified by the EPA, the court\n\nretains a measure of flexibility under the Act to tailor the\n\nspecifics of an equitable remedy that will help bring about that\n\ngoal.    Our determination on this point is bolstered by several\n\n\n\n\nprovisions, irreparable injury is presumed to flow from such\nviolations.   E.g., United States v. City of Painesville, 644\nF.2d 1186, 1194 (6th Cir. 1981).\n     We note that, in spite of the legislative history indicating\nCongress's intent to narrow the scope of equitable discretion\nunder the SDWA, at least one court has applied traditional\nprinciples of equitable balancing to determine the propriety of\nan injunction for violations of the Act's substantive\nprovisions. See United States v. Midway Heights County Water\nDist., 695 F. Supp. 1072 (E.D. Cal. 1988) (denying public water\nsystem's motion for stay of preliminary injunction requiring it\nto comply with national drinking water regulations).\n    16We note that in City of New York, the proposed intervenors\ndid not argue that the equities of the case favored withholding\nfiltration in that particular case; rather, they sought to\neffect a \"head-on challenge to filtration\" per se. 198 F.3d at\n366. The proposed intervenors' challenge principally was based\non their assertion that \"filtration . . . is [both] dangerous to\nconsumers [and] fiscally wasteful.\" Id. at 363; see also id. at\n364 (\"[Appellants] do[] not seek to enforce administratively\nestablished    criteria;   [they]    seek[]   to    block   such\nenforcement.\"). Moreover, in City of New York (unlike in the\npresent case) the public water system conceded that it would not\nbe able to meet the avoidance criteria in the future. Id. at\n362-63.\n\n                                -34-\n\ffactors relating to the Act's \"language, history and structure,\"\n\nHill, 437 U.S. at 174, and its \"underlying substantive policy,\"\n\nVillage of Gambell, 480 U.S. at 544.\n\n          First, the critical passage of the SDWA's judicial-\n\nenforcement subsection states that, following a violation of the\n\nAct's substantive provisions, the court \"may enter . . . such\n\njudgment as protection of public health may require . . . .\"            42\n\nU.S.C. § 300g-3(b) (emphasis added).          When Congress uses the\n\npermissive   \"may\"   in    settings   such   as   §   300g-3(b),   it   is\n\n\"eminently reasonable\" to presume that the choice of verbiage is\n\na deliberate one, and that, in the context of that statute,\n\n\"'may' means may.\"17      McCreary v.

United States, 786 F.2d\n\n586, 591 (3d Cir. 1986) (finding that where statute states that\n\ncourt \"may\" grant injunctive relief, the statute's use of the\n\nconditional \"suggests that such relief is not mandatory in every\n\ncase\").   This tenet of statutory construction should obtain\n\n\n\n     17\n      Conversely, when Congress employs the word \"shall\" in like\ncontexts, it often means that \"Congress has imposed a mandatory\nduty upon the subject of the command.\"      Forest Guardians v.\nBabbitt, 174 F.3d 1178, 1187 (10th Cir. 1999) (citing Monsanto,\n491 U.S. at 607).   However, even the use of the word \"shall\"\ndoes not necessarily eliminate all equitable discretion if\nCongress's purpose not to eliminate such discretion is manifest.\nHecht Co., 321 U.S. at 329.\n\n                                 -35-\n\funless \"obvious inferences from the structure and purpose of the\n\nstatute [indicate] that 'may' was intended to have something\n\nother than its ordinary meaning.\"                    Reynolds v.

Rodgers,\n\n461 U.S. at 706) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            If anything, the strongest inference that may be drawn\n\nfrom the SDWA is that Congress did intend for \"may\" in § 300g-\n\n3(b) to track its everyday meaning.                       As mentioned in Part I,\n\nsupra, Congress amended the Act in 1986 to enhance the level of\n\nenforcement under the SDWA.                  See 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(a)(1)(B)\n\n(providing that if the responsible state enforcement authority\n\ndoes not commence enforcement action within thirty days of being\n\nnotified    by     the     EPA     of        existence       of       violation,       \"the\n\nAdministrator shall issue an [administrative] order . . . or the\n\nAdministrator shall commence a civil action . . . .\") (emphases\n\nadded);    Rodgers,      supra,    §    4.20A,       at    152    (\"In   making       these\n\nchanges    Congress       [was]    convinced          that       it   [could]    control\n\nprosecutorial options by replacing 'mays' with 'shalls' in its\n\nenforcement      instructions.\").              But    in   so     amending      the   Act,\n\nCongress    left      untouched    the       \"mays\"       contained      in   the     Act's\n\nneighboring judicial-enforcement provision, thereby making only\n\nprosecution      of     substantive          SDWA     violations         an   expressly\n\nmandatory     undertaking.

In the report of\n\nthe    Senate   Environment      and     Public    Works       Committee       (which\n\ngenerated the version of the bill that ultimately became law) on\n\nthe enactment of these amendments, the Committee stated that\n\n\"[t]he purpose of adding administrative order authority is not\n\nto replace judicial enforcement, but to add a complementary\n\nenforcement     mechanism.\"       S.     Rep.   No.     99-56,    at    9     (1986),\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\freprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1566, 1574.       By affording the\n\nEPA an intermediate remedy for SDWA violations that does not\n\nrequire court action, Congress explicitly contemplated a system\n\nin which substantive violations of the Act (particularly minor\n\nones) would not always result in the issuance of an injunction.\n\nSee Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. at 317-18.\n\n          In sum, there is substantial evidence in the SDWA's\n\ntext and legislative history to suggest that \"may\" really does\n\nmean \"may\" in § 300g-3(b).     While these clues alone might not\n\nsuffice to eliminate all doubt that Congress intended for \"may\"\n\nto have a permissive meaning, at a minimum, they do eliminate\n\nthe possibility that the SDWA's structure and purpose generate\n\nan \"obvious inference\" that the word \"may\" in § 300g-3(b) really\n\nmeans \"shall.\"18   Rodgers, 461 U.S. at 706; see also Russ Winner,\n\nThe Chancellor's Foot and Environmental Law: A Call for Better\n\nReasoned Decisions on Environmental Injunctions, 9 Envtl. L.\n\n\n     18\n      The United States asserts that by creating a filtration\nexemption under the SDWA in 1996 for water systems with\nuninhabited and undeveloped watersheds in consolidated control,\n42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(7)(C)(v), Congress demonstrated its belief\nthat such an amendment was needed to circumvent the mandatory\ncommand of the Act's filtration requirement. We disagree. This\nprovision merely authorizes state enforcement agencies, who\nwould otherwise be obliged to bring an enforcement action for\navoidance-criteria violations, see id. § 300g-3(a)(1)(B)\n(requiring the EPA to bring suit for substantive SDWA violation\nif state enforcement agency fails timely to do so), to permit\ncompliance with the Act by means other than filtration for\ncertain types of water systems. The amendment does not touch\nupon the power of the court to issue -- or not issue -- an\ninjunction.\n\n                               -38-\n\f477, 506 (1979) (\"If . . . the legislation explicitly requires\n\nthat 'an injunction must issue,' a court . . . has no choice but\n\nto comply.    Most of the time, however, the legislature is silent\n\nas to injunctive remedy or merely says that an injunction 'may'\n\nissue.   In this case, courts usually retain their full equitable\n\ndiscretion.\").\n\n          Our conclusion on the SDWA's preservation of equitable\n\ndiscretion also is reinforced by other portions of the Act's\n\njudicial-enforcement provision.      While the United States relies\n\nheavily on language in § 300g-3(b) referring to compliance with\n\nthe Act, and specifically on statements to the effect that the\n\nEPA Administrator is authorized to \"bring a civil action . . .\n\nto require compliance\" and that a court hearing an SDWA suit\n\n\"may enter . . . such judgment as protection of public health\n\nmay require, taking into consideration the time necessary to\n\ncomply,\" we find that such language, when compared to similar\n\nlanguage in other federal enforcement statutes, does not compel\n\nthe conclusion that the court must issue an injunction.\n\n          Take, for example, the provision empowering the EPA to\n\nbring a civil action \"to require compliance.\"        Similar language\n\nappears in a number of other statutes' judicial-enforcement\n\nprovisions, and generally has been construed as leaving intact\n\nthe judiciary's equitable discretion to deny the issuance of an\n\ninjunction.      The   courts   reaching   this   interpretation   have\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\freasoned that the language simply represents Congress's grant of\n\nauthority to an agency to bring a suit to require compliance --\n\nin other words, that the agency can seek to require compliance\n\nthrough legal process.\n\n            For instance, under the judicial-enforcement provision\n\nof   the   Securities   and    Exchange   Act   of   1934,    15   U.S.C.    §\n\n78u(d)(1), the SEC \"may, in its discretion, bring an action . .\n\n. to enjoin . . . acts or practices\" violating the statute's\n\nsubstantive provisions.        In SEC v. Frank, 388 F.2d 486, 491 (2d\n\nCir. 1968), Judge Friendly, writing for the panel, found such\n\nlanguage not susceptible of the interpretation that equitable\n\ndiscretion had been stripped from the district court: \"Such\n\nbland language affords no sufficient basis for concluding that\n\nCongress meant special weight to be given the Commission's\n\ndecision to allow its staff to institute suit.                 If Congress\n\nwishes to go further, it should say so in language all can\n\nunderstand.\"    Likewise, in Federal Power Commission v. Arizona\n\nEdison Co., 194 F.2d 679, 684-86 (9th Cir. 1952), the Ninth\n\nCircuit,    reaching    an    analogous   conclusion   with    respect      to\n\nidentical language in the judicial-enforcement provision of the\n\nFederal Power Commission Act, 16 U.S.C. § 825m(a), held that the\n\ncourts' traditional powers of equity had not been eviscerated by\n\nthe agency's power to bring suit to require compliance.             Another\n\nexample of this usage, albeit in a slightly different context,\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fappears in the citizen-suit provision of the Clean Water Act;\n\nunder this statute, suits may not be instituted by individuals\n\nor organizations if the EPA or the appropriate state enforcement\n\nauthority \"has commenced and is diligently pursuing a civil or\n\ncriminal action . . . to require compliance\" with the Act's\n\nsubstantive provisions.             33 U.S.C. § 1365(b)(1)(B) (emphasis\n\nadded).       Despite this reference to \"requir[ing] compliance\" in\n\nthe statutory language, the Supreme Court held in Romero-Barcelo\n\nthat the Clean Water Act does not require the issuance of an\n\ninjunction in all cases where a statutory violation has been\n\nidentified.         456 U.S. at 313 (holding that \"[t]he grant of\n\njurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests\n\na duty to do so under any and all circumstances\").                   These\n\nexamples demonstrate that a statutory provision that gives an\n\nagency the power to litigate \"to require compliance,\" without\n\nmore, does not necessarily obligate the court asked to rule on\n\nsuch a suit to issue any particular remedy.19\n\n               The other passage in § 300g-3(b) referred to by the\n\nUnited States -- the one stating that courts are to consider\n\n\"the        time   necessary   to    comply   and   the   availability   of\n\nalternative water supplies\" in fashioning equitable relief -- is\n\nbetter construed to mean that, to the extent a court issues a\n\n\n\n       19\n      As we note infra, we believe that the district court did\nrequire compliance with the SDWA in this case.\n\n                                       -41-\n\f\"judgment as public health may require\" that does include the\n\nfiltration remedy (which, as the district court noted, will\n\nusually be the case), it must allow the public water system\n\nreasonable   time   to   comply   in   light   of   the   availability   of\n\nalternative water sources.        From the command that a court must\n\nconsider the time necessary to comply when it does order a\n\n\"judgment as public health may require,\" however, it does not\n\nnecessarily follow that the court must always exact the type of\n\ncompliance sought by the agency whenever a violation of the Act\n\nhas been identified.     This construction is supported by the fact\n\nthat, in spite of the ubiquitousness of the term \"compliance\" in\n\n§ 300g-3(b), courts are not expressly limited by the statute to\n\nentering judgments that \"require compliance,\" but instead have\n\nbeen granted the leeway to issue \"judgment[s] as protection of\n\npublic health may require.\"        Cf. Natural Res. Def. Council v.\n\nSouthwest Marine, Inc., 236 F.3d 985, 1000 (9th Cir. 2000)\n\n(holding that, with respect to judicial-enforcement provision in\n\nClean Water Act limiting courts to \"enforce[ment]\" of existing\n\nstandards and orders, \"the authority to 'enforce' an existing\n\nrequirement is more than the authority to declare that the\n\nrequirement exists and repeat that it must be followed\"), cert.\n\ndenied, 121 S. Ct. 2242 (2001).\n\n         In sum, while the United States's position certainly\n\nis not implausible, the fact that the MWRA's interpretation of\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\fthe SDWA is at least as plausible effectively forecloses the\n\npossibility that a \"necessary and inescapable inference\" exists\n\nin the Act as to the necessity for filtration upon a finding of\n\na regulatory violation.   Porter, 328 U.S. at 398.\n\n          The United States insists that, in terms of breadth of\n\nequitable discretion, the SDWA bears an uncanny resemblance to\n\nthe Endangered Species Act (ESA) -- a statute found by the\n\nSupreme Court to have removed courts' authority to withhold\n\ninjunctive relief.   Hill, 437 U.S. at 193-95.       In Hill, the\n\nSupreme Court found that the ESA had flatly banned federal\n\nagencies from carrying out activities which threaten to destroy\n\nor modify the habitat of endangered species.         Id. at 194.\n\nThrough an examination of the statute's voluminous text and\n\nlegislative history, the Court found that Congress \"ha[d] spoken\n\nin the plainest of words, making it abundantly clear that the\n\nbalance had been struck in favor of affording endangered species\n\nthe highest of priorities . . . .\"         Id.   In so finding,\n\nmoreover, the Court essentially ignored the statute's judicial-\n\nenforcement provision, 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g), which, far from\n\nexpressly requiring the issuance of an injunction upon the\n\nfinding of a statutory violation, merely gives district courts\n\n\"jurisdiction . . . to enforce any . . . provision\" of the Act.20\n\n\n     20\n      This apparent omission was noted in a dissent by then-\nJustice Rehnquist, who, after taking note of the provision,\ndetermined that it was not strong enough to eliminate the\n\n                              -43-\n\fAttempting to tether this case to that precedent, the United\n\nStates flags what it sees as analogous indicia of legislative\n\nintent with respect to the filtration mandate in the SDWA, and\n\nurges us to overlook the similarly permissive nature of the\n\nSDWA's judicial-enforcement provision.\n\n           While there is force to this argument, in the final\n\nanalysis we do not believe that it holds water.                      The principal\n\nproblem with the United States's effort to juxtapose the ESA and\n\nthe SDWA is that, for reasons discussed above, the overwhelming\n\nevidence of congressional intent that the Supreme Court found in\n\nHill   simply   does    not    exist     with   respect    to     the     filtration\n\nmandate in the SDWA.       The United States points us to no specific\n\nevidence that the narrow goal of filtration (as opposed to the\n\nbroader   aim   of     safe    drinking       water)   was      to    receive    the\n\noverarching priority that endangered-species protection garnered\n\nunder the ESA.       As the district court noted, by imposing the\n\ndisinfection mandate directly even as it imposed the filtration\n\nremedy    indirectly,         Congress     \"stopped       short      of     ordering\n\nfiltration as an all-encompassing preventive.\"                    MWRA II, 97 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 165.       As for the Supreme Court's failure to consider\n\nthe language of the ESA's judicial-enforcement provision in\n\nHill, we note that in subsequent cases, such as United States v.\n\n\n\npresumption of retained equitable discretion.                Hill, 437 U.S. at\n211-13 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n\n                                       -44-\n\fOakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, the Court has found that\n\npiece of legislative evidence to be particularly relevant in\n\nascertaining the extent to which equitable discretion had been\n\nretained.      See ___ U.S. ___, 121 S. Ct. 1711, 1721 (2001)\n\n(analyzing     judicial-enforcement            provision      of      Controlled\n\nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 882(a), and concluding that the\n\ndistrict court \"is not textually required by any clear and valid\n\nlegislative command\" in that provision to issue an injunction)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).            Whether or not the approach\n\ntaken in Hill with respect to the ESA is still \"good law,\" we\n\nare not persuaded that a similar approach is appropriate here.\n\n            Apart from its arguments concerning the text of the\n\nSDWA, the United States also pursues a broader line of attack in\n\nthis appeal: that the district court's decision excuses an\n\nongoing statutory violation, and therefore exceeds the scope of\n\nequitable discretion that may be exercised under any statute.\n\nWhile    acknowledging     the    Supreme    Court's      statement     that   \"a\n\nfederal     judge   sitting      as   chancellor     is    not     mechanically\n\nobligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law,\"\n\nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. at 313, the United States contends that\n\nthe Court has never authorized courts to do what it claims the\n\ndistrict court did in this case -- namely, to permit a water\n\nsystem    in   violation    of    the   SDWA    to   remain      in   violation\n\nindefinitely.       In pressing this argument, the United States\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\fpoints to three of the Court's seminal cases in this area from\n\nthe last century:      Hecht Co., Romero-Barcelo, and          Village of\n\nGambell. Even though the Supreme Court endorsed the district\n\ncourt's   exercise    of   equitable   discretion   in    each   of   those\n\ndecisions,   the     United   States   correctly    observes     that   the\n\ndistrict court's order in all three cases was designed to lead\n\nto compliance with the relevant statute.21               By declining to\n\norder the MWRA to install a filtration system, the United States\n\ncontends, the district court was unfaithful to these precedents\n\nby \"allow[ing] the MWRA to remain out of compliance with the\n\nSDWA and the SWTR permanently.\"\n\n          We agree that in all three of these cases -- and,\n\nindeed, in all cases in which the Supreme Court has spoken in\n\nthis area -- the violating party was not permitted to evade the\n\nsubstantive requirements of the statute.       We disagree, however,\n\n\n    21In Hecht Co., the defendant had remedied its past\nviolations of the Emergency Price Control Act, and the district\ncourt had found that those transgressions were not likely to\nrecur. 321 U.S. at 325-26. In Romero-Barcelo, the Court noted\nthat the violator (the Navy) was likely in the near future to\nreceive the permit it needed to comply with the Federal Water\nPollution Control Act amendments to the Clean Water Act, and\nfound that the statute's judicial-enforcement provision \"permits\nthe district court to order that relief it considers necessary\nto secure prompt compliance with the Act.\"      456 U.S. at 320\n(emphasis added). And in Village of Gambell, the Court found\nthat because oil companies needed to receive further approval\nfrom the Secretary of the Interior before engaging in drilling\noff the coast of Alaska, the district court was not required,\nunder the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, to\nenjoin the companies' activities based on their past failures to\nmeet the Act's procedural requirements. 480 U.S. at 544.\n\n                                  -46-\n\fwith the United States's argument that the court is permitting\n\nnoncompliance in this case.                \"[W]hen a court of equity exercises\n\nits   discretion,        it       may    not      consider      the    advantages       and\n\ndisadvantages of nonenforcement of the statute, but only the\n\nadvantages and disadvantages of employing the extraordinary\n\nremedy    of    injunction         over     the     other      available      methods    of\n\nenforcement.\"          Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop., 121 S. Ct. at\n\n1722 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).                           Because\n\nthe court's order is designed to ensure that the Act's paramount\n\nobjective      of    safe       drinking       water    remains      fulfilled    in    the\n\nfuture, the district court did not, as the United States argues,\n\nsanction perpetual noncompliance with the Act.                          See Village of\n\nGambell, 480 U.S. at 544 (directing courts charged with ensuring\n\ncompliance      with        a    statute       to      focus    on    \"the    underlying\n\nsubstantive         policy      the     process        was   designed    to    effect\").\n\nContrary to the situation in Hill, this is not a case where\n\n\"Congress' order of priorities, as expressed in the statute,\n\nwould be deprived of effect if the District Court could choose\n\nto deny injunctive relief.\"                Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop., 121\n\nS. Ct. at 1721 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Hill,\n\n437 U.S. at 194).\n\n            Although the EPA is correct that filtration is an\n\nabsolute requirement under the SDWA/SWTR regime for those water\n\nsystems     that      fail       to     meet     the     avoidance      criteria,       the\n\n\n                                            -47-\n\fpreeminence of filtration in bringing about the goal of safe\n\ndrinking water is primarily a function of the Rule, not the Act.\n\nThe purpose of the Act, in the words of its drafters, is to\n\n\"assure    that   water     supply   systems      serving    the       public   meet\n\nminimum national standards for protection of public health.\"\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 93-1185,         reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6454,\n\n6454.     In other words, the framers of the Act were concerned\n\nwith ensuring that consumers of public water systems have access\n\nto safe drinking water, with the safety of the water to be\n\njudged according to objective criteria developed by the EPA.\n\nFiltration, while serving an important role in furtherance of\n\nthe objective of safe water, is merely a prophylactic remedy\n\nmade available to help bring about that objective.                        One fact\n\nunderscores this point particularly well, and demonstrates why\n\nthe exercise of equitable discretion is especially appropriate\n\nwith respect to this particular regulatory scheme: under the\n\nAct, if a water system never violates any of the avoidance\n\ncriteria, its water is presumptively \"safe\" according to the\n\nSDWA,   regardless     of    whether    it     ever   installs     a    filtration\n\nsystem.     In essence, the water system's compliance with the\n\navoidance    criteria       makes    the      water   safe   from       the     EPA's\n\nperspective -- a point conceded by the United States at trial.\n\nWe fail to see how accomplishment of the Act's substantive goals\n\nis   undermined   by   overlooking         past   violations     of     regulatory\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fdeadlines that have no bearing on the current or future purity\n\nof the water delivered to consumers.            See Romero-Barcelo, 456\n\nU.S. at 310 (noting that purpose of injunctive relief is to\n\ndeter future violations, not to punish past ones) (citing Hecht\n\nCo., 321 U.S. at 329-30); cf. Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw\n\nEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 192 (2000) (holding\n\nthat district court had discretion under Clean Water Act \"to\n\ndetermine which form of relief is best suited, in the particular\n\ncase,   to    abate   current    violations    and    deter   future   ones\")\n\n(emphasis added).       Moreover, given that the district court has\n\nretained jurisdiction in this case for the purpose of policing\n\nany    future    violation,     thereby    allowing    it   to   revisit   the\n\nvalidity of its earlier decision not to order filtration, the\n\nUnited States has a ready forum in which to seek relief for any\n\nfuture avoidance-criteria violations.            See Romero-Barcelo, 456\n\nU.S. at 320 (\"Should it become clear that . . . compliance with\n\nthe [statute] will not be forthcoming, the statutory scheme and\n\npurpose would require the court to reconsider the balance it has\n\nstruck.\").\n\n              Besides the issue of ongoing supervision to ensure\n\ncompliance, the case at bar bears a close similarity to Romero-\n\nBarcelo in at least one other respect: the district court's\n\nfocus on the relevant statute's substantive purposes, rather\n\nthan    its     technical   requirements.       In    Romero-Barcelo,      the\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fplaintiffs   claimed   that,   by    allowing   the   Navy    to   continue\n\nbombing   exercises    on   Vieques    Island   without      first      having\n\nobtained a discharge permit, the court was countenancing an\n\nongoing statutory violation -- namely, the unpermitted discharge\n\nof   ordnance   into   navigable      waters.     456     U.S.     at    314.\n\nDisagreeing with this characterization, the Supreme Court found\n\nthat, by tying future Navy activities to its procurement of a\n\ndischarge permit, the district court had \"neither ignored the\n\nstatutory violation nor undercut the purpose and function of the\n\npermit system.\"    Id. at 315.        This was the case, according to\n\nthe Court, because \"[t]he integrity of the Nation's waters, . .\n\n. not the permit process, is the purpose of the [statute].\"                Id.\n\nat 314.   So it is here: the manifest purpose of the SDWA is safe\n\ndrinking water, not filtration.\n\n          Of course, we are aware that the filtration mandate is,\n\nin some meaningful way, more \"substantive\" than the FWPCA's\n\npermit requirement, and that, through the 1986 amendments to the\n\nSDWA, Congress expressed its intent that filtration should be\n\nused by water systems that fail to meet the standards for\n\navoidance established by the EPA.          But in the end, we believe\n\nthat we would do far greater violence to both the text and the\n\npurpose of the SDWA were we to strip courts of the flexibility\n\nto shape equitable decrees in appropriate situations.              For as we\n\nnoted infra, under § 300g-3(b), courts are authorized to issue\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\f\"judgments   as    protection   of   public   health   may   require.\"\n\nMoreover, by retaining jurisdiction in this case, the district\n\ncourt has assumed the responsibility of ensuring that, through\n\ncontinued oversight of the MWRA's avoidance-criteria compliance,\n\nthe MWRA's water supply will remain \"safe\" according to the\n\nEPA's standards.\n\n         The United States's final contention -- in reality, it\n\nis nothing more than a variation on the basic theme of its\n\nappeal -- is that the district court, by holding a trial on the\n\npropriety of applying the filtration requirement to the MWRA,\n\narrogated to itself powers that had been placed by Congress in\n\nthe hands of the EPA.     In its view, the district court's trial\n\namounted to little more than an improper reconsideration of the\n\ndeterminations that the EPA made in promulgating the Rule.\n\nUnder the SDWA, the United States argues, such considerations\n\nare the exclusive province of experts in the EPA, not the\n\ncourts, and if the district court's decision is left to stand,\n\nevery water system that finds itself displeased with the SWTR's\n\nrigid requirements will have the opportunity to challenge the\n\nwisdom of the Rule as applied to it.\n\n         This line of reasoning only is valid as far as it goes\n\n-- and it does not go as far as the United States suggests.         It\n\nis certainly true that, in delegating authority to the EPA to\n\nascertain circumstances in which \"filtration . . . is required\"\n\n\n                                 -51-\n\fof    public    water     systems,        42    U.S.C.    §    300g-1(b)(7)(C)(i),\n\nCongress      entrusted     the     EPA    with    the    power    to   make     policy\n\njudgments with respect to the factors that would make filtration\n\nmandatory.      It is also true that, as a general matter, those\n\njudgments are not to be second-guessed by courts.                            But policy\n\ndeterminations in statutes and regulations that Congress chooses\n\nto have enforced through suits in equity are always subject to\n\ncourts' equitable discretion -- that is, at least to the extent\n\nthat Congress has preserved discretion in the statute and has\n\nnot proscribed, through its expressions of policy, the type of\n\nequitable remedy that a court seeks to implement.                        If Congress\n\nhas    left    the   door    open    to     a    court   to    exercise       equitable\n\ndiscretion respecting enforcement of a statute such as the SDWA,\n\nand the court senses that the equities of the case may favor\n\nalternative means of exacting compliance with the statute ( i.e.,\n\nother than the issuance of an injunction), the court does not\n\nexceed the boundaries of its authority by conducting fact-\n\nfinding for the purpose of determining how best to wield its\n\ndiscretion      in   light    of     the       priorities      established      in    the\n\nstatute.      The district court did not hold a trial to revisit the\n\nunderlying wisdom of the SWTR; rather, it held a trial to\n\nascertain whether, based on both the particular facts of this\n\ncase    and    the   substantive          goals    of    the    Act,    it    was    more\n\nappropriate to order filtration or to permit the MWRA to pursue\n\n\n                                           -52-\n\fits alternative approach to the extent that it could satisfy the\n\nRule's avoidance criteria and ultimately provide a safer water\n\nsupply.\n\n            In sum, with respect to the SDWA, a court must \"take\n\nas given the value choices embodied in the statutes and policies\n\nadministered      by   the   [agency],   but   is   entitled   and   in   fact\n\nrequired to consider whether the enforcement of the [agency's]\n\norder would violate equitable principles that are neutral with\n\nregard to those value choices.\"          NLRB v. P*I*E Nationwide, Inc.,\n\n894 F.2d 887, 893 (7th Cir. 1990).                  In our view, this is\n\nprecisely what the district court did in this case.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n            Under the SDWA, it should be a rare case in which a\n\nviolation of regulatory standards does not lead to an injunction\n\nif the responsible enforcement agency requests one.              This is so\n\nbecause, as the district court in this case properly found, the\n\nSDWA contains a \"presumption expressed by Congress . . . that\n\nfiltration will almost always be the preferred remedy for a[n]\n\nSWTR violation.\"       MWRA I, 48 F. Supp. 2d at 72.       Expressions by\n\nCongress of this sort, once identified, must be respected by\n\ncourts,    lest    equitable     discretion     become   the    judiciary's\n\npreferred method of reshaping policy determinations made by\n\nother branches of government that are better equipped to make\n\nthem.     But the district court, after carefully considering the\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\ffacts,    found    that    this    was    indeed     such   a    rare    case,   and\n\naccordingly declined to issue an injunction.                    In rendering this\n\njudgment, the court was careful to shape its decision so as to\n\nensure that the MWRA's drinking water will meet the avoidance-\n\ncriteria standards that are the EPA's benchmarks for safety.                       It\n\nexercised the flexibility left to it by Congress in the statute,\n\nand    assumed     the    responsibility        of   monitoring         the   MWRA's\n\ncompliance    in    the    event    that    future     violations        require    a\n\nreexamination of the decision not to order filtration.                             In\n\nshort, the district court used its equitable discretion to\n\nappropriate ends: furthering the substantive purposes of the\n\nAct.     In so doing, it did not act outside the scope of its\n\nauthority with respect to the specific statute at issue in\n\ndeclining to issue an injunction.                  Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt's judgment is\n\n           Affirmed.       No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -54-\n\f",

The federal Safe Water\n\nDrinking    Act    (SDWA    or    Act)   authorizes     the   Environmental\n\nProtection Agency (EPA) to prescribe criteria specifying when\n\npublic water systems are \"required\" to install a filtration\n\nsystem.    The Act also provides, however, that courts asked to\n\nissue an injunction enforcing the EPA's filtration standards\n\n\"may enter . . . such judgment as protection of public health\n\nmay require . . . .\"         This appeal requires us to resolve the\n\napparent tension between these two provisions.            Specifically, we\n\nmust   decide     whether   the   SDWA   requires    courts   to    order   the\n\nstatutorily prescribed remedy of filtration for violations of\n\nits    substantive    provisions     and    the   regulations      promulgated\n\nthereunder, or, alternatively, whether courts have the authority\n\nin SDWA cases not to order such remedies in those instances\n\nwhere the equities are found to counsel forbearance.                Suffice it\n\nto say, we are not faced with an imminent threat to the public\n\nhealth in this case; none has been alleged by the United States\n\non appeal.        Rather, this dispute mainly has to do with the\n\noperation of an EPA rule that purports to oblige public water\n\nsystems to install a filtration system if they fail to meet\n\ncertain regulatory standards by a prescribed deadline -- an\n\n                                      -2-\n\fobligation that extends into the future indefinitely, and that\n\ndoes not account for the present and future safety of the\n\nsystem's drinking water.\n\n          Based on our reading of the Act, we find that the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion by declining to order\n\nthat the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) install\n\na filtration system.     We therefore affirm its judgment.\n\n                            I.

Regulatory Regime\n\n          In 1974, Congress, legislating in an area that had\n\npreviously received scant attention under federal law, passed\n\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, Pub. L. No. 93-523, 88 Stat. 1660\n\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 300f to 300j-8 (1991 &\n\nSupp. 2000)), with the basic goal of protecting the purity of\n\nthe   drinking   water   provided    by   the   nation's   public   water\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fsystems.1      To this end, the Act vests authority in the EPA to\n\npromulgate and enforce two types of water-purity standards:\n\nmaximum contaminant levels (MCLs) and treatment techniques.\n\nUnder    the    Act,    the   EPA   is    to     regulate    the   majority   of\n\ncontaminants in drinking water by formulating MCLs -- numerical\n\nstandards that represent the agency's expert determination as to\n\n\"the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on\n\nthe health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin\n\nof safety.\"      Id. § 300g-1(b)(4)(A).              By contrast, the EPA only\n\nmay require the implementation of specific treatment techniques,\n\nconsisting of engineering or design standards, in instances\n\nwhere the Administrator deems it infeasible, for technological\n\nor economic reasons, to ascertain an acceptable concentration\n\nlevel    for    the    contaminant.            Id.   §   300g-1(b)(7)(A).     As\n\noriginally written, the SDWA did not specifically require that\n\nthe EPA develop either MCLs or treatment techniques with respect\n\nto any particular contaminant.                 As a result, between 1974 and\n\n1986 the EPA promulgated regulations concerning only twenty-\n\nthree drinking water contaminants, and of these pollutants, all\n\nbut one had previously been subject to regulations issued by the\n\n\n\n     1Under the SDWA, the term \"public water system\" encompasses\nany \"system for the provision to the public of piped water for\nhuman   consumption   through   pipes   or   other   constructed\nconveyances, if such system has at least fifteen service\nconnections   or   regularly   serves   at   least   twenty-five\nindividuals.\" 42 U.S.C. § 300f(4)(A).\n\n                                         -4-\n\fPublic Health Service.

Rev. 809, 814 (1999).\n\n            In 1986, however, Congress amended the Act so as to\n\nrequire (rather than merely to authorize) the EPA to develop\n\ntreatment    regimes      with       respect      to   scores       of    additional\n\ncontaminants,      and   to    require     that    violations       of    the   Act's\n\nsubstantive provisions and the rules promulgated thereunder be\n\nprosecuted by either the states or the EPA.                      Id. at 814-15.\n\nThese amendments were prompted by the EPA's perceived laxity in\n\nissuing rules under and enforcing the SDWA, see 2 William H.\n\nRodgers, Jr., Environmental Law, § 4.20A, at 152 (Supp. 2001)\n\n(\"In making these changes Congress [was] convinced that it\n\n[could]    control   prosecutorial         options      [under      the    SDWA]   by\n\nreplacing     'mays'          with     'shalls'        in     its        enforcement\n\ninstructions.\"), and by anecdotal evidence suggesting a rise in\n\nbiological and chemical contamination of public water supplies\n\nthroughout the United States.\n\n            Through these amendments, Congress also expressed a\n\ngrowing preference for the employment of specific treatment\n\ntechniques, as opposed to the promulgation of MCLs, to solve the\n\nproblem of contaminated drinking water.                      This policy shift\n\noccurred      as   the    result      of   mounting         scientific      evidence\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdemonstrating      the   efficacy   of    filtration    and    disinfection\n\ntechniques    in     reducing   waterborne      viral        and   bacterial\n\ncontamination.      Id., § 4.20A, at 151.        Reflecting this view,\n\nCongress specifically required that disinfection be employed by\n\nall public water systems to reduce the live quantities of those\n\npathogens, except for systems specifically eligible to receive\n\na variance from the EPA.        42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(8).           Congress\n\nalso changed the SDWA to provide for filtration of public water\n\nsystems.   Id. § 300g-1(b)(7)(C)(i).        But unlike the disinfection\n\nmandate, filtration was not directly imposed upon all public\n\nwater systems; rather, Congress provided that the EPA \"shall\n\npropose and promulgate . . . criteria under which filtration .\n\n. . is required as a treatment technique for public water\n\nsystems supplied by surface water sources.\"             Id.\n\n           On June 29, 1989, pursuant to this statutory command,\n\nthe EPA promulgated the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR or\n\nRule), 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.70-.73.            The SWTR focuses on public\n\nsystems that draw their water in some measure from above-ground\n\nsources.   It seeks to reduce the risk of illness from waterborne\n\npathogens to one yearly occurrence per 10,000 consumers of water\n\nfrom covered public systems.

Specifically, the Rule requires\n\nthat all public systems achieve a three-log (99.9 percent)\n\nreduction in the Giardia lamblia parasite and a four-log (99.99\n\npercent)   reduction   in   viral     contamination,    40   C.F.R.   §\n\n141.70(a); establishes a mandatory disinfection requirement for\n\nall systems, subject to the granting of variances by the EPA,\n\nid. § 141.72; specifies the standards according to which all\n\nfiltration systems must be constructed, id. § 141.73; and sets\n\nout eleven \"avoidance criteria\" for levels of certain waterborne\n\ncontaminants that all public water systems hoping to forego\n\nfiltration must satisfy, id. §§ 141.71(a)-(b).2        On December 16,\n\n1998, in response to an additional amendment to the SDWA passed\n\nin 1996, see 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(2)(C) (Supp. 2000), the EPA\n\npromulgated the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule\n\n(IESWTR), 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.170-.173, which requires that public\n\nwater systems implement treatment techniques with respect to the\n\nprotozoan Cryptosporidium larvum, whose presence in public water\n\nsystems has risen in the past two decades and which has been\n\ndemonstrated to cause significant health problems, particularly\n\nfor those individuals with weakened immune systems.          This Rule,\n\nwhose requirements must be met by public water systems by the\n\n\n\n    2 Of the eleven \"avoidance criteria,\" two relate to source\nwater quality, four concern minimum levels of disinfection, and\nfive involve system-specific watershed protection and operations\nrequirements. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.71(a)-(b).\n\n                                -7-\n\fend   of    2001,   requires     a    two-log       (99    percent)    reduction     in\n\nCryptosporidium by all water systems that employ filtration, and\n\nan extension of watershed controls to cover Cryptosporidium for\n\nall unfiltered water systems.             Id. § 141.173(b).\n\n              The   filtration       mandate       in   the   SWTR    is   written   in\n\nunequivocal -- and, in the context of federal regulations,\n\nunusually broad -- terms.               Tracking the pertinent deadlines\n\nembodied in the Act, the Rule requires that public water systems\n\nnot meeting all of the avoidance criteria by December 30, 1991,\n\n\"must provide treatment consisting of both disinfection . . .\n\nand filtration\" by June 29, 1993, or, if the violation occurs\n\nafter December 30, 1991, within eighteen months of the date that\n\nthe violation has been established.                       Id. § 141.73 (emphasis\n\nadded).       Moreover, filtration decisions under the Rule are\n\nfinal, in that the Rule provides no mechanism by which a public\n\nwater      system   may   petition     for     a    reopening    of    a   filtration\n\ndetermination.       See id.     The upshot of this regulatory scheme is\n\nthat once a public water system has been found to have violated\n\none of the avoidance criteria, it forever remains subject to an\n\nenforcement suit requesting the installation of a filtration\n\nsystem.3      This result obtains no matter how safe the system's\n\n\n      3\n     The SDWA contains no statute of limitations, and \"an action\non behalf of the United States in its governmental capacity . .\n. is subject to no time limitation, in the absence of\ncongressional enactment clearly imposing it.\" E.I.

This is so because, under the\n\nAct, state agencies that adopt drinking water regulations deemed\n\nby the EPA to be at least as stringent as its own may assume\n\nprimary responsibility for identifying violations of the EPA's\n\nregulations and for enforcing the filtration requirement against\n\nthe violators.       Id. § 300g-2(a).              The Act provides that within\n\nthirty months of the promulgation of the SWTR, those state\n\nagencies that participate in SDWA enforcement must identify the\n\nwater     systems       that    are     required        to   install     filtration\n\nfacilities.6        Id.    §    300g-1(b)(7)(C)(iii).

And in 1996, Congress substituted the term\n\"any applicable requirement\" for \"a national primary drinking\nwater regulation\" to reflect the semantic changes effected by\nthe 1986 amendments to the Act.\n      6\n     In 1996 Congress once again amended the SDWA to permit the\nEPA to excuse from filtration certain public water systems that\ndraw water from uninhabited, undeveloped watersheds over which\nthe public water system has \"consolidated\" (i.e., sole)\nownership of the surrounding lands.         42 U.S.C. § 300g-\n1(b)(7)(C)(v).   The MWRA, however, does not qualify to take\nadvantage of the exception because it does not have consolidated\nownership of the land surrounding its reservoirs.\n\n                                            -10-\n\fauthorities are afforded the first opportunity under this system\n\nto make formal determinations regarding the need for filtration,\n\nthe EPA must bring its own enforcement action in the absence of\n\nsuch a state determination, provided the state agency and the\n\nviolating water system are given thirty days' notice and an\n\nopportunity      for     consultation       with    the     EPA.

Regs.\n\nCode   tit.    310,    §§     22.20A(2),    (4),     the    EPA    granted       primary\n\nenforcement      responsibility         to     the     DEP.             Public     Water\n\nSupervision: Program Revision for Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\n\n58 Fed. Reg. 34,583 (June 28, 1993).\n\nB.            The MWRA\n\n              Established in 1984, the MWRA owns and operates the\n\npublic water system that provides most of the drinking water for\n\nthe city of Boston and surrounding communities.                               Its water\n\nsystem serves approximately two million customers in over forty\n\nMassachusetts         cities    and    towns.         The     MWRA       has     primary\n\nresponsibility for treating its drinking water and transporting\n\nthat water from its reservoirs to the distribution systems of\n\nthe local communities it serves.                   In providing water to its\n\ncustomers,      the    MWRA    works   in    tandem    with       the    Metropolitan\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fDistrict    Commission    (MDC),   an   organization      responsible   for\n\nmonitoring the quality of water in the MWRA system and managing\n\nthe watersheds surrounding the principal sources of the MWRA's\n\nwater supply.7\n\n           The MWRA's water system, which was originally designed\n\nby the Massachusetts Board of Health in the late nineteenth\n\ncentury, consists of three large reservoirs connected by a\n\nnetwork of 265 miles of water mains and 130 miles of aqueducts.\n\nFeeding into the system are two above-ground bodies of water in\n\ncentral Massachusetts, the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs,\n\nwhich collectively contain approximately 475 billion gallons of\n\nwater.     The Quabbin Reservoir, by far the larger of the two\n\nbodies of water, empties into the Wachusett Reservoir.             The MWRA\n\ndraws water from the eastern edge of the Wachusett Reservoir at\n\nthe Cosgrove Intake, and transports the water through a series\n\nof   tunnels   and    aqueducts    until   it   reaches    the    Norumbega\n\nReservoir,     an     intermediate      storage    basin     in     Weston,\n\nMassachusetts.       From there the water travels in all directions,\n\nthrough a complex, 6,700-mile web of additional tunnels, pipes,\n\n\n\n     7Even though the MDC was named as a defendant in this\nlawsuit by virtue of its ownership and control of many of the\nwater-treatment facilities in question, the United States did\nnot allege in the district court, nor does it allege before this\ncourt, that the MDC violated any laws with respect to this\ncontroversy.   We therefore refer to the appellees throughout\nthis opinion as \"the MWRA,\" except where it is necessary to\ndistinguish between the two entities.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fand aqueducts, ultimately connecting to the local distribution\n\ncenters in the various communities that the MWRA serves.\n\n           For    some   time,     the   MWRA    has   employed     two    basic\n\ntechniques to treat its drinking water: disinfection, used to\n\nkill live contaminants, and corrosion control, used to minimize\n\nthe leaching of metals (such as lead) into the water from the\n\nantiquated pipes through which the water travels before reaching\n\nthe taps of consumers.        The water supply undergoes disinfection\n\nas it enters the distribution system through the Cosgrove Intake\n\nand again as it departs the primary distribution system at the\n\nNorumbega Reservoir.         In the mid-1990s, the MWRA replaced the\n\nchloramine disinfection treatment it used at the Cosgrove Intake\n\nwith an alternative disinfection treatment of ozonation, which\n\nconsists   of    the   injection    of   ozone    bubbles   into    the    water\n\nsupply.8   According to the MWRA, ozonation kills a wider range\n\nof pathogens than do the traditional disinfection techniques,\n\nand the process        provides the added benefit of improving the\n\ntaste    and    coloration    of    treated      water.     While    the     EPA\n\nacknowledges the general effectiveness of ozonation, the agency\n\nhas taken the position that it is not, by itself, an effective\n\nsubstitute for filtration.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n     The MWRA continues to use chloramine disinfection at the\nNorumbega Reservoir site.\n\n                                     -13-\n\f         In the months following the EPA's formulation of the\n\nSWTR, the MWRA determined that it would not be able to fulfill\n\nall of the avoidance criteria by the December 30, 1991 deadline.\n\nIn particular, the MWRA concluded that occasional spikes in\n\nfecal coliform bacteria that had been measured in the Wachusett\n\nReservoir in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a phenomenon later\n\nattributed to the seasonal roosting habits of gulls, could not\n\nbe controlled by that date.   Consequently, the MWRA did not seek\n\na formal avoidance determination from the DEP.     On January 24,\n\n1992, the DEP notified the MWRA that, according to the terms of\n\nthe SDWA, it would be required to install a filtration system by\n\nJune 30, 1993.\n\n         By early 1993, after it became clear that the MWRA\n\ncould not design and install a filtration system before June\n\n1993, the MWRA, the MDC, and the DEP entered into negotiations\n\non an administrative consent order (ACO) to govern the MWRA's\n\ncompliance with the SWTR.     Rather than requiring the immediate\n\ninstallation of a filtration system, the ACO established a\n\n\"dual-track\" approach for compliance.     Under this scheme, the\n\nMWRA was permitted in the short term to employ a treatment\n\nregime consisting of disinfection, ozonation, and covered water\n\nstorage facilities, while at the same time embarking upon an\n\naggressive   watershed   protection   plan   for   the   Wachusett\n\nReservoir.   The MWRA also was expected to continue its campaign\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fof \"gull harassment,\" a policy meant to scare away birds so as\n\nto prevent them from defecating in the reservoir.                 If the MWRA\n\nproperly   pursued    these    endeavors,     it    would    be    given   the\n\nopportunity under the ACO to petition, on or before August 3,\n\n1998, for a \"reopener\" establishing that the avoidance criteria\n\nhad been met and that filtration was not required.9               At the same\n\ntime as it pursued the watershed protection strategy, however,\n\nthe MWRA also was obligated to plan the siting and design of the\n\nfiltration facility that it would be required to install in the\n\nevent that it could not establish its eligibility for filtration\n\navoidance by August 1998.      The MWRA, the MDC, and the DEP signed\n\nthe ACO on June 11, 1993.\n\n           Given that the ACO essentially excused the MWRA from\n\ncomplying with a key component of the SWTR, it seems rather\n\nsurprising at first blush that the EPA, while aware of the\n\nnegotiations   over    the    ACO,    did   not    attempt   to    block   its\n\nimplementation.       In fact, despite having written the Rule's\n\nfiltration requirement in mandatory terms (and despite the Act's\n\nmandate that there be filtration when the Rule's standards were\n\nnot met), the EPA's actual practice has been to enforce the\n\nfiltration mandate with less than the unswerving rigor that the\n\nstatutory and regulatory language would seem to require.                   For\n\n\n    9A subsequent amendment to the ACO pushed back to October\n31, 1998, the MWRA's target date for demonstrating compliance\nwith the avoidance criteria.\n\n                                     -15-\n\finstance, notwithstanding the filtration command in the SWTR, in\n\n1992 the EPA issued an internal guidance memorandum that gave\n\nstate enforcement authorities the discretion to postpone final\n\nfiltration determinations if a water system is able to prove\n\nthat    it     could    later   meet     the   avoidance       criteria      through\n\nintermediate      measures.       And     while    the   EPA    never      expressly\n\nacquiesced       in    the   provision    in     the   ACO    that    created    the\n\npotential for the MWRA to eventually avoid filtration (in fact,\n\nit stated in a letter to the parties to the ACO that it reserved\n\nthe right to bring an enforcement action at a later date), it\n\ndid promise the DEP and the MWRA that it would abstain, at least\n\nin the short term, from filing its own enforcement suit once the\n\nACO was executed.\n\n             Consistent with this approach, the EPA worked closely\n\nwith the MWRA in its implementation of both compliance tracks in\n\nthe    three    years     following     the    signing   of     the   ACO.      This\n\nassistance included the agency's advice on steps to be taken by\n\nthe MWRA to satisfy the avoidance criteria.                    In November 1996,\n\nJohn DeVillars, the EPA Regional Administrator, wrote a letter\n\nto the MWRA in which he generally commended the MWRA on its\n\nprogress but cautioned that \"in order to avoid filtration, more\n\nstill needs to be done\"         (emphasis added).          At least through the\n\nend of 1996, this statement epitomized the EPA's deliberately\n\nambiguous       posture      vis-à-vis     the    MWRA's       need   to     install\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\ffiltration: the agency generally supported the MWRA's efforts to\n\nachieve compliance with the avoidance criteria by alternative\n\nmeans, even as it held out the threat of suing to require\n\nfiltration if it later found itself unsatisfied with the MWRA's\n\nperformance.\n\n          In early 1997, after the MWRA acknowledged that it\n\ncould not meet several interim deadlines contained in the ACO,\n\nthe EPA began to lose patience, and the working relationship\n\nbetween the MWRA and the EPA quickly deteriorated.           In two\n\nletters to the MWRA dated January 8, 1997, and May 15, 1997, the\n\nEPA Regional Administrator expressed \"extreme concern\" for the\n\nMWRA's failure to produce adequate design plans for a Wachusett\n\nReservoir filtration facility, and reminded the MWRA that it was\n\nstill in technical violation of the SWTR for its failure to\n\ninstall a filtration system back in 1993.     The EPA's displeasure\n\nwith the MWRA's approach was only exacerbated by a September 18,\n\n1997 agreement between the DEP and the MWRA that amended the ACO\n\nto delay the completion of the design of the filtration plant\n\nuntil January 31, 2002.\n\n          On October 1, 1997, over a year before the MWRA was to\n\nhave   submitted   its    petition    to   reopen   the   filtration\n\ndetermination, the MWRA and the MDC filed with the DEP an early\n\n\"Request for Review and Revision of DEP Determination that\n\nFiltration is Required for Wachusett Reservoir.\"      This document\n\n\n                               -17-\n\frequested that the MWRA be excused from further pursuing the\n\nfiltration track by the end of 1997 if it could establish\n\nprospective compliance with the SWTR's avoidance criteria.              The\n\nEPA, which was not consulted by the MWRA prior to the filing of\n\nthis request, responded critically upon learning of it.               In a\n\nDecember 9, 1997 letter to the MWRA, the MDC, and the DEP, the\n\nEPA Regional Administrator revealed that he had asked the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice to bring an SDWA enforcement action to\n\nrequire \"filtration . . . [and] measures to enhance protection\n\nof the Wachusett reservoirs . . . according to a clear, binding\n\nand expeditious schedule.\"       Such legal action was necessary, in\n\nhis   opinion,   because   the   MWRA   \"did   not   meet   the   avoidance\n\ncriteria in 1991, has not met them to this day, and will not\n\nmeet them by next summer, either.\"\n\n           Three days after the EPA Regional Administrator sent\n\nthis letter, the DEP issued a noncommittal response to the\n\nMWRA's request to forego filtration.           While refusing to allow\n\nwork on the filtration track to be terminated in light of the\n\nMWRA's acknowledgment that it could not meet the avoidance\n\ncriteria regarding Giardia, viruses, and total coliform counts\n\nby the end of 1997, the DEP did grant the MWRA until October 31,\n\n1998, or nearly three months later than allowed by the ACO, to\n\nreapply for a filtration waiver.        Accepting that invitation, the\n\nMWRA submitted a follow-up request to the DEP on October 30,\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f1998.    In that request, the MWRA sought permission to treat its\n\nwater using ozonation and chloramine disinfection only.                          The\n\nMWRA also proposed that the savings realized from not installing\n\na filtration facility be spent on a pipeline replacement plan\n\nand stepped-up monitoring program.                On November 13, 1998, the\n\nDEP formally approved the request, finding that the MWRA had\n\ncome into compliance with all of the SWTR's avoidance criteria\n\nand concluding that the MWRA had developed satisfactory plans\n\nfor improving the quality of its water.                      The DEP's action\n\neffectively excused the MWRA from having to install a filtration\n\nsystem for the time being; however, the approval made clear that\n\nany future violation of any of the avoidance criteria would\n\nresult in revocation of the waiver and reimposition of the\n\nfiltration requirement.\n\nC.          The Proceedings Below\n\n            Meanwhile, on February 12, 1998, the United States had\n\nfiled the instant SDWA lawsuit on behalf of the EPA.                             The\n\nlawsuit sought an injunction ordering the MWRA to comply with\n\nthe filtration requirement set out in the Act and the Rule.                      The\n\ndistrict     court,        while    permitting    some     initial      discovery,\n\neffectively        stayed     the    case   for   nearly     a   full     year    in\n\nanticipation of the DEP's disposition of the MWRA's filtration-\n\nwaiver request.        Once the DEP approved the request, the United\n\nStates     moved     for     summary    judgment,    citing      uncontradicted\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fevidence of the MWRA's past failures to meet the avoidance\n\ncriteria and its continued refusal to install a filtration\n\nsystem.          Its position was augmented by the MWRA's acknowledgment\n\nthat,       in    January   1999,    it   had    failed   to   meet   one    of   the\n\navoidance criteria at the Wachusett Reservoir -- in this case,\n\nthe standard relating to fecal coliform concentration.10                     The EPA\n\nsubsequently asked the DEP to revoke the MWRA's filtration\n\nwaiver based on this violation, but the DEP declined to do so.\n\nSince the January 1999 avoidance-criteria failure, the MWRA's\n\nrecord of providing safe drinking water has been unblemished.\n\n                 On May 3, 1999, the district court ruled on the United\n\nStates's motion for summary judgment.                 While noting the DEP's\n\nNovember 1998 finding that the MWRA had come into compliance\n\nwith     all       the   avoidance    criteria      and   opining     that    \"this\n\nconclusion might have been conclusive of the litigation,\" the\n\ncourt found that the           MWRA's January 1999 violation \"entitles\n\nthe EPA to a judicial declaration that the MWRA is liable under\n\n\n\n       10\n      The MWRA asserts that the January 1999 fecal coliform\nfailure was illusory, in that the relevant water samples barely\nmissed meeting the acceptable levels of bacterial colonies and\nthat the testing during that period was conducted at tolerance\nlevels and frequencies far more rigorous than those required by\nthe SWTR and other EPA guidelines. The district court noted,\nhowever, that the MWRA failed to raise the testing-technique\nissue in opposition to the United States's motion for partial\nsummary judgment.      MWRA II, 97 F. Supp. 2d at 176.\nConsequently, it found the testing method used by the MWRA in\nJanuary 1999 to be \"a fact of no legal significance.\" Id. at\n189.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fthe SDWA for injunctive relief and civil penalties.\"               MWRA I, 48\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 70.\n\n           The district court went on to hold, however, that,\n\nbased on the principle that the discretion of courts to fashion\n\nequitable remedies as appropriate may only be circumvented by a\n\n\"clear legislative command,\" the court retained the discretion\n\nto determine the type of relief that should be granted.                  Id. at\n\n71 (citing Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110699\"><a href=\"/opinion/110699/weinberger-v-romero-barcelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313\n\n(1982)).        While   acknowledging        a   statement   in    the    Act's\n\nlegislative history to the effect that courts shall not use\n\n\"traditional balancing principles used by equity courts\" in\n\nruling on SDWA suits, id. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 93-1185 (1974),\n\nreprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6454, 6476), the court determined\n\nthat the judicial-enforcement provision of the Act contained\n\nlanguage \"descriptive of the traditional powers of a court of\n\nchancery\" and that the statute did not \"impos[e] the same narrow\n\nmandate\" on courts to enforce violations of its substantive\n\nprovisions that it placed on the EPA to promulgate rules.

In the final analysis, the court discerned no clear\n\ncommand    that     courts     \"limit       [themselves]     to    mechanical\n\nenforcement of EPA compliance orders,\" id., although it did find\n\na \"presumption expressed by Congress in the SDWA that filtration\n\nwill   almost    always   be   the   preferred      remedy   for   a[n]    SWTR\n\nviolation.\"     Id. at 72.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            Having   determined       that    it   possessed    the    equitable\n\ndiscretion to withhold the filtration remedy, the district court\n\nordered a bench trial to determine whether, in fact, it was\n\nappropriate to exercise such discretion with respect to the\n\nMWRA.   As the court saw it, the issue to be tried was whether\n\n\"the MWRA's alternative strategy of ozonation, chlorination, and\n\npipe replacement [will] better serve Congress's objective of\n\nproviding 'maximum feasible protection of the public health'\n\nthan will the EPA's insistence on filtration.\"                  Id.\n\n            Between December 1999 and February 2000, the district\n\ncourt presided over a twenty-four day bench trial in which it\n\nheard from twenty-three witnesses and entered 524 exhibits into\n\nevidence.     At trial, the United States sought to establish that\n\nfiltration combined with disinfection is much more effective\n\nagainst highly treatment-resistant pathogens, such as Giardia\n\nand Cryptosporidium, than the ozonation alternative favored by\n\nthe   MWRA.     It   also    sought    to    prove      that   the    process    of\n\nozonation, while generally effective in combating most forms of\n\nlive waterborne pathogens, may produce microbes that nourish\n\ncertain types of bacteria, thereby creating the potential for\n\n\"regrowth\" of certain pathogens in the water supply.                     For its\n\npart,   the   MWRA   noted    that    it     was   in   compliance      with    the\n\navoidance criteria at the time of trial, thereby removing the\n\nurgency of installing a filtration system.               It further attempted\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fto     demonstrate     that   its    proposed     approach     of    pipeline\n\nrehabilitation, watershed protection, and ozone and chloramine\n\ndisinfection treatments would provide more comprehensive water\n\npurification than filtration alone.\n\n              The district court issued its findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law on May 5, 2000, holding, for the first time,\n\nthat the MWRA would not be required to install a filtration\n\nsystem under present circumstances.             MWRA II, 97 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n188.       While finding that filtration combined with disinfection\n\nwas    a    superior   treatment    technique    to   the   MWRA's   proposed\n\n\"ozonation-only\" strategy, the court determined that, given the\n\nlack of an actual health issue in light of the MWRA's compliance\n\nwith the avoidance criteria at the time of trial, \"[a]ny risk to\n\npublic health entailed by selection of the 'ozone-only' option\n\nis within acceptable levels.\" Id.           In making this determination,\n\nthe court relied heavily on studies introduced at trial by the\n\nMWRA indicating that the ozonation technique could successfully\n\nkeep the concentrations of pathogens in the water supply at or\n\nbelow      the   safety   levels    specified    by   the   SWTR     avoidance\n\ncriteria.        Id.   It further found that, while the threat of\n\nbacterial \"regrowth\" posed by ozonation was real, that threat\n\ncould more effectively be addressed through pipe rehabilitation,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fflushing, and corrosion control than through filtration.11                       Id.\n\nMoreover, the court, noting the tremendous sums that the MWRA\n\nwas spending and had pledged to spend in subsequent years on\n\nhealth-related       system    improvements, 12           accepted    the     MWRA's\n\nargument that the installation of a $180 million filtration\n\nsystem would severely complicate the MWRA's efforts to take on\n\nother water purification projects, such as pipe replacement,\n\nthat    would   be   needed    with    or     without      the     presence    of   a\n\nfiltration      system.       Id.      As     to    the    issue     of   watershed\n\nprotection, the court agreed with the MWRA that the plan of\n\nacquiring lands close to the Wachusett Reservoir had proven\n\nsuccessful in creating an effective barrier against manmade\n\ncontamination, and that the implementation of a filtration plan\n\nwould       reduce   popular        support        for     maintaining        strict\n\nenvironmental protection of the protected areas.                   Id. at 187-88.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      The district court noted that the possibility of\n\"regrowth,\"   without actual evidence of heightened levels of\nbacteria, was not     a component of the SWTR's filtration-\navoidance criteria. Id. at 189.\n       12\n      In particular, the court found that the MWRA had budgeted\napproximately $1.7 billion for four major (and needed) capital\nimprovement projects: a new water supply tunnel; a covered-\nstorage facility for treated water; a new disinfection facility;\nand an ongoing water-main rehabilitation project. Id. at 169.\nAdditionally, the district court found that the MWRA had\ninstituted a successful grant program in which it was providing\n$25 million per year to its constituent cities and towns to\nimprove the safety of their local water delivery systems. Id.\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\f          In sum, the district court found the MWRA's proposed\n\ntreatment plan to be a \"sound alternative to . . . filtration\n\nwhen competing demands for limited resources and the level of\n\nrisk from all potential threats to the safety of MWRA water are\n\nconsidered.\"     Id. at 189.   The court determined that, in light\n\nof the ACO, only one avoidance criteria violation remained\n\nrelevant -- the fecal coliform violation in January 1999 -- and\n\nthat, based on that single SWTR violation and the myriad efforts\n\nundertaken by the MWRA to improve the quality of its water, the\n\nUnited States had not demonstrated that reallocating funds from\n\nthe   MWRA's    planned   health-related   system   improvements   to\n\nfiltration was warranted.      Id.   Consequently, the court denied\n\nthe United States's request for injunctive relief.          Id.    It\n\nretained jurisdiction, however, to facilitate reexamination of\n\nthe decision in the event that future circumstances warrant it.\n\nId.   This appeal followed.\n\n               II. Equitable Discretion under the SDWA\n\n          On appeal, the United States does not challenge any of\n\nthe district court's factual findings, including the court's\n\ndetermination that the MWRA's \"ozonation-only\" approach is an\n\nacceptable alternative to filtration.         Nor does the United\n\nStates assert that the district court        abused its equitable\n\ndiscretion by declining to order filtration in light of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fMWRA's history of avoidance-criteria noncompliance.13                            Instead,\n\nits appeal essentially is confined to one argument: that under\n\nthe SDWA, courts have no discretion to withhold indefinitely a\n\nprovided-for     remedy,       such       as    filtration,        if     it   has   been\n\ndemonstrated     that    a     public          water    system      has    violated     a\n\nsubstantive     requirement         of    the    Act.        The    district     court's\n\ndetermination regarding the scope of its equitable discretion\n\npresents    a   pure     issue       of    law,        and   so     we    review     that\n\ndetermination de novo.

It also\ncontends that it has not been estopped from pointing out the\nMWRA's pre-1999 violations by its failure to block the ACO.\nHowever, as the United States states in its brief, under its\ntheory of the case -- that a district court does not have the\ndiscretion to excuse SWTR violations -- the additional\nviolations are essentially irrelevant, as even one failure to\nmeet the avoidance criteria after the December 30, 1991 deadline\ncreates an ongoing violation that triggers the filtration\nobligation under the Rule.\n\n                                          -26-\n\f(1944).

Rather, it argues that the judicial-enforcement\n\nprovision of the SDWA, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3(b), when read along\n\nwith the rest of the Act, admits of only one appropriate outcome\n\nin cases where a water system fails an avoidance criterion: the\n\ndelinquent water system must be directed to install a filtration\n\nsystem.    Accordingly, in the United States's view, the SDWA does\n\ncreate a \"necessary and inescapable inference\" that courts may\n\nnot decline to order filtration whenever a violation of the Act\n\nor the rules promulgated thereunder has been established.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\f            In reaching this conclusion, the United States focuses\n\non the SDWA's judicial-enforcement provision, 42 U.S.C. § 300g-\n\n3(b), which states, in relevant part:\n\n            The [EPA] Administrator may bring a civil\n            action in the appropriate United States\n            district court to require compliance with\n            any applicable requirement [of the Act] . .\n            . .

In this respect, the United States contends that\n\nthe case at bar is most akin to Hill, a decision in which the\n\nSupreme Court found that the district court did not have the\n\nequitable discretion under the Endangered Species Act to decline\n\nthe issuance of an injunction if it found that a violation of\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fthe statute's substantive provisions had occurred.               437 U.S. at\n\n193-95.\n\n          To bolster this argument, the United States adverts to\n\na   passage    from   §    300g-3(b)'s    legislative      history    that,   it\n\nargues,   evinces         congressional     intent   to    diminish    courts'\n\nequitable discretion under the SDWA.

As mentioned in Part I,\n\nsupra, Congress amended the Act in 1986 to enhance the level of\n\nenforcement under the SDWA.

We disagree. This\nprovision merely authorizes state enforcement agencies, who\nwould otherwise be obliged to bring an enforcement action for\navoidance-criteria violations, see id. § 300g-3(a)(1)(B)\n(requiring the EPA to bring suit for substantive SDWA violation\nif state enforcement agency fails timely to do so), to permit\ncompliance with the Act by means other than filtration for\ncertain types of water systems. The amendment does not touch\nupon the power of the court to issue -- or not issue -- an\ninjunction.\n\n                               -38-\n\f477, 506 (1979) (\"If . . . the legislation explicitly requires\n\nthat 'an injunction must issue,' a court . . . has no choice but\n\nto comply.

In this case, courts usually retain their full equitable\n\ndiscretion.\").\n\n          Our conclusion on the SDWA's preservation of equitable\n\ndiscretion also is reinforced by other portions of the Act's\n\njudicial-enforcement provision.      While the United States relies\n\nheavily on language in § 300g-3(b) referring to compliance with\n\nthe Act, and specifically on statements to the effect that the\n\nEPA Administrator is authorized to \"bring a civil action . . .\n\nto require compliance\" and that a court hearing an SDWA suit\n\n\"may enter . . . such judgment as protection of public health\n\nmay require, taking into consideration the time necessary to\n\ncomply,\" we find that such language, when compared to similar\n\nlanguage in other federal enforcement statutes, does not compel\n\nthe conclusion that the court must issue an injunction.\n\n          Take, for example, the provision empowering the EPA to\n\nbring a civil action \"to require compliance.\"        Similar language\n\nappears in a number of other statutes' judicial-enforcement\n\nprovisions, and generally has been construed as leaving intact\n\nthe judiciary's equitable discretion to deny the issuance of an\n\ninjunction.

Another\n\nexample of this usage, albeit in a slightly different context,\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fappears in the citizen-suit provision of the Clean Water Act;\n\nunder this statute, suits may not be instituted by individuals\n\nor organizations if the EPA or the appropriate state enforcement\n\nauthority \"has commenced and is diligently pursuing a civil or\n\ncriminal action . . . to require compliance\" with the Act's\n\nsubstantive provisions.             33 U.S.C. § 1365(b)(1)(B) (emphasis\n\nadded).       Despite this reference to \"requir[ing] compliance\" in\n\nthe statutory language, the Supreme Court held in Romero-Barcelo\n\nthat the Clean Water Act does not require the issuance of an\n\ninjunction in all cases where a statutory violation has been\n\nidentified.         456 U.S. at 313 (holding that \"[t]he grant of\n\njurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests\n\na duty to do so under any and all circumstances\").                   These\n\nexamples demonstrate that a statutory provision that gives an\n\nagency the power to litigate \"to require compliance,\" without\n\nmore, does not necessarily obligate the court asked to rule on\n\nsuch a suit to issue any particular remedy.19\n\n               The other passage in § 300g-3(b) referred to by the\n\nUnited States -- the one stating that courts are to consider\n\n\"the        time   necessary   to    comply   and   the   availability   of\n\nalternative water supplies\" in fashioning equitable relief -- is\n\nbetter construed to mean that, to the extent a court issues a\n\n\n\n       19\n      As we note infra, we believe that the district court did\nrequire compliance with the SDWA in this case.\n\n                                       -41-\n\f\"judgment as public health may require\" that does include the\n\nfiltration remedy (which, as the district court noted, will\n\nusually be the case), it must allow the public water system\n\nreasonable   time   to   comply   in   light   of   the   availability   of\n\nalternative water sources.        From the command that a court must\n\nconsider the time necessary to comply when it does order a\n\n\"judgment as public health may require,\" however, it does not\n\nnecessarily follow that the court must always exact the type of\n\ncompliance sought by the agency whenever a violation of the Act\n\nhas been identified.     This construction is supported by the fact\n\nthat, in spite of the ubiquitousness of the term \"compliance\" in\n\n§ 300g-3(b), courts are not expressly limited by the statute to\n\nentering judgments that \"require compliance,\" but instead have\n\nbeen granted the leeway to issue \"judgment[s] as protection of\n\npublic health may require.\"        Cf.

Porter, 328 U.S. at 398.\n\n          The United States insists that, in terms of breadth of\n\nequitable discretion, the SDWA bears an uncanny resemblance to\n\nthe Endangered Species Act (ESA) -- a statute found by the\n\nSupreme Court to have removed courts' authority to withhold\n\ninjunctive relief.   Hill, 437 U.S. at 193-95.       In Hill, the\n\nSupreme Court found that the ESA had flatly banned federal\n\nagencies from carrying out activities which threaten to destroy\n\nor modify the habitat of endangered species.         Id. at 194.\n\nThrough an examination of the statute's voluminous text and\n\nlegislative history, the Court found that Congress \"ha[d] spoken\n\nin the plainest of words, making it abundantly clear that the\n\nbalance had been struck in favor of affording endangered species\n\nthe highest of priorities . . . .\"         Id.   In so finding,\n\nmoreover, the Court essentially ignored the statute's judicial-\n\nenforcement provision, 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g), which, far from\n\nexpressly requiring the issuance of an injunction upon the\n\nfinding of a statutory violation, merely gives district courts\n\n\"jurisdiction . . . to enforce any . . . provision\" of the Act.20\n\n\n     20\n      This apparent omission was noted in a dissent by then-\nJustice Rehnquist, who, after taking note of the provision,\ndetermined that it was not strong enough to eliminate the\n\n                              -43-\n\fAttempting to tether this case to that precedent, the United\n\nStates flags what it sees as analogous indicia of legislative\n\nintent with respect to the filtration mandate in the SDWA, and\n\nurges us to overlook the similarly permissive nature of the\n\nSDWA's judicial-enforcement provision.\n\n           While there is force to this argument, in the final\n\nanalysis we do not believe that it holds water.                      The principal\n\nproblem with the United States's effort to juxtapose the ESA and\n\nthe SDWA is that, for reasons discussed above, the overwhelming\n\nevidence of congressional intent that the Supreme Court found in\n\nHill   simply   does    not    exist     with   respect    to     the     filtration\n\nmandate in the SDWA.       The United States points us to no specific\n\nevidence that the narrow goal of filtration (as opposed to the\n\nbroader   aim   of     safe    drinking       water)   was      to    receive    the\n\noverarching priority that endangered-species protection garnered\n\nunder the ESA.       As the district court noted, by imposing the\n\ndisinfection mandate directly even as it imposed the filtration\n\nremedy    indirectly,         Congress     \"stopped       short      of     ordering\n\nfiltration as an all-encompassing preventive.\"                    MWRA II, 97 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 165.       As for the Supreme Court's failure to consider\n\nthe language of the ESA's judicial-enforcement provision in\n\nHill, we note that in subsequent cases, such as United States v.\n\n\n\npresumption of retained equitable discretion.                Hill, 437 U.S. at\n211-13 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n\n                                       -44-\n\fOakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, the Court has found that\n\npiece of legislative evidence to be particularly relevant in\n\nascertaining the extent to which equitable discretion had been\n\nretained.

Whether or not the approach\n\ntaken in Hill with respect to the ESA is still \"good law,\" we\n\nare not persuaded that a similar approach is appropriate here.\n\n            Apart from its arguments concerning the text of the\n\nSDWA, the United States also pursues a broader line of attack in\n\nthis appeal: that the district court's decision excuses an\n\nongoing statutory violation, and therefore exceeds the scope of\n\nequitable discretion that may be exercised under any statute.\n\nWhile    acknowledging     the    Supreme    Court's      statement     that   \"a\n\nfederal     judge   sitting      as   chancellor     is    not     mechanically\n\nobligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law,\"\n\nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. at 313, the United States contends that\n\nthe Court has never authorized courts to do what it claims the\n\ndistrict court did in this case -- namely, to permit a water\n\nsystem    in   violation    of    the   SDWA    to   remain      in   violation\n\nindefinitely.       In pressing this argument, the United States\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\fpoints to three of the Court's seminal cases in this area from\n\nthe last century:      Hecht Co., Romero-Barcelo, and          Village of\n\nGambell. Even though the Supreme Court endorsed the district\n\ncourt's   exercise    of   equitable   discretion   in    each   of   those\n\ndecisions,   the     United   States   correctly    observes     that   the\n\ndistrict court's order in all three cases was designed to lead\n\nto compliance with the relevant statute.21               By declining to\n\norder the MWRA to install a filtration system, the United States\n\ncontends, the district court was unfaithful to these precedents\n\nby \"allow[ing] the MWRA to remain out of compliance with the\n\nSDWA and the SWTR permanently.\"\n\n          We agree that in all three of these cases -- and,\n\nindeed, in all cases in which the Supreme Court has spoken in\n\nthis area -- the violating party was not permitted to evade the\n\nsubstantive requirements of the statute.       We disagree, however,\n\n\n    21In Hecht Co., the defendant had remedied its past\nviolations of the Emergency Price Control Act, and the district\ncourt had found that those transgressions were not likely to\nrecur. 321 U.S. at 325-26. In Romero-Barcelo, the Court noted\nthat the violator (the Navy) was likely in the near future to\nreceive the permit it needed to comply with the Federal Water\nPollution Control Act amendments to the Clean Water Act, and\nfound that the statute's judicial-enforcement provision \"permits\nthe district court to order that relief it considers necessary\nto secure prompt compliance with the Act.\"      456 U.S. at 320\n(emphasis added). And in Village of Gambell, the Court found\nthat because oil companies needed to receive further approval\nfrom the Secretary of the Interior before engaging in drilling\noff the coast of Alaska, the district court was not required,\nunder the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, to\nenjoin the companies' activities based on their past failures to\nmeet the Act's procedural requirements. 480 U.S. at 544.\n\n                                  -46-\n\fwith the United States's argument that the court is permitting\n\nnoncompliance in this case.                \"[W]hen a court of equity exercises\n\nits   discretion,        it       may    not      consider      the    advantages       and\n\ndisadvantages of nonenforcement of the statute, but only the\n\nadvantages and disadvantages of employing the extraordinary\n\nremedy    of    injunction         over     the     other      available      methods    of\n\nenforcement.\"          Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop., 121 S. Ct. at\n\n1722 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).                           Because\n\nthe court's order is designed to ensure that the Act's paramount\n\nobjective      of    safe       drinking       water    remains      fulfilled    in    the\n\nfuture, the district court did not, as the United States argues,\n\nsanction perpetual noncompliance with the Act.                          See Village of\n\nGambell, 480 U.S. at 544 (directing courts charged with ensuring\n\ncompliance      with        a    statute       to      focus    on    \"the    underlying\n\nsubstantive         policy      the     process        was   designed    to    effect\").\n\nContrary to the situation in Hill, this is not a case where\n\n\"Congress' order of priorities, as expressed in the statute,\n\nwould be deprived of effect if the District Court could choose\n\nto deny injunctive relief.\"                Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop., 121\n\nS. Ct. at 1721 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Hill,\n\n437 U.S. at 194).\n\n            Although the EPA is correct that filtration is an\n\nabsolute requirement under the SDWA/SWTR regime for those water\n\nsystems     that      fail       to     meet     the     avoidance      criteria,       the\n\n\n                                            -47-\n\fpreeminence of filtration in bringing about the goal of safe\n\ndrinking water is primarily a function of the Rule, not the Act.\n\nThe purpose of the Act, in the words of its drafters, is to\n\n\"assure    that   water     supply   systems      serving    the       public   meet\n\nminimum national standards for protection of public health.\"\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 93-1185,         reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6454,\n\n6454.     In other words, the framers of the Act were concerned\n\nwith ensuring that consumers of public water systems have access\n\nto safe drinking water, with the safety of the water to be\n\njudged according to objective criteria developed by the EPA.\n\nFiltration, while serving an important role in furtherance of\n\nthe objective of safe water, is merely a prophylactic remedy\n\nmade available to help bring about that objective.                        One fact\n\nunderscores this point particularly well, and demonstrates why\n\nthe exercise of equitable discretion is especially appropriate\n\nwith respect to this particular regulatory scheme: under the\n\nAct, if a water system never violates any of the avoidance\n\ncriteria, its water is presumptively \"safe\" according to the\n\nSDWA,   regardless     of    whether    it     ever   installs     a    filtration\n\nsystem.     In essence, the water system's compliance with the\n\navoidance    criteria       makes    the      water   safe   from       the     EPA's\n\nperspective -- a point conceded by the United States at trial.\n\nWe fail to see how accomplishment of the Act's substantive goals\n\nis   undermined   by   overlooking         past   violations     of     regulatory\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fdeadlines that have no bearing on the current or future purity\n\nof the water delivered to consumers.            See Romero-Barcelo, 456\n\nU.S. at 310 (noting that purpose of injunctive relief is to\n\ndeter future violations, not to punish past ones) (citing Hecht\n\nCo., 321 U.S. at 329-30); cf.

Moreover, given that the district court has\n\nretained jurisdiction in this case for the purpose of policing\n\nany    future    violation,     thereby    allowing    it   to   revisit   the\n\nvalidity of its earlier decision not to order filtration, the\n\nUnited States has a ready forum in which to seek relief for any\n\nfuture avoidance-criteria violations.            See Romero-Barcelo, 456\n\nU.S. at 320 (\"Should it become clear that . . . compliance with\n\nthe [statute] will not be forthcoming, the statutory scheme and\n\npurpose would require the court to reconsider the balance it has\n\nstruck.\").\n\n              Besides the issue of ongoing supervision to ensure\n\ncompliance, the case at bar bears a close similarity to Romero-\n\nBarcelo in at least one other respect: the district court's\n\nfocus on the relevant statute's substantive purposes, rather\n\nthan    its     technical   requirements.       In    Romero-Barcelo,      the\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fplaintiffs   claimed   that,   by    allowing   the   Navy    to   continue\n\nbombing   exercises    on   Vieques    Island   without      first      having\n\nobtained a discharge permit, the court was countenancing an\n\nongoing statutory violation -- namely, the unpermitted discharge\n\nof   ordnance   into   navigable      waters.     456     U.S.     at    314.\n\nDisagreeing with this characterization, the Supreme Court found\n\nthat, by tying future Navy activities to its procurement of a\n\ndischarge permit, the district court had \"neither ignored the\n\nstatutory violation nor undercut the purpose and function of the\n\npermit system.\"    Id. at 315.        This was the case, according to\n\nthe Court, because \"[t]he integrity of the Nation's waters, . .\n\n. not the permit process, is the purpose of the [statute].\"                Id.\n\nat 314.   So it is here: the manifest purpose of the SDWA is safe\n\ndrinking water, not filtration.\n\n          Of course, we are aware that the filtration mandate is,\n\nin some meaningful way, more \"substantive\" than the FWPCA's\n\npermit requirement, and that, through the 1986 amendments to the\n\nSDWA, Congress expressed its intent that filtration should be\n\nused by water systems that fail to meet the standards for\n\navoidance established by the EPA.          But in the end, we believe\n\nthat we would do far greater violence to both the text and the\n\npurpose of the SDWA were we to strip courts of the flexibility\n\nto shape equitable decrees in appropriate situations.              For as we\n\nnoted infra, under § 300g-3(b), courts are authorized to issue\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\f\"judgments   as    protection   of   public   health   may   require.\"\n\nMoreover, by retaining jurisdiction in this case, the district\n\ncourt has assumed the responsibility of ensuring that, through\n\ncontinued oversight of the MWRA's avoidance-criteria compliance,\n\nthe MWRA's water supply will remain \"safe\" according to the\n\nEPA's standards.\n\n         The United States's final contention -- in reality, it\n\nis nothing more than a variation on the basic theme of its\n\nappeal -- is that the district court, by holding a trial on the\n\npropriety of applying the filtration requirement to the MWRA,\n\narrogated to itself powers that had been placed by Congress in\n\nthe hands of the EPA.     In its view, the district court's trial\n\namounted to little more than an improper reconsideration of the\n\ndeterminations that the EPA made in promulgating the Rule.\n\nUnder the SDWA, the United States argues, such considerations\n\nare the exclusive province of experts in the EPA, not the\n\ncourts, and if the district court's decision is left to stand,\n\nevery water system that finds itself displeased with the SWTR's\n\nrigid requirements will have the opportunity to challenge the\n\nwisdom of the Rule as applied to it.\n\n         This line of reasoning only is valid as far as it goes\n\n-- and it does not go as far as the United States suggests.         It\n\nis certainly true that, in delegating authority to the EPA to\n\nascertain circumstances in which \"filtration . . . is required\"\n\n\n                                 -51-\n\fof    public    water     systems,        42    U.S.C.    §    300g-1(b)(7)(C)(i),\n\nCongress      entrusted     the     EPA    with    the    power    to   make     policy\n\njudgments with respect to the factors that would make filtration\n\nmandatory.      It is also true that, as a general matter, those\n\njudgments are not to be second-guessed by courts.                            But policy\n\ndeterminations in statutes and regulations that Congress chooses\n\nto have enforced through suits in equity are always subject to\n\ncourts' equitable discretion -- that is, at least to the extent\n\nthat Congress has preserved discretion in the statute and has\n\nnot proscribed, through its expressions of policy, the type of\n\nequitable remedy that a court seeks to implement.                        If Congress\n\nhas    left    the   door    open    to     a    court   to    exercise       equitable\n\ndiscretion respecting enforcement of a statute such as the SDWA,\n\nand the court senses that the equities of the case may favor\n\nalternative means of exacting compliance with the statute ( i.e.,\n\nother than the issuance of an injunction), the court does not\n\nexceed the boundaries of its authority by conducting fact-\n\nfinding for the purpose of determining how best to wield its\n\ndiscretion      in   light    of     the       priorities      established      in    the\n\nstatute.      The district court did not hold a trial to revisit the\n\nunderlying wisdom of the SWTR; rather, it held a trial to\n\nascertain whether, based on both the particular facts of this\n\ncase    and    the   substantive          goals    of    the    Act,    it    was    more\n\nappropriate to order filtration or to permit the MWRA to pursue\n\n\n                                           -52-\n\fits alternative approach to the extent that it could satisfy the\n\nRule's avoidance criteria and ultimately provide a safer water\n\nsupply.\n\n            In sum, with respect to the SDWA, a court must \"take\n\nas given the value choices embodied in the statutes and policies\n\nadministered      by   the   [agency],   but   is   entitled   and   in   fact\n\nrequired to consider whether the enforcement of the [agency's]\n\norder would violate equitable principles that are neutral with\n\nregard to those value choices.\"          NLRB v.

In our view, this is\n\nprecisely what the district court did in this case.\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n            Under the SDWA, it should be a rare case in which a\n\nviolation of regulatory standards does not lead to an injunction\n\nif the responsible enforcement agency requests one.              This is so\n\nbecause, as the district court in this case properly found, the\n\nSDWA contains a \"presumption expressed by Congress . . . that\n\nfiltration will almost always be the preferred remedy for a[n]\n\nSWTR violation.\"       MWRA I, 48 F. Supp. 2d at 72.       Expressions by\n\nCongress of this sort, once identified, must be respected by\n\ncourts,    lest    equitable     discretion     become   the    judiciary's\n\npreferred method of reshaping policy determinations made by\n\nother branches of government that are better equipped to make\n\nthem.     But the district court, after carefully considering the\n\n\n                                    -53-\n\ffacts,    found    that    this    was    indeed     such   a    rare    case,   and\n\naccordingly declined to issue an injunction.                    In rendering this\n\njudgment, the court was careful to shape its decision so as to\n\nensure that the MWRA's drinking water will meet the avoidance-\n\ncriteria standards that are the EPA's benchmarks for safety.                       It\n\nexercised the flexibility left to it by Congress in the statute,\n\nand    assumed     the    responsibility        of   monitoring         the   MWRA's\n\ncompliance    in    the    event    that    future     violations        require    a\n\nreexamination of the decision not to order filtration.                             In\n\nshort, the district court used its equitable discretion to\n\nappropriate ends: furthering the substantive purposes of the\n\nAct.     In so doing, it did not act outside the scope of its\n\nauthority with respect to the specific statute at issue in\n\ndeclining to issue an injunction.                  Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt's judgment is\n\n           Affirmed.       No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -54-\n\f</pre>",
