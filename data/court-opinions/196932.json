In 1992,  plaintiff Sheikh  Bashir Ahmed,\r                            \r\n\nM.D. was discharged from his one-year term of employment as a\r\n\nresident in internal medicine at defendant Berkshire  Medical\r\n\nCenter,   Inc.,  ostensibly  because  of  unsatisfactory  job\r\n\nperformance.   Plaintiff  responded  by  filing  the  instant\r\n\naction in which he complained, inter alia, of national origin\r                                                     \r\n\ndiscrimination, denial of due process and breach of contract.\r\n\nSome ten  months  later, while  in  the midst  of  discovery,\r\n\nplaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction  reinstating him\r\n\nto the  residency position  pending final disposition  of his\r\n\nallegations.    From  the  district court's  denial  of  such\r\n\nrequest, plaintiff now appeals on an interlocutory basis.  He\r\n\nalso  seeks to appeal from a district court order denying him\r\n\nleave to amend his complaint.\r\n\n     We perceive no error in the district court's decision to\r\n\ndeny preliminary  injunctive relief.   The court  applied the\r\n\nproper  rule  of  law,  having  invoked  the  four-part  test\r\n\ngoverning  such  determinations.    See,  e.g.,  Narragansett\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndian  Tribe v.  Guilbert, 934  F.2d 4,  5 (1st  Cir. 1991).\r                                      \r\n\nAccordingly,  \"[t]he  only  real   question  is  whether  the\r\n\ndistrict  court misused  [its] discretion  in evaluating  the\r\n\ncircumstances and calibrating the scales.\"  Independent Oil &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nChem.

Busey, 79 F.3d 1250, 1271  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n1996) (taking note of the lower courts' \"broad discretion\" in\r\n\nthis regard).   On the basis of the limited record before it,\r\n\nthe  district   court  concluded  that   plaintiff  had   not\r\n\ndemonstrated a probability of success on the merits, that  he\r\n\nhad not established irreparable harm, and that the balance of\r\n\nequities  and the  public  interest both  tilted in  favor of\r\n\ndenying  injunctive relief.   Having  reviewed the  record in\r\n\nfull, and  having scrutinized  the court's findings  \"under a\r\n\nrelatively deferential glass,\" Procter  &amp; Gamble, 864 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n929, we find no abuse of discretion.1\r                                                1\r\n\n     Plaintiff insists that his  eventual success at trial is\r\n\na foregone conclusion.  Yet much of the evidence  on which he\r\n\nrelies is conclusory or otherwise inadmissible.  It turns out\r\n\nthat  the parties'  respective evidentiary  submissions, when\r\n\njuxtaposed,  do  little  to  resolve the  underlying  factual\r\n\ndisputes,   particularly   concerning   the   rationale   for\r\n\nplaintiff's termination.2   And the district  court cannot be\r                                    2\r\n\nfaulted   for  concluding  that,  until  the  allegations  of\r\n\nunsatisfactory   job   performance   have    been   resolved,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   Given  our  disposition of  the  merits, we  need  not\r               1\r\naddress defendant's contention  that jurisdiction is  lacking\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.    1292(a)(1)  to review this  ruling.   See,\r                                                                        \r\ne.g., Narragansett Indian Tribe, 934 F.2d at 8 n.5.\r                                           \r\n\n   2    With  respect to  his  due  process  claim, plaintiff\r               2\r\nobjects  that the  lower  court overlooked  an allegation  of\r\nstate  action in his complaint.  That such an allegation does\r\nappear  therein does not disturb the  conclusion that, on the\r\npresent record, plaintiff has not established a likelihood of\r\nsuccess with respect to any of his claims. \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's  reinstatement to a position \"with responsibility\r\n\nfor  life and death  decisions,\" Order at  8, might adversely\r\n\naffect the public interest.\r\n\n     Plaintiff's  appeal from  the  denial of  his motion  to\r\n\namend falters on  a different basis: we  lack jurisdiction at\r\n\nthis juncture to  review such an order.   It is well  settled\r\n\nthat \"denial of a request to amend a complaint is not usually\r\n\nappealable  as an  interlocutory  matter.\"   Kartell v.
