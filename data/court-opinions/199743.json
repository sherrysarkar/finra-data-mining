Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Danny M.

Danny   M.    Kelly   appeals   from   the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 cause of\n\naction for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 12(b)(6).   The only issue is whether Kelly’s complaint\n\nchallenging the town of Chelmsford’s taking of a portion of\n\nhis property through eminent domain was ripe for review.\n\n         In his complaint, Kelly alleged a number of reasons\n\nin support of his assertion that the taking of his property\n\nwas improper, including that it was not taken for a public\n\nuse, that the taking reduced his property value, and that he\n\ndid not receive adequate compensation for the taking.\n\n         In this circuit, “exhaustion of state law remedies\n\n-- whatever form they may take -- is a precondition to the\n\nmaintenance of a federal damages action under the Takings\n\nClause . . . .”   Ochoa Realty Corp. v. Faria, 815 F.2d 812,\n\n817 (1st Cir. 1987); see also          Marietta Realty, Inc. v.\n\nSpringfield Redevelopment Authority, 902 F.Supp. 310, 313\n\n(D. Mass. 1995) (plaintiff must first invoke the available\n\nmechanisms for compensation from the defendant in order to\n\nripen a claim under the Fifth Amendment).           This is true\n\nwhether the alleged wrongful taking is a result of negligent\n\nor intentional conduct.   Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533\n\f(1984).   The    Massachusetts inverse condemnation statute,\n\nMass.Gen.L. ch. 79, provides such a remedy.\n\n          As Kelly conceded in his complaint below, the town\n\nof Chelmsford took his property through eminent domain in\n\norder to build a sewerage pumping station, very much a\n\npublic use of the property.     The gravamen of his complaint\n\nin the district court was an explicit challenge to the\n\nadequacy of the proffered compensation as well as a request\n\nfor damages.    As such, the district court properly dismissed\n\nthe complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) as not ripe for review\n\nbecause of Kelly’s failure to first attempt to avail himself\n\nof the Massachusetts inverse condemnation statute.        The\n\ndistrict court’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
