Lawrence  Estrella was convicted\r                                      \r\n\nof being a \"felon in possession\" of a firearm in violation of\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1)  and  sentenced as  an  armed  career\r\n\ncriminal.    Id.    924(e)(1).   His  appeal  raises  various\r                            \r\n\nissues, the most difficult being  whether he is excepted from\r\n\nthe  felon-in-possession statute  as one  whose civil  rights\r\n\nhave been restored and  whose right to firearms has  not been\r\n\nsignificantly restricted under state law.  Id.   921(a)(20).\r                                                          \r\n\n     Estrella's long  criminal record  began in 1967  when he\r\n\nwas  17 years  old.   Pertinently, in  January 1977,  he pled\r\n\nguilty in  Massachusetts state  court to assault  and battery\r\n\nwith  a dangerous  weapon (a  motor vehicle)  and received  a\r\n\nprison sentence of 3 to 10 years.  He escaped from custody on\r\n\nJuly 2, 1978, and proceeded to commit crimes in two different\r\n\nstates for which he was convicted in 1980:  armed robbery and\r\n\narmed assault in Massachusetts,  and breaking and entering an\r\n\noccupied dwelling in Michigan.\r\n\n     Estrella  received a  10-to-15 year prison  sentence for\r\n\nthe Massachusetts armed robbery and assault, and a concurrent\r\n\n7-to-15  year  prison  term  for  the  Michigan  crime.    On\r\n\nSeptember 28, 1987, Estrella  was released from Massachusetts\r\n\nstate  prison and placed on parole until the year 2003, later\r\n\nreduced to June 1, 1999.   He moved to New Hampshire  in 1990\r\n\nand his parole supervision  was transferred to New Hampshire.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nHe now had three \"violent felony\"  convictions on his record.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(e)(1).\r\n\n     On  February  16, 1994,  Estrella  went  to a  federally\r\n\nlicensed firearms dealership in Goffstown, New Hampshire, and\r\n\npurchased a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, allegedly as a\r\n\ngift for his wife.  The owner  of the dealership had received\r\n\nthe gun from a  distributor in Massachusetts.  In  the course\r\n\nof  the  purchase,   Estrella  completed   an  ATF   Firearms\r\n\nTransaction Record,  see 27  C.F.R.    178.124(c);  on it  he\r                                    \r\n\nanswered, inaccurately, that he  had not been convicted  of a\r\n\ncrime punishable by a term exceeding one year.\r\n\n     Having  learned of  the purchase  from the  local police\r\n\nchief in Estrella's  town, agents of  the Bureau of  Alcohol,\r\n\nTobacco and Firearms obtained  a warrant to search Estrella's\r\n\nresidence for  firearms and related  documents.  A  search of\r\n\nEstrella's home occurred  on March 8, 1994.  Estrella arrived\r\n\nduring the  search,  and on  being  advised of  the  warrant,\r\n\nEstrella said he wanted  to cooperate and signed a  waiver of\r\n\nhis  Miranda  rights.   He then  escorted  the agents  to his\r                        \r\n\ngarage and showed them where the pistol was located.\r\n\n     A federal  grand jury  indicted Estrella  as a  felon in\r\n\npossession,  18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1), and  for making  a false\r\n\nstatement  in the  purchase  of a  firearm, id.    922(a)(6).\r                                                           \r\n\nRelated  New  Hampshire  state  charges  were  dismissed  and\r\n\nEstrella was tried in  federal court in September 1995.   The\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\njury convicted Estrella  of violating section 922(g)(1),  but\r\n\ndeadlocked   on  the  section   922(a)(6)  count,  which  the\r\n\ngovernment later  abandoned.   Because of his  three violent-\r\n\nfelony  convictions,  Estrella was  sentenced  to 216  months\r\n\nimprisonment.  He now appeals.\r\n\n     At the outset  we reject,  as an issue  settled in  this\r\n\ncircuit,  Estrella's  argument  that section 922(g)  facially\r\n\nexceeds Congress'  power under  the Commerce Clause.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Blais,  98   F.3d  647,  649  (1st  Cir.   1996).\r                             \r\n\nEstrella's  \"as-applied\"  challenge also  fails,  because the\r\n\ngovernment offered evidence that  the pistol he purchased had\r\n\nmoved in interstate commerce.   Our precedent also forecloses\r\n\nEstrella's cursory  Tenth Amendment challenge to  the federal\r\n\nfirearm regulations.   United States v. Minnick,  949 F.2d 8,\r                                                           \r\n\n10-11 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 995 (1992).\r                                               \r\n\n     The main question, which we consider de novo, is whether\r                                                             \r\n\nfederal law  prohibited Estrella from  obtaining the  pistol.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for \r\n\n     any  person .  . .  who has  been convicted  in any\r\n     court of, a crime  punishable by imprisonment for a\r\n     term  exceeding one year .  . . [to]  possess in or\r\n     affecting commerce, any  firearm or ammunition;  or\r\n     to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been\r\n     shipped or  transported  in interstate  or  foreign\r\n     commerce.\r\n\nBut  18 U.S.C.    921(a)(20) excepts  from the  definition of\r\nconviction\r\n\n     [a]ny conviction  which has  been expunged,  or set\r\n     aside or for  which a person  has been pardoned  or\r\n     has had  civil rights  restored .  . .  unless such\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights\r\n     expressly provides  that the  person may not  ship,\r\n     transport, possess, or receive firearms.\r\n\nBut  for this exception, Estrella fell within the main ban of\r\n\nsection 922(g)(1); the troublesome  issues are whether he had\r\n\nhis civil  rights restored and,  if so, whether  the \"unless\"\r\n\nclause applies in his case.\r\n\n     We   consider   first    whether   Massachusetts,    the\r\n\njurisdiction   of  the  \"predicate   offense,\"  had  restored\r\n\nEstrella's   civil  rights.     (The  government   relied  on\r\n\nEstrella's Michigan  conviction only as  a predicate  offense\r\n\nfor  sentencing  under  section  924(e)(1), and  not  in  his\r\n\nindictment  for   violating  section  922(g)(1).)    In  this\r\n\ncircuit, the civil  rights that must  be restored to  trigger\r\n\nthe  exception are the rights to vote, to hold public office,\r\n\nand to serve on a jury.  United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1, 2\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 2569 (1996).\r                                              \r\n\n     This  court has held  that all  three core  civil rights\r\n\nmust be restored  for a  person to avoid  the prohibition  of\r\n\nsection 922(g).   United States v.  Indelicato, 97 F.3d  627,\r                                                          \r\n\n631 &amp; n.3  (1st Cir.  1996).  In  Massachusetts, a  convicted\r\n\nfelon does not lose the right to vote.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 54,\r\n\n   86, 103B.   And  Estrella  was no  longer incarcerated  in\r\n\nFebruary 1994, so  he could  now hold public  office.   Mass.\r\n\nGen.  L. ch. 279,   30.   Nevertheless, the government argues\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nthat  Estrella's  right  to serve  on  a  jury  had not  been\r\n\nsufficiently restored when he purchased the pistol.\r\n\n     Massachusetts disqualifies from  jury service any person\r\n\nwho \"has been  convicted of  a felony within  the past  seven\r\n\nyears or is a defendant  in pending felony case or is  in the\r\n\ncustody of  a correctional institution.\"   Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\r\n\n234A,    4(7).    Estrella's   conviction  in  1980  for  the\r\n\npredicate offense, the  armed assault  and robbery,  occurred\r\n\nmore  than seven years  prior to his  purchase of  the gun in\r\n\n1994.  The government claims, however,  that in 1994 Estrella\r\n\nwas still \"in  the custody of a correctional  institution\" by\r\n\ndint of his continuing parole status.\r\n\n     The  government cites  federal  decisions  holding  that\r\n\nparole  constitutes \"custody\"  for purposes  such as  federal\r\n\nhabeas  jurisdiction.  E.g., United States  v. Flynn, 49 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n11, 14 (1st  Cir. 1995)  (citing cases).   But \"custody\"  has\r\n\nbeen defined broadly in this context for  reasons peculiar to\r\n\nhabeas corpus, Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 430 (1984);\r                                              \r\n\nand  under section  921(a)(20),  state  law  governs  whether\r\n\nEstrella is barred from serving on juries.  Beecham v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates,  511  U.S.  368  (1994).    We  have  not  found  any\r                  \r\n\nMassachusetts  decisions  that decide  whether  a  parolee is\r\n\nbarred from service.\r\n\n     While the term \"custody\" is elastic, it is doubtful that\r\n\na paroled prisoner  would normally be  described as being  in\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nthe custody  \"of a  correctional institution.\"   Further, the\r\n\nSupreme  Judicial Court  has referred  in passing  to section\r\n\n4(7) as  disqualifying prospective  jurors on the  grounds of\r\n\n\"incarceration  or conviction  of  a felony  within the  past\r                          \r\n\nseven years.\"  Commonwealth v. Tolentino, 663 N.E.2d 846, 849\r                                                    \r\n\nn.3 (Mass. 1996) (emphasis added).  Massachusetts also  has a\r\n\nstatutory definition of \"correctional  institution,\" defining\r\n\nit  in physical  terms  and referring  to  its use  \"for  the\r\n\ncustody  . .  .  of committed  offenders  and of  such  other\r\n\npersons as may be placed in  custody therein . . . .\"   Mass.\r\n\nGen. L. ch. 125,    1(d), (e).\r\n\n     Despite  these  scraps  of statute  and  precedent, some\r\n\nmight  think it  odd that a  felon still on  parole should be\r\n\nseated  on  a  jury.   Still,  circumstances  vary,  and  the\r\n\nimmediate issue is  simply whether  Massachusetts imposes  an\r\n\nautomatic  ban.   We think  this is  a matter that  the state\r\n\nsupreme court could probably decide either way,  but--pending\r\n\nsuch clarification--our best assessment is that Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw does  not automatically disqualify a  parolee seven years\r\n\nafter conviction.\r\n\n     As a  fall-back argument, the government  says that even\r\n\nif Estrella could  in theory serve  on a jury,  Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw  so curtails the opportunity for any ex-felon to serve as\r\n\na  juror that  this  civil right  has  not been  sufficiently\r\n\nrestored  to  satisfy section  921(a)(20).     By  statute, a\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nMassachusetts trial judge  can choose to  remove from a  jury\r\n\npanel a  person  convicted  of  any  felony  or  other  crime\r\n\npunishable by imprisonment of more than one year.  Mass. Gen.\r\n\nL. ch.  234,    8.   In Caron we  left open  the problem  now\r                                         \r\n\nposed.  77 F.3d at 6. \r\n\n     We join  other circuits in  concluding that to  meet the\r\n\ntest of  section 921(a)(20),  each of  the three core  \"civil\r\n\nrights\" must be substantially, but  not perfectly, restored.1\r\n\nIn  applying this test, we are guided by the rationale behind\r\n\nCongress'  use of  \"civil rights  restored\" as  a touchstone:\r\n\nthe notion  that  by reinvesting  a  person with  core  civic\r\n\nresponsibilities, the  state vouches for  the trustworthiness\r\n\nof that  person to  possess  firearms (unless  that right  is\r\n\nwithheld).  Indelicato, 97 F.3d at 630.\r                                  \r\n\n     While  regarding the matter as close,  we think that the\r\n\nMassachusetts legislature has expressed the requisite, albeit\r\n\nunquantifiable, measure  of confidence in  ex-felons such  as\r\n\nEstrella so far as concerns jury service.  Our view rests not\r\n\nonly on the language of  section 8 but on what we  take to be\r\n\nits philosophy.   Almost a century ago, the  Supreme Judicial\r\n\nCourt said that:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1E.g., United States  v.

Michigan law\r                                            \r\n\nis thus more hostile to  service by ex-felons than is the  law of\r\n\nMassachusetts.\r\n\n     Although all  three of  Estrella's core civil  rights were\r\n\nrestored  by  Massachusetts,  his prior  felony  conviction still\r\n\ncounts  as  a  predicate   offense  if  Massachusetts  \"expressly\r\n\nprovide[d]\" that he \"may not ship, transport, possess, or receive\r\n\nfirearms,\"  18  U.S.C.    921(a)(20),  \"firearm\"   being  broadly\r\n\ndefined to include inter alia handguns, shotguns and rifles.  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n921(a)(3).   Estrella objects  that his  parole papers  nowhere\r\n\nexpressly provide that he  could not own firearms; but  his civil\r\n\nrights were not restored by pardon, or by his  parole papers, but\r\n\nby  state statutes.    And  in  such  a  situation,  we  look  to\r\n\nMassachusetts  law as  a  whole for  the \"express\"  restrictions.\r\n\nUnited States v. Sullivan, 98 F.3d 686, 689 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                   \r\n\n     Some  might think  it  perverse to  look to  Massachusetts\r\n\nfirearms law when  the purchase was made  in New Hampshire.   But\r\n\nthe trigger  for the federal ban is the Massachusetts conviction;\r                                      \r\n\nand  the ban  is  removed only  if  Massachusetts has  shown  the\r\n\nrequisite confidence  in the  ex-felon by restoring  civil rights\r\n\nwithout limiting firearms ownership.   (New Hampshire, of course,\r\n\nis free to impose its own limitations on gun ownership within the\r\n\nstate,  but they do  not control the  federal ban one  way or the\r\n\nother here.)   \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     In Massachusetts, an  ex-felon released  from custody  for\r\n\nmore  than five years  can obtain a  firearm identification card,\r\n\nMass. Gen.  L. ch. 140,    129B, which  permits one to  possess a\r\n\nhandgun  (any firearm with a barrel of  less than 16 inches, or a\r\n\nshort-barrel shotgun) in  his residence or place  of business and\r\n\nto possess a rifle or long-barrel shotgun anywhere.  Id. ch. 269,\r                                                                  \r\n\n10(a).  But in  Massachusetts a convicted felon cannot  carry a\r\n\nhandgun anywhere else, id.  ch. 140,    125, 131, 131F;  ch. 269,\r                                    \r\n\n10(a); never can  purchase, rent  or lease a  handgun, id.  ch.\r                                                                      \r\n\n140,    131A; and never can sell, rent or lease to another person\r\n\nany firearms, ch. 140,   122.\r\n\n     In assessing this patchwork  of restrictions, little  help\r\n\nis  provided by  the federal  statute's language--\"may  not ship,\r\n\ntransport, possess,  or  receive firearms\"--since  this  language\r\n\ndoes not tell us how much restriction is needed where some rights\r\n\nare  permitted and  others  forbidden.   The legislative  history\r\n\nrefers only to  the \"right to  firearm ownership\"  as if it  were\r\n\nindivisible.   S. Rep.  No. 583, 98th  Cong., 2d Sess.  7 (1984).\r\n\nPossibly  Congress  never considered  the case  in which  the ex-\r\n\nfelon's right to own firearms was restricted in some ways but not\r\n\nothers.\r\n\n     Four  of  the   circuits  that   have  construed   section\r\n\n921(a)(20)  conclude that it does not protect the ex-felon if the\r\n\nstate  continues in  any  way to  restrict significantly  the ex-\r\n\nfelon's right to \"ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nUnder  this \"all or nothing\" approach, it does not matter whether\r\n\nthe particular weapon possessed by the defendant was permitted or\r\n\nforbidden by state law.  The Sixth and Tenth Circuits so construe\r\n\nthe \"exception to the exception,\" and the Seventh and Eighth come\r\n\nto about the same  result by treating firearms privileges  as one\r\n\nofthecivil rightsthatmustbe restoredtotriggersection 921(a)(20).2\r\n\n     By contrast, the Ninth Circuit makes the federal ban apply\r\n\nonly if  the ex-felon is found to possess a weapon that state law\r\n\nforbids  to him.   United States v.  Dahms, 938  F.2d 131, 134-35\r                                                    \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1991);  see also  United States v.  Tomlinson, 67  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n508, 513  (4th Cir. 1995);  but see  United States v.

Thus, if Estrella had bought a\r\n\nlong-barreled  shotgun, the  federal  ban would  not here  apply.\r\n\nThis  approach has patent virtues:   it respects  the state's own\r\n\nchoice;  it  may provide  better warning  to  the ex-felon  if he\r                                                                        \r\n\nremains in his state of conviction; and it is probably easier for\r\n\ncourts  to administer in the first instance (by asking what state\r\n\nlaw permits as to this weapon).\r                                \r\n\n     But the Ninth Circuit's  approach is less persuasive  as a\r\n\nreading of the statute.   It strains the literal language of  the\r\n\n\"unless\" proviso,  see Driscoll, 970  F.2d at 1480-81;  and while\r                                         \r\n\nthe federal statute  does in some measure defer to  state law, it\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Compare Driscoll,  970 F.2d at 1480,  and United States\r                                                                         \r\nv.

We have overridden literal language where it appeared\r\n\ninadvertent and  undermined Congress'  aim.   Id.   But requiring\r                                                           \r\n\nthat the  state permit the untrammeled possession  of firearms is\r\n\nfully   consistent  with   the  trustworthiness   rationale  that\r\n\nunderpins the \"civil rights restored\" provision itself.\r\n\n     The  Ninth  Circuit  approach   might  give  some  limited\r\n\nprotection  to a defendant who  remains in the  state of original\r\n\nconviction  and who honestly  relies on state law;  but it is not\r\n\nclear  that this is a common case,  and (as we explain below) the\r\n\nstatute does  not require  willfulness at  all.   As for  ease of\r\n\nadministration, Congress  in drafting  the statute certainly  did\r\n\nnot have  this value high on its list, and the plurality approach\r\n\nof cases  like Driscoll requires more  work in the first  case to\r                                 \r\n\nassess the law  of the state  but less work  in subsequent  cases\r\n\ninvolving the same state.\r\n\n     Under the  plurality approach, which we  choose to follow,\r\n\nwe  think that  Massachusetts' ban  on handgun possession  by ex-\r\n\nfelons outside the home or business is a substantial enough limit\r\n\non firearms rights  to preserve  the federal ban.   Other  courts\r\n\nhave  taken the  same  view in  assessing  other state  statutes.\r\n\nUnited  States  v.

He argues first that he  lacked the\r\n\nrequisite scienter because he believed  that his civil rights had\r\n\nbeen restored.  But this panel  is bound by the earlier ruling in\r\n\nthis circuit that  under section 922(g), \"the government need not\r\n\nprove that the defendant knowingly  violated the law; rather,  it\r\n\nonly  need prove  . .  . that  the defendant  knowingly possessed\r\n\nfirearms.\"  United States  v.

The\r                                 \r\ncourt's reasoning is different than ours, consistent in some\r\nrespects and not in others, but its result for Massachusetts\r\nex-felons is the same.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nharshly with the defendant in the rare case of  a truly innocent-\r\n\nminded violation.\r\n\n     Estrella is  not in this category.   He was told  when his\r\n\nparole supervision was transferred to New Hampshire that he could\r\n\nnot possess firearms.   Although his brief says that  by February\r\n\n1994 the New Hampshire  parole rules had lapsed, it  appears that\r\n\nNew Hampshire  state law  independently prohibited  Estrella from\r\n\npossessing the pistol and there is some  indication that Estrella\r\n\nwas so warned.  Further, Estrella's outright lie on the ATF form,\r\n\ndenying that he had ever been convicted for a crime punishable by\r\n\nat least one year in prison, is not the act of an innocent man.\r\n\n     Because  a  mistake of  law was  no  defense, we  need not\r\n\ndiscuss  at  length  two  other  claims  by  Estrella:  that  the\r\n\ngovernment should not have been  allowed to introduce evidence of\r\n\nthe New  Hampshire parole rules  and that defense  counsel should\r\n\nhave offered evidence that the rules had lapsed.  Apparently, the\r\n\ngovernment's  evidence  was offered  without  objection.   It  is\r\n\nenough that neither piece  of evidence had much bearing  upon the\r\n\nissues  properly before  the  jury or  was  likely to  alter  the\r\n\nresult.\r\n\n     Next,  Estrella  says  that  the search  warrant  did  not\r\n\nauthorize entry into  his garage.   The warrant  approved by  the\r\n\ndistrict court permitted the search of the \"residence of Lawrence\r\n\nR. Estrella,  . . . more  particularly described as  a blue cape-\r\n\nstyle  house with  a breezeway  connecting a  two-car  garage and\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nlocated 450 feet uphill on  Tiffany Hill Road . . . .\"   We agree\r\n\nwith  the district  court that  the  common-sense meaning  of the\r\n\nwarrant was that  the area  to be searched  included the  garage.\r\n\nAccord  United  States v.

Id. &#167; 924(e)(1).  His appeal raises various issues, the most difficult being whether he is excepted from the felon-in-possession statute as one whose civil rights have been restored and whose right to firearms has not been significantly restricted under state law.  Id. &#167; 921(a)(20).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella's long criminal record began in 1967 when he was 17 years old.  Pertinently, in January 1977, he pled guilty in Massachusetts state court to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a motor vehicle) and received a prison sentence of 3 to 10 years.  He escaped from custody on July 2, 1978, and proceeded to commit crimes in two different states for which he was convicted in 1980:  armed robbery and armed assault in Massachusetts, and breaking and entering an occupied dwelling in Michigan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella received a 10-to-15 year prison sentence for the Massachusetts armed robbery and assault, and a concurrent 7-to-15 year prison term for the Michigan crime.  On September 28, 1987, Estrella was released from Massachusetts state prison and placed on parole until the year 2003, later reduced to June 1, 1999.  He moved to New Hampshire in 1990 and his parole supervision was transferred to New Hampshire.  He now had three \"violent felony\" convictions on his record.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1994, Estrella went to a federally licensed firearms dealership in Goffstown, New Hampshire, and purchased a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, allegedly as a gift for his wife.  The owner of the dealership had received the gun from a distributor in Massachusetts.  In the course of the purchase, Estrella completed an ATF Firearms Transaction Record, see 27 C.F.R. &#167; 178.124(c);  on it he answered, inaccurately, that he had not been convicted of a crime punishable by a term exceeding one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having learned of the purchase from the local police chief in Estrella's town, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms obtained a warrant to search Estrella's residence for firearms and related documents.  A search of Estrella's home occurred on March 8, 1994.  Estrella arrived during the search, and on being advised of the warrant, Estrella said he wanted to cooperate and signed a waiver of his Miranda rights.  He then escorted the agents to his garage and showed them where the pistol was located.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted Estrella as a felon in possession, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), and for making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm, id. &#167; 922(a)(6).  Related New Hampshire state charges were dismissed and Estrella was tried in federal court in September 1995.  The jury convicted Estrella of violating section 922(g)(1), but deadlocked on the section 922(a)(6) count, which the government later abandoned.  Because of his three violent-felony convictions, Estrella was sentenced to 216 months imprisonment.  He now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset we reject, as an issue settled in this circuit, Estrella's argument that section 922(g) facially exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.  United States v. Blais, 98 F.3d 647, 649 (1st Cir.1996).  Estrella's \"as-applied\" challenge also fails, because the government offered evidence that the pistol he purchased had moved in interstate commerce.  Our precedent also forecloses Estrella's cursory Tenth Amendment challenge to the federal firearm regulations.  United States v. Minnick, 949 F.2d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 995, 112 S.Ct. 1698, 118 L.Ed.2d 408 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main question, which we consider de novo, is whether federal law prohibited Estrella from obtaining the pistol.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>any person ... who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... [to] possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition;  or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20) excepts from the definition of conviction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But for this exception, Estrella fell within the main ban of section 922(g)(1);  the troublesome issues are whether he had his civil rights restored and, if so, whether the \"unless\" clause applies in his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider first whether Massachusetts, the jurisdiction of the \"predicate offense,\" had restored Estrella's civil rights.  (The government relied on Estrella's Michigan conviction only as a predicate offense for sentencing under section 924(e)(1), and not in his indictment for violating section 922(g)(1).)   In this circuit, the civil rights that must be restored to trigger the exception are the rights to vote, to hold public office, and to serve on a jury.  United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.)  (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2569, 135 L.Ed.2d 1085 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that all three core civil rights must be restored for a person to avoid the prohibition of section 922(g).  United States v. Indelicato, 97 F.3d 627, 631 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1996).  In Massachusetts, a convicted felon does not lose the right to vote.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 54, &#167;&#167; 86, 103B.  And Estrella was no longer incarcerated in February 1994, so he could now hold public office.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 279, &#167; 30.  Nevertheless, the government argues that Estrella's right to serve on a jury had not been sufficiently restored when he purchased the pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts disqualifies from jury service any person who \"has been convicted of a felony within the past seven years or is a defendant in pending felony case or is in the custody of a correctional institution.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 234A, &#167; 4(7).  Estrella's conviction in 1980 for the predicate offense, the armed assault and robbery, occurred more than seven years prior to his purchase of the gun in 1994.  The government claims, however, that in 1994 Estrella was still \"in the custody of a correctional institution\" by dint of his continuing parole status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites federal decisions holding that parole constitutes \"custody\" for purposes such as federal habeas jurisdiction.  E.g., United States v. Flynn, 49 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.1995) (citing cases).  But \"custody\" has been defined broadly in this context for reasons peculiar to habeas corpus, Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 430, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1143-44, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984);  and under section 921(a)(20), state law governs whether Estrella is barred from serving on juries.  Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).  We have not found any Massachusetts decisions that decide whether a parolee is barred from service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the term \"custody\" is elastic, it is doubtful that a paroled prisoner would normally be described as being in the custody \"of a correctional institution.\"   Further, the Supreme Judicial Court has referred in passing to section 4(7) as disqualifying prospective jurors on the grounds of \"incarceration or conviction of a felony within the past seven years.\"  Commonwealth v. Tolentino, 422 Mass. 515, 663 N.E.2d 846, 849 n. 3 (1996) (emphasis added).  Massachusetts also has a statutory definition of \"correctional institution,\" defining it in physical terms and referring to its use \"for the custody ... of committed offenders and of such other persons as may be placed in custody therein....\"  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 125, &#167;&#167; 1(d), (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these scraps of statute and precedent, some might think it odd that a felon still on parole should be seated on a jury.  Still, circumstances vary, and the immediate issue is simply whether Massachusetts imposes an automatic ban.  We think this is a matter that the state supreme court could probably decide either way, but--pending such clarification--our best assessment is that Massachusetts law does not automatically disqualify a parolee seven years after conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fall-back argument, the government says that even if Estrella could in theory serve on a jury, Massachusetts law so curtails the opportunity for any ex-felon to serve as a juror that this civil right has not been sufficiently restored to satisfy section 921(a)(20).  By statute, a Massachusetts trial judge can choose to remove from a jury panel a person convicted of any felony or other crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 234, &#167; 8.  In Caron we left open the problem now posed.  77 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We join other circuits in concluding that to meet the test of section 921(a)(20), each of the three core \"civil rights\" must be substantially, but not perfectly, restored.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In applying this test, we are guided by the rationale behind Congress' use of \"civil rights restored\" as a touchstone:  the notion that by reinvesting a person with core civic responsibilities, the state vouches for the trustworthiness of that person to possess firearms (unless that right is withheld).  Indelicato, 97 F.3d at 630.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While regarding the matter as close, we think that the Massachusetts legislature has expressed the requisite, albeit unquantifiable, measure of confidence in ex-felons such as Estrella so far as concerns jury service.  Our view rests not only on the language of section 8 but on what we take to be its philosophy.  Almost a century ago, the Supreme Judicial Court said that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>in this commonwealth it is not the law that persons convicted of crime shall be permanently deprived of their civil rights.  Our legislation, more humane and charitable than the law of early times, recognizes the possibility of repentance and reformation....  [T]here is nothing to prevent the board from putting upon the jury list the name of a former criminal, if they find him to be of good moral character and otherwise suitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commonwealth v. Wong Chung, 186 Mass. 231, 71 N.E. 292, 293 (1904).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right of the trial judge to dismiss an ex-felon under section 8 appears to be a safeguard, allowing the trial judge to dismiss the ex-felon out of hand wherever his record, or the nature of the case, warrants that course;  without this provision, a judge might have to give a particularized reason.  Thus viewed, this qualification does not appear to detract from the Wong Chung view that in Massachusetts an ex-felon after seven years and release from jail is presumptively trusted to serve on a jury.  Accord United States v. Caron, 941 F.Supp. 238, 246 (D.Mass.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construing a somewhat similar state restriction, two circuits have held that Michigan does not restore the civil rights of felons.  United States v. Metzger, 3 F.3d 756, 759 (4th Cir.1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1006, 114 S.Ct. 1374, 128 L.Ed.2d 50 (1994);  United States v. Driscoll, 970 F.2d 1472, 1478-79 (6th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1083, 113 S.Ct. 1056, 122 L.Ed.2d 362 (1993).  But Michigan court rules require automatic exclusion of felons as jurors whenever a party so moves, and also direct courts to excuse convicted felons sua sponte from jury panels in criminal cases, once that ground for exclusion is established.  Metzger, 3 F.3d at 759.   Michigan law is thus more hostile to service by ex-felons than is the law of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although all three of Estrella's core civil rights were restored by Massachusetts, his prior felony conviction still counts as a predicate offense if Massachusetts \"expressly provide[d]\" that he \"may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20), \"firearm\" being broadly defined to include inter alia handguns, shotguns and rifles.  Id. &#167; 921(a)(3).  Estrella objects that his parole papers nowhere expressly provide that he could not own firearms;  but his civil rights were not restored by pardon, or by his parole papers, but by state statutes.  And in such a situation, we look to Massachusetts law as a whole for the \"express\" restrictions.  United States v. Sullivan, 98 F.3d 686, 689 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some might think it perverse to look to Massachusetts firearms law when the purchase was made in New Hampshire.  But the trigger for the federal ban is the Massachusetts conviction;  and the ban is removed only if Massachusetts has shown the requisite confidence in the ex-felon by restoring civil rights without limiting firearms ownership.  (New Hampshire, of course, is free to impose its own limitations on gun ownership within the state, but they do not control the federal ban one way or the other here.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, an ex-felon released from custody for more than five years can obtain a firearm identification card, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 140, &#167; 129B, which permits one to possess a handgun (any firearm with a barrel of less than 16 inches, or a short-barrel shotgun) in his residence or place of business and to possess a rifle or long-barrel shotgun anywhere.  Id. ch. 269, &#167; 10(a).  But in Massachusetts a convicted felon cannot carry a handgun anywhere else, id. ch. 140, &#167;&#167; 125, 131, 131F;  ch. 269, &#167; 10(a);  never can purchase, rent or lease a handgun, id. ch. 140, &#167; 131A;  and never can sell, rent or lease to another person any firearms, ch. 140, &#167; 122.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing this patchwork of restrictions, little help is provided by the federal statute's language--\"may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms\"--since this language does not tell us how much restriction is needed where some rights are permitted and others forbidden.  The legislative history refers only to the \"right to firearm ownership\" as if it were indivisible.  S.Rep. No. 583, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1984).  Possibly Congress never considered the case in which the ex-felon's right to own firearms was restricted in some ways but not others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of the circuits that have construed section 921(a)(20) conclude that it does not protect the ex-felon if the state continues in any way to restrict significantly the ex-felon's right to \"ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"   Under this \"all or nothing\" approach, it does not matter whether the particular weapon possessed by the defendant was permitted or forbidden by state law.  The Sixth and Tenth Circuits so construe the \"exception to the exception,\" and the Seventh and Eighth come to about the same result by treating firearms privileges as one of the civil rights that must be restored to trigger section 921(a)(20).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Ninth Circuit makes the federal ban apply only if the ex-felon is found to possess a weapon that state law forbids to him.  United States v. Dahms, 938 F.2d 131, 134-35 (9th Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Tomlinson, 67 F.3d 508, 513 (4th Cir.1995);  but see United States v. Clark, 993 F.2d 402, 404-05 (4th Cir.1993).  Thus, if Estrella had bought a long-barreled shotgun, the federal ban would not here apply.  This approach has patent virtues:  it respects the state's own choice;  it may provide better warning to the ex-felon if he remains in his state of conviction;  and it is probably easier for courts to administer in the first instance (by asking what state law permits as to this weapon).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Ninth Circuit's approach is less persuasive as a reading of the statute.  It strains the literal language of the \"unless\" proviso, see Driscoll, 970 F.2d at 1480-81;  and while the federal statute does in some measure defer to state law, it does not give carte blanche to the states.  Indelicato, 97 F.3d at 629-30.   We have overridden literal language where it appeared inadvertent and undermined Congress' aim.  Id.  But requiring that the state permit the untrammeled possession of firearms is fully consistent with the trustworthiness rationale that underpins the \"civil rights restored\" provision itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit approach might give some limited protection to a defendant who remains in the state of original conviction and who honestly relies on state law;  but it is not clear that this is a common case, and (as we explain below) the statute does not require willfulness at all.  As for ease of administration, Congress in drafting the statute certainly did not have this value high on its list, and the plurality approach of cases like Driscoll requires more work in the first case to assess the law of the state but less work in subsequent cases involving the same state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plurality approach, which we choose to follow, we think that Massachusetts' ban on handgun possession by ex-felons outside the home or business is a substantial enough limit on firearms rights to preserve the federal ban.  Other courts have taken the same view in assessing other state statutes.  United States v. Wagner, 976 F.2d 354, 356 (7th Cir.1992);  Driscoll, 970 F.2d at 1481;  Burns, 934 F.2d at 1160-61.   In the future, there might be close cases where, for example, some other state's restriction is arguably de minimis;  but an ordinary Massachusetts felon will not be exempted from the federal ban.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella raises several other claims of error concerning his conviction and sentence.  He argues first that he lacked the requisite scienter because he believed that his civil rights had been restored.  But this panel is bound by the earlier ruling in this circuit that under section 922(g), \"the government need not prove that the defendant knowingly violated the law;  rather, it only need prove ... that the defendant knowingly possessed firearms.\"  United States v. Smith, 940 F.2d 710, 713 (1st Cir.1991).  Accord United States v. Capps, 77 F.3d 350, 352-53 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2568, 135 L.Ed.2d 1084 (1996);  Tomlinson, 67 F.3d at 513-14 n. 9 (distinguishing Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A risk of injustice exists wherever a legislature makes criminal conduct that some may believe to be lawful.  But the federal felon-in-possession statute does not impose a statutory minimum term, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(b), so long as the defendant is not a three-time violent felon, id. &#167; 924(e)(1).  Even if a jury can be found to convict, sentencing judges are not likely to deal harshly with the defendant in the rare case of a truly innocent-minded violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella is not in this category.  He was told when his parole supervision was transferred to New Hampshire that he could not possess firearms.  Although his brief says that by February 1994 the New Hampshire parole rules had lapsed, it appears that New Hampshire state law independently prohibited Estrella from possessing the pistol and there is some indication that Estrella was so warned.  Further, Estrella's outright lie on the ATF form, denying that he had ever been convicted for a crime punishable by at least one year in prison, is not the act of an innocent man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a mistake of law was no defense, we need not discuss at length two other claims by Estrella:  that the government should not have been allowed to introduce evidence of the New Hampshire parole rules and that defense counsel should have offered evidence that the rules had lapsed.  Apparently, the government's evidence was offered without objection.  It is enough that neither piece of evidence had much bearing upon the issues properly before the jury or was likely to alter the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Estrella says that the search warrant did not authorize entry into his garage.  The warrant approved by the district court permitted the search of the \"residence of Lawrence R. Estrella, ... more particularly described as a blue cape-style house with a breezeway connecting a two-car garage and located 450 feet uphill on Tiffany Hill Road....\"  We agree with the district court that the common-sense meaning of the warrant was that the area to be searched included the garage.

Although we could treat those arguments as abandoned, see United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992), the length of the mandatory sentence has led us to examine each argument on the merits, but none appears to have force.

Pertinently, in January 1977, he pled guilty in Massachusetts state court to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a motor vehicle) and received a prison sentence of 3 to 10 years.  He escaped from custody on July 2, 1978, and proceeded to commit crimes in two different states for which he was convicted in 1980:  armed robbery and armed assault in Massachusetts, and breaking and entering an occupied dwelling in Michigan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella received a 10-to-15 year prison sentence for the Massachusetts armed robbery and assault, and a concurrent 7-to-15 year prison term for the Michigan crime.  On September 28, 1987, Estrella was released from Massachusetts state prison and placed on parole until the year 2003, later reduced to June 1, 1999.  He moved to New Hampshire in 1990 and his parole supervision was transferred to New Hampshire.  He now had three \"violent felony\" convictions on his record.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1994, Estrella went to a federally licensed firearms dealership in Goffstown, New Hampshire, and purchased a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, allegedly as a gift for his wife.  The owner of the dealership had received the gun from a distributor in Massachusetts.  In the course of the purchase, Estrella completed an ATF Firearms Transaction Record, see 27 C.F.R. &#167; 178.124(c);  on it he answered, inaccurately, that he had not been convicted of a crime punishable by a term exceeding one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having learned of the purchase from the local police chief in Estrella's town, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms obtained a warrant to search Estrella's residence for firearms and related documents.  A search of Estrella's home occurred on March 8, 1994.  Estrella arrived during the search, and on being advised of the warrant, Estrella said he wanted to cooperate and signed a waiver of his Miranda rights.  He then escorted the agents to his garage and showed them where the pistol was located.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted Estrella as a felon in possession, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), and for making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm, id. &#167; 922(a)(6).  Related New Hampshire state charges were dismissed and Estrella was tried in federal court in September 1995.  The jury convicted Estrella of violating section 922(g)(1), but deadlocked on the section 922(a)(6) count, which the government later abandoned.  Because of his three violent-felony convictions, Estrella was sentenced to 216 months imprisonment.

(The government relied on Estrella's Michigan conviction only as a predicate offense for sentencing under section 924(e)(1), and not in his indictment for violating section 922(g)(1).)

In Massachusetts, a convicted felon does not lose the right to vote.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 54, &#167;&#167; 86, 103B.  And Estrella was no longer incarcerated in February 1994, so he could now hold public office.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 279, &#167; 30.  Nevertheless, the government argues that Estrella's right to serve on a jury had not been sufficiently restored when he purchased the pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts disqualifies from jury service any person who \"has been convicted of a felony within the past seven years or is a defendant in pending felony case or is in the custody of a correctional institution.\"   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 234A, &#167; 4(7).  Estrella's conviction in 1980 for the predicate offense, the armed assault and robbery, occurred more than seven years prior to his purchase of the gun in 1994.  The government claims, however, that in 1994 Estrella was still \"in the custody of a correctional institution\" by dint of his continuing parole status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites federal decisions holding that parole constitutes \"custody\" for purposes such as federal habeas jurisdiction.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span> (1994).  We have not found any Massachusetts decisions that decide whether a parolee is barred from service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the term \"custody\" is elastic, it is doubtful that a paroled prisoner would normally be described as being in the custody \"of a correctional institution.\"   Further, the Supreme Judicial Court has referred in passing to section 4(7) as disqualifying prospective jurors on the grounds of \"incarceration or conviction of a felony within the past seven years.\"  Commonwealth v. Tolentino, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></span>, 849 n. 3 (1996) (emphasis added).  Massachusetts also has a statutory definition of \"correctional institution,\" defining it in physical terms and referring to its use \"for the custody ... of committed offenders and of such other persons as may be placed in custody therein....\"  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 125, &#167;&#167; 1(d), (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these scraps of statute and precedent, some might think it odd that a felon still on parole should be seated on a jury.  Still, circumstances vary, and the immediate issue is simply whether Massachusetts imposes an automatic ban.  We think this is a matter that the state supreme court could probably decide either way, but--pending such clarification--our best assessment is that Massachusetts law does not automatically disqualify a parolee seven years after conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fall-back argument, the government says that even if Estrella could in theory serve on a jury, Massachusetts law so curtails the opportunity for any ex-felon to serve as a juror that this civil right has not been sufficiently restored to satisfy section 921(a)(20).  By statute, a Massachusetts trial judge can choose to remove from a jury panel a person convicted of any felony or other crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year.  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 234, &#167; 8.  In Caron we left open the problem now posed.  77 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We join other circuits in concluding that to meet the test of section 921(a)(20), each of the three core \"civil rights\" must be substantially, but not perfectly, restored.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In applying this test, we are guided by the rationale behind Congress' use of \"civil rights restored\" as a touchstone:  the notion that by reinvesting a person with core civic responsibilities, the state vouches for the trustworthiness of that person to possess firearms (unless that right is withheld).  Indelicato, 97 F.3d at 630.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While regarding the matter as close, we think that the Massachusetts legislature has expressed the requisite, albeit unquantifiable, measure of confidence in ex-felons such as Estrella so far as concerns jury service.  Our view rests not only on the language of section 8 but on what we take to be its philosophy.  Almost a century ago, the Supreme Judicial Court said that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>in this commonwealth it is not the law that persons convicted of crime shall be permanently deprived of their civil rights.  Our legislation, more humane and charitable than the law of early times, recognizes the possibility of repentance and reformation....

Thus viewed, this qualification does not appear to detract from the Wong Chung view that in Massachusetts an ex-felon after seven years and release from jail is presumptively trusted to serve on a jury.

But Michigan court rules require automatic exclusion of felons as jurors whenever a party so moves, and also direct courts to excuse convicted felons sua sponte from jury panels in criminal cases, once that ground for exclusion is established.  Metzger, 3 F.3d at 759.   Michigan law is thus more hostile to service by ex-felons than is the law of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although all three of Estrella's core civil rights were restored by Massachusetts, his prior felony conviction still counts as a predicate offense if Massachusetts \"expressly provide[d]\" that he \"may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20), \"firearm\" being broadly defined to include inter alia handguns, shotguns and rifles.  Id. &#167; 921(a)(3).  Estrella objects that his parole papers nowhere expressly provide that he could not own firearms;  but his civil rights were not restored by pardon, or by his parole papers, but by state statutes.  And in such a situation, we look to Massachusetts law as a whole for the \"express\" restrictions.  United States v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197048\"><a href=\"/opinion/197048/united-states-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 689 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some might think it perverse to look to Massachusetts firearms law when the purchase was made in New Hampshire.  But the trigger for the federal ban is the Massachusetts conviction;  and the ban is removed only if Massachusetts has shown the requisite confidence in the ex-felon by restoring civil rights without limiting firearms ownership.  (New Hampshire, of course, is free to impose its own limitations on gun ownership within the state, but they do not control the federal ban one way or the other here.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Massachusetts, an ex-felon released from custody for more than five years can obtain a firearm identification card, Mass.Gen.L. ch. 140, &#167; 129B, which permits one to possess a handgun (any firearm with a barrel of less than 16 inches, or a short-barrel shotgun) in his residence or place of business and to possess a rifle or long-barrel shotgun anywhere.  Id. ch. 269, &#167; 10(a).  But in Massachusetts a convicted felon cannot carry a handgun anywhere else, id. ch. 140, &#167;&#167; 125, 131, 131F;  ch. 269, &#167; 10(a);  never can purchase, rent or lease a handgun, id. ch. 140, &#167; 131A;  and never can sell, rent or lease to another person any firearms, ch. 140, &#167; 122.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing this patchwork of restrictions, little help is provided by the federal statute's language--\"may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms\"--since this language does not tell us how much restriction is needed where some rights are permitted and others forbidden.  The legislative history refers only to the \"right to firearm ownership\" as if it were indivisible.  S.Rep. No. 583, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1984).  Possibly Congress never considered the case in which the ex-felon's right to own firearms was restricted in some ways but not others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of the circuits that have construed section 921(a)(20) conclude that it does not protect the ex-felon if the state continues in any way to restrict significantly the ex-felon's right to \"ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"   Under this \"all or nothing\" approach, it does not matter whether the particular weapon possessed by the defendant was permitted or forbidden by state law.  The Sixth and Tenth Circuits so construe the \"exception to the exception,\" and the Seventh and Eighth come to about the same result by treating firearms privileges as one of the civil rights that must be restored to trigger section 921(a)(20).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Ninth Circuit makes the federal ban apply only if the ex-felon is found to possess a weapon that state law forbids to him.  United States v. Dahms, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564457\"><a href=\"/opinion/564457/united-states-v-michael-lee-dahms/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span>, 134-35 (9th Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Tomlinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705917\"><a href=\"/opinion/705917/united-states-v-calvin-lamont-tomlinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 513 (4th Cir.1995);  but see United States v. Clark, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606682\"><a href=\"/opinion/606682/united-states-v-albert-thomas-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 404-05 (4th Cir.1993).  Thus, if Estrella had bought a long-barreled shotgun, the federal ban would not here apply.  This approach has patent virtues:  it respects the state's own choice;  it may provide better warning to the ex-felon if he remains in his state of conviction;  and it is probably easier for courts to administer in the first instance (by asking what state law permits as to this weapon).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Ninth Circuit's approach is less persuasive as a reading of the statute.  It strains the literal language of the \"unless\" proviso, see Driscoll, 970 F.2d at 1480-81;  and while the federal statute does in some measure defer to state law, it does not give carte blanche to the states.  Indelicato, 97 F.3d at 629-30.   We have overridden literal language where it appeared inadvertent and undermined Congress' aim.  Id.  But requiring that the state permit the untrammeled possession of firearms is fully consistent with the trustworthiness rationale that underpins the \"civil rights restored\" provision itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit approach might give some limited protection to a defendant who remains in the state of original conviction and who honestly relies on state law;  but it is not clear that this is a common case, and (as we explain below) the statute does not require willfulness at all.  As for ease of administration, Congress in drafting the statute certainly did not have this value high on its list, and the plurality approach of cases like Driscoll requires more work in the first case to assess the law of the state but less work in subsequent cases involving the same state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plurality approach, which we choose to follow, we think that Massachusetts' ban on handgun possession by ex-felons outside the home or business is a substantial enough limit on firearms rights to preserve the federal ban.  Other courts have taken the same view in assessing other state statutes.  United States v. Wagner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591433\"><a href=\"/opinion/591433/united-states-v-frederick-d-wagner/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">354</span></a></span>, 356 (7th Cir.1992);  Driscoll, 970 F.2d at 1481;  Burns, 934 F.2d at 1160-61.   In the future, there might be close cases where, for example, some other state's restriction is arguably de minimis;  but an ordinary Massachusetts felon will not be exempted from the federal ban.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella raises several other claims of error concerning his conviction and sentence.  He argues first that he lacked the requisite scienter because he believed that his civil rights had been restored.  But this panel is bound by the earlier ruling in this circuit that under section 922(g), \"the government need not prove that the defendant knowingly violated the law;  rather, it only need prove ... that the defendant knowingly possessed firearms.\"  United States v.

But the federal felon-in-possession statute does not impose a statutory minimum term, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(b), so long as the defendant is not a three-time violent felon, id. &#167; 924(e)(1).  Even if a jury can be found to convict, sentencing judges are not likely to deal harshly with the defendant in the rare case of a truly innocent-minded violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrella is not in this category.  He was told when his parole supervision was transferred to New Hampshire that he could not possess firearms.  Although his brief says that by February 1994 the New Hampshire parole rules had lapsed, it appears that New Hampshire state law independently prohibited Estrella from possessing the pistol and there is some indication that Estrella was so warned.  Further, Estrella's outright lie on the ATF form, denying that he had ever been convicted for a crime punishable by at least one year in prison, is not the act of an innocent man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a mistake of law was no defense, we need not discuss at length two other claims by Estrella:  that the government should not have been allowed to introduce evidence of the New Hampshire parole rules and that defense counsel should have offered evidence that the rules had lapsed.  Apparently, the government's evidence was offered without objection.  It is enough that neither piece of evidence had much bearing upon the issues properly before the jury or was likely to alter the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Estrella says that the search warrant did not authorize entry into his garage.  The warrant approved by the district court permitted the search of the \"residence of Lawrence R. Estrella, ... more particularly described as a blue cape-style house with a breezeway connecting a two-car garage and located 450 feet uphill on Tiffany Hill Road....\"  We agree with the district court that the common-sense meaning of the warrant was that the area to be searched included the garage.
