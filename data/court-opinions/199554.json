This appeal — in which we have\n\nthe benefit of exemplary briefing by the parties and the various\n\namici — requires us to reconcile a triad of state interests\n\n(protecting    public   health,      maintaining    public      safety,    and\n\npreserving    access    to   medical       facilities)   with    the   First\n\nAmendment interests of those who challenge restrictions on how\n\nthey may debate issues of public concern.          We act in the context\n\nof a Massachusetts statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 120E½\n\n(the Act), which creates a floating six-foot buffer zone around\n\npedestrians and motor vehicles as they approach reproductive\n\nhealth care facilities (RHCFs).            We view that statute through\n\nthe prism of Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000), in which the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court upheld an analogous statute despite\n\nthe fact that it incidentally restricted some speech.\n\n         The    district     court     found    meaningful      distinctions\n\nbetween the Act and the Colorado statute at issue in                   Hill,\n\ndetermined     that      these       distinctions        undermined       the\n\nconstitutionality of the Act, and preliminarily enjoined the\n\nAct's enforcement.      See McGuire v. Reilly, 122 F. Supp. 2d 97,\n\n101-03 (D. Mass. 2000).          But the distinctions noted by the\n\ndistrict court do not make a dispositive difference.                      Hill\n\ncontrols, and the Act, on its face, lawfully regulates the time,\n\nplace, and manner of speech without discriminating based on\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcontent or viewpoint.        Accordingly, we reverse the district\n\ncourt's ukase.\n\n\n\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In order to frame the issues on appeal, we think it is\n\nuseful to trace the developments leading to the Act's passage,\n\nsurvey its text, and place it in the context suggested by the\n\nHill Court's decision.       With that foundation in place, we then\n\nrecount the proceedings below.\n\n                        A.   The Act's History.\n\n           By   the   late   1990s,   Massachusetts   had   experienced\n\nrepeated incidents of violence and aggressive behavior outside\n\nRHCFs.   Concerned legislators responded to these disturbances by\n\nintroducing Senate Bill No. 148, see S.B. 148, 181st Gen. Ct.,\n\nReg. Sess. (Mass. Jan. 6, 1999), reprinted in Appendix B hereto.\n\nThe bill purposed to create a fixed twenty-five foot buffer zone\n\nfrom RHCFs' entrances, exits, and driveways, and with limited\n\nexceptions, to prohibit all persons from entering, or remaining\n\nwithin, that buffer zone regardless of the person's intent or\n\nthe willingness of others to listen.         The state senate held a\n\nhearing in April of 1999.      The received testimony chronicled the\n\nharassment and intimidation that typically occurred outside\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fRHCFs.    In addition, numerous witnesses addressed the emotional\n\nand physical vulnerability of women seeking to avail themselves\n\nof abortion services, and gave accounts of the deleterious\n\neffects of overly aggressive demonstrations on patients and\n\nproviders alike.      Based in part on this testimony, the senate\n\nconcluded that existing laws did not adequately protect public\n\nsafety in areas surrounding RHCFs.             To remedy this situation,\n\nthe senate favored the creation of fixed buffer zones.                    The\n\nsponsors of the bill left no doubt that they intended the\n\nproposed law to \"increase public safety in and around [RHCFs]\"\n\nwhile    \"maintain[ing]    the   flow    of    traffic    and    prevent[ing]\n\ncongestion\" there.     S.B. 148, supra, § 1.            In the bargain, the\n\nsponsors expected the law to provide \"reasonable time, place and\n\nmanner restrictions to reconcile and protect both the First\n\nAmendment    rights   of   persons      to    express    their    views   near\n\nreproductive health care facilities and the rights of persons\n\nseeking access to those facilities to be free from hindrance,\n\nharassment, intimidation and harm.\" It thereby would \"create an\n\nenvironment in and around reproductive health care facilities\n\nwhich is conducive towards the provision of safe and effective\n\nmedical services . . . to its patients.\"            Id.\n\n            Skeptics worried that the proposed law might offend the\n\nConstitution.     To stave off these gloom-and-doom predictions,\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe senate, on November 3, 1999, asked the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) for an advisory opinion on the bill's\n\nconstitutionality.          On January 24, 2000, the SJC concluded that\n\nthe Constitution presented no obstacle to enactment.                        Opinion of\n\nthe Justices to the Senate, 430 Mass. 1205, 1211-12 (2000).                          The\n\nSJC advised that the bill, as framed, was unrelated to the\n\ncontent of protected expression.                Id. at 1209.          Moreover, the\n\nrestrictions     imposed      had    a    rational       basis   in   view     of    the\n\nheightened governmental interest that arises when \"advocates of\n\nboth    sides   of    one    of     the   nation's       most    divisive      issues\n\nfrequently meet within close proximity of each other in the\n\nareas immediately surrounding the State's clinics, in what can\n\nand often do become congested areas charged with anger.\"                       Id. at\n\n1210.\n\n           After      receiving      this    favorable      review,     the    senate\n\nengrossed Senate Bill No. 148 on February 29, 2000.                                 That\n\nversion   of    the   law    never    came      to   a   vote    in   the    house    of\n\nrepresentatives, mainly because the United States Supreme Court\n\ndecided Hill on June 28, 2000.                   In that opinion, the Court\n\nupheld,    as    a     content-neutral           time,     place,      and     manner\n\nrestriction, a Colorado statute designed to ameliorate the same\n\nevils.    530 U.S. at 719-21.             The Court's conclusion rested on\n\nthree pillars:\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f         First, [the statute] is not a regulation of\n         speech. Rather, it is a regulation of the\n         places where some speech may occur. Second,\n         it was not adopted because of disagreement\n         with the message it conveys. . . . Third,\n         the State's interests in protecting access\n         and privacy, and providing the police with\n         clear guidelines, are unrelated to the\n         content of the demonstrators' speech.\n\nId. at 719-20 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n         Massachusetts decided to follow the trail that Colorado\n\nhad blazed.    Consequently, the house of representatives struck\n\nthe text of Senate Bill No. 148 and reformulated its language.\n\nThe amended version — ultimately enacted and codified as section\n\n120E½ — recast the proposed statute and, most notably, replaced\n\nthe fixed buffer zones originally envisioned by the state senate\n\nwith floating buffer zones of the type upheld in             Hill.     The\n\nhouse engrossed the bill on July 28, 2000, and the senate\n\nconcurred the next day.       On August 10, 2000, Governor Cellucci\n\nsigned the Act into law.\n\n                         B.   The Act's Text.\n\n         The    Act,     formally     known   as     the   Massachusetts\n\nReproductive   Health    Care   Facilities    Act,    is   reprinted    in\n\nAppendix A hereto.      The Act makes it unlawful, absent consent,\n\n\"knowingly to approach [within six feet of a person or occupied\n\nmotor vehicle] for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill\n\nto, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\for counseling with such other person in the public way or\n\nsidewalk area within a radius of 18 feet from any entrance door\n\nor driveway to a reproductive health care facility.\"          Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 266, § 120E½(b).\n\n          The statutory prohibition is not absolute.             In the\n\nfirst place, the architecture of this floating buffer zone\n\nprecludes speakers from approaching unconsenting listeners, but\n\nit neither prevents speakers from holding their ground nor\n\nrequires them to retreat from passersby.        In the second place,\n\nthe Act's prophylaxis does not attach unless and until an RHCF\n\nopens   for   business    and   clearly    demarcates   the   protected\n\neighteen-foot zone.      Id. § 120E½(c).     Finally, the Act exempts\n\npersons entering or leaving an RHCF; persons using the streets\n\nto reach a destination other than the RHCF; and, while acting\n\nwithin the scope of their employment, (i) the RHCF's employees\n\nand agents, and (ii) certain government officials (e.g., police\n\nofficers).    Id. § 120E½(b).\n\n                    C.    The Influence of Hill.\n\n          In rejecting a challenge to a similar Colorado statute,\n\nthe Hill Court made a number of pronouncements that inform our\n\nresolution of this appeal.       Perhaps most important, the Court\n\nheld that the Colorado law was content-neutral even though it\n\nsingled out \"oral protest, education, [and] counseling,\" because\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthis denoted a broad category of speech rather than specifying\n\na particular subject matter or viewpoint.                  530 U.S. at 720.         In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the Court gave short shrift to the\n\nargument that, by targeting health care facilities, the Colorado\n\nstatute impermissibly discriminated against abortion protesters.\n\nId. at 724.\n\n           Three other points deserve mention.                   First, the Court\n\nemphasized      the     significance        of     the   state's     interest       in\n\npreserving      access   to    health     care     facilities.       Id.    at    715.\n\nSecond,   the    Court    noted      that    the    Colorado     legislature       had\n\ntailored the law narrowly to serve this end.                       Id. at 728-29.\n\nThird, the Court determined that a floating buffer zone of\n\nmodest    proportions         left    ample        alternative     channels        for\n\ncommunication.        Id. at 723.\n\n           Hill       bears   on   this     case    in   another    way    as    well.\n\nAlthough the Act was conceived in the albedo of Hill, it is not\n\na carbon copy of the statute at issue there.                 There are five key\n\ndifferences:\n\n           C           The protections of the Colorado law apply to\n                       all health care facilities, Colo. Rev. Stat. §\n                       18-9-122, whereas the Act applies only to free-\n                       standing clinics that provide abortions, Mass.\n                       Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 120E½.\n\n           C           The Colorado statute specifies an 100-foot\n                       radius around all covered facilities, Colo.\n                       Rev. Stat. § 18-9-122(3), whereas the Act\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f                      specifies an eighteen-foot radius, Mass. Gen.\n                      Laws ch. 266, § 120E½(b).\n\n          C           The   Colorado  statute  pretermits  unwanted\n                      approaches within eight feet of anyone inside\n                      the specified area, Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-9-\n                      122(3), while the Act constructs only a six-\n                      foot buffer zone, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, §\n                      120E½(b).\n\n          C           The directive that the Act apply only when an\n                      RHCF is open for business and has clearly\n                      demarcated the protected area, Mass. Gen. Laws\n                      ch. 266, § 120E½(c), is not part of the\n                      Colorado scheme.\n\n          C           The Act, unlike the Colorado law, exempts\n                      various groups of persons from its reach. Id.\n                      § 120E½(b).\n\nIn most of these respects, the Act arguably restricts less\n\nspeech than its Colorado counterpart.\n\n                         D.   Proceedings Below.\n\n          The plaintiffs — Mary Anne McGuire, Ruth Schiavone, and\n\nJean B. Zarrella — are Massachusetts residents who regularly\n\nprotest, demonstrate, and provide sidewalk counseling outside\n\nRHCFs.   Shortly after the passage of the Act, they sued a number\n\nof state hierarchs in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.         They argued that the Act violated\n\ntheir rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, equal\n\nprotection,     and    due    process    of   law.    To    remedy     these\n\ndeprivations,    they    sought   both    a   declaration   of   the   Act's\n\nunconstitutionality and an injunction against its enforcement.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f            The district court determined that the Act offended the\n\nFirst Amendment in two ways.     First, the court regarded the Act\n\nas    an   impermissible   content-based   restriction   because   it\n\n\"pertain[s] exclusively to speech that communicates a message of\n\nprotest, education, or counseling spoken at the entrances of\n\nabortion clinics.\"     McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 102.     Second,\n\nthe court determined that the Act discriminated on the basis of\n\nviewpoint.     Id. at 103.     The court reasoned that the Act's\n\nexemption of agents and employees of RHCFs gives rise to this\n\ninfirmity because, by virtue of their \"personal relationship\n\nwith the abortion clinic, [employees] have a strong financial\n\ninterest or philosophic incentive to counsel the listener to\n\nundergo an abortion and they constitute very zealous advocates\n\nfor this controversial procedure.\"     Id.   For these reasons, the\n\ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs had shown a substantial\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits and enjoined the defendants\n\nfrom enforcing the Act pending a trial.      Id. at 104.\n\n            This interlocutory appeal ensued.      On motion duly\n\nfiled, see Fed. R. App. P. 8(a), we stayed the injunction\n\npending appeal.    We now reverse.\n\nII.   THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD\n\n            A party who seeks a preliminary injunction must show:\n\n(1) that she has a substantial likelihood of success on the\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fmerits;      (2)   that   she    faces      a     significant        potential   for\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of immediate relief; (3) that\n\nthe    ebb   and   flow    of   possible        hardships      are    in   favorable\n\njuxtaposition (i.e., that the issuance of an injunction will not\n\nimpose more of a burden on the nonmovant than its absence will\n\nimpose on the movant); and (4) that the granting of prompt\n\ninjunctive relief will promote (or, at least, not denigrate) the\n\npublic interest.          Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc.                v. Baccarat,\n\nInc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); Narragansett Ind. Tribe\n\nv. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991).                   Appellate review of\n\nrulings granting or denying preliminary injunctions is quite\n\ndeferential.       The court of appeals will set aside such a ruling\n\nonly if it is persuaded that the lower court mistook the law,\n\nclearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused\n\nits discretion in granting the interim relief.                     Ross-Simons, 102\n\nF.3d at 15; Narragansett Ind. Tribe, 934 F.2d at 5.\n\n\n\n\nIII.    THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE\n\n             To place the appellants' First Amendment challenge into\n\nworkable      perspective,      we    begin       with   an    overview     of   the\n\nconstitutional doctrine governing restrictions on speech.                         We\n\nthen   consider     whether     the   Act       qualifies     as   content-neutral\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\flegislation for First Amendment purposes.                After answering this\n\nquestion, we then subject the Act to the appropriate level of\n\njudicial    scrutiny.         Throughout,      we    bear    in    mind     that    the\n\nplaintiffs have mounted a facial challenge to the Act as a\n\nwhole,     not    an    as-applied       challenge      to     some       particular\n\napplication of it.\n\n                   A.     The Doctrinal Underpinnings.\n\n            Freedom of speech \"is the matrix, the indispensable\n\ncondition, of nearly every other form of freedom.\"                          Palko v.\n\nConnecticut,      302     U.S.     319,    327       (1937)       (Cardozo,        J.).\n\nNotwithstanding        its    exalted     position      in    the     pantheon       of\n\nfundamental      freedoms,      free    speech      always    must    be    balanced\n\nagainst the state's responsibility to preserve and protect other\n\nimportant rights.         This balance may be weighted differently,\n\nhowever, depending upon the nature of the restriction that the\n\ngovernment seeks to foster.            We elaborate below.\n\n            Governmental restrictions on the content of particular\n\nspeech pose a high risk that the sovereign is, in reality,\n\nseeking    to    stifle      unwelcome    ideas     rather    than     to    achieve\n\nlegitimate regulatory objectives.              Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v.\n\nFCC, 512 U.S. 622, 641 (1994).             As a general rule, therefore,\n\nthe government cannot inhibit, suppress, or impose differential\n\ncontent-based burdens on speech.               Id. at 641-42.             To provide\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fmaximum assurance that the government will not throw its weight\n\non the scales of free expression, thereby \"manipulat[ing] . . .\n\npublic debate through coercion rather than persuasion,\" id. at\n\n641,   courts     presume     content-based          regulations      to     be\n\nunconstitutional.    R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377,\n\n382 (1992); Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d\n\n731, 736 (1st Cir. 1995).            While courts theoretically will\n\nuphold such a regulation if it is absolutely necessary to serve\n\na compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to the\n\nachievement of that end, see, e.g., Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312,\n\n321-29 (1988); Ark. Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S.\n\n221,   231-32     (1987),     such     regulations          rarely    survive\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.\n\n         Courts     grow    even   more    chary     when    the   government\n\nattempts to differentiate between disparate views espoused by\n\nthose speaking on a singular subject.               That chariness — some\n\nmight say hostility — is not surprising, for viewpoint-based\n\ndiscrimination is a particularly offensive type of content-based\n\ndiscrimination.     Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of\n\nVa., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995).\n\n         Judicial    review    takes      on   a   different   cast   when    a\n\nstatute does not regulate speech per se, but, rather, restricts\n\nthe time, place, and manner in which expression may occur.                 Such\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\flaws are less threatening to freedom of speech because they tend\n\nto    burden   speech   only   incidentally,          that   is,   for     reasons\n\nunrelated to the speech's content or the speaker's viewpoint.\n\nWhere that description applies, courts employ a less exacting\n\nlevel of scrutiny, upholding limitations on the time, place, and\n\nmanner of protected expression as long as \"they are justified\n\nwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech, . . .\n\nare   narrowly    tailored     to    serve    a   significant      governmental\n\ninterest, and . . . leave open ample alternative channels for\n\ncommunication of the information.\"             Clark v. Cmty. for Creative\n\nNon-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984).               This less taxing level\n\nof analysis — commonly called \"intermediate scrutiny\" — makes\n\nsense because the very fact of content neutrality offers a\n\nmeaningful assurance that the government is not striving in a\n\nclandestine manner to steer public discourse or brainwash its\n\ncitizens.      Turner Broad. Sys., 512 U.S. at 642.           We start, then,\n\nby analyzing whether the Act is content-neutral.\n\n                        B.   Classifying the Act.\n\n            The Supreme Court has explained that \"the principal\n\ninquiry   in    determining    content       neutrality,     in    speech    cases\n\ngenerally and in time, place, or manner cases in particular, is\n\nwhether   the    government    has    adopted     a    regulation     of    speech\n\nbecause of disagreement with the message it conveys.\"                      Ward v.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fRock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).                            Thus, a law\n\ndesigned to serve purposes unrelated to the content of protected\n\nspeech is deemed content-neutral even if, incidentally, it has\n\nan adverse effect on certain messages while leaving others\n\nuntouched.        See       Hill, 530 U.S. at 736; City of Renton v.\n\nPlaytime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 47-48 (1986).\n\n               By addressing political speech on public streets and\n\nsidewalks, the Act plainly operates at the core of the First\n\nAmendment.       See Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) (noting\n\nthat public streets and sidewalks are traditional public fora\n\nwhich    \"time    out       of   mind,    have     been   used     for   purposes     of\n\nassembly,       communicating            thoughts       between        citizens,     and\n\ndiscussing       public      questions\").           First       Amendment     interests\n\nnonetheless must be harmonized with the state's need to exercise\n\nits traditional police powers.                 Hill, 530 U.S. at 714-15.             The\n\ndistrict court resolved this balance against the appellants.                          It\n\nopined that the state legislature enacted section 120E½ because\n\nit    disagreed       with    both    the     content     of,    and   the    viewpoint\n\ninherent in, anti-abortion protests.                  See McGuire, 122 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 102-03.          The court thus concluded that the Act, on its\n\nface, discriminates against abortion-related speech, id. at 102,\n\nand     that    the     employee      exemption      compounds         this   evil    by\n\nfacilitating          the    airing      of     pro-choice        sentiments       while\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\fsimultaneously restricting the expressive activities of pro-life\n\npartisans, id. at 103.           We do not agree.\n\n              In holding that the Act constitutes invidious content-\n\nbased discrimination against abortion-related speech, the lower\n\ncourt    emphasized       that       \"the     Massachusetts          statute    applies\n\nexclusively to speech communicated at abortion clinics and not\n\n. . . to all health care facilities.\"                     Id. at 102.        We believe\n\nthat    the   court,      in   reaching       this      conclusion,        misconstrued\n\napplicable First Amendment doctrine by focusing exclusively on\n\nthe effects of the Act rather than on its underlying purpose.\n\n              The critical question in determining content neutrality\n\nis not whether certain speakers are disproportionately burdened,\n\nbut, rather, whether the reason for the differential treatment\n\nis — or is not — content-based.                     See Hill, 530 U.S. at 719\n\n(positing that a statute is content-neutral when it does not\n\ndirectly regulate speech, has its origins in a legislative\n\npurpose unrelated to disagreement with the underlying message of\n\nparticular      speech,        and    advances       interests       unconnected        to\n\nexpressive      content).            As   long     as    a    regulation       serves    a\n\nlegitimate purpose unrelated to expressive content, it is deemed\n\ncontent-neutral even if it has an incidental effect on some\n\nspeakers      and   not    others.          Ward,       491   U.S.    at    791;   Nat'l\n\nAmusements, 43 F.3d at 740.               In that event, all that remains is\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\ffor the government to show that accomplishment of the legitimate\n\npurpose that prompted the law also rationally explains its\n\ndifferential impact.         See City of Renton, 475 U.S. at 47-48;\n\nNat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 738.\n\n            We conclude, without much question, that the Act's\n\nstated goals justify its specific application to RHCFs.                     The\n\nMassachusetts legislature, confronted with an apparently serious\n\npublic safety problem, investigated the matter thoroughly.                  That\n\ninvestigation yielded solid evidence that abortion protesters\n\nare particularly aggressive and patients particularly vulnerable\n\nas they enter or leave RHCFs.               Thus, targeting these sites\n\nfurthers conventional objectives of the state's police power —\n\npromoting    public    health,     preserving     personal      security,   and\n\naffording safe access to medical services.                 Although the Act\n\nclearly affects anti-abortion protesters more than other groups,\n\nthere is no principled basis for assuming that this differential\n\ntreatment    results   from    a   fundamental     disagreement      with   the\n\ncontent of their expression.             Rather, the finding required on\n\nthese facts is that the legislature was making every effort to\n\nrestrict    as   little   speech    as    possible      while   combating   the\n\ndeleterious secondary effects of anti-abortion protests.                    Just\n\nas   targeting     medical    centers       did   not     render   Colorado's\n\ncounterpart statute content-based, Hill, 530 U.S. at 722-23, so\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\ftoo the Act's targeting of RHCFs fails to undermine its status\n\nas a content-neutral regulation.1\n\n\n\n            To be sure, the plaintiffs insist that the state's\n\nprofessed concerns about public safety, personal security, and\n\naccess to medical facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to\n\ncensor anti-abortion speech.   This insistence gets them nowhere.\n\nFor one thing, their insinuations are unsupported by any record\n\nevidence.    For another thing, where differential treatment is\n\njustified, on an objective basis, by the government's content-\n\nneutral effort to combat secondary effects, it is insufficient\n\nthat a regulation may have been adopted in direct response to\n\n\n\n    1The plaintiffs see this targeting as a smoking gun.      In\nthis regard, they cite Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 (1980), and\nPolice Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972), for the\nproposition that singling out a certain form of protest is\ntantamount to content-based discrimination. These authorities\nare unhelpful. In Carey, the Court struck down a statute that\nprohibited residential protests other than peaceful labor\npicketing. 447 U.S. at 471. In Mosley, the Court overturned a\nstatute that prohibited all protests except labor picketing near\na school.   408 U.S. at 101-02.    In each instance, the Court\ndeclared the statute unconstitutional because the legislative\npurpose — protecting residential privacy and preserving safe\naccess to schools, respectively — could not logically account\nfor the special treatment accorded to labor protests.      Here,\nhowever, as in Hill, 530 U.S. at 724, the targeting is closely\nconfined to the legitimate legislative purpose that underlies\nthe Act: combating violence at RHCFs. See also City of Renton\n475 U.S. at 47 (upholding a zoning ordinance that sought to\nprevent crime, protect residential neighborhoods, and maintain\nproperty values by singling out adult theaters).\n\n                               -19-\n\fthe negative impact of a particular form of speech.                               See Hill,\n\n530 U.S. at 723; Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., 512 U.S. 753,\n\n762-64    (1994);         see    also      Nat'l      Amusements,       43     F.3d    at   740\n\n(\"Secondary effects can comprise a special characteristic of a\n\nparticular speaker or group of speakers.\").                                  This is such a\n\ncase:     considered            as   a    whole,      the   Act    provides      a     neutral\n\njustification         —    unrelated        to     the     content      of    speech    —   for\n\ndifferential treatment.\n\n            In an effort to parry this thrust, the plaintiffs point\n\nconspicuously to the district court's holding that the statutory\n\nexemption       for       clinic         agents       and       employees       constitutes\n\nimpermissible viewpoint-based discrimination (and, therefore,\n\ntaints the entire Act).                  The court premised this holding on its\n\ndetermination that, by allowing clinic employees to enter the\n\nfloating buffer zone without constraint, the Act permits free-\n\nranging expression of pro-choice views while suppressing pro-\n\nlife messages.            McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 103-04.                          Because\n\nthis     determination           rests       on       an    unsubstantiated            factual\n\nfoundation, we reject it.\n\n            A   court's          findings        of      fact    must    be    anchored      in\n\nprobative evidence.              See United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d\n\n641, 654-55 (1st Cir. 1996); Blohm v. Commissioner, 994 F.2d\n\n1542, 1548 (11th Cir. 1993); United States v. Williams, 891 F.2d\n\n\n                                             -20-\n\f962, 964-67 (1st Cir. 1989).         This bedrock principle applies to\n\nfindings made on a motion for a preliminary injunction.                   See,\n\ne.g., Cohen v. Brown Univ., 991 F.2d 888, 906 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nHere, however, the district court lumped together all agents and\n\nemployees of RHCFs and characterized them, without a shred of\n\nrecord    support,     as    \"very     zealous     advocates        for   this\n\ncontroversial procedure [abortion].\"         McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 103.   The court then stated, again without any evidentiary\n\npredicate,   that    these   \"[e]mployees    and    agents     of    abortion\n\nclinics escort potential abortion clinic clients and counsel and\n\nexhort them to undergo an abortion within the restricted areas.\"\n\nId. at 103 n.9.       These findings are wholly unsupported and,\n\nhence, clearly erroneous.       A judge's intuition cannot take the\n\nplace of proof.      See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (holding that decisions must be based on more\n\nthan the judge's hunch, unsupported by facts); cf. Tuf Racing\n\nProds., Inc. v. Am. Suzuki Motor Corp., 223 F.3d 585, 590 (7th\n\nCir. 2000) (noting that judges must reason from facts rather\n\nthan settling for guesswork).\n\n           There is, moreover, another defect in the district\n\ncourt's treatment of the employee exemption.           The court ignored\n\nthe matter of secondary effects as they bear on that exemption.\n\nThis was an unfortunate oversight:          the secondary effects that\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fthe Act was designed to ameliorate include securing public\n\nsafety in and around RHCFs, preventing traffic congestion, and\n\nbalancing free speech with the need to maintain a salutary\n\natmosphere for those seeking access to medical services.                     See\n\nS.B. 148, supra, § 1.           There is no evidence that agents and\n\nemployees of RHCFs cause these problems.2                Thus, excluding those\n\nindividuals does not undermine the legitimacy of the Act as a\n\nvehicle to curb the secondary effects of particular conduct and\n\nthereby achieve the legislature's announced purposes.\n\n             The     legislative    history     bears       witness    to   this\n\nconclusion.        Testimony taken before the state senate indicates\n\nbeyond cavil that the employee exemption will promote the Act's\n\ngoals      because   clinic   employees     often    assist     in    protecting\n\npatients and ensuring their safe passage as they approach RHCFs.\n\nIndeed, the record contains numerous accounts of incidents in\n\nwhich clinic personnel had to approach patients to protect them\n\nfrom       protesters    and,      sometimes,       to     prevent      physical\n\naltercations.        Since it is within the scope of their employment\n\nfor clinic personnel to escort patients in this fashion, and\n\nsince a primary purpose of the law is to facilitate safe access,\n\n\n       2\n      To be sure, the record does show that, on occasion, a\nclinic employee has gotten into an altercation with an anti-\nabortion protester.    But this sort of disturbance presumably\nwould be stemmed by the exemption because the exemption tends to\nkeep clinic employees and abortion protesters apart.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fthe employee exemption serves the basic objectives of the Act.\n\nTo   cinch    matters,   the     legislature     rationally    could   have\n\nconcluded that clinic employees are less likely to engage in\n\ndirecting of unwanted speech toward captive listeners — a datum\n\nthat the Hill Court recognized as justifying the statute there.\n\nSee Hill, 530 U.S. at 715-17.\n\n             Endeavoring to counter these points, the plaintiffs\n\nposit that the employee exemption could not possibly have been\n\ndesigned to combat those undesirable secondary effects because\n\nthe Act, without the exemption, permits any person to approach\n\na non-consenting patient for purposes other than education,\n\nprotest,     and   counseling.     See   Mass.   Gen.   Laws   ch.   266,    §\n\n120E½(b).     The exemption only has meaning, therefore, insofar as\n\nit allows those who work for RHCFs to approach within six feet\n\nof non-consenting patients to engage in such activities (i.e,\n\neducation, protest, and counseling).             From this plateau, the\n\nplaintiffs suggest that if a clinic employee were to approach to\n\neducate or counsel a prospective patient, that education or\n\ncounseling doubtless would manifest a pro-choice viewpoint.                 So\n\nviewed, the sole practical purpose of the employee exemption is\n\nto promote a particular side of the abortion debate — a feature\n\nthat renders the exemption discriminatory and ensures that any\n\napplication would violate the First Amendment.\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f           While this argument has a certain logic, it ultimately\n\nfails.   After all, the plaintiffs have challenged the Act on its\n\nface.    The nature of this challenge raises the bar for their\n\nsuccess:   a party who mounts a facial challenge to a statute\n\nmust carry a significantly heavier burden than one who seeks\n\nmerely to sidetrack a particular application of the law.              See\n\nNat'l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 580\n\n(1998); Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d\n\n66, 76 (1st Cir. 2001); Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y, Inc. v.\n\nVill. of Stratton, 240 F.3d 553, 562 (6th Cir.), petition for\n\ncert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3750 (U.S. May 18, 2001) (No. 00-1737).\n\n           In the First Amendment context, this means that a\n\nplaintiff who challenges a statute on its face ordinarily must\n\nshow either that the law admits of no valid application or that,\n\neven if one or more valid application exists, the law's reach\n\nnevertheless   is   so   elongated   that   it   threatens   to   inhibit\n\nconstitutionally protected speech.          Time Warner Entm't Co. v.\n\nFCC, 93 F.3d 957, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1996).          The plaintiffs do not\n\nchallenge the employee exemption on the ground that it sweeps\n\ntoo broadly.   Thus, they must show that the exemption admits of\n\nno constitutionally permissible application.         This is an uphill\n\nclimb, requiring the legal equivalent of an alpenstock and\n\ncarabiners — and the plaintiffs are unable to scale the heights.\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f            Courts owe legislative judgments substantial respect\n\nand,   as   a   general   matter,      should    be   reluctant    \"to    reduce\n\nstatutory language to a merely illustrative function.\"                     Mass.\n\nAss'n of HMOs v. Ruthardt, 194 F.3d 176, 181 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThe Massachusetts legislature may or may not have intended the\n\nemployee    exemption     to   serve    the    purpose   envisioned      by   the\n\nplaintiffs.       There are other likely explanations.            For example,\n\nthe legislature may have exempted clinic workers — just as it\n\nexempted police officers — in order to make crystal clear what\n\nalready was implicit in the Act:              that those who work to secure\n\npeaceful access to RHCFs need not fear prosecution.                      See id.\n\n(explaining that a legislative body \"may consider a specific\n\npoint important or uncertain enough to justify a modicum of\n\nredundancy\").\n\n            The    ultimate    difficulty,       of   course,   is   that     the\n\nlegislature's subjective intent is both unknown and unknowable.\n\nAt this juncture, we can look only to the purposes that may\n\nrationally be said to be served by the provision in question\n\n(here, the employee exemption).               That is a large part of the\n\nreason why one who challenges a statute on its face must carry\n\nan appreciably heavier burden:            a facial challenge, unlike an\n\nas-applied challenge, does not allow a reviewing court to base\n\nits judgments on actual experience or provide the court any room\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fto capture nuances in a statute's meaning.           See United States v.\n\nRaines, 362 U.S. 17, 20-22 (1960); Richard H. Fallon, Jr., As-\n\nApplied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113\n\nHarv. L. Rev. 1321, 1330-35 (2000).\n\n            That ends this aspect of the argument.          Because we can\n\nenvision    at   least   one   legitimate   reason    for   including   the\n\nemployee exemption in the Act, it would be premature to declare\n\nthe   Act    unconstitutional      for    all   purposes     and   in   all\n\napplications.     See United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 71 (1st\n\nCir.) (noting that \"[i]t makes little sense to strike down an\n\nentire statute in response to a facial attack when potential\n\ndifficulties can be remedied in future cases through fact-\n\nspecific as-applied challenges\"), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 844\n\n(1999).     If, as the plaintiffs predict, experience shows that\n\nclinic staffers in fact are utilizing the exemption as a means\n\neither of proselytizing or of engaging in preferential pro-\n\nchoice advocacy, the plaintiffs remain free to challenge the\n\nAct, as applied, in a concrete factual setting.                See Pharm.\n\nResearch & Mfrs., 249 F.3d at 78 (rejecting facial challenge to\n\nstate statute without prejudice to plaintiff's right to launch\n\nan as-applied challenge after implementation of the statute).\n\n            We recapitulate.      The Act, on its face, is content-\n\nneutral. Futhermore, although courts correctly regard viewpoint\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fdiscrimination as a particularly pernicious form of content\n\ndiscrimination, the Act does not discriminate against speakers\n\nbased on their views.        The employee exemption too is neutral on\n\nits face, drawing no distinction between different ideologies.\n\nAnd to the extent (if at all) that the exemption contributes to\n\nthe Act's disproportionate impact on anti-abortion protesters,\n\nit   can    be   justified     by    reference      to   the    state's    neutral\n\nlegislative goals.      We conclude, therefore, that since neither\n\nthe Act as a whole nor the employee exemption reflects an\n\nimpermissible bias against either the content of certain speech\n\nor the views of certain speakers, the Act's constitutionality\n\nmust be determined by reference to the intermediate level of\n\nscrutiny     that   attaches    to    content-neutral          time,   place,    and\n\nmanner restrictions.\n\n                      C.     Intermediate Scrutiny.\n\n             Under the intermediate scrutiny standard, a law is\n\ndeemed     constitutional      if    it    is    narrowly   tailored      to   serve\n\nsignificant state interests while leaving open ample alternative\n\nchannels of communication.           See Renton, 475 U.S. at 50; Clark,\n\n468 U.S. at 293.      The Act passes this test.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\f               The state legislature ascribed four purposes to the\n\nAct:3       to increase public safety in and around RHCFs; to ensure\n\nsmooth traffic flow; to balance free speech with the rights of\n\npersons seeking access to RHCFs to be free from hindrance; and\n\nto create an environment conducive to safe and effective medical\n\nservices.           S.B. 148, supra, § 1.             The interests that underlie\n\nthese purposes are firmly rooted in the state's traditional\n\npolice powers, and these are precisely the sort of interests\n\nthat        justify    some      incidental        burdening    of   First    Amendment\n\nrights.         See       Hill   530   U.S.    at    715    (noting    the    \"enduring\n\nimportance of the right to be free from persistent importunity,\n\nfollowing and dogging after an offer to communicate has been\n\ndeclined\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nSchenck        v.     Pro-Choice       Network,      519    U.S.     357,   376   (1997)\n\n(extolling          the    significance       of    \"ensuring      public    safety   and\n\norder,       promoting       the   free    flow      of    traffic    on    streets   and\n\nsidewalks, protecting property rights, and protecting a woman's\n\nfreedom to seek pregnancy-related services\"); see also Madsen,\n\n512 U.S. at 772-73 (\"The First Amendment does not demand that\n\n\n        3\n     Although the state senate wrote this list of purposes as a\npreamble to Senate Bill No. 148, there is nothing in the\nsubsequent legislative history to suggest that the purposes\nchanged after the senate bill was amended in the house of\nrepresentatives to produce the final version.     We therefore\nfollow the parties' lead and assume that this litany applies to\nthe Act.\n\n                                           -28-\n\fpatients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to\n\nescape the cacophony of political protests.\").\n\n            On the flip side of the coin, the               Act is narrowly\n\ntailored and leaves open sufficient opportunity to communicate\n\nin other ways.         A law is narrowly tailored if it promotes a\n\nsubstantial governmental interest that would be less effectively\n\nachieved     without    the   law    and    does     so   without       burdening\n\nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further this\n\ngoal.      Ward, 491 U.S. at 799.            The plaintiffs argue that\n\nMassachusetts      previously      had   enacted     a    number    of    general\n\nprotections designed to combat the same evils as the Act, e.g.,\n\nMass Gen. Laws ch. 266 § 120E (knowingly obstructing entry to\n\nhealth care facility); id. ch. 272 § 53 (disturbing the peace);\n\nid.   ch. 12 § 11H (impairing civil rights); id. 265 § 13A\n\n(assault and battery), and that these non-speech-restricting\n\nprotections have not been enforced in the context of abortion\n\nprotests.    They claim, moreover, that the only behavior targeted\n\nby the Act that is not already covered by other laws is non-\n\nthreatening speech, and that the Commonwealth has offered no\n\ncontent-neutral      justifications        for     limiting      such    peaceful\n\ndiscourse.\n\n            This   argument   is    unconvincing.          The    Massachusetts\n\nlegislature reasonably concluded that existing law inadequately\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\faddressed the public safety, personal security, traffic, and\n\nhealth   care    concerns   created   by    persistent   demonstrations\n\noutside RHCFs.    Indeed, the state senate specifically found that\n\nexisting   statutory   protections    did    not   suffice   —   and   this\n\nfinding is plausible given the general terms used by those\n\nstatutes (e.g., \"obstruction,\" \"disturbing the peace\").                While\n\nsuch wider nets might catch the big fish, there is every reason\n\nto believe that they would let the fingerlings through.           We have\n\nsaid enough on this subject.          The short of it is that the\n\nlegislature weighed the Hill Court's conclusions and formulated\n\na bill to suit.     As a result of this careful craftsmanship, the\n\nAct, in its final form, affects only areas immediately adjacent\n\nto RHCFs; prohibits only nonconsensual approaches within six\n\nfeet; and applies only within a clearly marked eighteen-foot\n\nradius from clinic entrances and exits.         This framework is more\n\nprecisely focused and gives abortion protesters more opportunity\n\nfor advocacy than does the Colorado statute upheld in                  Hill.\n\nCompare Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 120E½ with Colo. Rev. Stat.\n\n§ 18-9-122.4      Because the Supreme Court concluded that the\n\n\n    4To illustrate, the Act creates a six-foot bubble around\nunwilling listeners, as opposed to the eight-foot bubble\nsanctioned under the Colorado law; the Act covers an eighteen-\nfoot radius as opposed to the 100-foot radius covered by the\nColorado statute; and the Act, unlike its Colorado counterpart,\ndoes not go into effect unless and until the covered area has\nbeen clearly delineated.\n\n                                 -30-\n\fColorado statute was narrowly tailored, the Act too satisfies\n\nthat requirement.        If, as the       Hill Court stated, visual and\n\nverbal images are able to cross an eight-foot floating buffer\n\nzone with sufficient ease that the \"restriction on an unwanted\n\nphysical approach leaves ample room to communicate a message\n\nthrough speech,\" 530 U.S. at 729, that same conclusion perforce\n\nmust apply to the Act's less commodious six-foot floating buffer\n\nzone.\n\n                 D.    The Equal Protection Challenge.\n\n             Without    developing       the    argument        in     detail,    the\n\nplaintiffs, like the court below, conclusorily assert that the\n\nAct violates the Equal Protection Clause.                      Because the equal\n\nprotection interests involved in the differential treatment of\n\nspeech   are    inextricably      intertwined           with    First     Amendment\n\nconcerns, Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95\n\n(1972), and the plaintiffs do not develop the point separately,\n\nwe   treat   this     assertion   as    part     of   the      plaintiffs'       First\n\nAmendment challenge.       In all events, it need not occupy us for\n\nlong.\n\n             From time to time, the Supreme Court has invoked equal\n\nprotection     rather     than    free        speech,     as     the    basis     for\n\ninvalidating a content-based speech restriction. E.g., Carey v.\n\nBrown, 447 U.S. 455, 459-63 (1980); Mosley, 408 U.S. at 94-95.\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fBut   where   the    state      shows    a    satisfactory     rationale     for    a\n\ncontent-neutral         time,    place,       and    manner    regulation,      that\n\nregulation necessarily passes the rational basis test employed\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.                  See Thorburn v. Austin, 231\n\nF.3d 1114, 1122 (8th Cir. 2000); Hoover v. Morales, 164 F.3d\n\n221, 227 n.3 (5th Cir. 1998); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga,\n\n107 F.3d 403, 411 n.7 (6th Cir. 1997).                 So it is here:       the Act\n\npasses muster under the Equal Protection Clause for the same\n\nreasons that it passes muster under the First Amendment.\n\nIV.   THE DUE PROCESS CHALLENGE\n\n           The      failure      of     the   plaintiffs'      First      Amendment\n\nchallenge does not end our journey.                  Even if the trial court's\n\nrationale collapses, an appellee is free to defend the judgment\n\nbelow on any other ground made manifest by the record.                          Mass.\n\nMut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479, 481 (1976) (per\n\ncuriam); United States v. Craven, 239 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Embracing that tenet, the plaintiffs urge us to affirm\n\nthe issuance of the preliminary injunction on the ground that\n\nthe Act vests unbridled discretion in RHCFs (and, thus, violates\n\nthe plaintiffs' due process rights).\n\n           This exhortation hinges upon language in the Act which\n\nprovides that the six-foot floating buffer zone \"shall only take\n\neffect   during     a   facility's       business      hours   and   if   the    area\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fcontained within the radius . . . is clearly marked.\"                  Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 266, § 120E½(c).           The plaintiffs posit that this\n\nlanguage vests private actors — the RHCFs — with unconstrained\n\npower to restrict speech, and they cite numerous cases for the\n\nblack-letter proposition that the Due Process Clause forbids\n\nstandardless delegations of governmental authority, especially\n\nto   private     parties.     E.g.,    Forsyth   County    v.    Nationalist\n\nMovement, 505 U.S. 123, 130-31 (1992); City of Lakewood v. Plain\n\nDealer Publ'g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 758-59 (1988);                  Freedman v.\n\nMaryland, 380 U.S. 51, 57-59 (1965).\n\n           The     district    court     rejected   this    asseveration,\n\nconcluding that the quoted portion of the Act \"is more logically\n\nviewed as a notice requirement serving to protect the interests\n\nof speakers such as plaintiffs.\"             McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n101 n.7.   We agree with this assessment.           While the plaintiffs\n\ncherry-pick statements from the case law in an effort to bolster\n\ntheir position, they have wrested these statements from their\n\ncontextual moorings.\n\n           Without exception, the cases on which the plaintiffs\n\nrely involve licensing schemes that allowed public officials to\n\nmake discriminatory, content-based decisions.               E.g., City of\n\nLakewood, 486 U.S. at 759; Heffron v. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna\n\nConsciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 648-49 (1981).               By their very\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fnature, licensing schemes that embody grants of standardless\n\ndiscretion to public officials (or sometimes private individuals\n\n— conceptually, it makes no difference) cannot constitute valid\n\ntime, place, and manner restrictions because they \"ha[ve] the\n\npotential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point\n\nof view.\"    Heffron, 452 U.S. at 649.      Since the floating buffer\n\nzone contemplated by the Act is content-neutral, see supra Part\n\nIII(B), the activation provision cannot raise this type of\n\nconstitutional concern.         And in all events, the activation\n\nprovision, to the extent that it allows clinic employees to make\n\ndecisions that have a disproportionate impact on anti-abortion\n\nspeech, is easily justified as an incidental burden.5           See Nat'l\n\nAmusements, 43 F.3d at 740.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            The existence of a four-part framework for granting or\n\ndenying preliminary injunctive relief does not mean that all\n\nfour components are weighted equally.        In the great majority of\n\ncases, likelihood of success constitutes the proper focal point\n\nof the inquiry.      Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16.         This case is no\n\nexception.     The   district   court    premised   its    issuance   of   a\n\n\n\n     5\n     We note an irony:   as a practical matter the activation\nprovision tends to favor (rather than curtail) anti-abortion\nexpression because it establishes conditions that RHCFs must\nmeet before the Act's prophylaxis takes effect.\n\n                                  -34-\n\fpreliminary injunction on its mistaken view that the plaintiffs\n\nprobably would succeed on their First Amendment challenge.                But\n\nthis conclusion is insupportable.              See supra Part III(B-C).\n\nMoreover,    the   plaintiffs     cannot   establish    a   probability    of\n\nmerits success on any other theory encompassed within their\n\nfacial challenge to the Act.        See supra Parts III(D), IV.        Since\n\nlikelihood    of   success   is   the   sine    qua   non   of   preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief, Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 1993), we need go no further.\n\n            We reverse the order granting a preliminary injunction\n\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nThe stay previously issued is dissolved as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f                          Appendix A\n\n               Mass.

Indeed, such facilities in the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts have been the focal point of many blockades,\ndisturbances and even violence, particularly the shootings\nat two reproductive health services facilities on December\n30, 1994, which, left two persons dead and many injured.\n\n     It is further found that persons attempting to enter\nor depart from reproductive health care facilities have\nbeen subject to harassing or intimidating activity by\npersons approaching within extremely close proximity and\nshouting or waving objects at them, which has tended to\nhamper or impede access to or departure from those facilities.\n\n     It  is   further   found  that   such  activity   near\nreproductive health care facilities creates a \"captive\naudience\" situation because persons seeking health care\nservices cannot avoid the area outside of reproductive\nhealth care facilities if they are to receive the services\nprovided therein, and their physical and emotional ailments\nor conditions can make them especially vulnerable to the\nadverse physiological and emotional effects of such\nharassing or intimidating activities directed at them from\nextremely close proximity.\n\n     It is further found that the violence and disturbances\ndescribed above have required the deployment of police\nofficers at significant cost to the cities and towns of the\nCommonwealth,   and  continue   to   occur  despite   civil\ninjunctions that prohibit certain persons from engaging in\nsuch conduct.\n\n     And it is further found that studies have shown that\nclinics with buffer zones experience far larger decreases\n\n                            -38-\n\fin every type of violence than clinics without buffer\nzones.\n\n     Therefore, the purpose of this legislation is:\n\n     (1) to increase the public safety      in   and   around\nreproductive health care facilities;\n\n     (2) to maintain the flow of traffic and prevent\ncongestion around reproductive health care facilities;\n\n     (3) to enact reasonable time, place and manner\nrestrictions to reconcile and protect both the First\nAmendment rights of persons to express their views near\nreproductive health care facilities and the rights of\npersons seeking access to those facilities to be free from\nhindrance, harassment, intimidation and harm; and\n\n     (4) to create an environment in and around reproductive\nhealth care facilities which is conducive towards the\nprovision of safe and effective medical services, including\nsurgical procedures, to its patients.\n\n     SECTION 2. Chapter 266 of the General Laws is hereby\namended by inserting after section 120E the following\nsection: —\n\n     (a) For the purposes of this section, \"reproductive\nhealth care facility\" shall mean a place, other than within\na hospital, where abortions are offered or performed.\n\n     (b)(1) Except for those listed in subsection (2) below,\nno person shall, during business hours of a reproductive\nhealth care facility, knowingly enter or remain in the\nfollowing area of private property of a reproductive health\ncare facility or public right-of-way:\n\n            (A) the area within twenty-five (25) feet of any\nportion of an entrance to, exit from, or driveway of a\nreproductive health care facility; and\n\n            (B) the area within the rectangle created by\nextending the outside boundaries of any entrance to, exit\nfrom, or driveway of, a reproductive health care facility\nin straight lines to the point where such lines intersect\n\n\n                           -39-\n\fthe sideline of the street in front of such entrance, exit\nor driveway.\n\n            (2) The provision of subsection (1) of this\nparagraph shall not apply to the following:\n\n           (A) persons entering or leaving such facility;\n\n            (B) employees or agents of such facility acting\nwithin the scope of their employment;\n\n            (C) law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting,\nconstruction, utilities, public works and other municipal\nagents acting within the scope of their employment; and\n\n            (D) persons using the public sidewalk or street\nright-of-way adjacent to such facility solely for the\npurpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.\n\n     (c) Whoever knowingly violates this section shall be\npunished, for the first offense, by a fine of not more than\none thousand dollars or not more than six months in a jail\nor house of correction or both, and for each subsequent\noffense by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars and\nnot more than five thousand dollars or not more than two\nand one-half years in a jail or house of correction or both.\n\n     A person who knowingly violates this section may be\narrested without a warrant by a sheriff, deputy sheriff, or\npolice officer.\n\n     (d) Any reproductive health care facility or any person\nwhose rights to provide or obtain reproductive health care\nservices have been interfered with by a violation of this\nsection may commence a civil action for damages or\ninjunctive and other equitable relief, including the award\nof compensatory and exemplary damages. Said civil action\nshall be instituted either in the superior court for the\ncounty in which the conduct complained of occurred, or in\nthe superior court for the county in which any person or\nentity complained of resides or has a principal place of\nbusiness. An aggrieved person or entity which prevails in\nan action authorized by this paragraph, in addition to\nother damages, shall be entitled to an award of the costs\nof the litigation and reasonable attorney's fees in an\namount to be fixed by the court.\n\n                           -40-\n\f     (e) A criminal conviction pursuant to the provision of\nthis section shall not be a condition precedent to\nmaintaining a civil action pursuant to the provision of\nthis section.\n\n     SECTION 3. The provisions of this act shall be deemed\nseverable, and if any provision of this act is adjudged\nunconstitutional or invalid, such judgment shall not affect\nother valid provisions hereof.\n\n\n\n\n                         -41-\n\f",

We act in the context of a Massachusetts statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2 (the Act), which creates a floating six-foot buffer zone around pedestrians and motor vehicles as they approach reproductive health care facilities (RHCFs). We view that statute through the prism of Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000), in which the United States Supreme Court upheld an analogous statute despite the fact that it incidentally restricted some speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found meaningful distinctions between the Act and the Colorado statute at issue in Hill, determined that these distinctions undermined the constitutionality of the Act, and preliminarily enjoined the Act's enforcement. See McGuire v. Reilly, 122 F. Supp. 2d 97, 101-03 (D. Mass. 2000). But the distinctions noted by the district court do not make a dispositive difference. Hill controls, and the Act, on its face, lawfully regulates the time, place, and manner of speech without discriminating based on content or viewpoint. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's ukase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to frame the issues on appeal, we think it is useful to trace the developments leading to the Act's passage, survey its text, and place it in the context suggested by the Hill Court's decision. With that foundation in place, we then recount the proceedings below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Act's History.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the late 1990s, Massachusetts had experienced repeated incidents of violence and aggressive behavior outside RHCFs. Concerned legislators responded to these disturbances by introducing Senate Bill No. 148, see S.B. 148, 181st Gen. Ct., Reg. Sess. (Mass. Jan. 6, 1999), reprinted in Appendix B hereto. The bill purposed to create a fixed twenty-five foot buffer zone from RHCFs' entrances, exits, and driveways, and with limited exceptions, to prohibit all persons from entering, or remaining within, that buffer zone regardless of the person's intent or the willingness of others to listen. The state senate held a hearing in April of 1999. The received testimony chronicled the harassment and intimidation that typically occurred outside RHCFs. In addition, numerous witnesses addressed the emotional and physical vulnerability of women seeking to avail themselves of abortion services, and gave accounts of the deleterious effects of overly aggressive demonstrations on patients and providers alike. Based in part on this testimony, the senate concluded that existing laws did not adequately protect public safety in areas surrounding RHCFs. To remedy this situation, the senate favored the creation of fixed buffer zones. The sponsors of the bill left no doubt that they intended the proposed law to \"increase public safety in and around [RHCFs]\" while \"maintain[ing] the flow of traffic and prevent[ing] congestion\" there. S.B. 148, supra, &#167; 1. In the bargain, the sponsors expected the law to provide \"reasonable time, place and manner restrictions to reconcile and protect both the First Amendment rights of persons to express their views near reproductive health care facilities and the rights of persons seeking access to those facilities to be free from hindrance, harassment, intimidation and harm.\" It thereby would \"create an environment in and around reproductive health care facilities which is conducive towards the provision of safe and effective medical services . . . to its patients.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skeptics worried that the proposed law might offend the Constitution. To stave off these gloom-and-doom predictions, the senate, on November 3, 1999, asked the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) for an advisory opinion on the bill's constitutionality. On January 24, 2000, the SJC concluded that the Constitution presented no obstacle to enactment. Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, 430 Mass. 1205, 1211-12 (2000). The SJC advised that the bill, as framed, was unrelated to the content of protected expression. Id. at 1209. Moreover, the restrictions imposed had a rational basis in view of the heightened governmental interest that arises when \"advocates of both sides of one of the nation's most divisive issues frequently meet within close proximity of each other in the areas immediately surrounding the State's clinics, in what can and often do become congested areas charged with anger.\" Id. at 1210.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving this favorable review, the senate engrossed Senate Bill No. 148 on February 29, 2000. That version of the law never came to a vote in the house of representatives, mainly because the United States Supreme Court decided Hill on June 28, 2000. In that opinion, the Court upheld, as a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, a Colorado statute designed to ameliorate the same evils. 530 U.S. at 719-21. The Court's conclusion rested on three pillars:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, [the statute] is not a regulation of speech. Rather, it is a regulation of the places where some speech may occur. Second, it was not adopted because of disagreement with the message it conveys. . . . Third, the State's interests in protecting access and privacy, and providing the police with clear guidelines, are unrelated to the content of the demonstrators' speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 719-20 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts decided to follow the trail that Colorado had blazed. Consequently, the house of representatives struck the text of Senate Bill No. 148 and reformulated its language. The amended version -- ultimately enacted and codified as section 120E1/2 -- recast the proposed statute and, most notably, replaced the fixed buffer zones originally envisioned by the state senate with floating buffer zones of the type upheld in Hill. The house engrossed the bill on July 28, 2000, and the senate concurred the next day. On August 10, 2000, Governor Cellucci signed the Act into law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Act's Text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act, formally known as the Massachusetts Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act, is reprinted in Appendix A hereto. The Act makes it unlawful, absent consent, \"knowingly to approach [within six feet of a person or occupied motor vehicle] for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education or counseling with such other person in the public way or sidewalk area within a radius of 18 feet from any entrance door or driveway to a reproductive health care facility.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory prohibition is not absolute. In the first place, the architecture of this floating buffer zone precludes speakers from approaching unconsenting listeners, but it neither prevents speakers from holding their ground nor requires them to retreat from passers by. In the second place, the Act's prophylaxis does not attach unless and until an RHCF opens for business and clearly demarcates the protected eighteen-foot zone. Id. &#167; 120E1/2 (c). Finally, the Act exempts persons entering or leaving an RHCF; persons using the streets to reach a destination other than the RHCF; and, while acting within the scope of their employment, (i) the RHCF's employees and agents, and (ii) certain government officials (e.g., police officers). Id. &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Influence of Hill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting a challenge to a similar Colorado statute, the Hill Court made a number of pronouncements that inform our resolution of this appeal. Perhaps most important, the Court held that the Colorado law was content-neutral even though it singled out \"oral protest, education, [and] counseling,\" because this denoted a broad category of speech rather than specifying a particular subject matter or viewpoint. 530 U.S. at 720. In reaching this conclusion, the Court gave short shrift to the argument that, by targeting health care facilities, the Colorado statute impermissibly discriminated against abortion protesters. Id. at 724.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three other points deserve mention. First, the Court emphasized the significance of the state's interest in preserving access to health care facilities. Id. at 715. Second, the Court noted that the Colorado legislature had tailored the law narrowly to serve this end. Id. at 728-29. Third, the Court determined that a floating buffer zone of modest proportions left ample alternative channels for communication. Id. at 723.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hill bears on this case in another way as well. Although the Act was conceived in the albedo of Hill, it is not a carbon copy of the statute at issue there. There are five key differences:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The protections of the Colorado law apply to all health care facilities, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122, whereas the Act applies only to free-standing clinics that provide abortions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Colorado statute specifies an 100-foot radius around all covered facilities, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122(3), whereas the Act specifies an eighteen-foot radius, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Colorado statute pretermits unwanted approaches within eight feet of anyone inside the specified area, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122(3), while the Act constructs only a six-foot buffer zone, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The directive that the Act apply only when an RHCF is open for business and has clearly demarcated the protected area, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(c), is not part of the Colorado scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act, unlike the Colorado law, exempts various groups of persons from its reach. Id. &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most of these respects, the Act arguably restricts less speech than its Colorado counterpart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Proceedings Below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs -- Mary Anne McGuire, Ruth Schiavone, and Jean B. Zarrella -- are Massachusetts residents who regularly protest, demonstrate, and provide sidewalk counseling outside RHCFs. Shortly after the passage of the Act, they sued a number of state hierarchs in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. They argued that the Act violated their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, equal protection, and due process of law. To remedy these deprivations, they sought both a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality and an injunction against its enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the Act offended the First Amendment in two ways. First, the court regarded the Act as an impermissible content-based restriction because it \"pertain[s] exclusively to speech that communicates a message of protest, education, or counseling spoken at the entrances of abortion clinics.\" McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 102. Second, the court determined that the Act discriminated on the basis of viewpoint. Id. at 103. The court reasoned that the Act's exemption of agents and employees of RHCFs gives rise to this infirmity because, by virtue of their \"personal relationship with the abortion clinic, [employees] have a strong financial interest or philosophic incentive to counsel the listener to undergo an abortion and they constitute very zealous advocates for this controversial procedure.\" Id. For these reasons, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and enjoined the defendants from enforcing the Act pending a trial. Id. at 104.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interlocutory appeal ensued. On motion duly filed, see Fed. R. App. P. 8(a), we stayed the injunction pending appeal. We now reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party who seeks a preliminary injunction must show: (1) that she has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that she faces a significant potential for irreparable harm in the absence of immediate relief; (3) that the ebb and flow of possible hardships are in favorable juxtaposition (i.e., that the issuance of an injunction will not impose more of a burden on the nonmovant than its absence will impose on the movant); and (4) that the granting of prompt injunctive relief will promote (or, at least, not denigrate) the public interest. Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); Narragansett Ind. Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991). Appellate review of rulings granting or denying preliminary injunctions is quite deferential. The court of appeals will set aside such a ruling only if it is persuaded that the lower court mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the interim relief. Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 15; Narragansett Ind. Tribe, 934 F.2d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To place the appellants' First Amendment challenge into workable perspective, we begin with an overview of the constitutional doctrine governing restrictions on speech. We then consider whether the Act qualifies as content-neutral legislation for First Amendment purposes. After answering this question, we then subject the Act to the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny. Throughout, we bear in mind that the plaintiffs have mounted a facial challenge to the Act as a whole, not an as-applied challenge to some particular application of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Doctrinal Underpinnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Freedom of speech \"is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 327 (1937) (Cardozo, J.). Notwithstanding its exalted position in the pantheon of fundamental freedoms, free speech always must be balanced against the state's responsibility to preserve and protect other important rights. This balance may be weighted differently, however, depending upon the nature of the restriction that the government seeks to foster. We elaborate below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Governmental restrictions on the content of particular speech pose a high risk that the sovereign is, in reality, seeking to stifle unwelcome ideas rather than to achieve legitimate regulatory objectives. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 641 (1994). As a general rule, therefore, the government cannot inhibit, suppress, or impose differential content-based burdens on speech. Id. at 641-42. To provide maximum assurance that the government will not throw its weight on the scales of free expression, thereby \"manipulat[ing] . . . public debate through coercion rather than persuasion,\" id. at 641, courts presume content-based regulations to be unconstitutional. R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992); Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir. 1995). While courts theoretically will uphold such a regulation if it is absolutely necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that end, see, e.g., Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 321-29 (1988); Ark. Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 231-32 (1987), such regulations rarely survive constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts grow even more chary when the government attempts to differentiate between disparate views espoused by those speaking on a singular subject. That chariness -- some might say hostility -- is not surprising, for viewpoint-based discrimination is a particularly offensive type of content-based discrimination. Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial review takes on a different cast when a statute does not regulate speech per se, but, rather, restricts the time, place, and manner in which expression may occur. Such laws are less threatening to freedom of speech because they tend to burden speech only incidentally, that is, for reasons unrelated to the speech's content or the speaker's viewpoint. Where that description applies, courts employ a less exacting level of scrutiny, upholding limitations on the time, place, and manner of protected expression as long as \"they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, . . . are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and . . . leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\" Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984). This less taxing level of analysis -- commonly called \"intermediate scrutiny\" -- makes sense because the very fact of content neutrality offers a meaningful assurance that the government is not striving in a clandestine manner to steer public discourse or brainwash its citizens. Turner Broad. Sys., 512 U.S. at 642. We start, then, by analyzing whether the Act is content-neutral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Classifying the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that \"the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality, in speech cases generally and in time, place, or manner cases in particular, is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\" Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989). Thus, a law designed to serve purposes unrelated to the content of protected speech is deemed content-neutral even if, incidentally, it has an adverse effect on certain messages while leaving others untouched. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 736; City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 47-48 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By addressing political speech on public streets and sidewalks, the Act plainly operates at the core of the First Amendment. See Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939) (noting that public streets and sidewalks are traditional public fora which \"time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions\"). First Amendment interests nonetheless must be harmonized with the state's need to exercise its traditional police powers. Hill, 530 U.S. at 714-15. The district court resolved this balance against the appellants. It opined that the state legislature enacted section 120E1/2 because it disagreed with both the content of, and the viewpoint inherent in, anti-abortion protests. See McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 102-03. The court thus concluded that the Act, on its face, discriminates against abortion-related speech, id. at 102, and that the employee exemption compounds this evil by facilitating the airing of pro-choice sentiments while simultaneously restricting the expressive activities of pro-life partisans, id. at 103. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that the Act constitutes invidious content-based discrimination against abortion-related speech, the lower court emphasized that \"the Massachusetts statute applies exclusively to speech communicated at abortion clinics and not . . . to all health care facilities.\" Id. at 102. We believe that the court, in reaching this conclusion, misconstrued applicable First Amendment doctrine by focusing exclusively on the effects of the Act rather than on its underlying purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical question in determining content neutrality is not whether certain speakers are disproportionately burdened, but, rather, whether the reason for the differential treatment is -- or is not -- content-based. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 719 (positing that a statute is content-neutral when it does not directly regulate speech, has its origins in a legislative purpose unrelated to disagreement with the underlying message of particular speech, and advances interests unconnected to expressive content). As long as a regulation serves a legitimate purpose unrelated to expressive content, it is deemed content-neutral even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers and not others. Ward, 491 U.S. at 791; Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 740. In that event, all that remains is for the government to show that accomplishment of the legitimate purpose that prompted the law also rationally explains its differential impact. See City of Renton, 475 U.S. at 47-48; Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 738.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, without much question, that the Act's stated goals justify its specific application to RHCFs. The Massachusetts legislature, confronted with an apparently serious public safety problem, investigated the matter thoroughly. That investigation yielded solid evidence that abortion protesters are particularly aggressive and patients particularly vulnerable as they enter or leave RHCFs. Thus, targeting these sites furthers conventional objectives of the state's police power -- promoting public health, preserving personal security, and affording safe access to medical services. Although the Act clearly affects anti-abortion protesters more than other groups, there is no principled basis for assuming that this differential treatment results from a fundamental disagreement with the content of their expression. Rather, the finding required on these facts is that the legislature was making every effort to restrict as little speech as possible while combating the deleterious secondary effects of anti-abortion protests. Just as targeting medical centers did not render Colorado's counterpart statute content-based, Hill, 530 U.S. at 722-23, so too the Act's targeting of RHCFs fails to undermine its status as a content-neutral regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the plaintiffs insist that the state's professed concerns about public safety, personal security, and access to medical facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to censor anti-abortion speech. This insistence gets them nowhere. For one thing, their insinuations are unsupported by any record evidence. For another thing, where differential treatment is justified, on an objective basis, by the government's content-neutral effort to combat secondary effects, it is insufficient that a regulation may have been adopted in direct response to the negative impact of a particular form of speech. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 723; Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., 512 U.S. 753, 762-64 (1994); see also Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 740 (\"Secondary effects can comprise a special characteristic of a particular speaker or group of speakers.\"). This is such a case: considered as a whole, the Act provides a neutral justification -- unrelated to the content of speech -- for differential treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to parry this thrust, the plaintiffs point conspicuously to the district court's holding that the statutory exemption for clinic agents and employees constitutes impermissible viewpoint-based discrimination (and, therefore, taints the entire Act). The court premised this holding on its determination that, by allowing clinic employees to enter the floating buffer zone without constraint, the Act permits free-ranging expression of pro-choice views while suppressing pro-life messages. McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 103-04. Because this determination rests on an unsubstantiated factual foundation, we reject it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court's findings of fact must be anchored in probative evidence. See United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 654-55 (1st Cir. 1996); Blohm v. Commissioner, 994 F.2d 1542, 1548 (11th Cir. 1993); United States v. Williams, 891 F.2d 962, 964-67 (1st Cir. 1989). This bedrock principle applies to findings made on a motion for a preliminary injunction. See, e.g., Cohen v. Brown Univ., 991 F.2d 888, 906 (1st Cir. 1993). Here, however, the district court lumped together all agents and employees of RHCFs and characterized them, without a shred of record support, as \"very zealous advocates for this controversial procedure [abortion].\" McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 103. The court then stated, again without any evidentiary predicate, that these \"[e]mployees and agents of abortion clinics escort potential abortion clinic clients and counsel and exhort them to undergo an abortion within the restricted areas.\" Id. at 103 n.9. These findings are wholly unsupported and, hence, clearly erroneous. A judge's intuition cannot take the place of proof. See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that decisions must be based on more than the judge's hunch, unsupported by facts); cf. Tuf Racing Prods., Inc. v. Am. Suzuki Motor Corp., 223 F.3d 585, 590 (7th Cir. 2000) (noting that judges must reason from facts rather than settling for guesswork).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, moreover, another defect in the district court's treatment of the employee exemption. The court ignored the matter of secondary effects as they bear on that exemption. This was an unfortunate oversight: the secondary effects that the Act was designed to ameliorate include securing public safety in and around RHCFs, preventing traffic congestion, and balancing free speech with the need to maintain a salutary atmosphere for those seeking access to medical services. See S.B. 148, supra, &#167; 1. There is no evidence that agents and employees of RHCFs cause these problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, excluding those individuals does not undermine the legitimacy of the Act as a vehicle to curb the secondary effects of particular conduct and thereby achieve the legislature's announced purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history bears witness to this conclusion. Testimony taken before the state senate indicates beyond cavil that the employee exemption will promote the Act's goals because clinic employees often assist in protecting patients and ensuring their safe passage as they approach RHCFs. Indeed, the record contains numerous accounts of incidents in which clinic personnel had to approach patients to protect them from protesters and, sometimes, to prevent physical altercations. Since it is within the scope of their employment for clinic personnel to escort patients in this fashion, and since a primary purpose of the law is to facilitate safe access, the employee exemption serves the basic objectives of the Act. To cinch matters, the legislature rationally could have concluded that clinic employees are less likely to engage in directing of unwanted speech toward captive listeners -- a datum that the Hill Court recognized as justifying the statute there. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 715-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endeavoring to counter these points, the plaintiffs posit that the employee exemption could not possibly have been designed to combat those undesirable secondary effects because the Act, without the exemption, permits any person to approach a non-consenting patient for purposes other than education, protest, and counseling. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b). The exemption only has meaning, therefore, insofar as it allows those who work for RHCFs to approach within six feet of non-consenting patients to engage in such activities (i.e, education, protest, and counseling). From this plateau, the plaintiffs suggest that if a clinic employee were to approach to educate or counsel a prospective patient, that education or counseling doubtless would manifest a pro-choice viewpoint. So viewed, the sole practical purpose of the employee exemption is to promote a particular side of the abortion debate -- a feature that renders the exemption discriminatory and ensures that any application would violate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this argument has a certain logic, it ultimately fails. After all, the plaintiffs have challenged the Act on its face. The nature of this challenge raises the bar for their success: a party who mounts a facial challenge to a statute must carry a significantly heavier burden than one who seeks merely to sidetrack a particular application of the law. See Nat'l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 580 (1998); Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 76 (1st Cir. 2001); Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc'y, Inc. v. Vill. of Stratton, 240 F.3d 553, 562 (6th Cir.), petition for cert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3750 (U.S. May 18, 2001) (No. 00-1737).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the First Amendment context, this means that a plaintiff who challenges a statute on its face ordinarily must show either that the law admits of no valid application or that, even if one or more valid application exists, the law's reach nevertheless is so elongated that it threatens to inhibit constitutionally protected speech. Time Warner Entm't Co. v. FCC, 93 F.3d 957, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The plaintiffs do not challenge the employee exemption on the ground that it sweeps too broadly. Thus, they must show that the exemption admits of no constitutionally permissible application. This is an uphill climb, requiring the legal equivalent of an alpenstock and carabiners and the plaintiffs are unable to scale the heights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts owe legislative judgments substantial respect and, as a general matter, should be reluctant \"to reduce statutory language to a merely illustrative function.\" Mass. Ass'n of HMOs v. Ruthardt, 194 F.3d 176, 181 (1st Cir. 1999). The Massachusetts legislature may or may not have intended the employee exemption to serve the purpose envisioned by the plaintiffs. There are other likely explanations. For example, the legislature may have exempted clinic workers -- just as it exempted police officers -- in order to make crystal clear what already was implicit in the Act: that those who work to secure peaceful access to RHCFs need not fear prosecution. See id. (explaining that a legislative body \"may consider a specific point important or uncertain enough to justify a modicum of redundancy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate difficulty, of course, is that the legislature's subjective intent is both unknown and unknowable. At this juncture, we can look only to the purposes that may rationally be said to be served by the provision in question (here, the employee exemption). That is a large part of the reason why one who challenges a statute on its face must carry an appreciably heavier burden: a facial challenge, unlike an as-applied challenge, does not allow a reviewing court to base its judgments on actual experience or provide the court any room to capture nuances in a statute's meaning. See United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 20-22 (1960); Richard H. Fallon, Jr., As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321, 1330-35 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the argument. Because we can envision at least one legitimate reason for including the employee exemption in the Act, it would be premature to declare the Act unconstitutional for all purposes and in all applications. See United States v. Hilton, 167 F.3d 61, 71 (1st Cir.) (noting that \"[i]t makes little sense to strike down an entire statute in response to a facial attack when potential difficulties can be remedied in future cases through fact-specific as-applied challenges\"), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 844 (1999). If, as the plaintiffs predict, experience shows that clinic staffers in fact are utilizing the exemption as a means either of proselytizing or of engaging in preferential pro-choice advocacy, the plaintiffs remain free to challenge the Act, as applied, in a concrete factual setting. See Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs., 249 F.3d at 78 (rejecting facial challenge to state statute without prejudice to plaintiff's right to launch an as-applied challenge after implementation of the statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recapitulate. The Act, on its face, is content-neutral. Furthermore, although courts correctly regard viewpoint discrimination as a particularly pernicious form of content discrimination, the Act does not discriminate against speakers based on their views. The employee exemption too is neutral on its face, drawing no distinction between different ideologies. And to the extent (if at all) that the exemption contributes to the Act's disproportionate impact on anti-abortion protesters, it can be justified by reference to the state's neutral legislative goals. We conclude, therefore, that since neither the Act as a whole nor the employee exemption reflects an impermissible bias against either the content of certain speech or the views of certain speakers, the Act's constitutionality must be determined by reference to the intermediate level of scrutiny that attaches to content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Intermediate Scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the intermediate scrutiny standard, a law is deemed constitutional if it is narrowly tailored to serve significant state interests while leaving open ample alternative channels of communication. See Renton, 475 U.S. at 50; Clark, 468 U.S. at 293. The Act passes this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state legislature ascribed four purposes to the Act:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to increase public safety in and around RHCFs; to ensure smooth traffic flow; to balance free speech with the rights of persons seeking access to RHCFs to be free from hindrance; and to create an environment conducive to safe and effective medical services. S.B. 148, supra, &#167; 1. The interests that underlie these purposes are firmly rooted in the state's traditional police powers, and these are precisely the sort of interests that justify some incidental burdening of First Amendment rights. See Hill 530 U.S. at 715 (noting the \"enduring importance of the right to be free from persistent importunity, following and dogging after an offer to communicate has been declined\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, 519 U.S. 357, 376 (1997) (extolling the significance of \"ensuring public safety and order, promoting the free flow of traffic on streets and sidewalks, protecting property rights, and protecting a woman's freedom to seek pregnancy-related services\"); see also Madsen, 512 U.S. at 772-73 (\"The First Amendment does not demand that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the cacophony of political protests.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the flip side of the coin, the Act is narrowly tailored and leaves open sufficient opportunity to communicate in other ways. A law is narrowly tailored if it promotes a substantial governmental interest that would be less effectively achieved without the law and does so without burdening substantially more speech than is necessary to further this goal. Ward, 491 U.S. at 799. The plaintiffs argue that Massachusetts previously had enacted a number of general protections designed to combat the same evils as the Act, e.g., Mass Gen. Laws ch. 266 &#167; 120E (knowingly obstructing entry to health care facility); id. ch. 272 &#167; 53 (disturbing the peace); id. ch. 12 &#167; 11H (impairing civil rights); id. 265 &#167; 13A (assault and battery), and that these non-speech-restricting protections have not been enforced in the context of abortion protests. They claim, moreover, that the only behavior targeted by the Act that is not already covered by other laws is non-threatening speech, and that the Commonwealth has offered no content-neutral justifications for limiting such peaceful discourse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unconvincing. The Massachusetts legislature reasonably concluded that existing law inadequately addressed the public safety, personal security, traffic, and health care concerns created by persistent demonstrations outside RHCFs. Indeed, the state senate specifically found that existing statutory protections did not suffice -- and this finding is plausible given the general terms used by those statutes (e.g., \"obstruction,\" \"disturbing the peace\"). While such wider nets might catch the big fish, there is every reason to believe that they would let the fingerlings through. We have said enough on this subject. The short of it is that the legislature weighed the Hill Court's conclusions and formulated a bill to suit. As a result of this careful craftsmanship, the Act, in its final form, affects only areas immediately adjacent to RHCFs; prohibits only nonconsensual approaches within six feet; and applies only within a clearly marked eighteen-foot radius from clinic entrances and exits. This framework is more precisely focused and gives abortion protesters more opportunity for advocacy than does the Colorado statute upheld in Hill. Compare Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2 with Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because the Supreme Court concluded that the Colorado statute was narrowly tailored, the Act too satisfies that requirement. If, as the Hill Court stated, visual and verbal images are able to cross an eight-foot floating buffer zone with sufficient ease that the \"restriction on an unwanted physical approach leaves ample room to communicate a message through speech,\" 530 U.S. at 729, that same conclusion perforce must apply to the Act's less commodious six-foot floating buffer zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The Equal Protection Challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without developing the argument in detail, the plaintiffs, like the court below, conclusorily assert that the Act violates the Equal Protection Clause. Because the equal protection interests involved in the differential treatment of speech are inextricably intertwined with First Amendment concerns, Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972), and the plaintiffs do not develop the point separately, we treat this assertion as part of the plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge. In all events, it need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From time to time, the Supreme Court has invoked equal protection rather than free speech, as the basis for invalidating a content-based speech restriction. E.g., Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 459-63 (1980); Mosley, 408 U.S. at 94-95. But where the state shows a satisfactory rationale for a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation, that regulation necessarily passes the rational basis test employed under the Equal Protection Clause. See Thorburn v. Austin, 231 F.3d 1114, 1122 (8th Cir. 2000); Hoover v. Morales, 164 F.3d 221, 227 n.3 (5th Cir. 1998); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403, 411 n.7 (6th Cir. 1997). So it is here: the Act passes muster under the Equal Protection Clause for the same reasons that it passes muster under the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE DUE PROCESS CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The failure of the plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge does not end our journey. Even if the trial court's rationale collapses, an appellee is free to defend the judgment below on any other ground made manifest by the record. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479, 481 (1976) (per curiam); United States v. Craven, 239 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. 2001). Embracing that tenet, the plaintiffs urge us to affirm the issuance of the preliminary injunction on the ground that the Act vests unbridled discretion in RHCFs (and, thus, violates the plaintiffs' due process rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exhortation hinges upon language in the Act which provides that the six-foot floating buffer zone \"shall only take effect during a facility's business hours and if the area contained within the radius . . . is clearly marked.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(c). The plaintiffs posit that this language vests private actors -- the RHCFs -- with unconstrained power to restrict speech, and they cite numerous cases for the black-letter proposition that the Due Process Clause forbids standard less delegations of governmental authority, especially to private parties. E.g., Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 130-31 (1992); City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ'g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 758-59 (1988); Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 57-59 (1965).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this asseveration, concluding that the quoted portion of the Act \"is more logically viewed as a notice requirement serving to protect the interests of speakers such as plaintiffs.\" McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 101 n.7. We agree with this assessment. While the plaintiffs cherry-pick statements from the case law in an effort to bolster their position, they have wrested these statements from their contextual moorings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without exception, the cases on which the plaintiffs rely involve licensing schemes that allowed public officials to make discriminatory, content-based decisions. E.g., City of Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 759; Heffron v. Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 648-49 (1981). By their very nature, licensing schemes that embody grants of standard less discretion to public officials (or sometimes private individuals -- conceptually, it makes no difference) cannot constitute valid time, place, and manner restrictions because they \"ha[ve] the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.\" Heffron, 452 U.S. at 649. Since the floating buffer zone contemplated by the Act is content-neutral, see supra Part III(B), the activation provision cannot raise this type of constitutional concern. And in all events, the activation provision, to the extent that it allows clinic employees to make decisions that have a disproportionate impact on anti-abortion speech, is easily justified as an incidental burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of a four-part framework for granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief does not mean that all four components are weighted equally. In the great majority of cases, likelihood of success constitutes the proper focal point of the inquiry. Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16. This case is no exception. The district court premised its issuance of a preliminary injunction on its mistaken view that the plaintiffs probably would succeed on their First Amendment challenge. But this conclusion is insupportable. See supra Part III(B-C). Moreover, the plaintiffs cannot establish a probability of merits success on any other theory encompassed within their facial challenge to the Act. See supra Parts III(D), IV. Since likelihood of success is the sine qua non of preliminary injunctive relief, Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1993), we need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the order granting a preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In this regard, they cite Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 (1980), and Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972), for the proposition that singling out a certain form of protest is tantamount to content-based discrimination. These authorities are unhelpful. In Carey, the Court struck down a statute that prohibited residential protests other than peaceful labor picketing. 447 U.S. at 471. In Mosley, the Court overturned a statute that prohibited all protests except labor picketing near a school. 408 U.S. at 101-02. In each instance, the Court declared the statute unconstitutional because the legislative purpose -- protecting residential privacy and preserving safe access to schools, respectively -- could not logically account for the special treatment accorded to labor protests. Here, however, as in Hill, 530 U.S. at 724, the targeting is closely confined to the legitimate legislative purpose that underlies the Act: combating violence at RHCFs. See also City of Renton 475 U.S. at 47 (upholding a zoning ordinance that sought to prevent crime, protect residential neighborhoods, and maintain property values by singling out adult theaters).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the record does show that, on occasion, a clinic employee has gotten into an altercation with an anti-abortion protester. But this sort of disturbance presumably would be stemmed by the exemption because the exemption tends to keep clinic employees and abortion protesters apart.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the state senate wrote this list of purposes as a preamble to Senate Bill No. 148, there is nothing in the subsequent legislative history to suggest that the purposes changed after the senate bill was amended in the house of representatives to produce the final version.

We act in the context of a Massachusetts statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2 (the Act), which creates a floating six-foot buffer zone around pedestrians and motor vehicles as they approach reproductive health care facilities (RHCFs). We view that statute through the prism of Hill v. Colorado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span> (2000), in which the United States Supreme Court upheld an analogous statute despite the fact that it incidentally restricted some speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found meaningful distinctions between the Act and the Colorado statute at issue in Hill, determined that these distinctions undermined the constitutionality of the Act, and preliminarily enjoined the Act's enforcement. See McGuire v. Reilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580458/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 101-03 (D. Mass. 2000). But the distinctions noted by the district court do not make a dispositive difference. Hill controls, and the Act, on its face, lawfully regulates the time, place, and manner of speech without discriminating based on content or viewpoint. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's ukase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to frame the issues on appeal, we think it is useful to trace the developments leading to the Act's passage, survey its text, and place it in the context suggested by the Hill Court's decision. With that foundation in place, we then recount the proceedings below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Act's History.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the late 1990s, Massachusetts had experienced repeated incidents of violence and aggressive behavior outside RHCFs. Concerned legislators responded to these disturbances by introducing Senate Bill No. 148, see S.B. 148, 181st Gen. Ct., Reg. Sess. (Mass. Jan. 6, 1999), reprinted in Appendix B hereto. The bill purposed to create a fixed twenty-five foot buffer zone from RHCFs' entrances, exits, and driveways, and with limited exceptions, to prohibit all persons from entering, or remaining within, that buffer zone regardless of the person's intent or the willingness of others to listen. The state senate held a hearing in April of 1999. The received testimony chronicled the harassment and intimidation that typically occurred outside RHCFs. In addition, numerous witnesses addressed the emotional and physical vulnerability of women seeking to avail themselves of abortion services, and gave accounts of the deleterious effects of overly aggressive demonstrations on patients and providers alike. Based in part on this testimony, the senate concluded that existing laws did not adequately protect public safety in areas surrounding RHCFs. To remedy this situation, the senate favored the creation of fixed buffer zones. The sponsors of the bill left no doubt that they intended the proposed law to \"increase public safety in and around [RHCFs]\" while \"maintain[ing] the flow of traffic and prevent[ing] congestion\" there. S.B. 148, supra, &#167; 1. In the bargain, the sponsors expected the law to provide \"reasonable time, place and manner restrictions to reconcile and protect both the First Amendment rights of persons to express their views near reproductive health care facilities and the rights of persons seeking access to those facilities to be free from hindrance, harassment, intimidation and harm.\" It thereby would \"create an environment in and around reproductive health care facilities which is conducive towards the provision of safe and effective medical services . . . to its patients.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skeptics worried that the proposed law might offend the Constitution. To stave off these gloom-and-doom predictions, the senate, on November 3, 1999, asked the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) for an advisory opinion on the bill's constitutionality. On January 24, 2000, the SJC concluded that the Constitution presented no obstacle to enactment. Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></span>, 1211-12 (2000). The SJC advised that the bill, as framed, was unrelated to the content of protected expression. Id. at 1209. Moreover, the restrictions imposed had a rational basis in view of the heightened governmental interest that arises when \"advocates of both sides of one of the nation's most divisive issues frequently meet within close proximity of each other in the areas immediately surrounding the State's clinics, in what can and often do become congested areas charged with anger.\" Id. at 1210.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving this favorable review, the senate engrossed Senate Bill No. 148 on February 29, 2000. That version of the law never came to a vote in the house of representatives, mainly because the United States Supreme Court decided Hill on June 28, 2000. In that opinion, the Court upheld, as a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, a Colorado statute designed to ameliorate the same evils. 530 U.S. at 719-21. The Court's conclusion rested on three pillars:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, [the statute] is not a regulation of speech. Rather, it is a regulation of the places where some speech may occur. Second, it was not adopted because of disagreement with the message it conveys. . . . Third, the State's interests in protecting access and privacy, and providing the police with clear guidelines, are unrelated to the content of the demonstrators' speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 719-20 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts decided to follow the trail that Colorado had blazed. Consequently, the house of representatives struck the text of Senate Bill No. 148 and reformulated its language. The amended version -- ultimately enacted and codified as section 120E1/2 -- recast the proposed statute and, most notably, replaced the fixed buffer zones originally envisioned by the state senate with floating buffer zones of the type upheld in Hill. The house engrossed the bill on July 28, 2000, and the senate concurred the next day. On August 10, 2000, Governor Cellucci signed the Act into law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Act's Text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act, formally known as the Massachusetts Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act, is reprinted in Appendix A hereto. The Act makes it unlawful, absent consent, \"knowingly to approach [within six feet of a person or occupied motor vehicle] for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education or counseling with such other person in the public way or sidewalk area within a radius of 18 feet from any entrance door or driveway to a reproductive health care facility.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory prohibition is not absolute. In the first place, the architecture of this floating buffer zone precludes speakers from approaching unconsenting listeners, but it neither prevents speakers from holding their ground nor requires them to retreat from passers by. In the second place, the Act's prophylaxis does not attach unless and until an RHCF opens for business and clearly demarcates the protected eighteen-foot zone. Id. &#167; 120E1/2 (c). Finally, the Act exempts persons entering or leaving an RHCF; persons using the streets to reach a destination other than the RHCF; and, while acting within the scope of their employment, (i) the RHCF's employees and agents, and (ii) certain government officials (e.g., police officers). Id. &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Influence of Hill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In rejecting a challenge to a similar Colorado statute, the Hill Court made a number of pronouncements that inform our resolution of this appeal. Perhaps most important, the Court held that the Colorado law was content-neutral even though it singled out \"oral protest, education, [and] counseling,\" because this denoted a broad category of speech rather than specifying a particular subject matter or viewpoint. 530 U.S. at 720. In reaching this conclusion, the Court gave short shrift to the argument that, by targeting health care facilities, the Colorado statute impermissibly discriminated against abortion protesters. Id. at 724.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three other points deserve mention. First, the Court emphasized the significance of the state's interest in preserving access to health care facilities. Id. at 715. Second, the Court noted that the Colorado legislature had tailored the law narrowly to serve this end. Id. at 728-29. Third, the Court determined that a floating buffer zone of modest proportions left ample alternative channels for communication. Id. at 723.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hill bears on this case in another way as well. Although the Act was conceived in the albedo of Hill, it is not a carbon copy of the statute at issue there. There are five key differences:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The protections of the Colorado law apply to all health care facilities, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122, whereas the Act applies only to free-standing clinics that provide abortions, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Colorado statute specifies an 100-foot radius around all covered facilities, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122(3), whereas the Act specifies an eighteen-foot radius, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Colorado statute pretermits unwanted approaches within eight feet of anyone inside the specified area, Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122(3), while the Act constructs only a six-foot buffer zone, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The directive that the Act apply only when an RHCF is open for business and has clearly demarcated the protected area, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(c), is not part of the Colorado scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act, unlike the Colorado law, exempts various groups of persons from its reach. Id. &#167; 120E1/2(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most of these respects, the Act arguably restricts less speech than its Colorado counterpart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Proceedings Below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs -- Mary Anne McGuire, Ruth Schiavone, and Jean B. Zarrella -- are Massachusetts residents who regularly protest, demonstrate, and provide sidewalk counseling outside RHCFs. Shortly after the passage of the Act, they sued a number of state hierarchs in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. They argued that the Act violated their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, equal protection, and due process of law. To remedy these deprivations, they sought both a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality and an injunction against its enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that the Act offended the First Amendment in two ways. First, the court regarded the Act as an impermissible content-based restriction because it \"pertain[s] exclusively to speech that communicates a message of protest, education, or counseling spoken at the entrances of abortion clinics.\" McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 102. Second, the court determined that the Act discriminated on the basis of viewpoint. Id. at 103. The court reasoned that the Act's exemption of agents and employees of RHCFs gives rise to this infirmity because, by virtue of their \"personal relationship with the abortion clinic, [employees] have a strong financial interest or philosophic incentive to counsel the listener to undergo an abortion and they constitute very zealous advocates for this controversial procedure.\" Id. For these reasons, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and enjoined the defendants from enforcing the Act pending a trial. Id. at 104.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interlocutory appeal ensued. On motion duly filed, see Fed. R.

THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION STANDARD</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party who seeks a preliminary injunction must show: (1) that she has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that she faces a significant potential for irreparable harm in the absence of immediate relief; (3) that the ebb and flow of possible hardships are in favorable juxtaposition (i.e., that the issuance of an injunction will not impose more of a burden on the nonmovant than its absence will impose on the movant); and (4) that the granting of prompt injunctive relief will promote (or, at least, not denigrate) the public interest.

Appellate review of rulings granting or denying preliminary injunctions is quite deferential.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To place the appellants' First Amendment challenge into workable perspective, we begin with an overview of the constitutional doctrine governing restrictions on speech. We then consider whether the Act qualifies as content-neutral legislation for First Amendment purposes. After answering this question, we then subject the Act to the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny. Throughout, we bear in mind that the plaintiffs have mounted a facial challenge to the Act as a whole, not an as-applied challenge to some particular application of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

Notwithstanding its exalted position in the pantheon of fundamental freedoms, free speech always must be balanced against the state's responsibility to preserve and protect other important rights. This balance may be weighted differently, however, depending upon the nature of the restriction that the government seeks to foster. We elaborate below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Governmental restrictions on the content of particular speech pose a high risk that the sovereign is, in reality, seeking to stifle unwelcome ideas rather than to achieve legitimate regulatory objectives.

As a general rule, therefore, the government cannot inhibit, suppress, or impose differential content-based burdens on speech. Id. at 641-42. To provide maximum assurance that the government will not throw its weight on the scales of free expression, thereby \"manipulat[ing] . . . public debate through coercion rather than persuasion,\" id. at 641, courts presume content-based regulations to be unconstitutional. R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 382 (1992); Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v.

While courts theoretically will uphold such a regulation if it is absolutely necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that end, see, e.g., Boos v.

That chariness -- some might say hostility -- is not surprising, for viewpoint-based discrimination is a particularly offensive type of content-based discrimination. Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, 829 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial review takes on a different cast when a statute does not regulate speech per se, but, rather, restricts the time, place, and manner in which expression may occur. Such laws are less threatening to freedom of speech because they tend to burden speech only incidentally, that is, for reasons unrelated to the speech's content or the speaker's viewpoint. Where that description applies, courts employ a less exacting level of scrutiny, upholding limitations on the time, place, and manner of protected expression as long as \"they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, . . . are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and . . . leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\" Clark v.

This less taxing level of analysis -- commonly called \"intermediate scrutiny\" -- makes sense because the very fact of content neutrality offers a meaningful assurance that the government is not striving in a clandestine manner to steer public discourse or brainwash its citizens. Turner Broad. Sys., 512 U.S. at 642. We start, then, by analyzing whether the Act is content-neutral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Classifying the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that \"the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality, in speech cases generally and in time, place, or manner cases in particular, is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\" Ward v.

Thus, a law designed to serve purposes unrelated to the content of protected speech is deemed content-neutral even if, incidentally, it has an adverse effect on certain messages while leaving others untouched. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 736; City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111597\"><a href=\"/opinion/111597/renton-v-playtime-theatres-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47-48 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By addressing political speech on public streets and sidewalks, the Act plainly operates at the core of the First Amendment.

First Amendment interests nonetheless must be harmonized with the state's need to exercise its traditional police powers. Hill, 530 U.S. at 714-15. The district court resolved this balance against the appellants. It opined that the state legislature enacted section 120E1/2 because it disagreed with both the content of, and the viewpoint inherent in, anti-abortion protests. See McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 102-03. The court thus concluded that the Act, on its face, discriminates against abortion-related speech, id. at 102, and that the employee exemption compounds this evil by facilitating the airing of pro-choice sentiments while simultaneously restricting the expressive activities of pro-life partisans, id. at 103. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that the Act constitutes invidious content-based discrimination against abortion-related speech, the lower court emphasized that \"the Massachusetts statute applies exclusively to speech communicated at abortion clinics and not . . . to all health care facilities.\" Id. at 102. We believe that the court, in reaching this conclusion, misconstrued applicable First Amendment doctrine by focusing exclusively on the effects of the Act rather than on its underlying purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical question in determining content neutrality is not whether certain speakers are disproportionately burdened, but, rather, whether the reason for the differential treatment is -- or is not -- content-based. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 719 (positing that a statute is content-neutral when it does not directly regulate speech, has its origins in a legislative purpose unrelated to disagreement with the underlying message of particular speech, and advances interests unconnected to expressive content). As long as a regulation serves a legitimate purpose unrelated to expressive content, it is deemed content-neutral even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers and not others. Ward, 491 U.S. at 791; Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 740. In that event, all that remains is for the government to show that accomplishment of the legitimate purpose that prompted the law also rationally explains its differential impact. See City of Renton, 475 U.S. at 47-48; Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 738.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, without much question, that the Act's stated goals justify its specific application to RHCFs. The Massachusetts legislature, confronted with an apparently serious public safety problem, investigated the matter thoroughly. That investigation yielded solid evidence that abortion protesters are particularly aggressive and patients particularly vulnerable as they enter or leave RHCFs. Thus, targeting these sites furthers conventional objectives of the state's police power -- promoting public health, preserving personal security, and affording safe access to medical services. Although the Act clearly affects anti-abortion protesters more than other groups, there is no principled basis for assuming that this differential treatment results from a fundamental disagreement with the content of their expression. Rather, the finding required on these facts is that the legislature was making every effort to restrict as little speech as possible while combating the deleterious secondary effects of anti-abortion protests. Just as targeting medical centers did not render Colorado's counterpart statute content-based, Hill, 530 U.S. at 722-23, so too the Act's targeting of RHCFs fails to undermine its status as a content-neutral regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the plaintiffs insist that the state's professed concerns about public safety, personal security, and access to medical facilities are mere pretexts for its desire to censor anti-abortion speech. This insistence gets them nowhere. For one thing, their insinuations are unsupported by any record evidence. For another thing, where differential treatment is justified, on an objective basis, by the government's content-neutral effort to combat secondary effects, it is insufficient that a regulation may have been adopted in direct response to the negative impact of a particular form of speech. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 723; Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117871\"><a href=\"/opinion/117871/madsen-v-womens-health-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 762-64 (1994); see also Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 740 (\"Secondary effects can comprise a special characteristic of a particular speaker or group of speakers.\"). This is such a case: considered as a whole, the Act provides a neutral justification -- unrelated to the content of speech -- for differential treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to parry this thrust, the plaintiffs point conspicuously to the district court's holding that the statutory exemption for clinic agents and employees constitutes impermissible viewpoint-based discrimination (and, therefore, taints the entire Act). The court premised this holding on its determination that, by allowing clinic employees to enter the floating buffer zone without constraint, the Act permits free-ranging expression of pro-choice views while suppressing pro-life messages. McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 103-04. Because this determination rests on an unsubstantiated factual foundation, we reject it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court's findings of fact must be anchored in probative evidence.

Here, however, the district court lumped together all agents and employees of RHCFs and characterized them, without a shred of record support, as \"very zealous advocates for this controversial procedure [abortion].\" McGuire, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 103. The court then stated, again without any evidentiary predicate, that these \"[e]mployees and agents of abortion clinics escort potential abortion clinic clients and counsel and exhort them to undergo an abortion within the restricted areas.\" Id. at 103 n.9. These findings are wholly unsupported and, hence, clearly erroneous. A judge's intuition cannot take the place of proof. See United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 717 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that decisions must be based on more than the judge's hunch, unsupported by facts); cf.

The court ignored the matter of secondary effects as they bear on that exemption. This was an unfortunate oversight: the secondary effects that the Act was designed to ameliorate include securing public safety in and around RHCFs, preventing traffic congestion, and balancing free speech with the need to maintain a salutary atmosphere for those seeking access to medical services. See S.B. 148, supra, &#167; 1. There is no evidence that agents and employees of RHCFs cause these problems.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, excluding those individuals does not undermine the legitimacy of the Act as a vehicle to curb the secondary effects of particular conduct and thereby achieve the legislature's announced purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history bears witness to this conclusion. Testimony taken before the state senate indicates beyond cavil that the employee exemption will promote the Act's goals because clinic employees often assist in protecting patients and ensuring their safe passage as they approach RHCFs. Indeed, the record contains numerous accounts of incidents in which clinic personnel had to approach patients to protect them from protesters and, sometimes, to prevent physical altercations. Since it is within the scope of their employment for clinic personnel to escort patients in this fashion, and since a primary purpose of the law is to facilitate safe access, the employee exemption serves the basic objectives of the Act. To cinch matters, the legislature rationally could have concluded that clinic employees are less likely to engage in directing of unwanted speech toward captive listeners -- a datum that the Hill Court recognized as justifying the statute there. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 715-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endeavoring to counter these points, the plaintiffs posit that the employee exemption could not possibly have been designed to combat those undesirable secondary effects because the Act, without the exemption, permits any person to approach a non-consenting patient for purposes other than education, protest, and counseling. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2(b). The exemption only has meaning, therefore, insofar as it allows those who work for RHCFs to approach within six feet of non-consenting patients to engage in such activities (i.e, education, protest, and counseling). From this plateau, the plaintiffs suggest that if a clinic employee were to approach to educate or counsel a prospective patient, that education or counseling doubtless would manifest a pro-choice viewpoint. So viewed, the sole practical purpose of the employee exemption is to promote a particular side of the abortion debate -- a feature that renders the exemption discriminatory and ensures that any application would violate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this argument has a certain logic, it ultimately fails. After all, the plaintiffs have challenged the Act on its face. The nature of this challenge raises the bar for their success: a party who mounts a facial challenge to a statute must carry a significantly heavier burden than one who seeks merely to sidetrack a particular application of the law.

Time Warner Entm't Co. v. FCC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724982\"><a href=\"/opinion/724982/time-warner-entertainment-co-lp-appellantpetitioner-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The plaintiffs do not challenge the employee exemption on the ground that it sweeps too broadly. Thus, they must show that the exemption admits of no constitutionally permissible application. This is an uphill climb, requiring the legal equivalent of an alpenstock and carabiners and the plaintiffs are unable to scale the heights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts owe legislative judgments substantial respect and, as a general matter, should be reluctant \"to reduce statutory language to a merely illustrative function.\" Mass. Ass'n of HMOs v. Ruthardt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198675\"><a href=\"/opinion/198675/massachusetts-v-ruthardt/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 181 (1st Cir. 1999). The Massachusetts legislature may or may not have intended the employee exemption to serve the purpose envisioned by the plaintiffs. There are other likely explanations. For example, the legislature may have exempted clinic workers -- just as it exempted police officers -- in order to make crystal clear what already was implicit in the Act: that those who work to secure peaceful access to RHCFs need not fear prosecution. See id. (explaining that a legislative body \"may consider a specific point important or uncertain enough to justify a modicum of redundancy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate difficulty, of course, is that the legislature's subjective intent is both unknown and unknowable. At this juncture, we can look only to the purposes that may rationally be said to be served by the provision in question (here, the employee exemption). That is a large part of the reason why one who challenges a statute on its face must carry an appreciably heavier burden: a facial challenge, unlike an as-applied challenge, does not allow a reviewing court to base its judgments on actual experience or provide the court any room to capture nuances in a statute's meaning. See United States v. Raines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 20-22 (1960); Richard H.

Because we can envision at least one legitimate reason for including the employee exemption in the Act, it would be premature to declare the Act unconstitutional for all purposes and in all applications. See United States v. Hilton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761516\"><a href=\"/opinion/761516/united-states-v-david-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.)

If, as the plaintiffs predict, experience shows that clinic staffers in fact are utilizing the exemption as a means either of proselytizing or of engaging in preferential pro-choice advocacy, the plaintiffs remain free to challenge the Act, as applied, in a concrete factual setting. See Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs., 249 F.3d at 78 (rejecting facial challenge to state statute without prejudice to plaintiff's right to launch an as-applied challenge after implementation of the statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recapitulate. The Act, on its face, is content-neutral. Furthermore, although courts correctly regard viewpoint discrimination as a particularly pernicious form of content discrimination, the Act does not discriminate against speakers based on their views. The employee exemption too is neutral on its face, drawing no distinction between different ideologies. And to the extent (if at all) that the exemption contributes to the Act's disproportionate impact on anti-abortion protesters, it can be justified by reference to the state's neutral legislative goals. We conclude, therefore, that since neither the Act as a whole nor the employee exemption reflects an impermissible bias against either the content of certain speech or the views of certain speakers, the Act's constitutionality must be determined by reference to the intermediate level of scrutiny that attaches to content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

See Renton, 475 U.S. at 50; Clark, 468 U.S. at 293. The Act passes this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state legislature ascribed four purposes to the Act:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to increase public safety in and around RHCFs; to ensure smooth traffic flow; to balance free speech with the rights of persons seeking access to RHCFs to be free from hindrance; and to create an environment conducive to safe and effective medical services. S.B. 148, supra, &#167; 1. The interests that underlie these purposes are firmly rooted in the state's traditional police powers, and these are precisely the sort of interests that justify some incidental burdening of First Amendment rights. See Hill 530 U.S. at 715 (noting the \"enduring importance of the right to be free from persistent importunity, following and dogging after an offer to communicate has been declined\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118085\"><a href=\"/opinion/118085/schenck-v-pro-choice-network-of-western-ny/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 376 (1997) (extolling the significance of \"ensuring public safety and order, promoting the free flow of traffic on streets and sidewalks, protecting property rights, and protecting a woman's freedom to seek pregnancy-related services\"); see also Madsen, 512 U.S. at 772-73 (\"The First Amendment does not demand that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the cacophony of political protests.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the flip side of the coin, the Act is narrowly tailored and leaves open sufficient opportunity to communicate in other ways. A law is narrowly tailored if it promotes a substantial governmental interest that would be less effectively achieved without the law and does so without burdening substantially more speech than is necessary to further this goal. Ward, 491 U.S. at 799. The plaintiffs argue that Massachusetts previously had enacted a number of general protections designed to combat the same evils as the Act, e.g., Mass Gen. Laws ch. 266 &#167; 120E (knowingly obstructing entry to health care facility); id. ch. 272 &#167; 53 (disturbing the peace); id. ch. 12 &#167; 11H (impairing civil rights); id. 265 &#167; 13A (assault and battery), and that these non-speech-restricting protections have not been enforced in the context of abortion protests. They claim, moreover, that the only behavior targeted by the Act that is not already covered by other laws is non-threatening speech, and that the Commonwealth has offered no content-neutral justifications for limiting such peaceful discourse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is unconvincing. The Massachusetts legislature reasonably concluded that existing law inadequately addressed the public safety, personal security, traffic, and health care concerns created by persistent demonstrations outside RHCFs. Indeed, the state senate specifically found that existing statutory protections did not suffice -- and this finding is plausible given the general terms used by those statutes (e.g., \"obstruction,\" \"disturbing the peace\"). While such wider nets might catch the big fish, there is every reason to believe that they would let the fingerlings through. We have said enough on this subject. The short of it is that the legislature weighed the Hill Court's conclusions and formulated a bill to suit. As a result of this careful craftsmanship, the Act, in its final form, affects only areas immediately adjacent to RHCFs; prohibits only nonconsensual approaches within six feet; and applies only within a clearly marked eighteen-foot radius from clinic entrances and exits. This framework is more precisely focused and gives abortion protesters more opportunity for advocacy than does the Colorado statute upheld in Hill. Compare Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167; 120E1/2 with Colo. Rev. Stat. &#167; 18-9-122.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because the Supreme Court concluded that the Colorado statute was narrowly tailored, the Act too satisfies that requirement. If, as the Hill Court stated, visual and verbal images are able to cross an eight-foot floating buffer zone with sufficient ease that the \"restriction on an unwanted physical approach leaves ample room to communicate a message through speech,\" 530 U.S. at 729, that same conclusion perforce must apply to the Act's less commodious six-foot floating buffer zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

But where the state shows a satisfactory rationale for a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation, that regulation necessarily passes the rational basis test employed under the Equal Protection Clause.

By their very nature, licensing schemes that embody grants of standard less discretion to public officials (or sometimes private individuals -- conceptually, it makes no difference) cannot constitute valid time, place, and manner restrictions because they \"ha[ve] the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.\" Heffron, 452 U.S. at 649. Since the floating buffer zone contemplated by the Act is content-neutral, see supra Part III(B), the activation provision cannot raise this type of constitutional concern. And in all events, the activation provision, to the extent that it allows clinic employees to make decisions that have a disproportionate impact on anti-abortion speech, is easily justified as an incidental burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See Nat'l Amusements, 43 F.3d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

It is hereby found and declared that existing law does not adequately protect the public safety in the areas in and around reproductive health care facilities. Indeed, such facilities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts have been the focal point of many blockades, disturbances and even violence, particularly the shootings at two reproductive health services facilities on December 30, 1994, which, left two persons dead and many injured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further found that persons attempting to enter or depart from reproductive health care facilities have been subject to harassing or intimidating activity by persons approaching within extremely close proximity and shouting or waving objects at them, which has tended to hamper or impede access to or departure from those facilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further found that such activity near reproductive health care facilities creates a \"captive audience\" situation because persons seeking health care services cannot avoid the area outside of reproductive health care facilities if they are to receive the services provided therein, and their physical and emotional ailments or conditions can make them especially vulnerable to the adverse physiological and emotional effects of such harassing or intimidating activities directed at them from extremely close proximity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further found that the violence and disturbances described above have required the deployment of police officers at significant cost to the cities and towns of the Commonwealth, and continue to occur despite civil injunctions that prohibit certain persons from engaging in such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And it is further found that studies have shown that clinics with buffer zones experience far larger decreases in every type of violence than clinics without buffer zones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the purpose of this legislation is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) to increase the public safety in and around reproductive health care facilities;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) to maintain the flow of traffic and prevent congestion around reproductive health care facilities;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) to enact reasonable time, place and manner restrictions to reconcile and protect both the First Amendment rights of persons to express their views near reproductive health care facilities and the rights of persons seeking access to those facilities to be free from hindrance, harassment, intimidation and harm; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) to create an environment in and around reproductive health care facilities which is conducive towards the provision of safe and effective medical services, including surgical procedures, to its patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2.

Said civil action shall be instituted either in the superior court for the county in which the conduct complained of occurred, or in the superior court for the county in which any person or entity complained of resides or has a principal place of business. An aggrieved person or entity which prevails in an action authorized by this paragraph, in addition to other damages, shall be entitled to an award of the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorney's fees in an amount to be fixed by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) A criminal conviction pursuant to the provision of this section shall not be a condition precedent to maintaining a civil action pursuant to the provision of this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 3. The provisions of this act shall be deemed severable, and if any provision of this act is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid, such judgment shall not affect other valid provisions hereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs see this targeting as a smoking gun. In this regard, they cite Carey v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110309\"><a href=\"/opinion/110309/carey-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span> (1980), and Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108597\"><a href=\"/opinion/108597/police-dept-of-chicago-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span> (1972), for the proposition that singling out a certain form of protest is tantamount to content-based discrimination. These authorities are unhelpful. In Carey, the Court struck down a statute that prohibited residential protests other than peaceful labor picketing. 447 U.S. at 471. In Mosley, the Court overturned a statute that prohibited all protests except labor picketing near a school. 408 U.S. at 101-02. In each instance, the Court declared the statute unconstitutional because the legislative purpose -- protecting residential privacy and preserving safe access to schools, respectively -- could not logically account for the special treatment accorded to labor protests. Here, however, as in Hill, 530 U.S. at 724, the targeting is closely confined to the legitimate legislative purpose that underlies the Act: combating violence at RHCFs. See also City of Renton 475 U.S. at 47 (upholding a zoning ordinance that sought to prevent crime, protect residential neighborhoods, and maintain property values by singling out adult theaters).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the record does show that, on occasion, a clinic employee has gotten into an altercation with an anti-abortion protester. But this sort of disturbance presumably would be stemmed by the exemption because the exemption tends to keep clinic employees and abortion protesters apart.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although the state senate wrote this list of purposes as a preamble to Senate Bill No. 148, there is nothing in the subsequent legislative history to suggest that the purposes changed after the senate bill was amended in the house of representatives to produce the final version. We therefore follow the parties' lead and assume that this litany applies to the Act.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To illustrate, the Act creates a six-foot bubble around unwilling listeners, as opposed to the eight-foot bubble sanctioned under the Colorado law; the Act covers an eighteen-foot radius as opposed to the 100-foot radius covered by the Colorado statute; and the Act, unlike its Colorado counterpart, does not go into effect unless and until the covered area has been clearly delineated.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note an irony: as a practical matter the activation provision tends to favor (rather than curtail) anti-abortion expression because it establishes conditions that RHCFs must meet before the Act's prophylaxis takes effect.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
