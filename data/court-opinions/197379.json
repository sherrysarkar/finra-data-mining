That  sojourn\r\n\nceased on January 5,  1994, when, after having been  convicted of\r\n\nvarious  crimes committed between 1989 and 1993, he was deported.\r\n\nWe do not chronicle the  complete compendium of Correa's criminal\r\n\ncapers,  but  confine  ourselves  to conveying  the  contours  of\r\n\ncertain crimes  that possess  particular  pertinence for  present\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          1.   The  February Offenses.   On  March 13,  1991, the\r                    1.   The  February Offenses.\r                                               \r\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts issued  a criminal complaint (later\r\n\nserved  by summons) which charged  Correa, then 19  years of age,\r\n\nwith  three  counts of  breaking and  entering  and one  count of\r\n\nlarceny.  See  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  266,    16A, 30  (1990).  The\r                       \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ncharges arose from a spree that occurred on February 19, 1991; on\r\n\nthat  date, Correa  raided three  separate automobiles  parked in\r\n\nDanvers, Massachusetts, and  absconded with ill-gotten gain  from\r\n\none.\r\n\n          2.   The  June Offenses.   Some  months later,  Correa,\r                    2.   The  June Offenses.\r                                           \r\n\nstill  19, was  charged  with  falsifying  his  age  to  purchase\r\n\nalcoholic beverages, in violation  of Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  138,  \r\n\n34A  (1991), and contributing to  the delinquency of  a child for\r\n\nbuying  and  serving  alcohol  to  two  boys,  ages  12  and  15,\r\n\nrespectively,  in  violation of  Mass. Gen.  Laws  ch. 119,    63\r\n\n(1993).  The infractions were alleged to have occurred on June 8,\r\n\n1991, in Beverly, Massachusetts.\r\n\n          3.  The  State Court Disposition  Hearing.  On  October\r                    3.  The  State Court Disposition  Hearing.\r                                                             \r\n\n28,  1992, Correa pled  guilty in a  state district  court to all\r\n\ncharges  arising from  both  incidents.    With  respect  to  the\r\n\nFebruary offenses, the court imposed a nine-month sentence on the\r\n\nthree   breaking-and-entering  counts   and  filed   the  larceny\r\n\nconviction.  With respect  to the June offenses, the  court filed\r\n\nall the convictions.1\r\n\n          In due course, the  government deported Correa.  Little\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In  Massachusetts, after  a plea  of  guilty in  a criminal\r\ncase, \"a judge, with the consent of  the defendant, may place the\r\ncase on file rather than impose sentence immediately.\"  DuPont v.\r                                                                        \r\nSuperior  Court, 401  Mass. 122,  123 (1987).   Although  that is\r                         \r\nusually the  end of the matter,  the case thereafter  \"may at any\r\ntime be called up [by the  court] and sentence may be imposed, or\r\nsome  other final disposition made  of it.\"   Marks v. Wentworth,\r                                                                          \r\n199 Mass. 44, 45 (1908).  Hence, the  defendant's right to appeal\r\nis  suspended for  the length of  time that  the case  remains on\r\nfile.  See DuPont, 401 Mass. at 123; Commonwealth v. Delgado, 367\r                                                                      \r\nMass. 432, 438 (1975).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ndaunted, he reentered  the United States  unlawfully in 1995  and\r\n\nfound his way to Lynn, Massachusetts.  The authorities eventually\r\n\napprehended him  and pressed a  charge of  illegal reentry  after\r\n\ndeportation.  See 8 U.S.C.   1326 (1994).  Correa  pled guilty to\r                           \r\n\nthis  accusation  in  federal  district court.    The  sentencing\r\n\nproceeding that followed comprises the cynosure of this appeal.2\r\n\n          We  set   the  stage.    In   applying  the  sentencing\r\n\nguidelines, a  nisi prius  court, among other  things, transposes\r\n\nthe  defendant's criminal  past into  \"criminal history  points,\"\r\n\nthus  obtaining  a  \"criminal   history  score\"  which  yields  a\r\n\n\"criminal history  category.\"   See United  States v.  Emery, 991\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  907, 909-10  (1st  Cir. 1993)  (illustrating the  process).\r\n\nSince the guideline sentencing range (GSR) is derived from a grid\r\n\nand  is determined in a given case by correlating the defendant's\r\n\ncriminal history  category with  his adjusted offense  level, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.  Diaz-Villafane, 874  F.2d 43,  47-48 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1989), criminal  history points can profoundly  affect the length\r\n\nof a sentence.\r\n\n          This case typifies  the phenomenon.   In the course  of\r\n\nhis sentencing calculations,  Judge O'Toole treated  the February\r\n\noffenses  as  comprising  one  crime  and  the  June offenses  as\r\n\ncomprising another, unrelated crime.  Hence, he assigned criminal\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  district  court apparently  applied the  November 1995\r\nedition  of the  sentencing  guidelines.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\nHarotunian,  920  F.2d  1040,  1041-42  &amp;  n.2  (1st  Cir.  1990)\r                    \r\n(explaining  that  the  guidelines  in  effect  at  the  time  of\r\nsentencing control  unless ex post  facto considerations prohibit\r\ntheir use).  Thus, all references herein are to that edition.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nhistory  points for  each.   On  that  basis, Correa  garnered  a\r\n\ncriminal history score of 7, which placed him in criminal history\r\n\ncategory  IV.    Had the  judge  treated  the  February and  June\r\n\noffenses as related rather  than unrelated, or had he  deemed the\r\n\nJune  offenses  unworthy  of  consideration,   Correa's  criminal\r\n\nhistory score would  have dropped  by one point,  placing him  in\r\n\ncriminal  history category  III.   At  Correa's adjusted  offense\r\n\nlevel (19),  the single  criminal history point  accounted for  a\r\n\nsubstantial  increase in his GSR (which rose from 37-46 months to\r\n\n46-57 months).  See USSG ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).\r                             \r\n\n          Having  added the disputed  criminal history  point and\r\n\nfixed  the GSR  at  46-57 months,  the  judge then  accepted  the\r\n\ngovernment's  recommendation, incorporated in the plea agreement,\r\n\nthat  Correa be sentenced at  the nadir of  the applicable range.\r\n\nConsequently,   the  court   imposed  a   46-month  incarcerative\r\n\nsentence.  This  appeal ensued.   In it,  the appellant  contends\r\n\nthat  the  district court  erred  in  adding  the extra  criminal\r\n\nhistory  point.    He makes  two  arguments  in  support of  this\r\n\ncontention.  We treat these arguments sequentially.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r                                            \r\n\n                          Related Cases\r                                    Related Cases\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  guidelines  require  the  assessment  of  criminal\r\n\nhistory  points for  \"each prior  sentence.\"   USSG  4A1.1.   But\r\n\nthere are  exceptions.   One such exception  authorizes sentences\r\n\nimposed in  what the Sentencing Commission  calls \"related cases\"\r\n\nto  be  treated as  a single  sentence.   See  USSG  4A1.2(a)(2).\r                                                       \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nInsofar as  pertinent here, sentences are  considered related \"if\r\n\nthey  resulted from  offenses that  . .  . were  consolidated for\r\n\ntrial  or sentencing.\"    Id., comment.  (n.3).   At  sentencing,\r                                       \r\n\nCorrea argued unsuccessfully that  the February and June offenses\r\n\nfell  within this safe  harbor (and, therefore,  should be deemed\r\n\nrelated) because  the state court had in effect consolidated them\r\n\nfor sentencing.   Judge O'Toole  rejected the  notion that  these\r\n\ndisparate offenses constituted  a set of related cases.3   Correa\r\n\nnow presses this argument on appeal.\r\n\n          The standard of review in sentencing appeals ordinarily\r\n\nis deferential.  See 18 U.S.C.    3742(e) (1994); see also Dietz,\r                                                                          \r\n\n950 F.2d  at 52.  Thus,  \"where there is more  than one plausible\r\n\nview of  the circumstances,  the sentencing court's  choice among\r\n\nsupportable  alternatives\"  is  not   clearly  erroneous  and   a\r\n\nreviewing tribunal cannot disturb it.  United States v. Ruiz, 905\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 499,  508 (1st Cir. 1990).   However, to the  extent that an\r\n\nalleged error  involves the district court's  interpretation of a\r\n\nsentencing guideline,  it presents  a question of  law warranting\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3In so ruling, the lower court relied on an application note\r\ninstructing that \"[p]rior sentences are not considered related if\r\nthey  were  for offenses  that were  separated by  an intervening\r\narrest (i.e.,  the defendant is  arrested for  the first  offense\r                      \r\nprior to committing the second offense).\"  USSG   4A1.2, comment.\r\n(n.3).  The court repudiated United States v. Joseph, 50 F.3d 401\r                                                              \r\n(7th  Cir.), cert. denied, 116  S. Ct. 139  (1995), and impliedly\r                                   \r\nfound that the summons Correa received for the February offenses,\r\nwhich had  been served  before  he committed  the June  offenses,\r\nconstituted the functional  equivalent of an intervening  arrest.\r\nWhile this  holding seems  problematic, we  need not  resolve the\r\nuncertainty.   Here, the  record plainly presents  an alternative\r\nground for affirmance, and we are free to use that ground in lieu\r\nof the trial court's  rationale.  See Hachikian v.  FDIC, 96 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nplenary review.  See  United States v.

St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1992).  So it is here.\r\n\n          In United  States v.  Elwell, 984  F.2d 1289 (1st  Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1993),  we intimated that  a mere coincidence  in timing, without\r\n\nmore, is not enough  to justify treating convictions that  do not\r\n\npossess  common  antecedents  as  having  been  consolidated  for\r\n\npurposes of sentencing.

By the same\r                          \r\n\ntoken, we reject the  minority view embodied in United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSmith,  991 F.2d 1468, 1473 (9th Cir. 1993) (envisioning \"no need\r               \r\n\nfor  a formal consolidation order for cases to be `related' under\r\n\nsection 4A1.2\").\r\n\n          We  are cognizant  that some  may see  insistence on  a\r\n\nformal  indicium of consolidation, such  as an order  or a docket\r\n\nentry, as  arbitrary.   But judicial  inquiry into a  defendant's\r\n\ncriminal  past  for  sentencing  purposes,   properly  conceived,\r\n\nrequires  only a  snapshot of  the surface, not  an archeological\r\n\ndig.   Thus,  when  a  federal court  is  obliged  to tabulate  a\r\n\ndefendant's  criminal  history  score  for  sentencing  purposes,\r\n\nlimiting  the  requisite  inquiry  to the  formal  record     the\r\n\nindictment, the  docket entries, the judgment  of conviction, and\r\n\nthe like   strikes the right balance.  Moreover, it does so  in a\r\n\nmanner that  supplies needed  uniformity while husbanding  scarce\r\n\njudicial resources.\r\n\n          This  approach also is in keeping with the way in which\r\n\nwe have treated  analogous matters.   After all,  when a  federal\r\n\ncourt  looks  to  a prior  state  conviction  in formulating  its\r\n\nsentencing  calculus,  the  court  most  often  characterizes the\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nprevious conviction  by means  of a formal  categorical approach,\r\n\nrestricting its  examination to  the legislature's  definition of\r\n\nthe  crime.  See,  e.g., Taylor v.  United States,  495 U.S. 575,\r                                                           \r\n\n600-02  (1990); United States v.

If the  legislature's  definition  provides an  inexact\r\n\nconstruct, however, the court commonly bases its characterization\r\n\nof the previous conviction  on what is readily apparent  from the\r\n\nformal documents  in the case,  without delving more  deeply into\r\n\nthe  actual circumstances of the offense.  See, e.g., Taylor, 495\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at  602 (permitting a  sentencing court, when  a categorical\r\n\napproach  fails,  to  consider   the  charging  papers  and  jury\r\n\ninstructions to  ascertain the  contours of the  particular prior\r\n\noffense); United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1994)\r                                           \r\n\n(similar); United  States v.

Were  we  to  do  so,  we  would  make  criminal\r\n\nsentencing   already  an operose  task under the  guidelines    a\r\n\nmore   cumbersome  and   time-consuming   endeavor  with   little\r\n\ncorresponding benefit.   Criminal  history, by  definition, deals\r\n\nwith bygone events which  often happened in the distant  past, or\r\n\nin a remote jurisdiction,  or both.  Requiring a federal judge to\r\n\ngo  behind the  formal record  and excavate  the details  of what\r\n\ntranspired  in  each instance  would  impose  an onerous  burden,\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nfreighted with unusual evidentiary difficulties.  We think that a\r\n\ncategorical  rule, analogous  to  that sponsored  by the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt in Taylor, better serves the interests of justice.\r                         \r\n\n          In the instant  case, the record  is pellucid that  the\r\n\nstate  court  judge  never  entered an  order  consolidating  the\r\n\ncomplaints, which  embodied the  February and June  offenses, for\r\n\nsentencing or  for any other purpose.  To the exact contrary, the\r\n\ncomplaints embodying these two sets of offenses were at all times\r\n\nhandled under separate docket numbers, and there is no indication\r\n\nthat  the state  court  judge ever  gave  a moment's  thought  to\r\n\nwhether consolidation was (or was  not) desirable.  Moreover, the\r\n\nappellant concedes that the offenses occurred in different places\r\n\nat different  times  and  that they  arose  in  widely  divergent\r\n\nfactual contexts.  Last, but  not least, this is not a  situation\r\n\nin which  the court  of original  jurisdiction  imposed a  single\r\n\nsentence spanning a  series of  discrete offenses.   Rather,  the\r\n\ncourt  imposed  a prison  sentence  on  the breaking-and-entering\r\n\nconvictions (the main component of the February offenses) but did\r\n\nnot include the  convictions on the June offenses as  part of the\r\n\nunderpinning for that  sentence.  Instead, the  court filed those\r\n\ncharges, in effect  reserving the right to  call up the  file and\r\n\nimpose a sentence at a future date.  See supra note 1.\r                                                        \r\n\n          We  will not  paint the  lily.   Because there  were no\r\n\nformal indicia  of consolidation, the February  offenses were not\r\n\n\"related\"  to the  June offenses  under a  proper reading  of the\r\n\nfederal sentencing guidelines.  Hence, the appellant's  principal\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nassignment of error fails.\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r                                            \r\n\n                     Juvenile Status Offenses\r                               Juvenile Status Offenses\r                                                       \r\n\n          The appellant's fallback position  is that, even if the\r\n\nJune offenses are not  \"related\" to the February offenses  in the\r\n\nrequisite  sense, they  nonetheless are juvenile  status offenses\r\n\nand thus not countable  in compiling his criminal  history score.\r\n\nSee USSG   4A1.2(c) (ordaining  that the sentencing  court should\r             \r\n\n\"never count  . . .  [j]uvenile status offenses\"  when tabulating\r\n\ncriminal  history  points).   The  district  court rejected  this\r\n\nasseveration.  So do we.\r\n\n          The  sentencing  guidelines  do  not  define  the  term\r\n\n\"juvenile status offense,\"  although they offer  illustrations of\r\n\ncrimes which,  like juvenile  status offenses, are  excludable in\r\n\ncomputing  a  defendant's  criminal  history  score.    See  USSG\r                                                                     \r\n\n 4A1.2(c)(2).   In determining  whether a prior  conviction falls\r\n\nwithin  the  ambit of  section 4A1.2(c)(2),  courts traditionally\r\n\n\"look  to the substance of the underlying state offense.\"  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Unger, 915 F.2d 759,  763 (1st Cir. 1990).   Moreover,\r                          \r\n\ncourts  can derive some guidance from a mirror image provision in\r\n\nthe  guidelines  which  encourages  the  assignment  of  criminal\r\n\nhistory points  for  a  crime committed  by  a  defendant  before\r\n\nreaching the  age of 18 if he or she perpetrated the crime within\r\n\nthe five-year period immediately  preceding the occurrence of the\r\n\noffense of conviction.  See USSG   4A1.2(d)(2).  This provision's\r                                     \r\n\nprimary purpose is to promote points for past crimes that predict\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\ncriminal proclivity.\r\n\n          Considering   together  the  caselaw   and  the  actual\r\n\nguideline  provisions, we  conclude  that a  crime constitutes  a\r\n\njuvenile status offense only if three elements coalesce:  (1) the\r\n\ndefendant  committed the crime  as a  juvenile, see  USSG  4A1.2,\r                                                             \r\n\ncomment. (n.7); (2) the conduct would have been lawful if engaged\r\n\nin by  an adult, see United  States v. Ward, 71  F.3d 262, 263-64\r                                                     \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1995);  and (3) the offense is not  serious, see United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Hardeman, 933 F.2d 278, 281-83  (5th Cir. 1991).  When\r                             \r\n\nall  is said and done, this third element, which necessitates the\r\n\nappraisal of  gravity for  a given  crime, is  quintessentially a\r\n\njudgment  call.   Still, the  illustrations of  exempted offenses\r\n\nsupplied   by   the   Sentencing   Commission,   e.g.,   truancy,\r\n\nhitchhiking, loitering, vagrancy, and minor  traffic infractions,\r\n\nUSSG  4A1.2(c)(2),  furnish a  valid point  of  comparison.   The\r\n\nenumerated offenses all  possess a  bland quality  that helps  to\r\n\ndistinguish  them  from  more  substantial transgressions:    for\r\n\nexample, one  common characteristic is that  they provide little,\r\n\nif  any, indication  of a person's  proclivity to  commit future,\r\n\nmore serious crimes.\r\n\n          In applying this paradigm to the June offenses, we note\r\n\nfirst  that either of the two component crimes   falsifying one's\r\n\nage  to purchase alcohol and contributing to the delinquency of a\r\n\nchild    is, if not an exempted offense, independently sufficient\r\n\nto warrant the bestowal of the challenged criminal history point.\r\n\nSince  contributing to the delinquency of a child is arguably the\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nmore weighty of the crimes, we focus exclusively on it.\r\n\n          The  appellant flunks  the first  segment of  the test:\r\n\nthe victims may have been juveniles, but in  ascertaining whether\r                     \r\n\na  crime is  (or is  not) a  juvenile status  offense, it  is the\r\n\nperpetrator's age,  not  the victim's  age,  that matters     and\r\n\nCorrea was 19 years old when he committed the  act.  Accordingly,\r\n\nhe was not a juvenile.  See USSG  4A1.2, comment. (n.7) (defining\r                                     \r\n\na juvenile for this purpose as a person under the age of 18).  He\r\n\nalso fails  to satisfy the  second requirement:   contributing to\r\n\nthe  delinquency  of   a  child  is   conduct  which  state   law\r\n\ncriminalizes regardless of the perpetrator's age.  See Mass. Gen.\r                                                                \r\n\nLaws ch. 119,  63.\r\n\n          Since the appellant's  argument depends on  his ability\r\n\nto establish three  factors, and  the first two  are lacking,  we\r\n\nneed  go no further.4   It is abundantly  clear that the district\r\n\ncourt did  not err either in  declining to classify the  crime of\r\n\ncontributing to the delinquency  of a child as a  juvenile status\r\n\noffense or in assessing an extra criminal history point for it.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Because the  appellant's argument  stalls at the  first two\r\nstages of the test, we need not decide  whether the offense might\r\nbe  written off either as youthful folly or as lacking predictive\r\nvalue vis- -vis  future lawlessness (and,  therefore, pass muster\r\nat the third stage of the test).\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n",

The February Offenses.   On March 13, 1991, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued a criminal complaint (later served by summons) which charged Correa, then 19 years of age, with three counts of breaking and entering and one count of larceny.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167;&#167; 16A, 30 (1990).  The charges arose from a spree that occurred on February 19, 1991;  on that date, Correa raided three separate automobiles parked in Danvers, Massachusetts, and absconded with ill-gotten gain from one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The June Offenses.   Some months later, Correa, still 19, was charged with falsifying his age to purchase alcoholic beverages, in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 138, &#167; 34A (1991), and contributing to the delinquency of a child for buying and serving alcohol to two boys, ages 12 and 15, respectively, in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 119, &#167; 63 (1993).

The State Court Disposition Hearing.   On October 28, 1992, Correa pled guilty in a state district court to all charges arising from both incidents.  With respect to the February offenses, the court imposed a nine-month sentence on the three breaking-and-entering counts and filed the larceny conviction.

Little daunted, he reentered the United States unlawfully in 1995 and found his way to Lynn, Massachusetts.  The authorities eventually apprehended him and pressed a charge of illegal reentry after deportation.  See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326 (1994).  Correa pled guilty to this accusation in federal district court.

In applying the sentencing guidelines, a nisi prius court, among other things, transposes the defendant's criminal past into \"criminal history points,\" thus obtaining a \"criminal history score\" which yields a \"criminal history category.\"   See United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 909-10 (1st Cir.1993) (illustrating the process).  Since the guideline sentencing range (GSR) is derived from a grid and is determined in a given case by correlating the defendant's criminal history category with his adjusted offense level, see United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47-48 (1st Cir.1989), criminal history points can profoundly affect the length of a sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case typifies the phenomenon.  In the course of his sentencing calculations, Judge O'Toole treated the February offenses as comprising one crime and the June offenses as comprising another, unrelated crime.  Hence, he assigned criminal history points for each.  On that basis, Correa garnered a criminal history score of 7, which placed him in criminal history category IV.  Had the judge treated the February and June offenses as related rather than unrelated, or had he deemed the June offenses unworthy of consideration, Correa's criminal history score would have dropped by one point, placing him in criminal history category III.  At Correa's adjusted offense level (19), the single criminal history point accounted for a substantial increase in his GSR (which rose from 37-46 months to 46-57 months).  See USSG ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having added the disputed criminal history point and fixed the GSR at 46-57 months, the judge then accepted the government's recommendation, incorporated in the plea agreement, that Correa be sentenced at the nadir of the applicable range.  Consequently, the court imposed a 46-month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.  In it, the appellant contends that the district court erred in adding the extra criminal history point.  He makes two arguments in support of this contention.  We treat these arguments sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Related Cases</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines require the assessment of criminal history points for \"each prior sentence.\"  USSG &#167; 4A1.1.  But there are exceptions.  One such exception authorizes sentences imposed in what the Sentencing Commission calls \"related cases\" to be treated as a single sentence.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2).  Insofar as pertinent here, sentences are considered related \"if they resulted from offenses that ... were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\"  Id., comment.  (n.3).  At sentencing, Correa argued unsuccessfully that the February and June offenses fell within this safe harbor (and, therefore, should be deemed related) because the state court had in effect consolidated them for sentencing.  Judge O'Toole rejected the notion that these disparate offenses constituted a set of related cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Correa now presses this argument on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review in sentencing appeals ordinarily is deferential.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e) (1994);  see also Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.   Thus, \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives\" is not clearly erroneous and a reviewing tribunal cannot disturb it.  United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990).  However, to the extent that an alleged error involves the district court's interpretation of a sentencing guideline, it presents a question of law warranting plenary review.  See United States v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).  So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Elwell, 984 F.2d 1289 (1st Cir.1993), we intimated that a mere coincidence in timing, without more, is not enough to justify treating convictions that do not possess common antecedents as having been consolidated for purposes of sentencing.  See id. at 1296 n. 7 (explaining that such convictions cannot be \"deemed 'constructively' consolidated because of ... [a] plea bargain and concurrent sentences\") (dictum).  We now transform the Elwell adumbration into an express holding:  at least in respect to offenses that are temporally and factually distinct (that is, offenses which occurred on different dates and which did not arise out of the same course of conduct), charges based thereon should not be regarded as having been consolidated (and, therefore, \"related\") unless the original sentencing court entered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of the record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have some relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that sentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so holding, we align ourselves with a number of our sister circuits which have reached a substantially similar conclusion.  See, e.g., United States v. Patasnik, 89 F.3d 63, 74 (2d Cir.1996);  Green v. United States, 65 F.3d 546, 548-49 (6th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 826, 133 L.Ed.2d 769 (1996);  United States v. Allen, 50 F.3d 294, 298-99 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2630, 132 L.Ed.2d 870 (1995);  United States v. Alberty, 40 F.3d 1132, 1134-35 (10th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1043, 115 S.Ct. 1416, 131 L.Ed.2d 300 (1995);  United States v. Klein, 13 F.3d 1182, 1185 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Garcia, 962 F.2d 479, 483 (5th Cir.1992).  By the same token, we reject the minority view embodied in United States v. Smith, 991 F.2d 1468, 1473 (9th Cir.1993) (envisioning \"no need for a formal consolidation order for cases to be 'related' under section 4A1.2\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are cognizant that some may see insistence on a formal indicium of consolidation, such as an order or a docket entry, as arbitrary.  But judicial inquiry into a defendant's criminal past for sentencing purposes, properly conceived, requires only a snapshot of the surface, not an archeological dig.  Thus, when a federal court is obliged to tabulate a defendant's criminal history score for sentencing purposes, limiting the requisite inquiry to the formal record--the indictment, the docket entries, the judgment of conviction, and the like--strikes the right balance.  Moreover, it does so in a manner that supplies needed uniformity while husbanding scarce judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach also is in keeping with the way in which we have treated analogous matters.  After all, when a federal court looks to a prior state conviction in formulating its sentencing calculus, the court most often characterizes the previous conviction by means of a formal categorical approach, restricting its examination to the legislature's definition of the crime.  See, e.g., Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159-60, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990);  United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. De Jesus, 984 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1993).  If the legislature's definition provides an inexact construct, however, the court commonly bases its characterization of the previous conviction on what is readily apparent from the formal documents in the case, without delving more deeply into the actual circumstances of the offense.  See, e.g., Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160 (permitting a sentencing court, when a categorical approach fails, to consider the charging papers and jury instructions to ascertain the contours of the particular prior offense);  United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1994) (similar);  United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 3-4 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1992) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not disposed to deviate from this salutary principle in interpreting the \"related case\" guideline, USSG &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2).  Were we to do so, we would make criminal sentencing--already an operose task under the guidelines--a more cumbersome and time-consuming endeavor with little corresponding benefit.  Criminal history, by definition, deals with bygone events which often happened in the distant past, or in a remote jurisdiction, or both.  Requiring a federal judge to go behind the formal record and excavate the details of what transpired in each instance would impose an onerous burden, freighted with unusual evidentiary difficulties.  We think that a categorical rule, analogous to that sponsored by the Supreme Court in Taylor, better serves the interests of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the record is pellucid that the state court judge never entered an order consolidating the complaints, which embodied the February and June offenses, for sentencing or for any other purpose.  To the exact contrary, the complaints embodying these two sets of offenses were at all times handled under separate docket numbers, and there is no indication that the state court judge ever gave a moment's thought to whether consolidation was (or was not) desirable.  Moreover, the appellant concedes that the offenses occurred in different places at different times and that they arose in widely divergent factual contexts.  Last, but not least, this is not a situation in which the court of original jurisdiction imposed a single sentence spanning a series of discrete offenses.  Rather, the court imposed a prison sentence on the breaking-and-entering convictions (the main component of the February offenses) but did not include the convictions on the June offenses as part of the underpinning for that sentence.  Instead, the court filed those charges, in effect reserving the right to call up the file and impose a sentence at a future date.  See supra note 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Because there were no formal indicia of consolidation, the February offenses were not \"related\" to the June offenses under a proper reading of the federal sentencing guidelines.  Hence, the appellant's principal assignment of error fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Juvenile Status Offenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position is that, even if the June offenses are not \"related\" to the February offenses in the requisite sense, they nonetheless are juvenile status offenses and thus not countable in compiling his criminal history score.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(c) (ordaining that the sentencing court should \"never count ... [j]uvenile status offenses\" when tabulating criminal history points).  The district court rejected this asseveration.  So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines do not define the term \"juvenile status offense,\" although they offer illustrations of crimes which, like juvenile status offenses, are excludable in computing a defendant's criminal history score.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2).  In determining whether a prior conviction falls within the ambit of section 4A1.2(c)(2), courts traditionally \"look to the substance of the underlying state offense.\"  United States v. Unger, 915 F.2d 759, 763 (1st Cir.1990).  Moreover, courts can derive some guidance from a mirror image provision in the guidelines which encourages the assignment of criminal history points for a crime committed by a defendant before reaching the age of 18 if he or she perpetrated the crime within the five-year period immediately preceding the occurrence of the offense of conviction.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(d)(2).  This provision's primary purpose is to promote points for past crimes that predict criminal proclivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering together the caselaw and the actual guideline provisions, we conclude that a crime constitutes a juvenile status offense only if three elements coalesce:  (1) the defendant committed the crime as a juvenile, see USSG &#167; 4A1.2, comment.  (n.7);  (2) the conduct would have been lawful if engaged in by an adult, see United States v. Ward, 71 F.3d 262, 263-64 (7th Cir.1995);  and (3) the offense is not serious, see United States v. Hardeman, 933 F.2d 278, 281-83 (5th Cir.1991).  When all is said and done, this third element, which necessitates the appraisal of gravity for a given crime, is quintessentially a judgment call.  Still, the illustrations of exempted offenses supplied by the Sentencing Commission, e.g., truancy, hitchhiking, loitering, vagrancy, and minor traffic infractions, USSG &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2), furnish a valid point of comparison.  The enumerated offenses all possess a bland quality that helps to distinguish them from more substantial transgressions:  for example, one common characteristic is that they provide little, if any, indication of a person's proclivity to commit future, more serious crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying this paradigm to the June offenses, we note first that either of the two component crimes--falsifying one's age to purchase alcohol and contributing to the delinquency of a child--is, if not an exempted offense, independently sufficient to warrant the bestowal of the challenged criminal history point.  Since contributing to the delinquency of a child is arguably the more weighty of the crimes, we focus exclusively on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant flunks the first segment of the test:  the victims may have been juveniles, but in ascertaining whether a crime is (or is not) a juvenile status offense, it is the perpetrator's age, not the victim's age, that matters--and Correa was 19 years old when he committed the act.  Accordingly, he was not a juvenile.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2, comment.  (n.7) (defining a juvenile for this purpose as a person under the age of 18).  He also fails to satisfy the second requirement:  contributing to the delinquency of a child is conduct which state law criminalizes regardless of the perpetrator's age.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 119, &#167; 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the appellant's argument depends on his ability to establish three factors, and the first two are lacking, we need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  It is abundantly clear that the district court did not err either in declining to classify the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a child as a juvenile status offense or in assessing an extra criminal history point for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In Massachusetts, after a plea of guilty in a criminal case, \"a judge, with the consent of the defendant, may place the case on file rather than impose sentence immediately.\"  DuPont v.

Although that is usually the end of the matter, the case thereafter \"may at any time be called up [by the court] and sentence may be imposed, or some other final disposition made of it.\"  Marks v. Wentworth, 199 Mass. 44, 45, 85 N.E. 81 (1908).  Hence, the defendant's right to appeal is suspended for the length of time that the case remains on file.  See DuPont, 401 Mass. at 123, 514 N.E.2d 1086;  Commonwealth v.

Joseph, 50 F.3d 401 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 139, 133 L.Ed.2d 86 (1995), and impliedly found that the summons Correa received for the February offenses, which had been served before he committed the June offenses, constituted the functional equivalent of an intervening arrest.  While this holding seems problematic, we need not resolve the uncertainty.  Here, the record plainly presents an alternative ground for affirmance, and we are free to use that ground in lieu of the trial court's rationale.  See Hachikian v.

That sojourn ceased on January 5, 1994, when, after having been convicted of various crimes committed between 1989 and 1993, he was deported.  We do not chronicle the complete compendium of Correa's criminal capers, but confine ourselves to conveying the contours of certain crimes that possess particular pertinence for present purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The February Offenses.   On March 13, 1991, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued a criminal complaint (later served by summons) which charged Correa, then 19 years of age, with three counts of breaking and entering and one count of larceny.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 266, &#167;&#167; 16A, 30 (1990).  The charges arose from a spree that occurred on February 19, 1991;  on that date, Correa raided three separate automobiles parked in Danvers, Massachusetts, and absconded with ill-gotten gain from one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The June Offenses.   Some months later, Correa, still 19, was charged with falsifying his age to purchase alcoholic beverages, in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 138, &#167; 34A (1991), and contributing to the delinquency of a child for buying and serving alcohol to two boys, ages 12 and 15, respectively, in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 119, &#167; 63 (1993).  The infractions were alleged to have occurred on June 8, 1991, in Beverly, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The State Court Disposition Hearing.   On October 28, 1992, Correa pled guilty in a state district court to all charges arising from both incidents.  With respect to the February offenses, the court imposed a nine-month sentence on the three breaking-and-entering counts and filed the larceny conviction.  With respect to the June offenses, the court filed all the convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the government deported Correa.  Little daunted, he reentered the United States unlawfully in 1995 and found his way to Lynn, Massachusetts.  The authorities eventually apprehended him and pressed a charge of illegal reentry after deportation.  See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326 (1994).  Correa pled guilty to this accusation in federal district court.  The sentencing proceeding that followed comprises the cynosure of this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the stage.  In applying the sentencing guidelines, a nisi prius court, among other things, transposes the defendant's criminal past into \"criminal history points,\" thus obtaining a \"criminal history score\" which yields a \"criminal history category.\"   See United States v. Emery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605526\"><a href=\"/opinion/605526/united-states-v-charles-e-emery/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 909-10 (1st Cir.1993) (illustrating the process).  Since the guideline sentencing range (GSR) is derived from a grid and is determined in a given case by correlating the defendant's criminal history category with his adjusted offense level, see United States v. Diaz-Villafane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 47-48 (1st Cir.1989), criminal history points can profoundly affect the length of a sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case typifies the phenomenon.  In the course of his sentencing calculations, Judge O'Toole treated the February offenses as comprising one crime and the June offenses as comprising another, unrelated crime.  Hence, he assigned criminal history points for each.  On that basis, Correa garnered a criminal history score of 7, which placed him in criminal history category IV.  Had the judge treated the February and June offenses as related rather than unrelated, or had he deemed the June offenses unworthy of consideration, Correa's criminal history score would have dropped by one point, placing him in criminal history category III.  At Correa's adjusted offense level (19), the single criminal history point accounted for a substantial increase in his GSR (which rose from 37-46 months to 46-57 months).  See USSG ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having added the disputed criminal history point and fixed the GSR at 46-57 months, the judge then accepted the government's recommendation, incorporated in the plea agreement, that Correa be sentenced at the nadir of the applicable range.  Consequently, the court imposed a 46-month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.  In it, the appellant contends that the district court erred in adding the extra criminal history point.  He makes two arguments in support of this contention.  We treat these arguments sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Related Cases</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines require the assessment of criminal history points for \"each prior sentence.\"  USSG &#167; 4A1.1.  But there are exceptions.  One such exception authorizes sentences imposed in what the Sentencing Commission calls \"related cases\" to be treated as a single sentence.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2).  Insofar as pertinent here, sentences are considered related \"if they resulted from offenses that ... were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\"  Id., comment.  (n.3).  At sentencing, Correa argued unsuccessfully that the February and June offenses fell within this safe harbor (and, therefore, should be deemed related) because the state court had in effect consolidated them for sentencing.  Judge O'Toole rejected the notion that these disparate offenses constituted a set of related cases.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Correa now presses this argument on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review in sentencing appeals ordinarily is deferential.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e) (1994);  see also Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.   Thus, \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives\" is not clearly erroneous and a reviewing tribunal cannot disturb it.

Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1990).  However, to the extent that an alleged error involves the district court's interpretation of a sentencing guideline, it presents a question of law warranting plenary review.  See United States v.

See id. at 1296 n. 7 (explaining that such convictions cannot be \"deemed 'constructively' consolidated because of ... [a] plea bargain and concurrent sentences\") (dictum).  We now transform the Elwell adumbration into an express holding:  at least in respect to offenses that are temporally and factually distinct (that is, offenses which occurred on different dates and which did not arise out of the same course of conduct), charges based thereon should not be regarded as having been consolidated (and, therefore, \"related\") unless the original sentencing court entered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of the record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have some relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that sentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so holding, we align ourselves with a number of our sister circuits which have reached a substantially similar conclusion.

But judicial inquiry into a defendant's criminal past for sentencing purposes, properly conceived, requires only a snapshot of the surface, not an archeological dig.  Thus, when a federal court is obliged to tabulate a defendant's criminal history score for sentencing purposes, limiting the requisite inquiry to the formal record--the indictment, the docket entries, the judgment of conviction, and the like--strikes the right balance.  Moreover, it does so in a manner that supplies needed uniformity while husbanding scarce judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach also is in keeping with the way in which we have treated analogous matters.  After all, when a federal court looks to a prior state conviction in formulating its sentencing calculus, the court most often characterizes the previous conviction by means of a formal categorical approach, restricting its examination to the legislature's definition of the crime.  See, e.g., Taylor v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 600-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the legislature's definition provides an inexact construct, however, the court commonly bases its characterization of the previous conviction on what is readily apparent from the formal documents in the case, without delving more deeply into the actual circumstances of the offense.  See, e.g., Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160 (permitting a sentencing court, when a categorical approach fails, to consider the charging papers and jury instructions to ascertain the contours of the particular prior offense);  United States v. Winter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195327\"><a href=\"/opinion/195327/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1994) (similar);  United States v.

Were we to do so, we would make criminal sentencing--already an operose task under the guidelines--a more cumbersome and time-consuming endeavor with little corresponding benefit.  Criminal history, by definition, deals with bygone events which often happened in the distant past, or in a remote jurisdiction, or both.  Requiring a federal judge to go behind the formal record and excavate the details of what transpired in each instance would impose an onerous burden, freighted with unusual evidentiary difficulties.  We think that a categorical rule, analogous to that sponsored by the Supreme Court in Taylor, better serves the interests of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the record is pellucid that the state court judge never entered an order consolidating the complaints, which embodied the February and June offenses, for sentencing or for any other purpose.  To the exact contrary, the complaints embodying these two sets of offenses were at all times handled under separate docket numbers, and there is no indication that the state court judge ever gave a moment's thought to whether consolidation was (or was not) desirable.  Moreover, the appellant concedes that the offenses occurred in different places at different times and that they arose in widely divergent factual contexts.  Last, but not least, this is not a situation in which the court of original jurisdiction imposed a single sentence spanning a series of discrete offenses.  Rather, the court imposed a prison sentence on the breaking-and-entering convictions (the main component of the February offenses) but did not include the convictions on the June offenses as part of the underpinning for that sentence.  Instead, the court filed those charges, in effect reserving the right to call up the file and impose a sentence at a future date.  See supra note 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Because there were no formal indicia of consolidation, the February offenses were not \"related\" to the June offenses under a proper reading of the federal sentencing guidelines.  Hence, the appellant's principal assignment of error fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Juvenile Status Offenses</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's fallback position is that, even if the June offenses are not \"related\" to the February offenses in the requisite sense, they nonetheless are juvenile status offenses and thus not countable in compiling his criminal history score.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(c) (ordaining that the sentencing court should \"never count ... [j]uvenile status offenses\" when tabulating criminal history points).  The district court rejected this asseveration.  So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines do not define the term \"juvenile status offense,\" although they offer illustrations of crimes which, like juvenile status offenses, are excludable in computing a defendant's criminal history score.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2).  In determining whether a prior conviction falls within the ambit of section 4A1.2(c)(2), courts traditionally \"look to the substance of the underlying state offense.\"  United States v. Unger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548928\"><a href=\"/opinion/548928/united-states-v-eric-n-unger/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 763 (1st Cir.1990).  Moreover, courts can derive some guidance from a mirror image provision in the guidelines which encourages the assignment of criminal history points for a crime committed by a defendant before reaching the age of 18 if he or she perpetrated the crime within the five-year period immediately preceding the occurrence of the offense of conviction.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(d)(2).  This provision's primary purpose is to promote points for past crimes that predict criminal proclivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering together the caselaw and the actual guideline provisions, we conclude that a crime constitutes a juvenile status offense only if three elements coalesce:  (1) the defendant committed the crime as a juvenile, see USSG &#167; 4A1.2, comment.  (n.7);  (2) the conduct would have been lawful if engaged in by an adult, see United States v. Ward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709064\"><a href=\"/opinion/709064/united-states-v-anthony-d-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 263-64 (7th Cir.1995);  and (3) the offense is not serious, see United States v. Hardeman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561282\"><a href=\"/opinion/561282/united-states-v-bennie-ray-hardeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 281-83 (5th Cir.1991).  When all is said and done, this third element, which necessitates the appraisal of gravity for a given crime, is quintessentially a judgment call.  Still, the illustrations of exempted offenses supplied by the Sentencing Commission, e.g., truancy, hitchhiking, loitering, vagrancy, and minor traffic infractions, USSG &#167; 4A1.2(c)(2), furnish a valid point of comparison.  The enumerated offenses all possess a bland quality that helps to distinguish them from more substantial transgressions:  for example, one common characteristic is that they provide little, if any, indication of a person's proclivity to commit future, more serious crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying this paradigm to the June offenses, we note first that either of the two component crimes--falsifying one's age to purchase alcohol and contributing to the delinquency of a child--is, if not an exempted offense, independently sufficient to warrant the bestowal of the challenged criminal history point.  Since contributing to the delinquency of a child is arguably the more weighty of the crimes, we focus exclusively on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant flunks the first segment of the test:  the victims may have been juveniles, but in ascertaining whether a crime is (or is not) a juvenile status offense, it is the perpetrator's age, not the victim's age, that matters--and Correa was 19 years old when he committed the act.  Accordingly, he was not a juvenile.  See USSG &#167; 4A1.2, comment.  (n.7) (defining a juvenile for this purpose as a person under the age of 18).  He also fails to satisfy the second requirement:  contributing to the delinquency of a child is conduct which state law criminalizes regardless of the perpetrator's age.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 119, &#167; 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the appellant's argument depends on his ability to establish three factors, and the first two are lacking, we need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  It is abundantly clear that the district court did not err either in declining to classify the crime of contributing to the delinquency of a child as a juvenile status offense or in assessing an extra criminal history point for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In Massachusetts, after a plea of guilty in a criminal case, \"a judge, with the consent of the defendant, may place the case on file rather than impose sentence immediately.\"  DuPont v.
