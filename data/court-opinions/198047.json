Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Edwin Colon on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Patrick M.\r\nHamilton, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 10, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Pro se appellant Edwin Colon appeals a\r\ndistrict court judgment which denied his motion for relief from\r\na final judgment compelling the forfeiture of his former\r\nresidence at 13 Maplewood Drive in North Grafton,\r\nMassachusetts.  Appellant maintains that the forfeiture was\r\nunfair because he did not receive notice of the forfeiture\r\nproceeding until the government served him with a copy of the\r\ncourt's final judgment on April 12, 1996.\r\n          This court has thoroughly reviewed the record and the\r\nparties' briefs on appeal.  We conclude that the district court\r\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying appellant relief.  See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Real Property, 135 F.3d 1312, 1315-16\r\n(9th Cir. 1998); United States v. Clark, 84 F.3d 378, 381 (10th\r\nCir. 1996).  We further reject appellant's contention that\r\nbecause the government failed to use his inmate registration\r\nnumber from the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in\r\naddressing its notices, and further erroneously included the\r\nmiddle initial \"A\" in its addresses, the notices were\r\nconstitutionally inadequate.  See, e.g., Bye v. United States,\r\n105 F.3d 865, 857 (2d Cir. 1997)(per curiam); United States v.\r\n51 Pieces of Real Property, 17 F.3d 1306, 1317 &amp; n.11 (10th\r\nCir. 1994).  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\r\naffirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1. \n",
