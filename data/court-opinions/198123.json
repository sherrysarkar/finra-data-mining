William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Samson Omosefunmi on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Rayford A.\r\nFarquhar, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 10, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we find no merit in appellant's contentions.  Dismissal\r\nof appellant's complaint was sufficiently justified by the\r\nreasons described in the government's motion to dismiss, which\r\nreasons included defendants' immunity from suit and appellant's\r\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. \r\nThe district court was not required to grant appellant's\r\napplication for default in these circumstances, and we find\r\nappellant's allegations of judicial bias to be frivolous.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.   \r\n\n                           -2-\n",
