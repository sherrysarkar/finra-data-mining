After    pleading    guilty   to\n\nconspiring to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute,\n\nappellant, Anthony Castro, was sentenced to 87 months, or more\n\nthan   seven   years,   in   prison.   Castro    concedes    that    he\n\nparticipated in several crack deals, but objects to his 87-month\n\nsentence on two grounds.      First, he argues that the district\n\ncourt incorrectly calculated the drug quantity on which his\n\nsentence was based because, in one of the deals involving 11.6\n\nof the 35.039 grams of crack attributed to him, he acted to\n\nassist the buyer, not the seller, and so he says he cannot\n\nlawfully be sentenced for the distribution of the 11.6 grams.\n\nSecond, Castro objects to the district court's consideration of\n\nhis probation sentence for a prior state crime when calculating\n\nhis criminal history.    Castro says that the alternative to this\n\nstate probation sentence was not incarceration and so, under the\n\nfederal guidelines, it is not \"probation\" of the type that can\n\naffect one's criminal history.\n\n          We reject the argument that one who acts as the buyer's\n\nagent in facilitating a drug deal may not have the drug quantity\n\nfrom that sale attributed to him as relevant conduct.           Under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and 21 U.S.C. § 846, Castro may be\n\n                                 -2-\n\fpunished not merely for selling drugs, but more generally for\n\nfacilitating their distribution and delivery.            We also reject\n\nthe second argument, based on Castro's state probation sentence,\n\nas     inconsistent    with    the   clear   language   of   U.S.S.G.    §\n\n4A1.2(c)(1)(A), which counts any prior sentence of probation of\n\nat least one year.      Finding Castro's arguments to be meritless,\n\nwe affirm his sentence.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            This case involves the unfortunate story of Anthony Castro\n\nwho,    along   with   his    grandmother,   his   father,   and   others,\n\nparticipated in distributing crack cocaine to undercover DEA agents in\n\nFitchburg, Massachusetts. Castro became addicted to the drugs he\n\ndistributed.     During a several month period in 1999, Castro was\n\ninvolved in at least twelve crack sales to undercover federal agents.\n\nCastro's role differed from sale to sale; in some cases he was the\n\nprimary seller, in other cases he merely provided assistance by\n\nintroducing the agents to other sellers or by acting as an\n\nintermediary.\n\n            One sale in particular is important to Castro's argument.\n\nOn October 20, 1999, Castro was involved in the distribution of what\n\nturned out to be 11.6 grams of crack. Castro says that, by October, he\n\nwas no longer dealing crack. Instead, he had turned to using the drug\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fand had become severely addicted. Castro admits that he participated\n\nin the October 20 distribution, but claims his participation was\n\nlimited to assisting the buyer (a federal agent, unbeknownst to Castro)\n\nfind the best priced crack in town. (Castro was attempting to make\n\na small profit by charging the buyer a fee in return for\n\nproviding him with connections to dealers offering the lowest\n\nprices.) In the process of doing so, Castro was present during a\n\ntransaction between the undercover agent and Robert Rodriguez, a seller\n\nwith whom Castro admits he was at one point allied.        During this\n\ntransaction, Castro translated price and quantity terms from Spanish to\n\nEnglish and from English to Spanish, thereby facilitating the\n\ndistribution of 11.6 grams of crack.\n\n          A   grand   jury    eventually    returned   a   number   of\n\nindictments, most of which charged multiple defendants with\n\nnumerous counts of drug distribution in Fitchburg. After Castro\n\nentered into a plea agreement, the government dismissed the\n\nindictments against him, and he pled guilty to a one-count\n\nsuperceding information charging him with conspiring to possess\n\ncrack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.\n\n          When Castro was sentenced for this crime, the district\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fcourt held him accountable for 35.039 grams of crack, which\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(5) yields a base offense level of 30.\n\nAfter a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, Castro had an offense level of 27. The district\n\ncourt awarded Castro two criminal history points for two prior\n\nconvictions. One of these two prior convictions was for disorderly\n\nconduct, an offense for which Castro was sentenced to one year of\n\nprobation. The district court awarded Castro an additional two points,\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), for committing the instant offense while on\n\nprobation.   Four criminal history points translate to a criminal\n\nhistory category of III and, with an offense level of 27, a\n\nsentencing range of 87 to 108 months.           Because Castro was\n\naccountable for 35.039 grams of crack, just over the 35-gram\n\ncut-off, the court sentenced him to 87 months, which was the\n\nlowest available sentence within the guidelines range.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                II.\n\n            Our review of legal questions concerning the district\n\ncourt's application of the guidelines is de novo. United States\n\nv. Caraballo, 200 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1999).       Our review of\n\nfactual findings is for clear error.     Id.\n\n                                 A.\n\n            First, Castro argues that the drug quantity on which\n\nhis sentence was based was incorrectly calculated because it\n\nincluded 11.6 grams from the October 20 transaction.        Castro\n\nclaims that during that transaction, he intended solely to help\n\nthe buyer, a federal agent, rather than the seller, Rodriguez.\n\nIt is undisputed that he sought to introduce the agent to\n\nsellers other than Rodriguez, which was against Rodriguez's\n\ninterest.    Castro concedes that he facilitated the 11.6 gram\n\ntransaction; his only argument is that he facilitated the\n\npurchase and not the sale. The district court found that Castro\n\nfacilitated the transaction and concluded that it did not matter\n\nwhether Castro was acting as an agent of the buyer or as an\n\nagent of the seller.    We agree.\n\n            We think the aggregation of the drug quantities for the\n\ntransactions involving facilitation by Castro fits comfortably\n\n                                 -6-\n\fas   relevant     conduct   within      the   scope    of     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(A).     Under subsection (a)(1)(A), the question is\n\nwhether the distribution was an act \"committed, aided, abetted,\n\n. . . or willfully caused by\" Castro \"that occurred during the\n\ncommission of the offense of conviction.\"        Castro was convicted\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 846 for conspiracy to violate 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1), which renders it \"unlawful for any person knowingly\n\nor intentionally . . . to . . . distribute, . . . or possess\n\nwith intent to . . . distribute, . . . a controlled substance.\"\n\nA defendant can be found to have aided or abetted distribution\n\nif   the   defendant   \"associated   himself    with    the    underlying\n\nventure, participated in it as something he wished to bring\n\nabout, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\"              United\n\nStates v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Clifford, 979 F.2d 896, 899 (1st Cir. 1992))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           There is no question that Castro aided or abetted the October\n\n20 distribution. Castro told the buyer that Rodriguez would get the\n\ncrack right away and asked the buyer, on Rodriguez's behalf, if the\n\nbuyer had the money to purchase the crack. He also interpreted the\n\nSpanish conversation between Rodriguez and another seller and advised\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe buyer that the crack would weigh sixteen or seventeen grams. On\n\nthese facts, the 11.6 gram possession with intent to distribute was\n\nproperly attributed to Castro under subsection (a)(1)(A).1\n\n          Castro responds that his participation in the distribution\n\nwas limited to aiding the buyer. Castro's \"buyer's agent\" defense has\n\nlong been rejected by this and other circuits as a defense to drug\n\ndistribution under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). United States v. Porter,\n\n764 F.2d 1, 10-12 (1st Cir. 1985) (collecting cases); accord United\n\nStates v. Pruitt, 487 F.2d 1241, 1243 (8th Cir. 1973) (collecting\n\ncases); see also Minor v. United States, 623 A.2d 1182, 1186 (D.C. App.\n\n1993) (noting \"uniform agreement among the federal courts\" that the\n\n\"agent of the buyer\" defense does not exist under § 841(a)(1)).\n\nSection 841(a)(1) contains a broad prohibition on distribution\n\nrather than a narrow one on sale, and so it does not matter that\n\n\n\n     1    The October 20 distribution was a \"reasonably\nforeseeable act[ ] . . . in furtherance of [a] jointly\nundertaken criminal activity.\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). Thus\nCastro is also liable for that transaction under subsection\n(a)(1)(B) because the October 20 transaction was obviously\nforeseeable by Castro (indeed, he actively participated in it)\nand in furtherance of an ongoing conspiracy to distribute crack.\n     Because, however, the transactions for which Castro was held\nliable involved substantive distributions which he personally\nfacilitated (rather than planned transactions or transactions by\nother conspirators while he was a member of the conspiracy) we\nthink treatment as an aider and abetter under subsection\n(a)(1)(A) is a better analytical fit.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fCastro sought to help the buyer rather than the seller when he\n\nfacilitated the distribution. The relevant statute makes this point\n\nexplicitly: it defines \"distribute\" as \"to deliver,\" 21 U.S.C. §\n\n802(11), and it defines \"deliver\" as \"the actual, constructive, or\n\nattempted transfer of a controlled substance . . . whether or not there\n\nexists an agency relationship,\" id. § 802(8) (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, it is enough that Castro participated in the transfer of\n\ncrack cocaine from Rodriguez to the undercover agent. Regardless of\n\nwhether Castro was acting to help the buyer or the seller, he\n\nfacilitated the transfer of the drug and that is sufficient to expose\n\nhim to liability for that transaction for sentencing purposes.2\n\n                                  B.\n\n          Second,    Castro   objects   to   the   district   court's\n\nconsideration of his probation sentence for a prior disorderly\n\n\n     2     In contrast, under former 26 U.S.C. § 4705(a) (repealed\n1970), the law prohibited sale of certain drugs, rather than\ndistribution, and so acting solely as an agent for the buyer was\nsometimes a valid defense to a charge of selling. United States v.\nMacDonald, 455 F.2d 1259, 1261 (1st Cir. 1972); United States v.\nBarcella, 432 F.2d 570, 571 (1st Cir. 1970). The Comprehensive Drug\nAbuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat.\n1236 (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. §§ 801-971 and in scattered\nsections of titles 18, 21, and 42), which repealed the subchapter of\nthe Code including 26 U.S.C. § 4705, prohibits distribution. 21 U.S.C.\n§ 841(a)(1). The prohibition on distribution is broader in scope than\nthe former prohibition on sale -- the claim that one acted on the\nbuyer's behalf is not relevant to the charge that one participated in\na distribution. Porter, 764 F.2d at 11; accord Pruitt, 487 F.2d at\n1245.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fconduct conviction when calculating his criminal history.3         He\n\nsays that violation of his probation sentence could not have\n\nresulted in jail time under state law and so, under the\n\nguidelines, it is not \"probation\" of the type that can affect\n\none's criminal history.      The district court concluded that,\n\nunder the clear text of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c), the offense was\n\nproperly scored.   We agree.\n\n          Massachusetts law provides that \"idle and disorderly\n\npersons, [and] disturbers of the peace . . . may be punished by\n\nimprisonment . . . for not more than six months, or by a fine of\n\nnot more than two hundred dollars, or by both.\"     Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 272, § 53 (2000).   Nonetheless, Castro says his one year probation\n\nsentence was not an alternative to jail time because when he first\n\nappeared in state court on his disorderly conduct charges, the judge\n\ndeclined to appoint counsel4 and informed him that his sentence would\n\n\n     3    Whether the court considers Castro's disorderly conduct\nconviction as a prior conviction for purposes of computing his\ncriminal history under the guidelines is important, he says,\nbecause if this prior conviction counts, then Castro's criminal\nhistory category is III, which yields a sentencing range of 87\nto 108 months, but if this conviction does not count, then\nCastro's criminal history category is II, which yields a\nsentencing range of 78 to 97 months.\n     4   It may be that counsel did in fact represent Castro\nbefore he actually received his probation sentence and so he\n\n                                -10-\n\fnot include any jail time. The judge applied Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211D,\n\n§ 2A (2000), which provides that\n\n          a criminal defendant charged with a misdemeanor or a\n          violation of a municipal ordinance or bylaw need not\n          be appointed counsel if the judge, at arraignment,\n          informs such defendant on the record that, if the\n          defendant is convicted of such offense, his sentence\n          will not include any period of incarceration.     For\n          good cause, that judge or another judge of the same\n          court may later revoke such determination on the\n          record and appoint counsel, and on the request such\n          counsel shall be entitled to a continuance to conduct\n          any necessary discovery and to prepare adequately for\n          trial.\n\n          Castro then says that probation, as defined by a single\n\ndictionary, is a sentencing alternative to jail and that, because jail\n\nwas not an option, he was not sentenced to \"probation\" as the term is\n\nsometimes defined. Castro also points to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1, application\n\nnote 4, which states that probation counts as a criminal justice\n\nsentence but a sentence to pay a fine does not. He says that it would\n\nbe absurd for his probation to count toward his criminal history when\n\nthe more severe sentence to which he might have been subject under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 53, was a two hundred dollar fine, which\n\nwould not be counted.\n\n          The clear text of the guidelines defeats Castro's argument.\n\nUnder U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, which provides instructions for computing\n\n\ncould have received jail time. For purposes of the issue here,\nwe need not resolve the matter.\n\n                                -11-\n\fcriminal history, sentences for disorderly conduct are counted toward\n\none's criminal history only if \"the sentence was a term of probation of\n\nat least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days\"\n\n(or if the instant offense is similar to the prior disorderly conduct\n\noffense). U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c). Castro's disorderly conduct conviction\n\nresulted in a sentence of \"probation of at least one year\" and so the\n\ndistrict court correctly counted it. We will not rewrite the text of\n\nthe guidelines where, as here, the Commission has expressed a clear\n\nintent to count sentences to probation of at least one year as\n\ncriminal history. See United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255,\n\n1265 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          In addition,    it is not absurd to count disorderly\n\nconduct convictions that result in probation sentences of at\n\nleast one year, but to refrain from counting similar convictions\n\nthat result only in a fine.    The \"at least one year\" requirement\n\nimposed by the guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(1)(A), reflects\n\na plausible determination that disorderly conduct convictions\n\nresulting in at least one year of probation are the type of\n\nconvictions that are sufficiently serious to be included in\n\none's criminal history, while such convictions, should they\n\nresult only in a fine, are not.         The supervisory element of a\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fone year probation sentence alone could be deemed more severe\n\npunishment than a fine and thus it would be sensible to count a\n\none year probation sentence and not a fine.\n\n          Finally, the factual premise of Castro's argument is flawed.\n\nCastro argues that because the court invoked Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211D,\n\n§ 2A, at his arraignment, he could not receive a prison sentence as an\n\nalternative to his probation. But Castro could have received a prison\n\nsentence; by engaging in disorderly conduct, he exposed himself to a\n\nfine or jail time. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 53. That the judge\n\nchose not to appoint counsel, thereby removing the prison\n\noption,5 id. ch. 211D, § 2A, does not detract from the fact that at\n\nthe time Castro was charged, probation, a fine, and jail time\n\nwere all potential sentences. The \"absurdity\" Castro attempts to\n\nconstruct does not materialize because the potential alternative to\n\nCastro's probation was not merely a fine, but also included the\n\npossibility of a jail sentence of not more than six months under\n\n     5    Even after the state court invoked § 2A, prison remained a\npossibility for Castro. Section 2A, in a part ignored by Castro,\nstates that\n\n     [a] judge . . . may later revoke such determination [of\n     ineligibility for prison] on the record and appoint counsel, and\n     on the request such counsel shall be entitled to a continuance to\n     conduct any necessary discovery and to prepare adequately for\n     trial.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 211D, § 2A (emphasis added).\n\n                                -13-\n\fMass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 53.\n\n                             III.\n\n         For these reasons, the sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -14-\n\f",

After    pleading    guilty   to\n\nconspiring to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute,\n\nappellant, Anthony Castro, was sentenced to 87 months, or more\n\nthan   seven   years,   in   prison.   Castro    concedes    that    he\n\nparticipated in several crack deals, but objects to his 87-month\n\nsentence on two grounds.      First, he argues that the district\n\ncourt incorrectly calculated the drug quantity on which his\n\nsentence was based because, in one of the deals involving 11.6\n\nof the 35.039 grams of crack attributed to him, he acted to\n\nassist the buyer, not the seller, and so he says he cannot\n\nlawfully be sentenced for the distribution of the 11.6 grams.\n\nSecond, Castro objects to the district court's consideration of\n\nhis probation sentence for a prior state crime when calculating\n\nhis criminal history.    Castro says that the alternative to this\n\nstate probation sentence was not incarceration and so, under the\n\nfederal guidelines, it is not \"probation\" of the type that can\n\naffect one's criminal history.\n\n          We reject the argument that one who acts as the buyer's\n\nagent in facilitating a drug deal may not have the drug quantity\n\nfrom that sale attributed to him as relevant conduct.           Under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) and 21 U.S.C. § 846, Castro may be\n\n                                 -2-\n\fpunished not merely for selling drugs, but more generally for\n\nfacilitating their distribution and delivery.            We also reject\n\nthe second argument, based on Castro's state probation sentence,\n\nas     inconsistent    with    the   clear   language   of   U.S.S.G.    §\n\n4A1.2(c)(1)(A), which counts any prior sentence of probation of\n\nat least one year.      Finding Castro's arguments to be meritless,\n\nwe affirm his sentence.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            This case involves the unfortunate story of Anthony Castro\n\nwho,    along   with   his    grandmother,   his   father,   and   others,\n\nparticipated in distributing crack cocaine to undercover DEA agents in\n\nFitchburg, Massachusetts. Castro became addicted to the drugs he\n\ndistributed.     During a several month period in 1999, Castro was\n\ninvolved in at least twelve crack sales to undercover federal agents.\n\nCastro's role differed from sale to sale; in some cases he was the\n\nprimary seller, in other cases he merely provided assistance by\n\nintroducing the agents to other sellers or by acting as an\n\nintermediary.\n\n            One sale in particular is important to Castro's argument.\n\nOn October 20, 1999, Castro was involved in the distribution of what\n\nturned out to be 11.6 grams of crack. Castro says that, by October, he\n\nwas no longer dealing crack. Instead, he had turned to using the drug\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fand had become severely addicted. Castro admits that he participated\n\nin the October 20 distribution, but claims his participation was\n\nlimited to assisting the buyer (a federal agent, unbeknownst to Castro)\n\nfind the best priced crack in town. (Castro was attempting to make\n\na small profit by charging the buyer a fee in return for\n\nproviding him with connections to dealers offering the lowest\n\nprices.) In the process of doing so, Castro was present during a\n\ntransaction between the undercover agent and Robert Rodriguez, a seller\n\nwith whom Castro admits he was at one point allied.        During this\n\ntransaction, Castro translated price and quantity terms from Spanish to\n\nEnglish and from English to Spanish, thereby facilitating the\n\ndistribution of 11.6 grams of crack.\n\n          A   grand   jury    eventually    returned   a   number   of\n\nindictments, most of which charged multiple defendants with\n\nnumerous counts of drug distribution in Fitchburg. After Castro\n\nentered into a plea agreement, the government dismissed the\n\nindictments against him, and he pled guilty to a one-count\n\nsuperceding information charging him with conspiring to possess\n\ncrack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.\n\n          When Castro was sentenced for this crime, the district\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fcourt held him accountable for 35.039 grams of crack, which\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(5) yields a base offense level of 30.\n\nAfter a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility,\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, Castro had an offense level of 27. The district\n\ncourt awarded Castro two criminal history points for two prior\n\nconvictions. One of these two prior convictions was for disorderly\n\nconduct, an offense for which Castro was sentenced to one year of\n\nprobation. The district court awarded Castro an additional two points,\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), for committing the instant offense while on\n\nprobation.   Four criminal history points translate to a criminal\n\nhistory category of III and, with an offense level of 27, a\n\nsentencing range of 87 to 108 months.           Because Castro was\n\naccountable for 35.039 grams of crack, just over the 35-gram\n\ncut-off, the court sentenced him to 87 months, which was the\n\nlowest available sentence within the guidelines range.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                II.\n\n            Our review of legal questions concerning the district\n\ncourt's application of the guidelines is de novo.

Our review of\n\nfactual findings is for clear error.     Id.\n\n                                 A.\n\n            First, Castro argues that the drug quantity on which\n\nhis sentence was based was incorrectly calculated because it\n\nincluded 11.6 grams from the October 20 transaction.        Castro\n\nclaims that during that transaction, he intended solely to help\n\nthe buyer, a federal agent, rather than the seller, Rodriguez.\n\nIt is undisputed that he sought to introduce the agent to\n\nsellers other than Rodriguez, which was against Rodriguez's\n\ninterest.    Castro concedes that he facilitated the 11.6 gram\n\ntransaction; his only argument is that he facilitated the\n\npurchase and not the sale. The district court found that Castro\n\nfacilitated the transaction and concluded that it did not matter\n\nwhether Castro was acting as an agent of the buyer or as an\n\nagent of the seller.    We agree.\n\n            We think the aggregation of the drug quantities for the\n\ntransactions involving facilitation by Castro fits comfortably\n\n                                 -6-\n\fas   relevant     conduct   within      the   scope    of     U.S.S.G.   §\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(A).     Under subsection (a)(1)(A), the question is\n\nwhether the distribution was an act \"committed, aided, abetted,\n\n. . . or willfully caused by\" Castro \"that occurred during the\n\ncommission of the offense of conviction.\"        Castro was convicted\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 846 for conspiracy to violate 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1), which renders it \"unlawful for any person knowingly\n\nor intentionally . . . to . . . distribute, . . . or possess\n\nwith intent to . . . distribute, . . . a controlled substance.\"\n\nA defendant can be found to have aided or abetted distribution\n\nif   the   defendant   \"associated   himself    with    the    underlying\n\nventure, participated in it as something he wished to bring\n\nabout, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\"              United\n\nStates v.

Thus\nCastro is also liable for that transaction under subsection\n(a)(1)(B) because the October 20 transaction was obviously\nforeseeable by Castro (indeed, he actively participated in it)\nand in furtherance of an ongoing conspiracy to distribute crack.\n     Because, however, the transactions for which Castro was held\nliable involved substantive distributions which he personally\nfacilitated (rather than planned transactions or transactions by\nother conspirators while he was a member of the conspiracy) we\nthink treatment as an aider and abetter under subsection\n(a)(1)(A) is a better analytical fit.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fCastro sought to help the buyer rather than the seller when he\n\nfacilitated the distribution. The relevant statute makes this point\n\nexplicitly: it defines \"distribute\" as \"to deliver,\" 21 U.S.C. §\n\n802(11), and it defines \"deliver\" as \"the actual, constructive, or\n\nattempted transfer of a controlled substance . . . whether or not there\n\nexists an agency relationship,\" id. § 802(8) (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, it is enough that Castro participated in the transfer of\n\ncrack cocaine from Rodriguez to the undercover agent. Regardless of\n\nwhether Castro was acting to help the buyer or the seller, he\n\nfacilitated the transfer of the drug and that is sufficient to expose\n\nhim to liability for that transaction for sentencing purposes.2\n\n                                  B.\n\n          Second,    Castro   objects   to   the   district   court's\n\nconsideration of his probation sentence for a prior disorderly\n\n\n     2     In contrast, under former 26 U.S.C. § 4705(a) (repealed\n1970), the law prohibited sale of certain drugs, rather than\ndistribution, and so acting solely as an agent for the buyer was\nsometimes a valid defense to a charge of selling.

The district court concluded that,\n\nunder the clear text of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c), the offense was\n\nproperly scored.   We agree.\n\n          Massachusetts law provides that \"idle and disorderly\n\npersons, [and] disturbers of the peace . . . may be punished by\n\nimprisonment . . . for not more than six months, or by a fine of\n\nnot more than two hundred dollars, or by both.\"     Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 272, § 53 (2000).   Nonetheless, Castro says his one year probation\n\nsentence was not an alternative to jail time because when he first\n\nappeared in state court on his disorderly conduct charges, the judge\n\ndeclined to appoint counsel4 and informed him that his sentence would\n\n\n     3    Whether the court considers Castro's disorderly conduct\nconviction as a prior conviction for purposes of computing his\ncriminal history under the guidelines is important, he says,\nbecause if this prior conviction counts, then Castro's criminal\nhistory category is III, which yields a sentencing range of 87\nto 108 months, but if this conviction does not count, then\nCastro's criminal history category is II, which yields a\nsentencing range of 78 to 97 months.\n     4   It may be that counsel did in fact represent Castro\nbefore he actually received his probation sentence and so he\n\n                                -10-\n\fnot include any jail time. The judge applied Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211D,\n\n§ 2A (2000), which provides that\n\n          a criminal defendant charged with a misdemeanor or a\n          violation of a municipal ordinance or bylaw need not\n          be appointed counsel if the judge, at arraignment,\n          informs such defendant on the record that, if the\n          defendant is convicted of such offense, his sentence\n          will not include any period of incarceration.     For\n          good cause, that judge or another judge of the same\n          court may later revoke such determination on the\n          record and appoint counsel, and on the request such\n          counsel shall be entitled to a continuance to conduct\n          any necessary discovery and to prepare adequately for\n          trial.\n\n          Castro then says that probation, as defined by a single\n\ndictionary, is a sentencing alternative to jail and that, because jail\n\nwas not an option, he was not sentenced to \"probation\" as the term is\n\nsometimes defined. Castro also points to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1, application\n\nnote 4, which states that probation counts as a criminal justice\n\nsentence but a sentence to pay a fine does not. He says that it would\n\nbe absurd for his probation to count toward his criminal history when\n\nthe more severe sentence to which he might have been subject under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 53, was a two hundred dollar fine, which\n\nwould not be counted.\n\n          The clear text of the guidelines defeats Castro's argument.\n\nUnder U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, which provides instructions for computing\n\n\ncould have received jail time. For purposes of the issue here,\nwe need not resolve the matter.\n\n                                -11-\n\fcriminal history, sentences for disorderly conduct are counted toward\n\none's criminal history only if \"the sentence was a term of probation of\n\nat least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days\"\n\n(or if the instant offense is similar to the prior disorderly conduct\n\noffense). U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c). Castro's disorderly conduct conviction\n\nresulted in a sentence of \"probation of at least one year\" and so the\n\ndistrict court correctly counted it. We will not rewrite the text of\n\nthe guidelines where, as here, the Commission has expressed a clear\n\nintent to count sentences to probation of at least one year as\n\ncriminal history. See United States v. Talladino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195724\"><a href=\"/opinion/195724/united-states-v-talladino/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1265 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          In addition,    it is not absurd to count disorderly\n\nconduct convictions that result in probation sentences of at\n\nleast one year, but to refrain from counting similar convictions\n\nthat result only in a fine.    The \"at least one year\" requirement\n\nimposed by the guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c)(1)(A), reflects\n\na plausible determination that disorderly conduct convictions\n\nresulting in at least one year of probation are the type of\n\nconvictions that are sufficiently serious to be included in\n\none's criminal history, while such convictions, should they\n\nresult only in a fine, are not.         The supervisory element of a\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fone year probation sentence alone could be deemed more severe\n\npunishment than a fine and thus it would be sensible to count a\n\none year probation sentence and not a fine.\n\n          Finally, the factual premise of Castro's argument is flawed.\n\nCastro argues that because the court invoked Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211D,\n\n§ 2A, at his arraignment, he could not receive a prison sentence as an\n\nalternative to his probation. But Castro could have received a prison\n\nsentence; by engaging in disorderly conduct, he exposed himself to a\n\nfine or jail time. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 53. That the judge\n\nchose not to appoint counsel, thereby removing the prison\n\noption,5 id. ch. 211D, § 2A, does not detract from the fact that at\n\nthe time Castro was charged, probation, a fine, and jail time\n\nwere all potential sentences. The \"absurdity\" Castro attempts to\n\nconstruct does not materialize because the potential alternative to\n\nCastro's probation was not merely a fine, but also included the\n\npossibility of a jail sentence of not more than six months under\n\n     5    Even after the state court invoked § 2A, prison remained a\npossibility for Castro. Section 2A, in a part ignored by Castro,\nstates that\n\n     [a] judge . . . may later revoke such determination [of\n     ineligibility for prison] on the record and appoint counsel, and\n     on the request such counsel shall be entitled to a continuance to\n     conduct any necessary discovery and to prepare adequately for\n     trial.\n\nMass.
