Burton Ferrara  and Sohiel Omar\r                                       \r\n\nappeal  from  their  convictions  for  bank   larceny,  money\r\n\nlaundering and conspiracy.   The single issue  is whether the\r\n\ndistrict court  erred  in  excluding,  over  the  defendants'\r\n\nobjection, grand  jury testimony  of a  witness who  had died\r\n\nprior to the  trial.  The issue  turns on the application  of\r\n\nthe hearsay exception  for \"former testimony.\"  Fed. R. Evid.\r\n\n804(b)(1).  \r\n\n     On  March  27,  1991,  a  Brinks  armored  truck  making\r\n\ndeliveries in Boston was robbed of about $900,000.  The truck\r\n\nwas found in nearby Somerville with the money missing and the\r\n\ndriver, Burton Ferrara, handcuffed  in the rear  compartment.\r\n\nFerrara told  police that he had been hijacked in Boston by a\r\n\ngunman who, while  Ferrara was parked on  the street awaiting\r\n\nthe return  of  messengers,  stuck  a gun  through  a  portal\r\n\n(actually a  gunport) in the driver's  compartment and forced\r\n\nFerrara to open the door.        \r\n\n     After  an  extensive   investigation,  the   authorities\r\n\nconcluded that the  robbery had been  carried out by  Ferrara\r\n\nand his friend Sohiel  Omar.  In February 1994,  almost three\r\n\nyears  after  the  robbery,  a federal  grand  jury  indicted\r\n\nFerrara  and Omar,  charging  them with  bank larceny,  money\r\n\nlaundering the  stolen funds, and conspiracy  to commit those\r\n\nsubstantive offenses.   18 U.S.C.      371, 1956(a)(1)(B)(i),\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n2113(b).  The defendants were tried by a jury  in October and\r\n\nNovember of 1994.\r\n\n     At trial,  the government's evidence  was extensive but,\r\n\nwith  one exception,  largely circumstantial.   Its witnesses\r\n\ntestified that  prior to the  robbery, Ferrara and  Omar were\r\n\nfriends and  former co-workers  at an  automobile dealership.\r\n\nIn 1990, they had sought to renovate a house in South  Boston\r\n\nbut had  fallen into financial difficulties,  and were unable\r\n\nto pay their contractors.   Ferrara then obtained a job as  a\r\n\nBrinks  driver and began work in March 1991 on a regular run;\r\n\nmessengers  accompanied  him to  deliver  the  cash from  the\r\n\ntruck.  The robbery occurred about three weeks later.\r\n\n     The government  also offered  evidence that  the portal,\r\n\nthrough which the assailant's  gun had allegedly been thrust,\r\n\nwas closed when  the messengers had  left the truck.   It was\r\n\nshown that  the  portal cover--easily  controllable from  the\r\n\ninside--could  be opened  from  the outside  only with  time,\r\n\ntools  and effort.   Two  witnesses said  that there  were no\r\n\nscratch-marks outside the portal.   The jury could  thus have\r\n\nregarded Ferrara's version of events as doubtful.\r\n\n     More  damaging  was   testimony  from  contractors  that\r\n\nbeginning soon  after the robbery, Ferrara and  Omar began to\r\n\npay them  with large  sums--the first payment  was $5,200--in\r\n\ncash and  new  bills,  some  with serial  numbers  almost  in\r\n\nsequential order.  Much of the money was shown to derive from\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nFederal  Reserve  shipments to  the  bank whose  cash  was in\r\n\nFerrara's  truck  on  the day  of  the  robbery.   After  the\r\n\nrobbery, Ferrara  also bought money orders  and made payments\r\n\nto others.  \r\n\n     One of the contractors testified  that he told Omar that\r\n\nhe  preferred to  be  paid  by  check;  Omar  paid  the  next\r\n\ninstallments  with  checks  drawn   on  the  account  of  Lee\r\n\nServices, a defunct trash hauling firm.  Lee Najarian was the\r\n\nbookkeeper for  Lee Services.   In 1991, Najarian  was living\r\n\nwith Raymond Femino, who  was the proprietor of  Lee Services\r\n\nand a friend  of Omar.  Najarian's evidence at  the trial was\r\n\nespecially  damning  and  led  directly to  the  ruling  that\r\n\nprovoked this appeal.\r\n\n     Testifying at trial under  a grant of immunity, Najarian\r\n\ntold the jury that she remembered Omar bringing a large green\r\n\ntrash  bag to her home on the  night of the robbery, and that\r\n\nFemino  later showed her that the bag was filled with stacked\r\n\nbundles  of cash.    She  testified  further  that  Omar  had\r\n\nregularly returned during the spring of 1991 to retrieve cash\r\n\nand that  she had put some  of the money in  the Lee Services\r\n\nbank  account and  written  checks to  Omar  and one  of  his\r\n\ncontractors.\r\n\n     Finally, Najarian  testified  that she  had  heard  Omar\r\n\nboasting that he had worn a ski mask and had stuck a gun into\r\n\nthe truck and had taken the money out of the truck and thrown\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nit in his car.  According to Najarian, Omar also said that he\r\n\nhad buried some of the  money.  Najarian also said  that Omar\r\n\nhad implicated \"Burt\"--a likely reference to Ferrara--in  the\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n     In cross-examining Najarian, the defense brought out the\r\n\nfact that she had given contrary testimony to a grand jury in\r\n\nAugust 1993; on that  occasion, Najarian had generally denied\r\n\nany  pertinent knowledge of  the Brinks  robbery and  had not\r\n\ndisclosed Omar's delivery of  cash or his admissions.   After\r\n\nentering  into   a  written  immunity   agreement  with   the\r\n\ngovernment,   Najarian testified  again to the  grand jury in\r\n\nJanuary  1994.  This time  she gave testimony  similar to her\r\n\nlater trial testimony.\r\n\n     As part of its own case, the defense sought to undermine\r\n\nNajarian's  testimony  further by  introducing  a  portion of\r\n\nFemino's  grand jury  testimony.   Femino  had testified  for\r\n\nabout 10 to  20 minutes at an  earlier grand jury session  in\r\n\nNovember  1991.    There,  while being  questioned  on  other\r\n\naspects of the case,  he briefly but flatly  denied receiving\r\n\nmoney  from Omar,  either in  a trash  bag or  otherwise, and\r\n\ndenied putting cash for Omar into bank accounts.   \r\n\n     Because  Femino died  in  1993, he  was unavailable  for\r\n\ntrial.   The  defense sought  to offer  his prior  grand jury\r\n\ntestimony  under Fed.  R.  Evid. 804(b)(1)  which--where  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ndeclarant is unavailable--permits  as evidence in a  criminal\r\n\ntrial prior\r\n\n     [t]estimony given  [by the declarant]  as a witness\r\n     at  another  hearing  of   the  same  or  different\r\n     proceeding .  . .  if  the party  against whom  the\r\n     testimony is now offered  . . . had an  opportunity\r\n     and  similar  motive  to develop  the  testimony by\r\n     direct, cross, or redirect examination.    \r\n\nThe district court excluded  Femino's grand jury testimony on\r\n\nthe  ground  that the  government  did  not have  a  \"similar\r\n\nmotive\" in November 1991 to develop Femino's testimony.\r\n\n     The jury  ultimately convicted  Ferrara and Omar  on all\r\n\ncounts.  The district court later sentenced each defendant to\r\n\n48  months in prison, three  years of supervised release, and\r\n\nrestitution in the amount of $908,750.  On this appeal, which\r\n\nhas  been  ably  briefed by  both  sides,  the  only question\r\n\npresented is whether  it was  error and,  if so,  prejudicial\r\n\nerror, to exclude Femino's grand jury testimony.\r\n\n     If the exclusion of Femino's testimony clearly could not\r\n\nhave made a difference, we would dispose of the  case on that\r\n\nground,  but  we  think  that  this  course  is  not  readily\r\n\navailable.  Whether a mistaken evidentiary ruling is harmless\r\n\ndepends, in  the ordinary  case, primarily on  the likelihood\r\n\nthat it did or did not affect  the jury.  This in turn hinges\r\n\nboth upon the  evidence at  issue and  on the  weight of  the\r                                                 \r\n\nother evidence in the case.  See Rossetti v. Curran, 80  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     It  is true,  in the  government's favor,  that Femino's\r\n\ngrand jury testimony was not especially credible.  That small\r\n\npiece  of  the  testimony  that  helped  the  defendants  and\r\n\ncontradicted  Najarian  was brief,  lacking  in corroborative\r\n\ndetail  and   highly  self-serving   (since  Femino  had   no\r\n\nimmunity).   Other testimony  at trial suggested  that Femino\r\n\nwas  drug  addicted, an  alcoholic,  and a  seller  of drugs,\r\n\nmaking  his boilerplate denials  in the grand  jury even less\r\n\nlikely to be credited.\r\n\n     On  the other  hand, the  government's case  was largely\r\n\ncircumstantial.   Najarian's testimony about the  bag of cash\r\n\nmay  not  have been  essential, but  it  was very  helpful in\r\n\nmaking  the  circumstantial  case fit  together  tightly,  by\r\n\ndescribing how  the money was  conveyed to Femino.   Najarian\r\n\nalso  testified to  Omar's alleged  incriminating admissions.\r\n\nThe government says  that the defendants were able to impeach\r\n\nNajarian  with her own  original grand jury  testimony; but a\r\n\nlittle thought suggests that this argument cuts both ways.\r\n\n     A fairly strong case  against both defendants would have\r\n\nbeen   much  weaker   if   Najarian's   testimony  had   been\r\n\ndisbelieved.    Of  course, Najarian's  testimony  had  other\r\n\nsupport  while Femino's  grand  jury denials  were brief  and\r\n\nself-serving.   But, together with Najarian's  own grand jury\r\n\nperjury (one of her two versions was false), Femino's denials\r\n\ncould have helped to raise a reasonable doubt for the jury as\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nto both defendants.  In sum, the exclusion of  the grand jury\r\n\ntestimony was not clearly harmless; whether it was error is a\r\n\ndifferent matter.\r\n\n     In addressing the merits, we begin with a general  issue\r\n\nof law--how  to construe Rule 804(b)(1)--which  is subject to\r\n\nde  novo review.  But  in considering the  application of the\r                    \r\n\nrule  to particular  facts,  the district  court's ruling  is\r\n\nnormally tested  by an \"abuse of  discretion\" standard, which\r\n\nfavors the  prevailing party.   United States v.  Lombard, 72\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  170, 187 (1st Cir. 1995), appeal after remand, 102 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1  (1st  Cir. 1996).   And,  the  evidence in  question being\r\n\nhearsay, it was the defendants'  burden to prove each element\r\n\nof  the  exception  they  invoked.    Cf.  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180  (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n114 S. Ct. 2714 (1994).\r\n\n     Turning to  Rule 804(b)(1),  we think that  this hearsay\r\n\nexception  for prior  testimony  does extend,  where all  its\r\n\nconditions are  met, to  grand jury  testimony  taken at  the\r\n\ngovernment's  behest  and  later  offered  against  it  in  a\r\n\ncriminal trial.  A grand jury proceeding can be regarded as a\r\n\n\"hearing,\" especially in  the context of a  rule that applies\r\n\nas well  to depositions.   And--assuming  \"an opportunity and\r\n\nsimilar  motive to develop  the testimony\"--the rationale for\r\n\nan  exception to the hearsay  rule is made  out, namely, that\r\n\nthe  party against whom the  testimony is now offered earlier\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nhad  the  opportunity and  similar  motive  to discredit  the\r\n\ntestimony, and  so did then whatever  it would do  now if the\r\n\ndeclarant were on the stand.\r\n\n     It  is unclear  whether  Rule 804(b)(1)  is intended  to\r\n\napply where the present opponent of the evidence had no prior\r\n\nmotive to discredit the testimony but instead sponsored it in\r\n\nthe earlier proceeding as worthy of belief.  In such a  case,\r\n\nthe  rationale  for  a   hearsay  exception  would  be  quite\r\n\ndifferent, namely, a kind  of quasi-estoppel.1  Arguably, the\r\n\nmotive  to develop would not be \"similar\" in the second case,\r\n\nso the rule would not apply.   As we will see, even a broader\r\n\nview of the rule would not alter the result here.\r\n\n     In all events, in United States v. Donlon, 909 F.2d 650,\r                                                          \r\n\n654 (1st Cir. 1990), this court said that the prior-testimony\r\n\nexception  did not  apply  at all  to  grand jury  testimony.\r\n\nWhether  or not  this was  dictum, Donlon's  statement cannot\r                                                     \r\n\nstand  against the  Supreme  Court's own  decision two  years\r\n\nlater  in United  States  v. Salerno,  505  U.S. 317  (1992).\r                                                \r\n\nThere, the Supreme  Court all  but held  that Rule  804(b)(1)\r\n\ncould  embrace grand jury testimony; and on remand the Second\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The  advisory committee  note on Rule  804(b)(1) leaves\r\nthe matter in confusion.  It describes the estoppel rationale\r\nas archaic but  then, instead of flatly  rejecting it, shifts\r\nthe  discussion to  the proposition  that in  the case  of an\r\nadverse witness, the direct and redirect examination of one's\r\nown witness can be the equivalent of the cross-examination of\r\nan opponent's witness.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nCircuit  took the same view of  the matter.  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nDinapoli, 8 F.3d 909, 914 (2d Cir. 1993) (en banc).\r                                                             \r\n\n     There has been confusion on  this issue in the circuits.\r\n\nNo one knows whether the drafters of the rule had  grand jury\r\n\nproceedings  in mind.   In  fact,  it is  likely  to be  very\r\n\ndifficult  for defendants  offering grand  jury testimony  to\r\n\nsatisfy the  \"opportunity and  similar motive\" test;  and the\r\n\nreasons  why this is  so probably underlie  the doubts courts\r\n\nhave  expressed as to whether  the rule should  ever apply to\r\n\ngrand  jury testimony.  E.g., United States v. Dent, 984 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1453, 1462  (7th Cir.),  cert. denied, 510  U.S. 858  (1993).\r                                                 \r\n\nBut the government concedes that  it could in principle apply\r\n\nand  (yielding to Salerno) we  agree, if and  when the quoted\r                                     \r\n\ncondition is met.  \r\n\n      This concession  by the United  States is not  meant to\r\n\nstretch very far.   The government's bedrock position is that\r\n\nthe  prosecution   ordinarily  does  not  in   a  grand  jury\r                                                    \r\n\nproceeding have  the kind of motive to develop testimony that\r\n\nit would in an ordinary trial or that is required to meet the\r\n\nexpress  test and rationale of Rule 804(b)(1).  And, it says,\r\n\nin  this case the prosecutor  at the grand  jury stage lacked\r\n\nthe requisite \"similar motive\" as to Femino's testimony.   We\r\n\nagree  provisionally   with   the  former   proposition   and\r\n\ncompletely with the latter.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     In an ordinary trial, the positions  of the parties vis-\r\n\na- vis  a witness are likely to be clear-cut:  the witness is\r\n\nnormally presented by one side to advance its case and cross-\r\n\nexamined  by the other to discredit the testimony.  Each side\r\n\nusually has reason to treat the  trial as a last chance  with\r\n\nthe witness.  If a new trial  later becomes necessary and the\r\n\nwitness  proves unavailable, it may be a fair guess that each\r\n\nside  has already  done at  the original  trial all  that the\r\n\nparty  would do if  the declarant were now  present for a new\r\n\ntrial.  \r\n\n     Grand  juries  present a  different  face.   Often,  the\r\n\ngovernment neither aims to discredit the witness nor to vouch\r\n\nfor him.  The prosecutor may want to secure a  small piece of\r\n\nevidence  as part of an ongoing investigation or to compel an\r\n\nanswer by an unwilling witness or to \"freeze\" the position of\r\n\nan adverse witness.  In particular, discrediting a grand jury\r\n\nwitness  is rarely  essential, because  the government  has a\r\n\nmodest burden  of proof, selects  its own witnesses,  and can\r\n\nusually call more of them at its leisure.\r\n\n     In the case at hand,  we think that it is fair  to apply\r\n\nthe  \"opportunity and  similar motive\"  test to  the specific\r\n\nportion of the testimony at issue; there might be a motive to\r\n\ndevelop some testimony of a witness but not other parts.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nWilliamson v. United States, 114 S. Ct. 2431, 2434-36 (1994).\r                                       \r\n\nHere, our focus is upon Femino's exculpatory denial.  And our\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nmain  concern  is  whether,  in  the  prior  proceeding,  the\r\n\ngovernment  (the  party against  whom  the  testimony is  now\r\n\noffered) had \"an opportunity and similar motive\" to undermine\r\n\nit.\r\n\n     There  is  no indication  that  the  government had  any\r\n\nevidence available  in November  1991 with which  to confront\r\n\nand contradict Femino  when he denied receiving the cash from\r\n\nthe defendants.  Najarian was still denying  any knowledge of\r\n\nthe  matter in August 1993  in her own  grand jury testimony.\r\n\nNot until November 1994,  in an interview with an  FBI agent,\r\n\ndid  Najarian change her story and begin to cooperate.  Thus,\r\n\nit  is  arguable  that   the  government  had  no  meaningful\r\n\nopportunity to discredit Femino at the time.2\r\n\n     In any case,  it certainly lacked any  evident motive to\r\n\ndo so.  If  the government had had Najarian's  cooperation in\r\n\n1991, it could  well have  preferred to keep  it secret  from\r\n\nFemino.   The prosecutor might  have wished to  protect a key\r\n\nwitness for the time  being or to bargain later  with Femino,\r\n\narmed with a  perjury charge  against him.   Given the  other\r\n\nevidence against the defendants, the government surely had no\r\n\nreason  to fear that Femino's  terse denials, if  he were not\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Just how  equivalent the  \"opportunity\" need be  is not\r\nmade clear by the rule or advisory committee note.  There are\r\nobviously issues of  degree and may be  other variables (like\r\nfault) that bear upon the answer, which is probably best left\r\nto case-by-case development.   Compare United States v. Koon,\r                                                                        \r\n34 F.2d 1416, 1427  (9th Cir. 1994), rev'd on  other grounds,\r                                                                        \r\n116 S. Ct. 2035 (1996).  \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\ndirectly confronted, would lead  the grand jury to  refuse to\r\n\nindict.\r\n\n     The outcome is the same even if we assume dubitante that\r                                                                    \r\n\na party who previously sponsored a witness could be deemed to\r\n\nhave a  \"similar motive\"  when later opposing  the testimony.\r\n\nThe government has never had any reason to \"develop\" Femino's\r\n\nexculpatory denial as worthy  of belief.  In the  grand jury,\r\n\nthe government  called Femino to elicit  testimony on several\r\n\nother points; the prosecutor  seems to have asked about  cash\r\n\nfrom  the defendants simply to  lock the witness  into a firm\r\n\nposition  or to  make  clear  to  the  grand  jury  that  all\r\n\nreasonable questions had been asked.\r\n\n     An  argument  can certainly  be  made  that the  fairest\r\n\noutcome  here   would  be   to  admit   Femino's  exculpatory\r\n\nstatement.   His grand jury  testimony was  important to  the\r\n\ndefendants on this  issue; it was  pure happenstance that  he\r\n\ndied and was not  available at trial (although he  might have\r\n\nrefused  to testify).    And while  his  testimony was  self-\r\n\nserving and suspect, the government's ability to undermine it\r\n\nat  trial, through  Najarian,  was  substantial even  without\r\n\nhaving Femino to cross-examine.\r\n\n     Conflicts between rule and equity are common.  If  every\r\n\nruling is ad hoc, it is hard to implement  policy and predict\r                            \r\n\noutcomes.  And rules themselves are debatable:  one respected\r\n\nevidence code proposed that \"hearsay . . . is admissible if .\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n. . the declarant . . . is unavailable.\"   ALI, Model Code of\r                                                                         \r\n\nEvidence Rule 503  (1942).   But our own  federal rules  stop\r                    \r\n\nwith  a broad  catch-all exception  for hearsay  supported by\r\n\n\"circumstantial  guarantees of  trustworthiness.\"    Fed.  R.\r\n\nEvid. 803(24), 804(b)(5).  \r\n\n     In  this  case,  the  defendants  did  not  invoke  this\r\n\nexception, probably  believing that they could  not show that\r\n\nFemino's self-serving denials were trustworthy.  Thus viewed,\r\n\nthe defendants were deprived of helpful but not very credible\r\n\nevidence  which--for this  very  reason--might well  not have\r\n\nbeen given great weight  by the jury, quite apart  from other\r\n\nevidence  tending to  corroborate Najarian's  story.   In all\r\n\nevents,  the exclusion  of the  evidence was  consistent with\r\n\nRule 804(b)(1).\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n",

The single issue is whether the district court erred in excluding, over the defendants' objection, grand jury testimony of a witness who had died prior to the trial.  The issue turns on the application of the hearsay exception for \"former testimony.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 1991, a Brinks armored truck making deliveries in Boston was robbed of about $900,000.  The truck was found in nearby Somerville with the money missing and the driver, Burton Ferrara, handcuffed in the rear compartment.  Ferrara told police that he had been hijacked in Boston by a gunman who, while Ferrara was parked on the street awaiting the return of messengers, stuck a gun through a portal (actually a gunport) in the driver's compartment and forced Ferrara to open the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an extensive investigation, the authorities concluded that the robbery had been carried out by Ferrara and his friend Sohiel Omar.  In February 1994, almost three years after the robbery, a federal grand jury indicted Ferrara and Omar, charging them with bank larceny, money laundering the stolen funds, and conspiracy to commit those substantive offenses.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), 2113(b).  The defendants were tried by a jury in October and November of 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government's evidence was extensive but, with one exception, largely circumstantial.  Its witnesses testified that prior to the robbery, Ferrara and Omar were friends and former co-workers at an automobile dealership.  In 1990, they had sought to renovate a house in South Boston but had fallen into financial difficulties, and were unable to pay their contractors.  Ferrara then obtained a job as a Brinks driver and began work in March 1991 on a regular run;  messengers accompanied him to deliver the cash from the truck.  The robbery occurred about three weeks later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also offered evidence that the portal, through which the assailant's gun had allegedly been thrust, was closed when the messengers had left the truck.  It was shown that the portal cover--easily controllable from the inside--could be opened from the outside only with time, tools and effort.  Two witnesses said that there were no scratchmarks outside the portal.  The jury could thus have regarded Ferrara's version of events as doubtful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More damaging was testimony from contractors that beginning soon after the robbery, Ferrara and Omar began to pay them with large sums--the first payment was $5,200--in cash and new bills, some with serial numbers almost in sequential order.  Much of the money was shown to derive from Federal Reserve shipments to the bank whose cash was in Ferrara's truck on the day of the robbery.  After the robbery, Ferrara also bought money orders and made payments to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the contractors testified that he told Omar that he preferred to be paid by check;  Omar paid the next installments with checks drawn on the account of Lee Services, a defunct trash hauling firm.  Lee Najarian was the bookkeeper for Lee Services.  In 1991, Najarian was living with Raymond Femino, who was the proprietor of Lee Services and a friend of Omar.  Najarian's evidence at the trial was especially damning and led directly to the ruling that provoked this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testifying at trial under a grant of immunity, Najarian told the jury that she remembered Omar bringing a large green trash bag to her home on the night of the robbery, and that Femino later showed her that the bag was filled with stacked bundles of cash.  She testified further that Omar had regularly returned during the spring of 1991 to retrieve cash and that she had put some of the money in the Lee Services bank account and written checks to Omar and one of his contractors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Najarian testified that she had heard Omar boasting that he had worn a ski mask and had stuck a gun into the truck and had taken the money out of the truck and thrown it in his car.  According to Najarian, Omar also said that he had buried some of the money.  Najarian also said that Omar had implicated \"Burt\"--a likely reference to Ferrara--in the robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cross-examining Najarian, the defense brought out the fact that she had given contrary testimony to a grand jury in August 1993;  on that occasion, Najarian had generally denied any pertinent knowledge of the Brinks robbery and had not disclosed Omar's delivery of cash or his admissions.  After entering into a written immunity agreement with the government, Najarian testified again to the grand jury in January 1994.  This time she gave testimony similar to her later trial testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its own case, the defense sought to undermine Najarian's testimony further by introducing a portion of Femino's grand jury testimony.  Femino had testified for about 10 to 20 minutes at an earlier grand jury session in November 1991.  There, while being questioned on other aspects of the case, he briefly but flatly denied receiving money from Omar, either in a trash bag or otherwise, and denied putting cash for Omar into bank accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Femino died in 1993, he was unavailable for trial.  The defense sought to offer his prior grand jury testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) which--where the declarant is unavailable--permits as evidence in a criminal trial prior</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[t]estimony given [by the declarant] as a witness at another hearing of the same or different proceeding ... if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court excluded Femino's grand jury testimony on the ground that the government did not have a \"similar motive\" in November 1991 to develop Femino's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury ultimately convicted Ferrara and Omar on all counts.  The district court later sentenced each defendant to 48 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $908,750.  On this appeal, which has been ably briefed by both sides, the only question presented is whether it was error and, if so, prejudicial error, to exclude Femino's grand jury testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the exclusion of Femino's testimony clearly could not have made a difference, we would dispose of the case on that ground, but we think that this course is not readily available.  Whether a mistaken evidentiary ruling is harmless depends, in the ordinary case, primarily on the likelihood that it did or did not affect the jury.  This in turn hinges both upon the evidence at issue and on the weight of the other evidence in the case.  See Rossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, in the government's favor, that Femino's grand jury testimony was not especially credible.  That small piece of the testimony that helped the defendants and contradicted Najarian was brief, lacking in corroborative detail and highly self-serving (since Femino had no immunity).  Other testimony at trial suggested that Femino was drug addicted, an alcoholic, and a seller of drugs, making his boilerplate denials in the grand jury even less likely to be credited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the government's case was largely circumstantial.  Najarian's testimony about the bag of cash may not have been essential, but it was very helpful in making the circumstantial case fit together tightly, by describing how the money was conveyed to Femino.  Najarian also testified to Omar's alleged incriminating admissions.  The government says that the defendants were able to impeach Najarian with her own original grand jury testimony;  but a little thought suggests that this argument cuts both ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fairly strong case against both defendants would have been much weaker if Najarian's testimony had been disbelieved.  Of course, Najarian's testimony had other support while Femino's grand jury denials were brief and self-serving.  But, together with Najarian's own grand jury perjury (one of her two versions was false), Femino's denials could have helped to raise a reasonable doubt for the jury as to both defendants.  In sum, the exclusion of the grand jury testimony was not clearly harmless;  whether it was error is a different matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the merits, we begin with a general issue of law--how to construe Rule 804(b)(1)--which is subject to de novo review.  But in considering the application of the rule to particular facts, the district court's ruling is normally tested by an \"abuse of discretion\" standard, which favors the prevailing party.  United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170, 187 (1st Cir.1995), appeal after remand, 102 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1996).  And, the evidence in question being hearsay, it was the defendants' burden to prove each element of the exception they invoked.  Cf. United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1223, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to Rule 804(b)(1), we think that this hearsay exception for prior testimony does extend, where all its conditions are met, to grand jury testimony taken at the government's behest and later offered against it in a criminal trial.  A grand jury proceeding can be regarded as a \"hearing,\" especially in the context of a rule that applies as well to depositions.  And--assuming \"an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony\"--the rationale for an exception to the hearsay rule is made out, namely, that the party against whom the testimony is now offered earlier had the opportunity and similar motive to discredit the testimony, and so did then whatever it would do now if the declarant were on the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether Rule 804(b)(1) is intended to apply where the present opponent of the evidence had no prior motive to discredit the testimony but instead sponsored it in the earlier proceeding as worthy of belief.  In such a case, the rationale for a hearsay exception would be quite different, namely, a kind of quasi-estoppel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Arguably, the motive to develop would not be \"similar\" in the second case, so the rule would not apply.  As we will see, even a broader view of the rule would not alter the result here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, in United States v. Donlon, 909 F.2d 650, 654 (1st Cir.1990), this court said that the prior-testimony exception did not apply at all to grand jury testimony.  Whether or not this was dictum, Donlon 's statement cannot stand against the Supreme Court's own decision two years later in United States v. Salerno, 505 U.S. 317, 112 S.Ct. 2503, 120 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992).  There, the Supreme Court all but held that Rule 804(b)(1) could embrace grand jury testimony;  and on remand the Second Circuit took the same view of the matter.  United States v. DiNapoli, 8 F.3d 909, 914 (2d Cir.1993) (en banc ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has been confusion on this issue in the circuits.  No one knows whether the drafters of the rule had grand jury proceedings in mind.  In fact, it is likely to be very difficult for defendants offering grand jury testimony to satisfy the \"opportunity and similar motive\" test;  and the reasons why this is so probably underlie the doubts courts have expressed as to whether the rule should ever apply to grand jury testimony.  E.g., United States v. Dent, 984 F.2d 1453, 1462 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 858, 114 S.Ct. 169, 126 L.Ed.2d 129 (1993).  But the government concedes that it could in principle apply and (yielding to Salerno ) we agree, if and when the quoted condition is met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This concession by the United States is not meant to stretch very far.  The government's bedrock position is that the prosecution ordinarily does not in a grand jury proceeding have the kind of motive to develop testimony that it would in an ordinary trial or that is required to meet the express test and rationale of Rule 804(b)(1).  And, it says, in this case the prosecutor at the grand jury stage lacked the requisite \"similar motive\" as to Femino's testimony.  We agree provisionally with the former proposition and completely with the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an ordinary trial, the positions of the parties vis-a-vis a witness are likely to be clear-cut:  the witness is normally presented by one side to advance its case and cross-examined by the other to discredit the testimony.  Each side usually has reason to treat the trial as a last chance with the witness.  If a new trial later becomes necessary and the witness proves unavailable, it may be a fair guess that each side has already done at the original trial all that the party would do if the declarant were now present for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grand juries present a different face.  Often, the government neither aims to discredit the witness nor to vouch for him.  The prosecutor may want to secure a small piece of evidence as part of an ongoing investigation or to compel an answer by an unwilling witness or to \"freeze\" the position of an adverse witness.  In particular, discrediting a grand jury witness is rarely essential, because the government has a modest burden of proof, selects its own witnesses, and can usually call more of them at its leisure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, we think that it is fair to apply the \"opportunity and similar motive\" test to the specific portion of the testimony at issue;  there might be a motive to develop some testimony of a witness but not other parts.  Cf. Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 597-602, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 2434-36, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994).  Here, our focus is upon Femino's exculpatory denial.  And our main concern is whether, in the prior proceeding, the government (the party against whom the testimony is now offered) had \"an opportunity and similar motive\" to undermine it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no indication that the government had any evidence available in November 1991 with which to confront and contradict Femino when he denied receiving the cash from the defendants.  Najarian was still denying any knowledge of the matter in August 1993 in her own grand jury testimony.  Not until November 1994, in an interview with an FBI agent, did Najarian change her story and begin to cooperate.  Thus, it is arguable that the government had no meaningful opportunity to discredit Femino at the time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, it certainly lacked any evident motive to do so.  If the government had had Najarian's cooperation in 1991, it could well have preferred to keep it secret from Femino.  The prosecutor might have wished to protect a key witness for the time being or to bargain later with Femino, armed with a perjury charge against him.  Given the other evidence against the defendants, the government surely had no reason to fear that Femino's terse denials, if he were not directly confronted, would lead the grand jury to refuse to indict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome is the same even if we assume dubitante that a party who previously sponsored a witness could be deemed to have a \"similar motive\" when later opposing the testimony.  The government has never had any reason to \"develop\" Femino's exculpatory denial as worthy of belief.  In the grand jury, the government called Femino to elicit testimony on several other points;  the prosecutor seems to have asked about cash from the defendants simply to lock the witness into a firm position or to make clear to the grand jury that all reasonable questions had been asked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An argument can certainly be made that the fairest outcome here would be to admit Femino's exculpatory statement.  His grand jury testimony was important to the defendants on this issue;  it was pure happenstance that he died and was not available at trial (although he might have refused to testify).  And while his testimony was self-serving and suspect, the government's ability to undermine it at trial, through Najarian, was substantial even without having Femino to cross-examine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conflicts between rule and equity are common.  If every ruling is ad hoc, it is hard to implement policy and predict outcomes.  And rules themselves are debatable:  one respected evidence code proposed that \"hearsay ... is admissible if ... the declarant ... is unavailable.\"   ALI, Model Code of Evidence Rule 503 (1942).  But our own federal rules stop with a broad catch-all exception for hearsay supported by \"circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 803(24), 804(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the defendants did not invoke this exception, probably believing that they could not show that Femino's self-serving denials were trustworthy.  Thus viewed, the defendants were deprived of helpful but not very credible evidence which--for this very reason--might well not have been given great weight by the jury, quite apart from other evidence tending to corroborate Najarian's story.  In all events, the exclusion of the evidence was consistent with Rule 804(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The advisory committee note on Rule 804(b)(1) leaves the matter in confusion.  It describes the estoppel rationale as archaic but then, instead of flatly rejecting it, shifts the discussion to the proposition that in the case of an adverse witness, the direct and redirect examination of one's own witness can be the equivalent of the cross-examination of an opponent's witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Just how equivalent the \"opportunity\" need be is not made clear by the rule or advisory committee note.  There are obviously issues of degree and may be other variables (like fault) that bear upon the answer, which is probably best left to case-by-case development.  Compare United States v.

The single issue is whether the district court erred in excluding, over the defendants' objection, grand jury testimony of a witness who had died prior to the trial.  The issue turns on the application of the hearsay exception for \"former testimony.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 1991, a Brinks armored truck making deliveries in Boston was robbed of about $900,000.  The truck was found in nearby Somerville with the money missing and the driver, Burton Ferrara, handcuffed in the rear compartment.  Ferrara told police that he had been hijacked in Boston by a gunman who, while Ferrara was parked on the street awaiting the return of messengers, stuck a gun through a portal (actually a gunport) in the driver's compartment and forced Ferrara to open the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an extensive investigation, the authorities concluded that the robbery had been carried out by Ferrara and his friend Sohiel Omar.  In February 1994, almost three years after the robbery, a federal grand jury indicted Ferrara and Omar, charging them with bank larceny, money laundering the stolen funds, and conspiracy to commit those substantive offenses.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), 2113(b).  The defendants were tried by a jury in October and November of 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government's evidence was extensive but, with one exception, largely circumstantial.  Its witnesses testified that prior to the robbery, Ferrara and Omar were friends and former co-workers at an automobile dealership.  In 1990, they had sought to renovate a house in South Boston but had fallen into financial difficulties, and were unable to pay their contractors.  Ferrara then obtained a job as a Brinks driver and began work in March 1991 on a regular run;  messengers accompanied him to deliver the cash from the truck.  The robbery occurred about three weeks later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also offered evidence that the portal, through which the assailant's gun had allegedly been thrust, was closed when the messengers had left the truck.  It was shown that the portal cover--easily controllable from the inside--could be opened from the outside only with time, tools and effort.  Two witnesses said that there were no scratchmarks outside the portal.  The jury could thus have regarded Ferrara's version of events as doubtful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More damaging was testimony from contractors that beginning soon after the robbery, Ferrara and Omar began to pay them with large sums--the first payment was $5,200--in cash and new bills, some with serial numbers almost in sequential order.  Much of the money was shown to derive from Federal Reserve shipments to the bank whose cash was in Ferrara's truck on the day of the robbery.  After the robbery, Ferrara also bought money orders and made payments to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the contractors testified that he told Omar that he preferred to be paid by check;  Omar paid the next installments with checks drawn on the account of Lee Services, a defunct trash hauling firm.  Lee Najarian was the bookkeeper for Lee Services.  In 1991, Najarian was living with Raymond Femino, who was the proprietor of Lee Services and a friend of Omar.  Najarian's evidence at the trial was especially damning and led directly to the ruling that provoked this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testifying at trial under a grant of immunity, Najarian told the jury that she remembered Omar bringing a large green trash bag to her home on the night of the robbery, and that Femino later showed her that the bag was filled with stacked bundles of cash.  She testified further that Omar had regularly returned during the spring of 1991 to retrieve cash and that she had put some of the money in the Lee Services bank account and written checks to Omar and one of his contractors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Najarian testified that she had heard Omar boasting that he had worn a ski mask and had stuck a gun into the truck and had taken the money out of the truck and thrown it in his car.  According to Najarian, Omar also said that he had buried some of the money.  Najarian also said that Omar had implicated \"Burt\"--a likely reference to Ferrara--in the robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cross-examining Najarian, the defense brought out the fact that she had given contrary testimony to a grand jury in August 1993;  on that occasion, Najarian had generally denied any pertinent knowledge of the Brinks robbery and had not disclosed Omar's delivery of cash or his admissions.  After entering into a written immunity agreement with the government, Najarian testified again to the grand jury in January 1994.  This time she gave testimony similar to her later trial testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its own case, the defense sought to undermine Najarian's testimony further by introducing a portion of Femino's grand jury testimony.  Femino had testified for about 10 to 20 minutes at an earlier grand jury session in November 1991.  There, while being questioned on other aspects of the case, he briefly but flatly denied receiving money from Omar, either in a trash bag or otherwise, and denied putting cash for Omar into bank accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Femino died in 1993, he was unavailable for trial.  The defense sought to offer his prior grand jury testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) which--where the declarant is unavailable--permits as evidence in a criminal trial prior</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[t]estimony given [by the declarant] as a witness at another hearing of the same or different proceeding ... if the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court excluded Femino's grand jury testimony on the ground that the government did not have a \"similar motive\" in November 1991 to develop Femino's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury ultimately convicted Ferrara and Omar on all counts.  The district court later sentenced each defendant to 48 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $908,750.  On this appeal, which has been ably briefed by both sides, the only question presented is whether it was error and, if so, prejudicial error, to exclude Femino's grand jury testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the exclusion of Femino's testimony clearly could not have made a difference, we would dispose of the case on that ground, but we think that this course is not readily available.  Whether a mistaken evidentiary ruling is harmless depends, in the ordinary case, primarily on the likelihood that it did or did not affect the jury.  This in turn hinges both upon the evidence at issue and on the weight of the other evidence in the case.  See Rossetti v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196645\"><a href=\"/opinion/196645/rossetti-v-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, in the government's favor, that Femino's grand jury testimony was not especially credible.  That small piece of the testimony that helped the defendants and contradicted Najarian was brief, lacking in corroborative detail and highly self-serving (since Femino had no immunity).  Other testimony at trial suggested that Femino was drug addicted, an alcoholic, and a seller of drugs, making his boilerplate denials in the grand jury even less likely to be credited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the government's case was largely circumstantial.  Najarian's testimony about the bag of cash may not have been essential, but it was very helpful in making the circumstantial case fit together tightly, by describing how the money was conveyed to Femino.  Najarian also testified to Omar's alleged incriminating admissions.  The government says that the defendants were able to impeach Najarian with her own original grand jury testimony;  but a little thought suggests that this argument cuts both ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fairly strong case against both defendants would have been much weaker if Najarian's testimony had been disbelieved.  Of course, Najarian's testimony had other support while Femino's grand jury denials were brief and self-serving.  But, together with Najarian's own grand jury perjury (one of her two versions was false), Femino's denials could have helped to raise a reasonable doubt for the jury as to both defendants.  In sum, the exclusion of the grand jury testimony was not clearly harmless;  whether it was error is a different matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the merits, we begin with a general issue of law--how to construe Rule 804(b)(1)--which is subject to de novo review.  But in considering the application of the rule to particular facts, the district court's ruling is normally tested by an \"abuse of discretion\" standard, which favors the prevailing party.

A grand jury proceeding can be regarded as a \"hearing,\" especially in the context of a rule that applies as well to depositions.  And--assuming \"an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony\"--the rationale for an exception to the hearsay rule is made out, namely, that the party against whom the testimony is now offered earlier had the opportunity and similar motive to discredit the testimony, and so did then whatever it would do now if the declarant were on the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether Rule 804(b)(1) is intended to apply where the present opponent of the evidence had no prior motive to discredit the testimony but instead sponsored it in the earlier proceeding as worthy of belief.  In such a case, the rationale for a hearsay exception would be quite different, namely, a kind of quasi-estoppel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Arguably, the motive to develop would not be \"similar\" in the second case, so the rule would not apply.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span> (1992).  There, the Supreme Court all but held that Rule 804(b)(1) could embrace grand jury testimony;  and on remand the Second Circuit took the same view of the matter.  United States v. DiNapoli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656568\"><a href=\"/opinion/656568/united-states-v-vincent-dinapoli-louis-dinapoli-nicholas-auletta-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span>, 914 (2d Cir.1993) (en banc ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has been confusion on this issue in the circuits.  No one knows whether the drafters of the rule had grand jury proceedings in mind.  In fact, it is likely to be very difficult for defendants offering grand jury testimony to satisfy the \"opportunity and similar motive\" test;  and the reasons why this is so probably underlie the doubts courts have expressed as to whether the rule should ever apply to grand jury testimony.  E.g., United States v. Dent, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599270\"><a href=\"/opinion/599270/united-states-v-charles-dent-also-known-as-william-brown-and-ivy-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1453</span></a></span>, 1462 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span> (1993).  But the government concedes that it could in principle apply and (yielding to Salerno ) we agree, if and when the quoted condition is met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This concession by the United States is not meant to stretch very far.  The government's bedrock position is that the prosecution ordinarily does not in a grand jury proceeding have the kind of motive to develop testimony that it would in an ordinary trial or that is required to meet the express test and rationale of Rule 804(b)(1).  And, it says, in this case the prosecutor at the grand jury stage lacked the requisite \"similar motive\" as to Femino's testimony.  We agree provisionally with the former proposition and completely with the latter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an ordinary trial, the positions of the parties vis-a-vis a witness are likely to be clear-cut:  the witness is normally presented by one side to advance its case and cross-examined by the other to discredit the testimony.  Each side usually has reason to treat the trial as a last chance with the witness.  If a new trial later becomes necessary and the witness proves unavailable, it may be a fair guess that each side has already done at the original trial all that the party would do if the declarant were now present for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grand juries present a different face.  Often, the government neither aims to discredit the witness nor to vouch for him.  The prosecutor may want to secure a small piece of evidence as part of an ongoing investigation or to compel an answer by an unwilling witness or to \"freeze\" the position of an adverse witness.  In particular, discrediting a grand jury witness is rarely essential, because the government has a modest burden of proof, selects its own witnesses, and can usually call more of them at its leisure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, we think that it is fair to apply the \"opportunity and similar motive\" test to the specific portion of the testimony at issue;  there might be a motive to develop some testimony of a witness but not other parts.  Cf. Williamson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117868\"><a href=\"/opinion/117868/williamson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 597-602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117868\"><a href=\"/opinion/117868/williamson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2431</span></a></span>, 2434-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117868\"><a href=\"/opinion/117868/williamson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> (1994).  Here, our focus is upon Femino's exculpatory denial.  And our main concern is whether, in the prior proceeding, the government (the party against whom the testimony is now offered) had \"an opportunity and similar motive\" to undermine it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no indication that the government had any evidence available in November 1991 with which to confront and contradict Femino when he denied receiving the cash from the defendants.  Najarian was still denying any knowledge of the matter in August 1993 in her own grand jury testimony.  Not until November 1994, in an interview with an FBI agent, did Najarian change her story and begin to cooperate.  Thus, it is arguable that the government had no meaningful opportunity to discredit Femino at the time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any case, it certainly lacked any evident motive to do so.  If the government had had Najarian's cooperation in 1991, it could well have preferred to keep it secret from Femino.  The prosecutor might have wished to protect a key witness for the time being or to bargain later with Femino, armed with a perjury charge against him.  Given the other evidence against the defendants, the government surely had no reason to fear that Femino's terse denials, if he were not directly confronted, would lead the grand jury to refuse to indict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome is the same even if we assume dubitante that a party who previously sponsored a witness could be deemed to have a \"similar motive\" when later opposing the testimony.  The government has never had any reason to \"develop\" Femino's exculpatory denial as worthy of belief.  In the grand jury, the government called Femino to elicit testimony on several other points;  the prosecutor seems to have asked about cash from the defendants simply to lock the witness into a firm position or to make clear to the grand jury that all reasonable questions had been asked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An argument can certainly be made that the fairest outcome here would be to admit Femino's exculpatory statement.  His grand jury testimony was important to the defendants on this issue;  it was pure happenstance that he died and was not available at trial (although he might have refused to testify).  And while his testimony was self-serving and suspect, the government's ability to undermine it at trial, through Najarian, was substantial even without having Femino to cross-examine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conflicts between rule and equity are common.  If every ruling is ad hoc, it is hard to implement policy and predict outcomes.  And rules themselves are debatable:  one respected evidence code proposed that \"hearsay ... is admissible if ... the declarant ... is unavailable.\"   ALI, Model Code of Evidence Rule 503 (1942).  But our own federal rules stop with a broad catch-all exception for hearsay supported by \"circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 803(24), 804(b)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the defendants did not invoke this exception, probably believing that they could not show that Femino's self-serving denials were trustworthy.  Thus viewed, the defendants were deprived of helpful but not very credible evidence which--for this very reason--might well not have been given great weight by the jury, quite apart from other evidence tending to corroborate Najarian's story.  In all events, the exclusion of the evidence was consistent with Rule 804(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The advisory committee note on Rule 804(b)(1) leaves the matter in confusion.  It describes the estoppel rationale as archaic but then, instead of flatly rejecting it, shifts the discussion to the proposition that in the case of an adverse witness, the direct and redirect examination of one's own witness can be the equivalent of the cross-examination of an opponent's witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Just how equivalent the \"opportunity\" need be is not made clear by the rule or advisory committee note.  There are obviously issues of degree and may be other variables (like fault) that bear upon the answer, which is probably best left to case-by-case development.  Compare United States v.
