Stern, United States Attorney, and  George B. Henderson,\r                                                                              \r\nII, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r          \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  When the United  States would not sell\r                                \r\n\nor lease  land it owned to  defendant-appellant Peter Grabler\r\n\nso  that he  could  build a  tennis  court in  his  backyard,\r\n\nGrabler went  ahead and built the court  anyway.  There is no\r\n\ndispute  that part of the court was constructed on land owned\r\n\nby the  government (which  abutted Grabler's property).   The\r\n\ngovernment  sued in  federal  district court.   The  district\r\n\ncourt granted the  government's motion  for summary  judgment\r\n\nand  ordered Grabler to remove the court and restore the land\r\n\nto its original  condition.  Grabler  makes two arguments  on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          1.    Grabler  contends that  a  government lawyer,\r\n\nTheodore Smollen,  committed fraud on the  district court and\r\n\nthat,  as  a result,  the government  is  not entitled  to an\r\n\nequitable remedy.  Specifically, Grabler asserts that Smollen\r\n\ntold Grabler that but for the  fact that Grabler lived in  an\r\n\naffluent  neighborhood,  the  government  would  have  worked\r\n\nsomething out  instead of  insisting that Grabler  remove the\r\n\ntennis court.  In  a district court pleading,  the government\r\n\ndenied  that Smollen had made this statement.  Grabler argues\r\n\nthat  this denial was for the purpose of misleading the court\r\n\nand for  the purpose of preventing him  from fully presenting\r\n\nhis  counterclaim that  the government  had denied  him equal\r\n\nprotection of the laws by discriminating against him based on\r\n\nwealth.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n          We have stated that\r\n\n                  [a]  \"fraud  on  the  court\"\r\n               occurs   where    it   can   be\r\n               demonstrated,    clearly    and\r\n               convincingly, that  a party has\r\n               sentiently  set in  motion some\r\n               unconscionable           scheme\r\n               calculated  to  interfere  with\r\n               the  judicial  system's ability\r\n               impartially  to   adjudicate  a\r\n               matter       by      improperly\r\n               influencing   the   trier    or\r\n               unfairly      hampering     the\r\n               presentation  of  the  opposing\r\n               party's claim or defense.\r\n\nAoude  v.  Mobil Oil  Corp., 892  F.2d  1115, 1118  (1st Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1989).  Only  the \"most egregious misconduct directed  to the\r\n\ncourt itself\" will justify  a finding of fraud on  the court.\r\n\nPfizer, Inc. v. International  Rectifier Corp., 538 F.2d 180,\r                                                          \r\n\n195 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied,  429 U.S. 1040 (1977).  We\r                                             \r\n\nhave no trouble concluding that there was no such fraud here.\r\n\n          Grabler's  claim fails for  the simple  reason that\r\n\nthere  never  was  an  equal  protection  counterclaim   and,\r\n\nfurther,  because Grabler  never  raised such  a claim  until\r\n\nafter he says  he discovered  the alleged fraud.   Thus,  the\r                 \r\n\ngovernment's  actions  prior to  the  assertion  of an  equal\r                                           \r\n\nprotection violation could  not have been for  the purpose of\r\n\npreventing the district  court from adjudicating the  matter.\r\n\nIndeed, the government had no reason to formulate a scheme to\r\n\ninterfere with a claim Grabler never made.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n          Finally,  Grabler  does  not  make   out  an  equal\r\n\nprotection  violation on  the merits.   In  a case,  as here,\r\n\nwhich alleges improper selective enforcement, a litigant must\r\n\nshow, among  other things,  specific  instances where  others\r\n\n\"situated  similarly  in  all relevant  aspects  were treated\r\n\ndifferently . . . .\"   Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906, 910\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (internal  quotations and citations omitted).\r\n\nGrabler's  references to  persons who  were permitted  to use\r\n\ngovernment  land do  not  contain any  information about  how\r                                                 \r\n\ntheir circumstances compared to  Grabler's.  Nor does Grabler\r\n\ndemonstrate  any malicious  intent on the  government's part,\r\n\nanother requirement for stating such a claim.

Grabler's second appellate contention  is that\r\n\nthe   injunction   entered   by   the   district   court   is\r\n\ninappropriate.  We have  reviewed Grabler's arguments in this\r\n\nregard and find  that the  district court did  not abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in ordering  the relief  it did.
