This is an appeal from the denial of social\r                           \r\n\nsecurity  disability  benefits.    Appellant  Ana  H.  Rosado\r\n\n(\"Rosado\")  claims she  is disabled due  to a  combination of\r\n\nback problems and depression.\r\n\n     A mental residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") assessment\r\n\nwas  required in this case,  since it was determined Rosado's\r\n\nmental   impairment  was   \"severe.\"     See   20  C.F.R.    \r                                                        \r\n\n404.1520a(c)(3).

Prior to her son's\r\ndeath,  most of the evidence showed Rosado's mental condition\r\nwas \"good\"  or \"fair.\"   After she  lost her son,  though, it\r\ndoes  appear  from   the  records  of  all   three  examining\r\nphysicians that her  mental condition may have  deteriorated.\r\nOn remand,  the ALJ should  analyze the evidence in  light of\r\nthis  fact.
