Brooks states in his brief that \"the post suit amendment by defendants is subject to impinging Mr. Brooks' rights as he is engaged in an ongoing controversy with attorneys regarding his right as a father.\"   Appellant's Brief, p. 3. Those hypothetical future claims, however, are not of sufficient \"immediacy and reality\" to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement.

Given the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision declaring the challenged pre-amendment provisions unconstitutional, there is \" 'no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.' \"   Preiser v.

In  Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>, 1728 (1996), the Supreme Court held that \"federal courts have the power to dismiss or remand cases based on abstention principles only where the relief being sought is equitable or otherwise discretionary.  Because this was a damages action, we conclude that the District Court's remand order was an unwarranted application of the Burford doctrine.\"   Quackenbush, 116 S.Ct. at 1728.   Because Brooks' federal suit was not an action for damages, and the relief it sought \"is equitable or otherwise discretionary,\" the abstention-based dismissal was within the court's power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's dismissal of this case is summarily affirmed.
