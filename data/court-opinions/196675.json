The bankruptcy court entered\r\n\nthe  order for  relief  under chapter  7  on December  10,  1993,\r\n\nfollowing its denial of Petit's motion to dismiss the involuntary\r\n\npetition.  See 11 U.S.C.   305(a).  One week later, Petit filed a\r                        \r\n\nmotion to convert to chapter 11.  See id.   348.  At a hearing on\r                                                   \r\n\nFebruary  2,  1994, and  over  the objection  of  the petitioning\r\n\ncreditors, the  bankruptcy court directed  entry of an  order for\r\n\nrelief  under chapter 11, and took  under advisement the appoint-\r\n\nment of a chapter 11 trustee.  \r\n\n          Petit   filed  her   statement  of   financial  affairs\r\n\n(Official  Form 7)  and  schedules (Official  Form 6),  including\r\n\nSchedule C (Property  Claimed as  Exempt), see id.    521(1),  on\r                                                            \r\n\nFebruary  25,  1994,  asserting  a claim  to  certain  exemptions\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nprescribed under federal law, see id.    522(d)(11)(A) (\"an award\r                                               \r\n\nunder  a crime  victim's reparation  law\"); 522(d)(11)(D)  (\"pay-\r\n\nment[s],  not to  exceed  $7500, on  account  of personal  bodily\r\n\ninjury\").   In Schedule B, Petit listed as an exempt asset, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, the entire anticipated  proceeds from a pending state-court\r              \r\n\naction against Key Bank,  having an estimated value in  excess of\r\n\n$25  million.   On March  28, 1994,  the  order for  relief under\r\n\nchapter 11 was entered on the bankruptcy court docket.\r\n\n          The United States Trustee  convened a meeting of credi-\r\n\ntors on May  17, 1994.  See  id.   341;  Fed. R. Bankr. P.  2003.\r                                          \r\n\nBefore it ended, the meeting  of creditors was \"continued without\r\n\ndate\" by the Assistant  United States Trustee.   On June 17,  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court approved  the appointment of  defendant-appellee\r\n\nPeter  Fessenden, Esquire, as the chapter 11 trustee.  Two months\r\n\nlater,  on August 22, Fessenden  filed objections to  the list of\r\n\nproperty claimed as  exempt by Petit,  particularly her claim  to\r\n\nthe anticipated  proceeds from  the pending legal  action against\r\n\nKey  Bank.  Petit responded that the objection was time-barred by\r\n\nFed. R.  Bankr. P. 4003(b), because  it was not filed  until more\r\n\nthan  30 days after the \"conclusion\" of the meeting of creditors.\r\n\nSee Taylor v.  Freeland &amp; Kronz, 112 S. Ct. 1644, 1648-49 (1992).\r                                         \r\n\nFessenden meanwhile sent a notice to creditors that the continued\r\n\nmeeting of  creditors  would be  reconvened on  October 20,  thus\r\n\npurportedly  extending    until at least 30 days after October 20\r\n\n    the time for  filing any  objection to  the list  of property\r\n\nclaimed  exempt  and  rendering  timely the  objection  filed  by\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nFessenden on August 22. \r\n\n          Petit then  sought to quash the  notice reconvening the\r\n\nmeeting  of creditors,  contending  in the  alternative that  (1)\r\n\nBankruptcy Code   341  permits only the United States  Trustee or\r\n\nan express  \"designee\"     and  not  an undesignated  chapter  11\r\n\ntrustee    to convene a meeting of creditors and  that the United\r\n\nStates Trustee had objected to reconvening  the meeting of credi-\r\n\ntors  scheduled by  Fessenden; or  (2)  the 30-day  deadline pre-\r\n\nscribed in Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b)  for objecting to an exemption\r\n\nclaim cannot be  enlarged, citing the  Supreme Court decision  in\r\n\nTaylor,  112 S. Ct. at 1648 (\"[Rule 4003(b)] [d]eadlines may lead\r                \r\n\nto  unwelcome results, but they prompt parties to act and produce\r\n\nfinality.\").  But cf.  Mercer v.  Monzack, 53  F.3d 1  (1st Cir.)\r                                                   \r\n\n(distinguishing Taylor),  petition for  cert. filed, 64  U.S.L.W.\r                                                             \r\n\n3439  (U.S. Dec.  12,  1995) (No.  95-970).   Petit  argued  that\r\n\nallowing  trustees  to  circumvent  Taylor,  through  the  simple\r                                                    \r\n\nexpedient  of  routine, indefinite  adjournments  of  meetings of\r\n\ncreditors, would deprive chapter 11 debtors of the benefit of the\r\n\nvery policies of repose and finality acknowledged by the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt in  Taylor.  Petit urged, at the very least, that a meeting\r                          \r\n\nof  creditors adjourned  without  day be  deemed \"concluded\"  for\r\n\npurposes of the  Rule 4003(b)  time-bar if, as  here, the  United\r\n\nStates Trustee (or chapter 11 trustee) fails  to announce, within\r\n\n30  days  of the  adjournment, a  firm  date for  reconvening the\r\n\nmeeting of creditors.  See In re Levitt, 137 B.R.  881 (Bankr. D.\r                                                 \r\n\nMass. 1992); infra note 2.\r                            \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          The bankruptcy  court first denied the  motion to quash\r\n\nthe notice reconvening the  continued meeting of creditors, then,\r\n\nafter it had been reconvened, ruled that the  Fessenden objection\r\n\nto  Petit's exemption claim was not time-barred, In re Petit, 172\r                                                                      \r\n\nB.R.  706 (Bankr. D. Me. 1994) (Votolato, B.J.);1 Petit, 174 B.R.\r                                                                 \r\n\n868 (Bankr. D. Me.  1994) (Votolato, B.J.).2  The  district court\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  bankruptcy   court  ruled  that   Fessenden  possessed\r\nunilateral  authority  to  reconvene  the  meeting  of  creditors\r\nbecause Bankruptcy Code    102(9) defines the term \"United States\r\ntrustee\" to include a \"designee,\"  the term \"designee\" is synony-\r\nmous with the term \"appointee,\" and the United States Trustee had\r\nappointed Fessenden as the chapter 11  trustee.  In light of  our\r\nholding, we need not resolve this question.\r\n\n     2The  bankruptcy  court  sustained  the  objections  on  the\r\nfollowing  grounds.   First,  it found  In  re Levitt  inapposite\r                                                               \r\nbecause the indefinite adjournment of the meeting of creditors by\r\nthe  chapter  7 trustee  in that  case  had been  followed  by an\r\nunreasonable 15-month delay in reconvening the meeting.  Treating\r                               \r\nthe  \"reasonableness\" of any  delay in  reconvening a  meeting of\r\ncreditors  as a matter  requiring case-by-case determination, the\r\nbankruptcy court  noted several factors which  indicated that the\r\ndelay in this case was not  unreasonable:  (1) Fessenden did  not\r\nbecome  the chapter 11 trustee until after the initial meeting of\r\ncreditors, in  part because Petit, a  \"particularly litigious and\r\nobstructionist\" debtor, had opposed  the appointment of a chapter\r\n11 trustee; (2)   the Fessenden  appointment, which occurred  the\r\nsame day the 30-day period  prescribed in Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b)\r\nexpired,  followed the unexpected  withdrawal or disqualification\r\nof  other  potential  chapter  11 trustee  candidates;  (3)  thus\r\nFessenden was relegated to the role of a  mere \"spectator\" at the\r\ninitial May 17 meeting  of creditors, and did not  participate in\r\nquestioning  Petit  regarding her  schedules;  (4)  the Assistant\r\nUnited  States Trustee had informed Petit  at the initial meeting\r\nof creditors  that  although  it  was  unlikely  the  meeting  of\r\ncreditors  would  be  reconvened,  \"some  special  reason\"  might\r\nrequire  it; and  (5)  Fessenden filed  objections  to the  Petit\r\nexemption claims 66 days after his appointment. \r\n     On the  merits, the bankruptcy court found  the Petit exemp-\r\ntion claims here  at issue  frivolous, for two  reasons.   First,\r                                               \r\nMaine law does not permit residents to elect the federal slate of\r\nproperty exemptions, and  Petit's contention that  she was not  a\r\nMaine resident was found to be \"farcical.\"  Her real and personal\r\nproperty was all located in Maine, where she also voted, received\r\nher  mail,  and secured  her driver's  license.   She  adduced no\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\naffirmed.  Petit v. Fessenden (In re Petit), 182 B.R.  59 (D.

Instead,  Petit failed  to file the  required\r\n\nchapter  11 schedules  until  February 25,  two  days beyond  the\r\n\ndeadline.

The bankruptcy court entered the order for relief under chapter 7 on December 10, 1993, following its denial of Petit's motion to dismiss the involuntary petition.   See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 305(a).   One week later, Petit filed a motion to convert to chapter 11.   See id. &#167; 348.   At a hearing on February 2, 1994, and over the objection of the petitioning creditors, the bankruptcy court directed entry of an order for relief under chapter 11, and took under advisement the appointment of a chapter 11 trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petit filed her statement of financial affairs (Official Form 7) and schedules (Official Form 6), including Schedule C (Property Claimed as Exempt), see id. &#167; 521(1), on February 25, 1994, asserting a claim to certain exemptions prescribed under federal law, see id. &#167;&#167; 522(d)(11)(A) (\"an award under a crime victim's reparation law\");  522(d)(11)(D) (\"payment[s], not to exceed $7500, on account of personal bodily injury\").   In Schedule B, Petit listed as an exempt asset, inter alia, the entire anticipated proceeds from a pending state-court action against Key Bank, having an estimated value in excess of $25 million.   On March 28, 1994, the order for relief under chapter 11 was entered on the bankruptcy court docket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Trustee convened a meeting of creditors on May 17, 1994.   See id. &#167; 341;  Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2003.   Before it ended, the meeting of creditors was \"continued without date\" by the Assistant United States Trustee.   On June 17, the bankruptcy court approved the appointment of defendant-appellee Peter Fessenden, Esquire, as the chapter 11 trustee.   Two months later, on August 22, Fessenden filed objections to the list of property claimed as exempt by Petit, particularly her claim to the anticipated proceeds from the pending legal action against Key Bank.   Petit responded that the objection was time-barred by Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4003(b), because it was not filed until more than 30 days after the \"conclusion\" of the meeting of creditors.   See Taylor v. Freeland &amp; Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 642-44, 112 S.Ct. 1644, 1648-49, 118 L.Ed.2d 280 (1992).   Fessenden meanwhile sent a notice to creditors that the continued meeting of creditors would be reconvened on October 20, thus purportedly extending--until at least 30 days after October 20--the time for filing any objection to the list of property claimed exempt and rendering timely the objection filed by Fessenden on August 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petit then sought to quash the notice reconvening the meeting of creditors, contending in the alternative that (1) Bankruptcy Code &#167; 341 permits only the United States Trustee or an express \"designee\"--and not an undesignated chapter 11 trustee--to convene a meeting of creditors and that the United States Trustee had objected to reconvening the meeting of creditors scheduled by Fessenden;  or (2) the 30-day deadline prescribed in Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) for objecting to an exemption claim cannot be enlarged, citing the Supreme Court decision in Taylor, 112 S.Ct. at 1648 (\"[Rule 4003(b) ] [d]eadlines may lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt parties to act and produce finality.\").   But cf. Mercer v. Monzack, 53 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.)  (distinguishing Taylor ), petition for cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1317, 134 L.Ed.2d 471 (1996).   Petit argued that allowing trustees to circumvent Taylor, through the simple expedient of routine, indefinite adjournments of meetings of creditors, would deprive chapter 11 debtors of the benefit of the very policies of repose and finality acknowledged by the Supreme Court in Taylor.   Petit urged, at the very least, that a meeting of creditors adjourned without day be deemed \"concluded\" for purposes of the Rule 4003(b) time-bar if, as here, the United States Trustee (or chapter 11 trustee) fails to announce, within 30 days of the adjournment, a firm date for reconvening the meeting of creditors.

Nonetheless, no request to extend the filing time was ever made pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c).   See, e.g., Bryant v. Smith, 165 B.R. 176, 181-82 (W.D.Va.1994) (\"The court finds that untimely filed schedules waive a debtor's exemption unless the untimely filing is permitted by the bankruptcy judge in his discretion for cause shown or excusable neglect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 15-day window allowed under Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c), Petit did file a motion to convert the chapter 7 case to chapter 11, but this motion neither excused the failure to comply with Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c), nor tolled the 15-day filing period.   Finally, the automatic \"deeming\" provision in Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c), see supra p. 8, can afford no refuge since no chapter 7 schedules were ever filed.   Nor did the chapter 11 schedules eventually filed by Petit cure her procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, although an order of conversion constitutes an \"order for relief\" under the chapter to which the case is converted, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 348(a), it \"does not effect a change in the date of ... the order for relief.\"   That is to say, \"[s]ection 348(a) provides that 'those provisions of the Code which are keyed to the date of entry of the order for relief for their operation are unaffected ... by conversion.' \"  F &amp; M Marquette Nat'l Bank v.

Since the time limits prescribed in Bankruptcy Rules 1007(c) and 4003(a) are keyed to the date of the order for relief, which had already been entered on December 10, 1993, the order of conversion could not effect an automatic extension of the 15-day deadline (December 26, 1993) for filing schedules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Petit inexplicably made matters more problematic by disregarding a ready opportunity, and her clear responsibility, to cure the procedural default by complying with an explicit bankruptcy court order directing her to file chapter 11 schedules not later than February 23, 1994.   See Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9006(b), (c).   Instead, Petit failed to file the required chapter 11 schedules until February 25, two days beyond the deadline.   Thus, Petit's chapter 11 schedules were time-barred even viewed in the most favorable light, without regard to her failure to notify the United States Trustee of her intention to request an extension under Rule 4003(a) or to allege or demonstrate either excusable neglect or good cause.   See Fed.R.Bankr.P. 1007(c), 9006(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Taylor Court recognized that a debtor should not be indefinitely or unreasonably delayed in reacquiring property while the trustee or creditors ponder whether or not to lodge objections to a claim of exemptions.   See Taylor, 503 U.S. at 638, 112 S.Ct. at 1644;  In re Young, 806 F.2d 1303, 1305 (5th Cir.1987);  Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4003(b), 9006(b)(3) (trustee must move for filing extension before end of 30-day period).   Unless and until a debtor files a timely claim of exemptions, however, as required by the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, there is no \"list of property claimed exempt\" for the trustee or creditors to oppose.   See, e.g., Redfield v. Peat, Marwick and Co.  (In re Robertson ), 105 B.R. 440, 450 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1989) (\"The Debtor and other Defendants here who seek the normal benefit that flows from a timely claim of exemption not timely objected to, rest their contention on a late-filed claim that the Court never allowed to be filed....  In this case, the exemption claim late-filed without notice, motion, or leave of Court, is not entitled to the automatic allowance that Bankr.R. 4003(a) gives to a timely filed exemption claim if it is not timely objected to.   He who seeks to benefit by the Bankruptcy Rules must abide by them.\").   In these circumstances, the principle of repose relied upon in Taylor supports the rulings below.

First, it found In re Levitt inapposite because the indefinite adjournment of the meeting of creditors by the chapter 7 trustee in that case had been followed by an unreasonable 15-month delay in reconvening the meeting.   Treating the \"reasonableness\" of any delay in reconvening a meeting of creditors as a matter requiring case-by-case determination, the bankruptcy court noted several factors which indicated that the delay in this case was not unreasonable:  (1) Fessenden did not become the chapter 11 trustee until after the initial meeting of creditors, in part because Petit, a \"particularly litigious and obstructionist\" debtor, had opposed the appointment of a chapter 11 trustee;  (2) the Fessenden appointment, which occurred the same day the 30-day period prescribed in Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) expired, followed the unexpected withdrawal or disqualification of other potential chapter 11 trustee candidates;  (3) thus Fessenden was relegated to the role of a mere \"spectator\" at the initial May 17 meeting of creditors, and did not participate in questioning Petit regarding her schedules;  (4) the Assistant United States Trustee had informed Petit at the initial meeting of creditors that although it was unlikely the meeting of creditors would be reconvened, \"some special reason\" might require it;  and (5) Fessenden filed objections to the Petit exemption claims 66 days after his appointment</p>\n        <p>On the merits, the bankruptcy court found the Petit exemption claims here at issue frivolous, for two reasons.   First, Maine law does not permit residents to elect the federal slate of property exemptions, and Petit's contention that she was not a Maine resident was found to be \"farcical.\"   Her real and personal property was all located in Maine, where she also voted, received her mail, and secured her driver's license.   She adduced no concrete evidence that she had resided in Massachusetts for 180 days prior to the involuntary chapter 7 petition.   Second, even if Petit had been permitted by Maine law to claim the federal exemptions, she had not established that the pending lawsuit against Key Bank involved a claim arising \"under a crime victim's reparation law,\" see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d)(11)(A), or for \"payment[s] ... on account of personal bodily injury,\" see id. &#167; 522(d)(11)(D).   Further, Petit had not claimed these exemptions under &#167; 522(d)(11)(E) (compensation for \"loss of future earnings\") because Schedule C did not cite to &#167; 522(d)(11)(E).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In opposing Petit's claim of exemptions, the chapter 11 trustee agreed, in principle, not to oppose her claim of exemptions insofar as it pertained to legitimate state-law exemptions, if any.   Consequently, we express no opinion on the preliminary and related question whether, upon remand to the bankruptcy court, Petit should prevail on any motion to extend the time in which to file such a claim of exemptions for good cause or excusable neglect</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The bankruptcy court entered the order for relief under chapter 7 on December 10, 1993, following its denial of Petit's motion to dismiss the involuntary petition.   See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 305(a).   One week later, Petit filed a motion to convert to chapter 11.   See id. &#167; 348.   At a hearing on February 2, 1994, and over the objection of the petitioning creditors, the bankruptcy court directed entry of an order for relief under chapter 11, and took under advisement the appointment of a chapter 11 trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petit filed her statement of financial affairs (Official Form 7) and schedules (Official Form 6), including Schedule C (Property Claimed as Exempt), see id. &#167; 521(1), on February 25, 1994, asserting a claim to certain exemptions prescribed under federal law, see id. &#167;&#167; 522(d)(11)(A) (\"an award under a crime victim's reparation law\");  522(d)(11)(D) (\"payment[s], not to exceed $7500, on account of personal bodily injury\").   In Schedule B, Petit listed as an exempt asset, inter alia, the entire anticipated proceeds from a pending state-court action against Key Bank, having an estimated value in excess of $25 million.   On March 28, 1994, the order for relief under chapter 11 was entered on the bankruptcy court docket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Trustee convened a meeting of creditors on May 17, 1994.   See id. &#167; 341;  Fed.R.Bankr.P. 2003.   Before it ended, the meeting of creditors was \"continued without date\" by the Assistant United States Trustee.   On June 17, the bankruptcy court approved the appointment of defendant-appellee Peter Fessenden, Esquire, as the chapter 11 trustee.   Two months later, on August 22, Fessenden filed objections to the list of property claimed as exempt by Petit, particularly her claim to the anticipated proceeds from the pending legal action against Key Bank.   Petit responded that the objection was time-barred by Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4003(b), because it was not filed until more than 30 days after the \"conclusion\" of the meeting of creditors.   See Taylor v. Freeland &amp; Kronz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112725\"><a href=\"/opinion/112725/taylor-v-freeland-kronz/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 642-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112725\"><a href=\"/opinion/112725/taylor-v-freeland-kronz/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Fessenden meanwhile sent a notice to creditors that the continued meeting of creditors would be reconvened on October 20, thus purportedly extending--until at least 30 days after October 20--the time for filing any objection to the list of property claimed exempt and rendering timely the objection filed by Fessenden on August 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petit then sought to quash the notice reconvening the meeting of creditors, contending in the alternative that (1) Bankruptcy Code &#167; 341 permits only the United States Trustee or an express \"designee\"--and not an undesignated chapter 11 trustee--to convene a meeting of creditors and that the United States Trustee had objected to reconvening the meeting of creditors scheduled by Fessenden;  or (2) the 30-day deadline prescribed in Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) for objecting to an exemption claim cannot be enlarged, citing the Supreme Court decision in Taylor, 112 S.Ct. at 1648 (\"[Rule 4003(b) ] [d]eadlines may lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt parties to act and produce finality.\").

Petit argued that allowing trustees to circumvent Taylor, through the simple expedient of routine, indefinite adjournments of meetings of creditors, would deprive chapter 11 debtors of the benefit of the very policies of repose and finality acknowledged by the Supreme Court in Taylor.   Petit urged, at the very least, that a meeting of creditors adjourned without day be deemed \"concluded\" for purposes of the Rule 4003(b) time-bar if, as here, the United States Trustee (or chapter 11 trustee) fails to announce, within 30 days of the adjournment, a firm date for reconvening the meeting of creditors.

Finally, the automatic \"deeming\" provision in Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c), see supra p. 8, can afford no refuge since no chapter 7 schedules were ever filed.   Nor did the chapter 11 schedules eventually filed by Petit cure her procedural default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, although an order of conversion constitutes an \"order for relief\" under the chapter to which the case is converted, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 348(a), it \"does not effect a change in the date of ... the order for relief.\"   That is to say, \"[s]ection 348(a) provides that 'those provisions of the Code which are keyed to the date of entry of the order for relief for their operation are unaffected ... by conversion.' \"  F &amp; M Marquette Nat'l Bank v.

King, Collier on Bankruptcy &#167; 348.02 (15th ed. 1979));  see Schwartz v. Jetronic Indus., Inc.  (In re Harry Levin, Inc.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1818317\"><a href=\"/opinion/1818317/in-re-harry-levin-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 570 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1994);  LaRossa v.

Since the time limits prescribed in Bankruptcy Rules 1007(c) and 4003(a) are keyed to the date of the order for relief, which had already been entered on December 10, 1993, the order of conversion could not effect an automatic extension of the 15-day deadline (December 26, 1993) for filing schedules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Petit inexplicably made matters more problematic by disregarding a ready opportunity, and her clear responsibility, to cure the procedural default by complying with an explicit bankruptcy court order directing her to file chapter 11 schedules not later than February 23, 1994.   See Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9006(b), (c).   Instead, Petit failed to file the required chapter 11 schedules until February 25, two days beyond the deadline.   Thus, Petit's chapter 11 schedules were time-barred even viewed in the most favorable light, without regard to her failure to notify the United States Trustee of her intention to request an extension under Rule 4003(a) or to allege or demonstrate either excusable neglect or good cause.   See Fed.R.Bankr.P. 1007(c), 9006(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Taylor Court recognized that a debtor should not be indefinitely or unreasonably delayed in reacquiring property while the trustee or creditors ponder whether or not to lodge objections to a claim of exemptions.   See Taylor, 503 U.S. at 638, 112 S.Ct. at 1644;  In re Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480378\"><a href=\"/opinion/480378/bankr-l-rep-p-71627-in-the-matter-of-herman-neil-young-debtor-herman/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span>, 1305 (5th Cir.1987);  Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4003(b), 9006(b)(3) (trustee must move for filing extension before end of 30-day period).   Unless and until a debtor files a timely claim of exemptions, however, as required by the Bankruptcy Code and the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, there is no \"list of property claimed exempt\" for the trustee or creditors to oppose.   See, e.g., Redfield v. Peat, Marwick and Co.  (In re Robertson ), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008505\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008505/in-re-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 450 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1989) (\"The Debtor and other Defendants here who seek the normal benefit that flows from a timely claim of exemption not timely objected to, rest their contention on a late-filed claim that the Court never allowed to be filed....  In this case, the exemption claim late-filed without notice, motion, or leave of Court, is not entitled to the automatic allowance that Bankr.R. 4003(a) gives to a timely filed exemption claim if it is not timely objected to.   He who seeks to benefit by the Bankruptcy Rules must abide by them.\").   In these circumstances, the principle of repose relied upon in Taylor supports the rulings below.  Taylor, 503 U.S. at 644, 112 S.Ct. at 1648 (\"[Rule 4003(b) ] deadlines may lead to unwelcome results, but they prompt parties to act and produce finality.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In light of our holding, we need not resolve this question</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The bankruptcy court sustained the objections on the following grounds.   First, it found In re Levitt inapposite because the indefinite adjournment of the meeting of creditors by the chapter 7 trustee in that case had been followed by an unreasonable 15-month delay in reconvening the meeting.   Treating the \"reasonableness\" of any delay in reconvening a meeting of creditors as a matter requiring case-by-case determination, the bankruptcy court noted several factors which indicated that the delay in this case was not unreasonable:  (1) Fessenden did not become the chapter 11 trustee until after the initial meeting of creditors, in part because Petit, a \"particularly litigious and obstructionist\" debtor, had opposed the appointment of a chapter 11 trustee;  (2) the Fessenden appointment, which occurred the same day the 30-day period prescribed in Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) expired, followed the unexpected withdrawal or disqualification of other potential chapter 11 trustee candidates;  (3) thus Fessenden was relegated to the role of a mere \"spectator\" at the initial May 17 meeting of creditors, and did not participate in questioning Petit regarding her schedules;  (4) the Assistant United States Trustee had informed Petit at the initial meeting of creditors that although it was unlikely the meeting of creditors would be reconvened, \"some special reason\" might require it;  and (5) Fessenden filed objections to the Petit exemption claims 66 days after his appointment</p>\n        <p>On the merits, the bankruptcy court found the Petit exemption claims here at issue frivolous, for two reasons.   First, Maine law does not permit residents to elect the federal slate of property exemptions, and Petit's contention that she was not a Maine resident was found to be \"farcical.\"   Her real and personal property was all located in Maine, where she also voted, received her mail, and secured her driver's license.   She adduced no concrete evidence that she had resided in Massachusetts for 180 days prior to the involuntary chapter 7 petition.   Second, even if Petit had been permitted by Maine law to claim the federal exemptions, she had not established that the pending lawsuit against Key Bank involved a claim arising \"under a crime victim's reparation law,\" see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d)(11)(A), or for \"payment[s] ... on account of personal bodily injury,\" see id. &#167; 522(d)(11)(D).   Further, Petit had not claimed these exemptions under &#167; 522(d)(11)(E) (compensation for \"loss of future earnings\") because Schedule C did not cite to &#167; 522(d)(11)(E).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In opposing Petit's claim of exemptions, the chapter 11 trustee agreed, in principle, not to oppose her claim of exemptions insofar as it pertained to legitimate state-law exemptions, if any.   Consequently, we express no opinion on the preliminary and related question whether, upon remand to the bankruptcy court, Petit should prevail on any motion to extend the time in which to file such a claim of exemptions for good cause or excusable neglect</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
