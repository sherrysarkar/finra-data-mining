Among other matters, this\r\nappeal raises issues that require us to focus on the diverse nature\r\nof civil as compared to criminal contempt, and on the consequence\r\nof such differences in the context of allegations of due process\r\nand double jeopardy violations.  Appellant also challenges the \r\nvalidity of the criminal contempt statute, 18 U.S.C.  401(3),\r\nalleging that it is unconstitutionally vague, claims that his\r\nmotion for acquittal was improperly denied by the trial judge in\r\nthat the government failed to prove his willfulness to commit the\r\ncharged crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and lastly, contends that\r\nhe was improperly sentenced under the obstruction of justice\r\nguideline,  2J1.2, rather than the purportedly more analogous\r\n2J1.5, which deals with failures to appear by a material witness.\r\nWe consider these issues seriatim, and ultimately conclude that the\r\nrulings of the district court should be affirmed in all respects.\r\n                I.  Relevant Background\r\n    In April 1993, appellant was subpoenaed to testify before\r\na grand jury convened in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Massachusetts.  On this occasion appellant declined to\r\ntestify, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\r\nincrimination. Thereafter, the Government moved the district court\r\nfor an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  6002 et seq., granting\r\nappellant immunity and compelling his testimony. This motion was\r\ngranted, and an order issued to that effect on May 7, 1993.\r\n    On May 20, 1993, appellant was again summoned before the\r\ngrand jury and a copy of the May 7th order was served upon him and\r\nhis attorney. Nevertheless, appellant refused to comply with the\r\norder and to give evidence before the grand jury.  On that same\r\nday, shortly after his refusal, a hearing was conducted before the\r\ndistrict judge, at which time appellant again reiterated his\r\nrefusal to comply with the May 7th order and to testify before the\r\ngrand jury. He was thereafter adjudged in civil contempt by the\r\ndistrict judge and pursuant to the civil contempt statute, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1826, was committed to federal custody until such time as\r\nhe obeyed the May 7th order, or until the expiration of the grand\r\njury, whichever event occurred first.  The order granted appellant\r\ntwo weeks within which to report to the U.S. Marshal to start his\r\nconfinement, and thus he actually commenced his detention on\r\nJune 4, 1993.\r\n    As things would have it, the grand jury's commission\r\nexpired on September 12, 1994, without the benefit of appellant's\r\ntestimony.  Appellant thus remained in custody without purging his\r\ncontempt from June 4, 1993, to September 11, 1994, when he was\r\nreleased from civil incarceration.  Approximately two years later,\r\nhowever, on May 7, 1996, another grand jury returned an indictment\r\nagainst appellant charging him with criminal contempt, for his\r\nfailure to comply with the May 7, 1993 order in violation of 18\r\nU.S.C.  401(3).\r\n    Appellant moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that\r\nhis prosecution was barred on double jeopardy, vagueness, and fair\r\nwarning/due process grounds.  These contentions were rejected by\r\nthe district court.  After a brief bench trial appellant was\r\nconvicted on December 18, 1996, and thereafter was sentenced to\r\nfifteen months' imprisonment on March 25, 1997.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n                  II.  Double Jeopardy\r\n    The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the\r\nConstitution of the United States provides that no person \"shall be\r\nsubject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or\r\nlimb.\"  U.S. Const. amend. V (emphasis supplied).  This provision\r\nprotects persons against multiple prosecutions or punishments for\r\nthe same offense.  See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696\r\n(1993).\r\n    In a nutshell, appellant argues that because he was \r\n\"punished\" by 17 months' incarceration pursuant to the civil\r\ncontempt order issued May 20, 1993, he cannot be also punished\r\ncriminally for the same offense.  See United States v. Ursery, 518\r\nU.S. 267, 273 (1996).  This is an allegation that clearly\r\nmisconstrues the distinction between civil and criminal contempt,\r\nas well as fails to take into account longstanding unmodified\r\nprecedent that exists in this area of the law.  See, e.g.,\r\nShillitani v.  United States, 384 U.S. 364, 368 (1966); Yates v.\r\nUnited  States, 355 U.S. 66, 74 (1957); United States v.\r\nNightingale, 703 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1983).  Appellant was\r\nneither \"punished\" for his civil contempt, nor prosecuted for the\r\n\"same offense\" when he was later charged and convicted for criminal\r\ncontempt, notwithstanding that both contempts arose out of the same\r\noperative facts.  This conclusion becomes clearly apparent when one\r\nconsiders the nature and purpose of civil versus criminal contempt,\r\nas well as the consequences that flow from a judicial finding in\r\neach case.\r\n    The purpose of civil contempt is to coerce compliancewith an order of the court.  See G. &amp; C. Merriam Co.  v. Webster\r\nDictionary Co., 639 F.2d 29, 40 (1st Cir. 1980).  The subjects of\r\nthe court's order have \"the keys [to their] prison in their own\r\npockets.\"  Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 368.  They can be incarcerated\r\nfor no time, if there is compliance before custody commences; for\r\nsome time, if there is submission to the order after incarceration\r\nbegins; or for as long a time as the grand jury is extant, if there\r\nis unrepented contumacy.  In any event, it is totally clear that\r\nincarceration for civil contempt is not for the purpose of\r\npunishing recalcitrant respondents but rather is the modern\r\n\"persuasive\" tool that is used in substitution of the barbaric\r\nplacing of stones on the subject's chest, which was formerly used\r\nto literally press the recipient into submission.  See J. Langbein,\r\nTorture and the Law of Proof 74-76 (1977); see also L. Levy, The\r\nOrigins of the Fifth Amendment 276-277 (1968).  Incarceration for\r\ncivil contempt only seeks acquiescence to a court's order, not\r\nretribution for noncompliance with its command.\r\n    Criminal contempt, on the other hand, is used to punish \r\ndisobedience with a judicial order, and thus vindicates the\r\nauthority of the court.  G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 639 F.2d at 40.  This\r\ncrime is completed when contumacious conduct has taken place,\r\nregardless of whether the subject later complies with the order he\r\nor she had earlier violated.  That is, once the subject of an order\r\nwillfully refuses to meet the court's order, criminal contempt has\r\nbeen committed independently of whether this conduct receives the\r\nadditional attention of the court by the issuance of a civil\r\ncommitment order seeking compliance.  For example, in its May 20,\r\n1993 order, the district judge in this case found appellant in\r\n\"willful failure to obey the Order\" of May 7, 1993, and directed\r\nhis commitment to the custody of the Marshal until such time as he\r\ncomplied, or the grand jury's term expired, which ever occurred\r\nfirst.  The district judge granted appellant two weeks to report to\r\nbegin his incarceration.  Had he complied with this order before he\r\nreported to the Marshal, the civil commitment would have become\r\nautomatically ineffective, yet he would still have been subject to\r\na criminal contempt charge because that offense was consummated\r\nonce he willfully failed to comply with the May 7th order.\r\n    The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is\r\nnot limited to the difference in the purposes served by each, the\r\nfirst being remedial, the second being punitive.  Clearly, this\r\ndifferentiation emphasizes the crucial condition that only criminal\r\ncontempt is an \"offense,\" which is the relevant language used by\r\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause.  However, there are also variances in\r\nthe technique and scope within which they traditionally operate.\r\n    Although in the present appeal both the civil and\r\ncriminal contempts arise within the context of criminal matters,\r\nthis is neither a sine qua non nor probably its most common\r\nsetting.  A frequent scenario for civil contempt situations arises\r\nas a result of the exercise of the courts' equity jurisdiction, in\r\nwhich the coercive tool is often periodic (daily, weekly, etc.)\r\nmonetary fines, tailored to compensate the party aggrieved for the\r\ndamages suffered as a result of the contumacious conduct of the\r\nnoncomplying party.  See United States v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821\r\n(1994).  The payment of such civil fines by one party to another,\r\na common technique used by courts not only to force obedience, but\r\nalso to remedy the harm caused, emphasizes another basic\r\ndistinction between civil and criminal contempt.  In the latter,\r\nwhat is sought, as in the case of all criminal charges, is the\r\nvindication of public rights.  Thus, if criminal fines are imposed\r\nin addition to or in substitution for incarceration, they cannot be\r\nused for the purpose of compensating an aggrieved party. They are\r\ndirected towards punishing the crime that has already been\r\ncommitted, and to act as a deterrent against future violations. \r\nBecause these criminal monetary penalties are not related to\r\ncompensation, but are instead punitive, they need not be geared to\r\nthe actual damages caused, and are only limited by the parameters\r\nof the sentencing discretion allowed for that crime.  On the other\r\nhand, a civil fine, which seeks to compensate the aggrieved party,\r\nmust bear some relationship to the damages being suffered, and for\r\nthis reason is considered remedial rather than punitive in nature.\r\n    Conversely, civil incarceration must be tied to\r\ncorrective measures, that is, the curing of the contumacy by\r\ncompliance with the violated order.  Such is the present case.\r\nAppellant's civil detention, which turned out to last 17 months by\r\nhis choice, sought curative results, namely, compliance with the\r\norder.  By the time of his civil detention, appellant had already\r\nindependently committed the crime for which he is presently charged\r\nand convicted; namely, criminal contempt.  At that point he could\r\nno more turn back the clock on his actions than, for example, a\r\nrobber could avoid being convicted of bank robbery by returning the\r\nloot to a bank he had robbed.  Or perhaps more on point, he is\r\nentitled to no more success in his present contention, than if he\r\nsought to raise a double jeopardy defense to criminal bank robbery\r\ncharges after losing a civil law suit in which the bank sought the\r\nreturn of stolen money from appellant.  One proceeding takes place\r\nin a civil setting, while the other is criminal in nature.\r\nSimply put, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits\r\nsequential criminal prosecutions or sanctions.  It does not bar\r\nsimultaneous or sequential civil and criminal proceedings even if\r\nthey arise out of the same factual setting.  A civil contempt\r\nproceeding for the purpose of seeking compliance with an order of\r\nthe court, whether it brings about the imposition of coercive,\r\nnonpunitive fines, and/or imprisonment subject to release by\r\npurging of the contempt, is not criminal in nature, see \r\nShillitani, 384 U.S. at 371, it is a civil proceeding to which\r\njeopardy does not attach.\r\nAlthough appellant recognizes in his brief the compelling\r\nforce of the Supreme Court's decision in Yates, 355 U.S. 66, he\r\nargues that the holding in Yates must be tempered by the more\r\nrecent one in United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267.  In Yates, it\r\nwas specifically ruled that given that \"[t]he civil and criminal\r\n[contempt] sentences served distinct purposes, the one [being]\r\ncoercive, the other punitive and deterrent . . .[,] that the same\r\nact may give rise to these distinct sanctions presents no double\r\njeopardy problem,\" 355 U.S. at 73.  We are unable to find any\r\nsupport for appellant's position in Ursery, or for that matter, in\r\nany other case that we are aware of.  In fact, if anything, Ursery \r\nlends additional support to Yates on the point at issue.\r\nUrsery deals with the double jeopardy effect of civil\r\nforfeiture proceedings on parallel or subsequent criminal processes\r\narising out of the same operative facts leading to the civil\r\nforfeiture.  The Court's ultimate conclusion that civil forfeitures\r\nare \"neither 'punishment' nor criminal for purposes of the Double\r\nJeopardy Clause,\" 518 U.S. at 292, closely tracks the present\r\nsituation as regards civil contempt, for this is exactly what we\r\nare ruling in this appeal.  Ursery, therefore, is not of much help\r\nto appellant's position.  Cf. United States v. Bajakajian,     U.S.\r\n, 1998 WL 323512 (June 22, 1998) (reiterating that the Double\r\nJeopardy clause does not bar institution of civil forfeiture\r\nactions after criminal conviction, but holding that a criminal fine\r\nmust be \"proportionate\" to the offense under the Excessive Fines\r\nclause).\r\n The two alternative tests indicated in Ursery for\r\ndetermining the civil/criminal nature of a proceeding are: (1)\r\nwhether Congress has expressed its intention in the relevant\r\nstatute as to the nature of the proceeding, or (2) even if there is\r\nan expression in the statute that it is civil in nature, whether\r\nthere is \"the clearest proof\" that the resulting imposition is \"so\r\npunitive either in purpose or effect\"  as to require the conclusion\r\nthat the measure is punitive rather than remedial in nature.  518\r\nU.S. at 289 n.3.\r\nBoth of these tests militate against appellant's\r\nposition.  Undoubtedly, 28 U.S.C.  1826 evinces Congress's\r\nintention that the proceedings promoted thereunder be civil in\r\nnature.  Similarly, far from a showing that the civil incarceration\r\nin this case presented \"clear proof\" of a punitive purpose or\r\neffect, the very fact that appellant's civil imprisonment was\r\nsubject to his control and choice manifests an unmistakable\r\ndistinction from the imposition of a criminal sanction, in which\r\nthe defendant lacks any decisive control as to the duration of his\r\npunishment.  See Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 368; United States v.\r\nMichaud, 928 F.2d 13, 15 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nFor the reasons stated above we reject appellant's double\r\njeopardy challenge.\r\n             III.  Due Process Allegations\r\nA.  Void for vagueness arguments\r\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires\r\nthat a criminal statute be found \"unconstitutionally vague if it\r\n'fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that\r\nhis contemplated conduct is forbidden by [the] statute.'\"  UnitedStates v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617 (1954); see also United Statesv. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1178 (1st Cir. 1990).  The criminal\r\nstatute in question, 18 U.S.C.  401(3), authorizes a court \"to\r\npunish by fine or imprisonment . . . [d]isobedience or resistance\r\nto its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"\r\nBecause no First Amendment concerns are implicated in this appeal,\r\nthe vagueness challenge is limited by the framework of the specific\r\nfacts in the record of the case.  See Village of Hoffman Estates v.\r\nFlipeside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 495 n.7 (1982);\r\nUnited States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental Service,\r\nInc., 874 F.2d 20, 32 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Cintolo,\r\n818 F.2d 980, 996 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\nThe question before us is thus whether a person of\r\nordinary intelligence in appellant's situation would have\r\nunderstood that refusing to testify before the grand jury in the\r\nface of a direct written and oral order of the district judge,\r\nwould constitute \"disobedience or resistance\" to a court's \"lawful\r\nwrit, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"  The answer to\r\nthis question is self-evident.  Both the facts of this case and the\r\nplain language of  401(3) lead inexorably to this conclusion. \r\nSee Robinson v. Berman, 594 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1979).  Moreover,\r\nthe statute's \"application to [the] particular conduct\" at issue\r\nhere -- refusal to comply with a court order to testify -- is a\r\nnotoriously known circumstance, well within the general knowledge\r\nof the public by reason of the numerous prior criminal prosecutions\r\nin this district, this circuit, and throughout the country.  Seeid.  Lastly, the \"unusually high\" scienter requirement that must be\r\nmet by the government in a criminal contempt prosecution, namely\r\nthat defendant \"willfully\" disobeyed the order, see note 1,\r\n\"mitigates any vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy\r\nof notice to the defendant[,] that his conduct is prescribed.\"  Bay\r\nState Ambulance, 874 F.2d at 33.\r\nAppellant nevertheless argues that the statute is unclear\r\nbecause it only criminalizes violations of \"lawful\" orders, a\r\ncondition which he claims is difficult to identify.  Appellant\r\nmakes no claim either now or previously that this particular order\r\nis either unlawful or unclear, as well he cannot.  Consequently,\r\nhis objection is outside the scope of this Court's \"as-applied\"\r\nreview.  See Cintolo, 818 F.2d at 996.  This is particularly the\r\ncase when one considers that court orders carry an initial\r\npresumption of validity which must be subjected to challenge\r\nthrough established procedures, not through unilateral\r\nnoncompliance.  The limited exceptions to this rule, for example,\r\nwhere a court issues an order clearly without jurisdiction over the\r\nparties or subject matter, or that is \"patently unconstitutional\"\r\nor \"transparently invalid\" on its face, see In the Matter of the\r\nProvidence Journal Co., 820 F.2d 1342, 1347-48 (1st Cir. 1986),\r\nobviously do not apply to the present circumstances.\r\nThe allegations regarding vagueness are not well taken.\r\nB.  The Alleged Lack of Fair Warning\r\nIn a related variation of the void-for-vagueness\r\nargument, appellant contends that he was not given \"fair warning\"\r\nthat disobedience of the court order to testify exposed him to\r\npotential criminal prosecution and punishment over and beyond the\r\ncivil sanctions alluded to in the May 7 and 20, 1993 orders.  This,\r\nhe claims, constitutes a due process violation.  We understand\r\nappellant to claim that he was unaware that by committing a civil\r\ncontempt he was also engaging in a criminal one, and that there was\r\na duty on the part of someone, presumably the government, or\r\nperhaps the court, to advise him of this possibility before he\r\ncould be held criminally responsible for this  conduct.\r\nAppellant's brief is particularly scant in supporting\r\nthis novel theory.  We restate the age-old principle that ignorance\r\nof the law is not a defense to its violation.  See Cheek v. United\r\nStates, 498 U.S. 192, 199 (1991).  Such rare exceptions as exist to\r\nthis ancient and universal maxim, are patently inapplicable to the\r\npresent circumstances.  See United States v. Anzalone, 766 F.2d\r\n676, 678 (1st Cir. 1985); cf. Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S.\r\n135, 149 (1994) (acknowledging \"the venerable principle that\r\nignorance of the law generally is no defense to a criminal\r\ncharge\").  In particular, appellant's inherently tenuous position\r\nis weakened even further by the fact that he was assisted by\r\ncounsel at all relevant times.  The assistance of counsel, of\r\ncourse, is not required but merely serves to frame appellant's\r\nfallacious claim.\r\n    There is nothing unique about the law of criminal\r\ncontempt that sets it outside the standard established for the\r\nmajority of the criminal law that ignorance of its strictures does\r\nnot excuse noncompliance.  See United States v. Remini, 967 F.2d\r\n754, 758 (2d Cir.  1992).  There is furthermore nothing in the Due\r\nProcess Clause that requires a court to give notice that criminal\r\ncontempt charges may be brought after a witness is held in civil\r\ncontempt.  See United States v. Monteleone, 804 F.2d 1004, 1008\r\n(7th Cir. 1986); United States v. Petito, 671 F.2d 68, 73 (2d Cir.\r\n1982).  In this regard, In re Grand Jury Proceedings, Ortloff, 708\r\nF.2d 1455, 1458 (9th Cir. 1983), relied upon by appellant, is\r\ninapposite.\r\nFinally, we note that district judges may find it useful\r\nto warn a defendant explicitly that his refusal to comply with an\r\norder exposes him not only to civil contempt, but also to criminal\r\ncontempt.  After all, giving such warnings will only increase the\r\nlikelihood that the orders will be obeyed.  This practice is in no\r\nway inconsistent with our holding in this case, which is merely\r\nthat such warnings are not required by law.\r\nIV.  Allegation of Failure to Prove Lack of Willfulness\r\n               Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\r\n\nAppellant contends that his motion for acquittal should\r\nhave been granted because the Government failed to prove beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt his lack of good faith in refusing to comply with\r\nthe court's order to testify. The basis for this contention is a\r\nmotion filed by appellant's third consecutive counsel, seeking to\r\nvacate or suspend the order of contempt.\r\nThis motion was filed after appellant was found in\r\nviolation of the district court's order.  It is grounded on the\r\ncontention that although appellant had been granted use immunity,\r\nand thus could not validly claim a Fifth Amendment-based privilege\r\nbecause he had allegedly been the subject of an illegal wiretap and\r\nwas thus an \"aggrieved person\" under 18 U.S.C.  2510 et seq., he\r\nhad \"other valid grounds\" for remaining silent pursuant to In re\r\nLochiatto, 497 F.2d 803, 808 (1st Cir. 1974).  See also Gelbard v.\r\nUnited States, 408 U.S. 41, 59 (1972).\r\nAppellant concedes that he failed to raise this matter\r\nbefore the district judge as a defense to the issuance of the\r\nfinding of contempt and the issuance of the civil contempt order.\r\nAppellant nevertheless claims that he had not waived this right and\r\ncould raise this issue as a defense to the criminal contempt charge\r\nunder Gelbard.\r\nThe record in this case establishes that conversations\r\nattributed to appellant were intercepted pursuant to court-\r\nauthorized electronic surveillance.  Appellant and his then counsel\r\nof record were informed of this matter prior to the May 20, 1993\r\nhearing.  Although entitled to receive the supporting documentation\r\nrelated to this electronic surveillance, appellant never requested\r\nit, apparently as part of a negotiated agreement with the\r\nGovernment which, in exchange, allowed him to be released on his\r\nown recognizance for two weeks after his being found in civil\r\ncontempt, rather than the usual 48 hours, which is the practice in\r\nthe District of Massachusetts. \r\nThe motion giving rise to the present controversy was\r\nfiled on June 3, 1993, the day before appellant was due to report\r\nto the U.S. Marshal to commence his civil contempt detention.  This\r\nwas the first time that appellant claimed entitlement to Lochiattorights.  A hearing was held that same day before the judge who\r\nissued both the immunity and civil contempt orders.  After\r\nconsidering the argument of counsel, the court rejected appellant's\r\ncontention that he had not made a knowing waiver of his rights as\r\nto Lochiatto discovery, and refused to reopen or reconsider the\r\ncivil contempt order. Nevertheless, although appellant was\r\nincarcerated, the Government produced the electronic surveillance\r\nmaterials to which he would have been entitled under Lochiatto.  No\r\nchallenge of any nature was ever made to the validity of the\r\nwiretap, nor was an appeal taken from the civil contempt order or\r\nthe court's denial of the motion to vacate or suspend the same.\r\nAppellant next raised the Lochiatto issue at the time of\r\nhis criminal contempt trial, when he again claimed that the civil\r\ncontempt order was invalid because Lochiatto had not been complied\r\nwith.  The district judge again ruled that this matter had to be\r\nraised before the contempt order issued, and not having been timely\r\nraised, was considered waived.  Thereafter the district court ruled\r\nthat the Government had met its burden of proving that appellant\r\nacted knowingly and willfully in disobeying its order.  As part of\r\nthis finding, the court determined that good faith (or the lack\r\nthereof) was only one factor to be weighed in determining whether\r\nthe element of willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt had been met.\r\nIn Lochiatto, a witness before the grand jury who had\r\nbeen granted use immunity refused to testify, alleging that the\r\ninquiry of the government was the \"fruit\" of an illegal wiretap. \r\nSee 497 F.2d at 805.  In this case, the government admitted the\r\nexistence of electronic surveillance but asserted that all\r\ninformation brought before the grand jury was the product of court-\r\nauthorized wiretaps.  The district court rejected the various \r\nLochiatto's defendants request for discovery of the supporting\r\ndocumentation and proceeded to hold them in civil contempt.  We\r\nreversed this ruling, holding that upon a proper request, the\r\nwitness was entitled to inspect the appropriate documentation\r\nsurrounding the issuance of the wiretap, e.g., the application, the\r\nsupporting affidavits, the court order itself, and the government\r\naffidavit indicating the length of time the surveillance was\r\nconducted.\r\nThe distinction between Lochiatto and the present\r\nsituation is apparent.  To begin with, the Lochiattos made a timely\r\nrequest for the wiretap information before the district court found\r\nthem to be in contempt.  Although we will not attempt to delineate\r\nall possible scenarios regarding waiver of rights, the present\r\ncircumstances spell out a waiver of Lochiatto rights not only\r\nbecause appellant failed to request disclosure of the wiretap\r\ninformation before the contempt ruling, but also because appellant\r\ntook this action as a result of a bargain with the government in\r\nexchange for which he was allowed additional time to report for his\r\ncivil incarceration.  There is no question that appellant made a\r\nconscious choice not to contest the issue.\r\n A further significant difference from Lochiatto lies in\r\nthe action taken by the Lochiattos upon their being found in\r\ncontempt of the court's order.  They did not sit back in defiance,\r\nbut instead followed orderly procedure, appealed, and were thus\r\nable to reverse the ruling because they had saved their rights.  In\r\nthe present case not only did appellant fail to do the latter, but,\r\neven after receiving the discovery to which he would have been\r\nentitled, he did nothing except sit in jail in contumacious\r\nresistance.  He did not in any legal manner challenge the\r\nlawfulness of the order by seeking its revocation on appeal.  He\r\nwaited until criminal charges were brought and then attempted to\r\ncollaterally question the legitimacy of the civil contempt finding,\r\non grounds already rejected in that prior proceeding.  Nothing in\r\nLochiatto or any other case that we are aware of supports his\r\nposition.\r\nWe should further add that appellant cites no cases in\r\nsupport of his contention that proof of the absence of a good faith\r\nbasis for refusing to comply with a court order is a separate\r\nelement of criminal contempt.  In fact the cases are to the\r\ncontrary.  See, e.g., Remini, 967 F.2d at 757-58 (Good faith\r\nmisunderstanding of the law, including good faith reliance on the\r\nadvice of counsel, is not a defense to a criminal contempt charge);\r\nMichaud, 928 F.2d at 15; United States v. Underwood, 880 F.2d 612,\r\n618 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Armstrong, 781 F.2d 700, 706\r\n(9th Cir. 1986); United States v. Rylander, 714 F.2d 996, 1003 (9th\r\nCir. 1983).  Additionally, the evidence in the record, when viewed\r\nin the light most favorable to the verdict, see United States v.\r\nAkinola, 985 F.2d 1105, 1109 (1st Cir. 1993), amply supports the\r\nfinding that appellant's refusal to comply with the May 7, 1993\r\norder to testify before the grand jury was not only willful, but\r\nclearly without any good-faith basis.\r\nAppellant's motion for acquittal was properly denied.\r\n V.  The Application of the Proper Sentencing Guideline\r\nAppellant was convicted of criminal contempt under 18\r\nU.S.C.  401.  There is no specific sentence mandated for this\r\noffense.  The applicable Guideline for this offense is provided by \r\n2J1.1, which directs that  2X5.1 be used.  That section in turn\r\ndirects the use of the guideline for the most analogous offense. \r\nThe district court concluded that the obstruction of justice\r\nguideline,  2J1.2, is the most analogous.  Appellant disagrees and\r\nespouses  2J1.5, which deals with non-appearing material\r\nwitnesses, as being the applicable provision. \r\nThe first issue Marquardo appears to raise is whether\r\nU.S.S.G.  2X5.1, which requires the court to apply the guideline\r\nfor 'the most analogous offense,' excludes, in a case of criminal\r\ncontempt for refusal to testify before a grand jury, a district\r\ncourt from turning to  2J1.2 (obstruction of justice) as the most\r\napt analogue.  To state the proposition is to reveal its frivolity. \r\nThe question of the most appropriate analogy is essentially a\r\nquestion of fact, at most a mixed question of law and fact, and we\r\ngive deference to the district court's factual determinations.  SeeUnited States v. Phath, 1998 WL 244746, at *3 (1st Cir. May 20,\r\n1998).\r\nThe evidence submitted to the trial court was to the\r\neffect that appellant was a bookmaker who was privy to evidence of\r\nthe extortion activities of members of the so-called Winter Hill\r\nGang.  This gang and its members were under investigation by the\r\nfederal grand jury before whom appellant ultimately refused to\r\ntestify regarding these extortion activities.  The district court\r\nfound that:\r\n     [t]his is not like a case involving\r\n     failure of a witness to comply with a\r\n     subpoena to testify at trial.  The refusal\r\n     of this defendant to answer a grand jury\r\n     inquiry to him about his knowledge of the\r\n     Winter Hill Gang interfered with grand\r\n     jury proceedings bearing upon organized\r\n     crime activities of large scope.\r\n\nBased on the record in this case we can perceive no error\r\nin this conclusion, much less clear error.  We might add that\r\nalthough this is a matter of first impression in this circuit,\r\nother courts of appeal have upheld the application of  2J1.2 to\r\ncriminal contempt convictions on similar findings.  See, e.g., \r\nUnited States v. Voss, 82 F.3d 1521, 1541 (10th Cir. 1996).\r\nAppellant's reliance on Underwood, 880 F.2d at 620, is\r\nmisplaced, for in suggesting in that case that  2J1.5 was more\r\nclosely analogous to that defendant's conduct, the Underwood panel\r\nobserved that the defendant \"did not intend to obstruct justice\"\r\nbut was afraid that the his testimony would be used against him in\r\na pending case of his own before the same district judge.  As\r\nsubsequent courts have concluded, the facts in Underwood made it \"a\r\nspecial case.\"  Remini, 967 F.2d at 760.  We reiterate that the\r\nquestion of which is the most appropriate analogy depends on the\r\nfacts of the case.  It follows that, in some cases, criminal\r\ncontempt findings might not be covered by  2J1.2 as \"obstruction\r\nof justice\" conduct.  On occasion, a district judge may find\r\nanother analogy more apt to the facts in the case at bar, and, if\r\nso, the choice will be reviewed for clear error.\r\nHere, however, the district court found that \"[Appellant]\r\nknew that his refusal to answer a question of the grand jury about\r\nhis association with the Winter Hill Gang . . . would have an\r\nadverse effect upon and would obstruct the grand jury proceedings.\" \r\nNothing further is required considering the standard of deference\r\nthat is due to a district court's decisions in a criminal contempt\r\nsetting, in which the trial judge is uniquely in a position to\r\nassess the circumstances of defendant's actions.  See Voss, 82 F.3d\r\nat 1531.\r\nWe have considered all other issues raised by appellant\r\nand find them lacking in merit.\r\nAppellant's appeal is dismissed and his conviction is\r\naffirmed.\r\n",

Appellant also challenges the validity of the criminal contempt statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401(3), alleging that it is unconstitutionally vague, claims that his motion for acquittal was improperly denied by the trial judge in that the government failed to prove his willfulness to commit the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and lastly, contends that he was improperly sentenced under the obstruction of justice guideline, &#167; 2J1.2, rather than the purportedly more analogous &#167; 2J1.5, which deals with failures to appear by a material witness.  We consider these issues seriatim, and ultimately conclude that the rulings of the district court should be affirmed in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Relevant Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1993, appellant was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury convened in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  On this occasion appellant declined to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Thereafter, the Government moved the district court for an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6002 et seq., granting appellant immunity and compelling his testimony.  This motion was granted, and an order issued to that effect on May 7, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 20, 1993, appellant was again summoned before the grand jury and a copy of the May 7th order was served upon him and his attorney.  Nevertheless, appellant refused to comply with the order and to give evidence before the grand jury.  On that same day, shortly after his refusal, a hearing was conducted before the district judge, at which time appellant again reiterated his refusal to comply with the May 7th order and to testify before the grand jury.  He was thereafter adjudged in civil contempt by the district judge and pursuant to the civil contempt statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1826, was committed to federal custody until such time as he obeyed the May 7th order, or until the expiration of the grand jury, whichever event occurred first.  The order granted appellant two weeks within which to report to the U.S. Marshal to start his confinement, and thus he actually commenced his detention on June 4, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As things would have it, the grand jury's commission expired on September 12, 1994, without the benefit of appellant's testimony.  Appellant thus remained in custody without purging his contempt from June 4, 1993, to September 11, 1994, when he was released from civil incarceration.  Approximately two years later, however, on May 7, 1996, another grand jury returned an indictment against appellant charging him with criminal contempt, for his failure to comply with the May 7, 1993 order in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that his prosecution was barred on double jeopardy, vagueness, and fair warning/due process grounds.  These contentions were rejected by the district court.  After a brief bench trial appellant was convicted on December 18, 1996, and thereafter was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment on March 25, 1997.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides that no person \"shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  V (emphasis supplied).  This provision protects persons against multiple prosecutions or punishments for the same offense.  See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nutshell, appellant argues that because he was \"punished\" by 17 months' incarceration pursuant to the civil contempt order issued May 20, 1993, he cannot be also punished criminally for the same offense.  See United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 273, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996).  This is an allegation that clearly misconstrues the distinction between civil and criminal contempt, as well as fails to take into account longstanding unmodified precedent that exists in this area of the law.  See, e.g., Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 368, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966);  Yates v. United States, 355 U.S. 66, 74, 78 S.Ct. 128, 2 L.Ed.2d 95 (1957);  United States v. Nightingale, 703 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1983).  Appellant was neither \"punished\" for his civil contempt, nor prosecuted for the \"same offense\" when he was later charged and convicted for criminal contempt, notwithstanding that both contempts arose out of the same operative facts.  This conclusion becomes clearly apparent when one considers the nature and purpose of civil versus criminal contempt, as well as the consequences that flow from a judicial finding in each case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of civil contempt is to coerce compliance with an order of the court.  See G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co., 639 F.2d 29, 40 (1st Cir.1980).  The subjects of the court's order have \"the keys [to their] prison in their own pockets.\"  Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 368, 86 S.Ct. 1531.   They can be incarcerated for no time, if there is compliance before custody commences;  for some time, if there is submission to the order after incarceration begins;  or for as long a time as the grand jury is extant, if there is unrepented contumacy.  In any event, it is totally clear that incarceration for civil contempt is not for the purpose of punishing recalcitrant respondents but rather is the modern \"persuasive\" tool that is used in substitution of the barbaric placing of stones on the subject's chest, which was formerly used to literally press the recipient into submission.  See J. Langbein, Torture and the Law of Proof 74-76 (1977);  see also L. Levy, The Origins of the Fifth Amendment 276-277 (1968).  Incarceration for civil contempt only seeks acquiescence to a court's order, not retribution for noncompliance with its command.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Criminal contempt, on the other hand, is used to punish disobedience with a judicial order, and thus vindicates the authority of the court.  G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 639 F.2d at 40.   This crime is completed when contumacious conduct has taken place, regardless of whether the subject later complies with the order he or she had earlier violated.  That is, once the subject of an order willfully refuses to meet the court's order, criminal contempt has been committed independently of whether this conduct receives the additional attention of the court by the issuance of a civil commitment order seeking compliance.  For example, in its May 20, 1993 order, the district judge in this case found appellant in \"willful failure to obey the Order\" of May 7, 1993, and directed his commitment to the custody of the Marshal until such time as he complied, or the grand jury's term expired, which ever occurred first.  The district judge granted appellant two weeks to report to begin his incarceration.  Had he complied with this order before he reported to the Marshal, the civil commitment would have become automatically ineffective, yet he would still have been subject to a criminal contempt charge because that offense was consummated once he willfully failed to comply with the May 7th order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is not limited to the difference in the purposes served by each, the first being remedial, the second being punitive.  Clearly, this differentiation emphasizes the crucial condition that only criminal contempt is an \"offense,\" which is the relevant language used by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  However, there are also variances in the technique and scope within which they traditionally operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although in the present appeal both the civil and criminal contempts arise within the context of criminal matters, this is neither a sine qua non nor probably its most common setting.  A frequent scenario for civil contempt situations arises as a result of the exercise of the courts' equity jurisdiction, in which the coercive tool is often periodic (daily, weekly, etc.) monetary fines, tailored to compensate the party aggrieved for the damages suffered as a result of the contumacious conduct of the noncomplying party.  See International Union v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994).  The payment of such civil fines by one party to another, a common technique used by courts not only to force obedience, but also to remedy the harm caused, emphasizes another basic distinction between civil and criminal contempt.  In the latter, what is sought, as in the case of all criminal charges, is the vindication of public rights.  Thus, if criminal fines are imposed in addition to or in substitution for incarceration, they cannot be used for the purpose of compensating an aggrieved party.  They are directed towards punishing the crime that has already been committed, and to act as a deterrent against future violations.  Because these criminal monetary penalties are not related to compensation, but are instead punitive, they need not be geared to the actual damages caused, and are only limited by the parameters of the sentencing discretion allowed for that crime.  On the other hand, a civil fine, which seeks to compensate the aggrieved party, must bear some relationship to the damages being suffered, and for this reason is considered remedial rather than punitive in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, civil incarceration must be tied to corrective measures, that is, the curing of the contumacy by compliance with the violated order.  Such is the present case.  Appellant's civil detention, which turned out to last 17 months by his choice, sought curative results, namely, compliance with the order.  By the time of his civil detention, appellant had already independently committed the crime for which he is presently charged and convicted;  namely, criminal contempt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  At that point he could no more turn back the clock on his actions than, for example, a robber could avoid being convicted of bank robbery by returning the loot to a bank he had robbed.  Or perhaps more on point, he is entitled to no more success in his present contention, than if he sought to raise a double jeopardy defense to criminal bank robbery charges after losing a civil law suit in which the bank sought the return of stolen money from appellant.  One proceeding takes place in a civil setting, while the other is criminal in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits sequential criminal prosecutions or sanctions.  It does not bar simultaneous or sequential civil and criminal proceedings even if they arise out of the same factual setting.  A civil contempt proceeding for the purpose of seeking compliance with an order of the court, whether it brings about the imposition of coercive, nonpunitive fines, and/or imprisonment subject to release by purging of the contempt, is not criminal in nature, see Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 371, 86 S.Ct. 1531, it is a civil proceeding to which jeopardy does not attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant recognizes in his brief the compelling force of the Supreme Court's decision in Yates, 355 U.S. 66, 78 S.Ct. 128, 2 L.Ed.2d 95, he argues that the holding in Yates must be tempered by the more recent one in United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 116 S.Ct. 2135.   In Yates, it was specifically ruled that given that \"[t]he civil and criminal [contempt] sentences served distinct purposes, the one [being] coercive, the other punitive and deterrent ... [,] that the same act may give rise to these distinct sanctions presents no double jeopardy problem,\" 355 U.S. at 73, 78 S.Ct. 128.   We are unable to find any support for appellant's position in Ursery, or for that matter, in any other case that we are aware of.  In fact, if anything, Ursery lends additional support to Yates on the point at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ursery deals with the double jeopardy effect of civil forfeiture proceedings on parallel or subsequent criminal processes arising out of the same operative facts leading to the civil forfeiture.  The Court's ultimate conclusion that civil forfeitures are \"neither 'punishment' nor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause,\" 518 U.S. at 292, 116 S.Ct. 2135, closely tracks the present situation as regards civil contempt, for this is exactly what we are ruling in this appeal.  Ursery, therefore, is not of much help to appellant's position.  Cf. United States v. Bajakajian, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998) (reiterating that the Double Jeopardy clause does not bar institution of civil forfeiture actions after criminal conviction, but holding that a criminal fine must be \"proportionate\" to the offense under the Excessive Fines clause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two alternative tests indicated in Ursery for determining the civil/criminal nature of a proceeding are:  (1) whether Congress has expressed its intention in the relevant statute as to the nature of the proceeding, or (2) even if there is an expression in the statute that it is civil in nature, whether there is \"the clearest proof\" that the resulting imposition is \"so punitive either in purpose or effect\" as to require the conclusion that the measure is punitive rather than remedial in nature.  518 U.S. at 289 n. 3, 116 S.Ct. 2135.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of these tests militate against appellant's position.  Undoubtedly, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1826 evinces Congress's intention that the proceedings promoted thereunder be civil in nature.  Similarly, far from a showing that the civil incarceration in this case presented \"clear proof\" of a punitive purpose or effect, the very fact that appellant's civil imprisonment was subject to his control and choice manifests an unmistakable distinction from the imposition of a criminal sanction, in which the defendant lacks any decisive control as to the duration of his punishment.  See Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 368, 86 S.Ct. 1531;  United States v. Michaud, 928 F.2d 13, 15 n. 1 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above we reject appellant's double jeopardy challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Due Process Allegations</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Void for vagueness arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal statute be found \"unconstitutionally vague if it 'fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by [the] statute.' \"  United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954);  see also United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1178 (1st Cir.1990).  The criminal statute in question, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401(3), authorizes a court \"to punish by fine or imprisonment ... [d]isobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"   Because no First Amendment concerns are implicated in this appeal, the vagueness challenge is limited by the framework of the specific facts in the record of the case.  See Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 495 n. 7, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982);  United States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp. Rental Service, Inc., 874 F.2d 20, 32 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 996 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question before us is thus whether a person of ordinary intelligence in appellant's situation would have understood that refusing to testify before the grand jury in the face of a direct written and oral order of the district judge, would constitute \"disobedience or resistance\" to a court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"   The answer to this question is self-evident.  Both the facts of this case and the plain language of &#167; 401(3) lead inexorably to this conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Robinson v. Berman, 594 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1979).  Moreover, the statute's \"application to [the] particular conduct\" at issue here--refusal to comply with a court order to testify--is a notoriously known circumstance, well within the general knowledge of the public by reason of the numerous prior criminal prosecutions in this district, this circuit, and throughout the country.  See id.   Lastly, the \"unusually high\" scienter requirement that must be met by the government in a criminal contempt prosecution, namely that defendant \"willfully\" disobeyed the order, see note 1, \"mitigates any vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the defendant[,] that his conduct is prescribed.\"  Bay State Ambulance, 874 F.2d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nevertheless argues that the statute is unclear because it only criminalizes violations of \"lawful\" orders, a condition which he claims is difficult to identify.  Appellant makes no claim either now or previously that this particular order is either unlawful or unclear, as well he cannot.  Consequently, his objection is outside the scope of this Court's \"as-applied\" review.  See Cintolo, 818 F.2d at 996.   This is particularly the case when one considers that court orders carry an initial presumption of validity which must be subjected to challenge through established procedures, not through unilateral noncompliance.  The limited exceptions to this rule, for example, where a court issues an order clearly without jurisdiction over the parties or subject matter, or that is \"patently unconstitutional\" or \"transparently invalid\" on its face, see In the Matter of the Providence Journal Co., 820 F.2d 1342, 1347-48 (1st Cir.1986), obviously do not apply to the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations regarding vagueness are not well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Alleged Lack of Fair Warning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related variation of the void-for-vagueness argument, appellant contends that he was not given \"fair warning\" that disobedience of the court order to testify exposed him to potential criminal prosecution and punishment over and beyond the civil sanctions alluded to in the May 7 and 20, 1993 orders.  This, he claims, constitutes a due process violation.  We understand appellant to claim that he was unaware that by committing a civil contempt he was also engaging in a criminal one, and that there was a duty on the part of someone, presumably the government, or perhaps the court, to advise him of this possibility before he could be held criminally responsible for this conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's brief is particularly scant in supporting this novel theory.  We restate the age-old principle that ignorance of the law is not a defense to its violation.  See Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 199, 111 S.Ct. 604, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991).  Such rare exceptions as exist to this ancient and universal maxim,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are patently inapplicable to the present circumstances.  See United States v. Anzalone, 766 F.2d 676, 678 (1st Cir.1985);  cf.  Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 149, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994) (acknowledging \"the venerable principle that ignorance of the law generally is no defense to a criminal charge\").  In particular, appellant's inherently tenuous position is weakened even further by the fact that he was assisted by counsel at all relevant times.  The assistance of counsel, of course, is not required but merely serves to frame appellant's fallacious claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing unique about the law of criminal contempt that sets it outside the standard established for the majority of the criminal law that ignorance of its strictures does not excuse noncompliance.  See United States v. Remini, 967 F.2d 754, 758 (2d Cir.1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  There is furthermore nothing in the Due Process Clause that requires a court to give notice that criminal contempt charges may be brought after a witness is held in civil contempt.  See United States v. Monteleone, 804 F.2d 1004, 1008 (7th Cir.1986);  United States v. Petito, 671 F.2d 68, 73 (2d Cir.1982).  In this regard, In re Grand Jury Proceedings, Ortloff, 708 F.2d 1455, 1458 (9th Cir.1983), relied upon by appellant, is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that district judges may find it useful to warn a defendant explicitly that his refusal to comply with an order exposes him not only to civil contempt, but also to criminal contempt.  After all, giving such warnings will only increase the likelihood that the orders will be obeyed.  This practice is in no way inconsistent with our holding in this case, which is merely that such warnings are not required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>IV. Allegation of Failure to Prove Lack of Willfulness</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that his motion for acquittal should have been granted because the Government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his lack of good faith in refusing to comply with the court's order to testify.  The basis for this contention is a motion filed by appellant's third consecutive counsel, seeking to vacate or suspend the order of contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This motion was filed after appellant was found in violation of the district court's order.  It is grounded on the contention that although appellant had been granted use immunity, and thus could not validly claim a Fifth Amendment-based privilege because he had allegedly been the subject of an illegal wiretap and was thus an \"aggrieved person\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510 et seq., he had \"other valid grounds\" for remaining silent pursuant to In re Lochiatto, 497 F.2d 803, 808 (1st Cir.1974).  See also Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 59, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant concedes that he failed to raise this matter before the district judge as a defense to the issuance of the finding of contempt and the issuance of the civil contempt order.  Appellant nevertheless claims that he had not waived this right and could raise this issue as a defense to the criminal contempt charge under Gelbard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case establishes that conversations attributed to appellant were intercepted pursuant to court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Appellant and his then counsel of record were informed of this matter prior to the May 20, 1993 hearing.  Although entitled to receive the supporting documentation related to this electronic surveillance, appellant never requested it, apparently as part of a negotiated agreement with the Government which, in exchange, allowed him to be released on his own recognizance for two weeks after his being found in civil contempt, rather than the usual 48 hours, which is the practice in the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion giving rise to the present controversy was filed on June 3, 1993, the day before appellant was due to report to the U.S. Marshal to commence his civil contempt detention.  This was the first time that appellant claimed entitlement to Lochiatto rights.  A hearing was held that same day before the judge who issued both the immunity and civil contempt orders.  After considering the argument of counsel, the court rejected appellant's contention that he had not made a knowing waiver of his rights as to Lochiatto discovery, and refused to reopen or reconsider the civil contempt order.  Nevertheless, although appellant was incarcerated, the Government produced the electronic surveillance materials to which he would have been entitled under Lochiatto.   No challenge of any nature was ever made to the validity of the wiretap, nor was an appeal taken from the civil contempt order or the court's denial of the motion to vacate or suspend the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next raised the Lochiatto issue at the time of his criminal contempt trial, when he again claimed that the civil contempt order was invalid because Lochiatto had not been complied with.  The district judge again ruled that this matter had to be raised before the contempt order issued, and not having been timely raised, was considered waived.  Thereafter the district court ruled that the Government had met its burden of proving that appellant acted knowingly and willfully in disobeying its order.  As part of this finding, the court determined that good faith (or the lack thereof) was only one factor to be weighed in determining whether the element of willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt had been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lochiatto, a witness before the grand jury who had been granted use immunity refused to testify, alleging that the inquiry of the government was the \"fruit\" of an illegal wiretap.  See 497 F.2d at 805.   In this case, the government admitted the existence of electronic surveillance but asserted that all information brought before the grand jury was the product of court-authorized wiretaps.  The district court rejected the various Lochiatto's defendants request for discovery of the supporting documentation and proceeded to hold them in civil contempt.  We reversed this ruling, holding that upon a proper request, the witness was entitled to inspect the appropriate documentation surrounding the issuance of the wiretap, e.g., the application, the supporting affidavits, the court order itself, and the government affidavit indicating the length of time the surveillance was conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between Lochiatto and the present situation is apparent.  To begin with, the Lochiattos made a timely request for the wiretap information before the district court found them to be in contempt.  Although we will not attempt to delineate all possible scenarios regarding waiver of rights, the present circumstances spell out a waiver of Lochiatto rights not only because appellant failed to request disclosure of the wiretap information before the contempt ruling, but also because appellant took this action as a result of a bargain with the government in exchange for which he was allowed additional time to report for his civil incarceration.  There is no question that appellant made a conscious choice not to contest the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further significant difference from Lochiatto lies in the action taken by the Lochiattos upon their being found in contempt of the court's order.  They did not sit back in defiance, but instead followed orderly procedure, appealed, and were thus able to reverse the ruling because they had saved their rights.  In the present case not only did appellant fail to do the latter, but, even after receiving the discovery to which he would have been entitled, he did nothing except sit in jail in contumacious resistance.  He did not in any legal manner challenge the lawfulness of the order by seeking its revocation on appeal.  He waited until criminal charges were brought and then attempted to collaterally question the legitimacy of the civil contempt finding, on grounds already rejected in that prior proceeding.  Nothing in Lochiatto or any other case that we are aware of supports his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should further add that appellant cites no cases in support of his contention that proof of the absence of a good faith basis for refusing to comply with a court order is a separate element of criminal contempt.  In fact the cases are to the contrary.  See, e.g., Remini, 967 F.2d at 757-58 (Good faith misunderstanding of the law, including good faith reliance on the advice of counsel, is not a defense to a criminal contempt charge);  Michaud, 928 F.2d at 15;  United States v. Underwood, 880 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v. Armstrong, 781 F.2d 700, 706 (9th Cir.1986);  United States v. Rylander, 714 F.2d 996, 1003 (9th Cir.1983).  Additionally, the evidence in the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, see United States v. Akinola, 985 F.2d 1105, 1109 (1st Cir.1993), amply supports the finding that appellant's refusal to comply with the May 7, 1993 order to testify before the grand jury was not only willful, but clearly without any good-faith basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's motion for acquittal was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>V. The Application of the Proper Sentencing Guideline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was convicted of criminal contempt under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401.  There is no specific sentence mandated for this offense.  The applicable Guideline for this offense is provided by &#167; 2J1.1, which directs that &#167; 2X5.1 be used.  That section in turn directs the use of the guideline for the most analogous offense.  The district court concluded that the obstruction of justice guideline, &#167; 2J1.2, is the most analogous.  Appellant disagrees and espouses &#167; 2J1.5, which deals with non-appearing material witnesses, as being the applicable provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue Marquardo appears to raise is whether U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X5.1, which requires the court to apply the guideline for \"the most analogous offense,\" excludes, in a case of criminal contempt for refusal to testify before a grand jury, a district court from turning to &#167; 2J1.2 (obstruction of justice) as the most apt analogue.  To state the proposition is to reveal its frivolity.  The question of the most appropriate analogy is essentially a question of fact, at most a mixed question of law and fact, and we give deference to the district court's factual determinations.  See United States v. Phath, 144 F.3d 146, 149 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence submitted to the trial court was to the effect that appellant was a bookmaker who was privy to evidence of the extortion activities of members of the so-called Winter Hill Gang.  This gang and its members were under investigation by the federal grand jury before whom appellant ultimately refused to testify regarding these extortion activities.  The district court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>[t]his is not like a case involving failure of a witness to comply with a subpoena to testify at trial.  The refusal of this defendant to answer a grand jury inquiry to him about his knowledge of the Winter Hill Gang interfered with grand jury proceedings bearing upon organized crime activities of large scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record in this case we can perceive no error in this conclusion, much less clear error.  We might add that although this is a matter of first impression in this circuit, other courts of appeal have upheld the application of &#167; 2J1.2 to criminal contempt convictions on similar findings.  See, e.g., United States v. Voss, 82 F.3d 1521, 1531 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's reliance on Underwood, 880 F.2d at 620, is misplaced, for in suggesting in that case that &#167; 2J1.5 was more closely analogous to that defendant's conduct, the Underwood panel observed that the defendant \"did not intend to obstruct justice\" but was afraid that the his testimony would be used against him in a pending case of his own before the same district judge.  As subsequent courts have concluded, the facts in Underwood made it \"a special case.\"  Remini, 967 F.2d at 760.   We reiterate that the question of which is the most appropriate analogy depends on the facts of the case.  It follows that, in some cases, criminal contempt findings might not be covered by &#167; 2J1.2 as \"obstruction of justice\" conduct.  On occasion, a district judge may find another analogy more apt to the facts in the case at bar, and, if so, the choice will be reviewed for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the district court found that \"[Appellant] knew that his refusal to answer a question of the grand jury about his association with the Winter Hill Gang ... would have an adverse effect upon and would obstruct the grand jury proceedings.\"   Nothing further is required considering the standard of deference that is due to a district court's decisions in a criminal contempt setting, in which the trial judge is uniquely in a position to assess the circumstances of defendant's actions.  See Voss, 82 F.3d at 1531.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all other issues raised by appellant and find them lacking in merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's appeal is dismissed and his conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We express no opinion as to whether the violation of an order giving rise to a finding of civil contempt is necessarily also criminal contempt.

Appellant also challenges the validity of the criminal contempt statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401(3), alleging that it is unconstitutionally vague, claims that his motion for acquittal was improperly denied by the trial judge in that the government failed to prove his willfulness to commit the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and lastly, contends that he was improperly sentenced under the obstruction of justice guideline, &#167; 2J1.2, rather than the purportedly more analogous &#167; 2J1.5, which deals with failures to appear by a material witness.  We consider these issues seriatim, and ultimately conclude that the rulings of the district court should be affirmed in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Relevant Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1993, appellant was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury convened in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  On this occasion appellant declined to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Thereafter, the Government moved the district court for an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 6002 et seq., granting appellant immunity and compelling his testimony.  This motion was granted, and an order issued to that effect on May 7, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 20, 1993, appellant was again summoned before the grand jury and a copy of the May 7th order was served upon him and his attorney.  Nevertheless, appellant refused to comply with the order and to give evidence before the grand jury.  On that same day, shortly after his refusal, a hearing was conducted before the district judge, at which time appellant again reiterated his refusal to comply with the May 7th order and to testify before the grand jury.  He was thereafter adjudged in civil contempt by the district judge and pursuant to the civil contempt statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1826, was committed to federal custody until such time as he obeyed the May 7th order, or until the expiration of the grand jury, whichever event occurred first.  The order granted appellant two weeks within which to report to the U.S. Marshal to start his confinement, and thus he actually commenced his detention on June 4, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As things would have it, the grand jury's commission expired on September 12, 1994, without the benefit of appellant's testimony.  Appellant thus remained in custody without purging his contempt from June 4, 1993, to September 11, 1994, when he was released from civil incarceration.  Approximately two years later, however, on May 7, 1996, another grand jury returned an indictment against appellant charging him with criminal contempt, for his failure to comply with the May 7, 1993 order in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that his prosecution was barred on double jeopardy, vagueness, and fair warning/due process grounds.  These contentions were rejected by the district court.  After a brief bench trial appellant was convicted on December 18, 1996, and thereafter was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment on March 25, 1997.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides that no person \"shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant was neither \"punished\" for his civil contempt, nor prosecuted for the \"same offense\" when he was later charged and convicted for criminal contempt, notwithstanding that both contempts arose out of the same operative facts.  This conclusion becomes clearly apparent when one considers the nature and purpose of civil versus criminal contempt, as well as the consequences that flow from a judicial finding in each case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of civil contempt is to coerce compliance with an order of the court.  See G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"386218\"><a href=\"/opinion/386218/g-c-merriam-co-v-webster-dictionary-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1980).  The subjects of the court's order have \"the keys [to their] prison in their own pockets.\"  Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 368, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107248\"><a href=\"/opinion/107248/shillitani-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1531</span></a></span>.   They can be incarcerated for no time, if there is compliance before custody commences;  for some time, if there is submission to the order after incarceration begins;  or for as long a time as the grand jury is extant, if there is unrepented contumacy.  In any event, it is totally clear that incarceration for civil contempt is not for the purpose of punishing recalcitrant respondents but rather is the modern \"persuasive\" tool that is used in substitution of the barbaric placing of stones on the subject's chest, which was formerly used to literally press the recipient into submission.  See J. Langbein, Torture and the Law of Proof 74-76 (1977);  see also L. Levy, The Origins of the Fifth Amendment 276-277 (1968).  Incarceration for civil contempt only seeks acquiescence to a court's order, not retribution for noncompliance with its command.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Criminal contempt, on the other hand, is used to punish disobedience with a judicial order, and thus vindicates the authority of the court.  G. &amp; C. Merriam Co., 639 F.2d at 40.   This crime is completed when contumacious conduct has taken place, regardless of whether the subject later complies with the order he or she had earlier violated.  That is, once the subject of an order willfully refuses to meet the court's order, criminal contempt has been committed independently of whether this conduct receives the additional attention of the court by the issuance of a civil commitment order seeking compliance.  For example, in its May 20, 1993 order, the district judge in this case found appellant in \"willful failure to obey the Order\" of May 7, 1993, and directed his commitment to the custody of the Marshal until such time as he complied, or the grand jury's term expired, which ever occurred first.  The district judge granted appellant two weeks to report to begin his incarceration.  Had he complied with this order before he reported to the Marshal, the civil commitment would have become automatically ineffective, yet he would still have been subject to a criminal contempt charge because that offense was consummated once he willfully failed to comply with the May 7th order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is not limited to the difference in the purposes served by each, the first being remedial, the second being punitive.  Clearly, this differentiation emphasizes the crucial condition that only criminal contempt is an \"offense,\" which is the relevant language used by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  However, there are also variances in the technique and scope within which they traditionally operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although in the present appeal both the civil and criminal contempts arise within the context of criminal matters, this is neither a sine qua non nor probably its most common setting.  A frequent scenario for civil contempt situations arises as a result of the exercise of the courts' equity jurisdiction, in which the coercive tool is often periodic (daily, weekly, etc.) monetary fines, tailored to compensate the party aggrieved for the damages suffered as a result of the contumacious conduct of the noncomplying party.  See International Union v. Bagwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117872\"><a href=\"/opinion/117872/mine-workers-v-bagwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117872\"><a href=\"/opinion/117872/mine-workers-v-bagwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2552</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117872\"><a href=\"/opinion/117872/mine-workers-v-bagwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span> (1994).  The payment of such civil fines by one party to another, a common technique used by courts not only to force obedience, but also to remedy the harm caused, emphasizes another basic distinction between civil and criminal contempt.  In the latter, what is sought, as in the case of all criminal charges, is the vindication of public rights.  Thus, if criminal fines are imposed in addition to or in substitution for incarceration, they cannot be used for the purpose of compensating an aggrieved party.  They are directed towards punishing the crime that has already been committed, and to act as a deterrent against future violations.  Because these criminal monetary penalties are not related to compensation, but are instead punitive, they need not be geared to the actual damages caused, and are only limited by the parameters of the sentencing discretion allowed for that crime.  On the other hand, a civil fine, which seeks to compensate the aggrieved party, must bear some relationship to the damages being suffered, and for this reason is considered remedial rather than punitive in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, civil incarceration must be tied to corrective measures, that is, the curing of the contumacy by compliance with the violated order.  Such is the present case.  Appellant's civil detention, which turned out to last 17 months by his choice, sought curative results, namely, compliance with the order.  By the time of his civil detention, appellant had already independently committed the crime for which he is presently charged and convicted;  namely, criminal contempt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  At that point he could no more turn back the clock on his actions than, for example, a robber could avoid being convicted of bank robbery by returning the loot to a bank he had robbed.  Or perhaps more on point, he is entitled to no more success in his present contention, than if he sought to raise a double jeopardy defense to criminal bank robbery charges after losing a civil law suit in which the bank sought the return of stolen money from appellant.  One proceeding takes place in a civil setting, while the other is criminal in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits sequential criminal prosecutions or sanctions.  It does not bar simultaneous or sequential civil and criminal proceedings even if they arise out of the same factual setting.  A civil contempt proceeding for the purpose of seeking compliance with an order of the court, whether it brings about the imposition of coercive, nonpunitive fines, and/or imprisonment subject to release by purging of the contempt, is not criminal in nature, see Shillitani, 384 U.S. at 371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107248\"><a href=\"/opinion/107248/shillitani-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ursery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2135</span></a></span>.   In Yates, it was specifically ruled that given that \"[t]he civil and criminal [contempt] sentences served distinct purposes, the one [being] coercive, the other punitive and deterrent ... [,] that the same act may give rise to these distinct sanctions presents no double jeopardy problem,\" 355 U.S. at 73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105580\"><a href=\"/opinion/105580/yates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>.   We are unable to find any support for appellant's position in Ursery, or for that matter, in any other case that we are aware of.  In fact, if anything, Ursery lends additional support to Yates on the point at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ursery deals with the double jeopardy effect of civil forfeiture proceedings on parallel or subsequent criminal processes arising out of the same operative facts leading to the civil forfeiture.  The Court's ultimate conclusion that civil forfeitures are \"neither 'punishment' nor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause,\" 518 U.S. at 292, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2135</span></a></span>, closely tracks the present situation as regards civil contempt, for this is exactly what we are ruling in this appeal.  Ursery, therefore, is not of much help to appellant's position.  Cf. United States v.

Undoubtedly, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1826 evinces Congress's intention that the proceedings promoted thereunder be civil in nature.  Similarly, far from a showing that the civil incarceration in this case presented \"clear proof\" of a punitive purpose or effect, the very fact that appellant's civil imprisonment was subject to his control and choice manifests an unmistakable distinction from the imposition of a criminal sanction, in which the defendant lacks any decisive control as to the duration of his punishment.

Both the facts of this case and the plain language of &#167; 401(3) lead inexorably to this conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Robinson v. Berman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364030\"><a href=\"/opinion/364030/earle-r-robinson-v-louis-berman/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1979).  Moreover, the statute's \"application to [the] particular conduct\" at issue here--refusal to comply with a court order to testify--is a notoriously known circumstance, well within the general knowledge of the public by reason of the numerous prior criminal prosecutions in this district, this circuit, and throughout the country.  See id.   Lastly, the \"unusually high\" scienter requirement that must be met by the government in a criminal contempt prosecution, namely that defendant \"willfully\" disobeyed the order, see note 1, \"mitigates any vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the defendant[,] that his conduct is prescribed.\"  Bay State Ambulance, 874 F.2d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nevertheless argues that the statute is unclear because it only criminalizes violations of \"lawful\" orders, a condition which he claims is difficult to identify.  Appellant makes no claim either now or previously that this particular order is either unlawful or unclear, as well he cannot.  Consequently, his objection is outside the scope of this Court's \"as-applied\" review.  See Cintolo, 818 F.2d at 996.   This is particularly the case when one considers that court orders carry an initial presumption of validity which must be subjected to challenge through established procedures, not through unilateral noncompliance.  The limited exceptions to this rule, for example, where a court issues an order clearly without jurisdiction over the parties or subject matter, or that is \"patently unconstitutional\" or \"transparently invalid\" on its face, see In the Matter of the Providence Journal Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489896\"><a href=\"/opinion/489896/in-the-matter-of-application-to-adjudge-the-providence-journal-company-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span>, 1347-48 (1st Cir.1986), obviously do not apply to the present circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations regarding vagueness are not well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

This, he claims, constitutes a due process violation.  We understand appellant to claim that he was unaware that by committing a civil contempt he was also engaging in a criminal one, and that there was a duty on the part of someone, presumably the government, or perhaps the court, to advise him of this possibility before he could be held criminally responsible for this conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's brief is particularly scant in supporting this novel theory.

In particular, appellant's inherently tenuous position is weakened even further by the fact that he was assisted by counsel at all relevant times.  The assistance of counsel, of course, is not required but merely serves to frame appellant's fallacious claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing unique about the law of criminal contempt that sets it outside the standard established for the majority of the criminal law that ignorance of its strictures does not excuse noncompliance.  See United States v.

After all, giving such warnings will only increase the likelihood that the orders will be obeyed.  This practice is in no way inconsistent with our holding in this case, which is merely that such warnings are not required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>IV. Allegation of Failure to Prove Lack of Willfulness</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that his motion for acquittal should have been granted because the Government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his lack of good faith in refusing to comply with the court's order to testify.  The basis for this contention is a motion filed by appellant's third consecutive counsel, seeking to vacate or suspend the order of contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This motion was filed after appellant was found in violation of the district court's order.  It is grounded on the contention that although appellant had been granted use immunity, and thus could not validly claim a Fifth Amendment-based privilege because he had allegedly been the subject of an illegal wiretap and was thus an \"aggrieved person\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510 et seq., he had \"other valid grounds\" for remaining silent pursuant to In re Lochiatto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"319512\"><a href=\"/opinion/319512/in-re-barbara-lochiatto-in-re-patrick-lochiatto-in-re-john-e-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 808 (1st Cir.1974).  See also Gelbard v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108596\"><a href=\"/opinion/108596/gelbard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108596\"><a href=\"/opinion/108596/gelbard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span> (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant concedes that he failed to raise this matter before the district judge as a defense to the issuance of the finding of contempt and the issuance of the civil contempt order.  Appellant nevertheless claims that he had not waived this right and could raise this issue as a defense to the criminal contempt charge under Gelbard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case establishes that conversations attributed to appellant were intercepted pursuant to court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Appellant and his then counsel of record were informed of this matter prior to the May 20, 1993 hearing.  Although entitled to receive the supporting documentation related to this electronic surveillance, appellant never requested it, apparently as part of a negotiated agreement with the Government which, in exchange, allowed him to be released on his own recognizance for two weeks after his being found in civil contempt, rather than the usual 48 hours, which is the practice in the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion giving rise to the present controversy was filed on June 3, 1993, the day before appellant was due to report to the U.S. Marshal to commence his civil contempt detention.  This was the first time that appellant claimed entitlement to Lochiatto rights.  A hearing was held that same day before the judge who issued both the immunity and civil contempt orders.  After considering the argument of counsel, the court rejected appellant's contention that he had not made a knowing waiver of his rights as to Lochiatto discovery, and refused to reopen or reconsider the civil contempt order.  Nevertheless, although appellant was incarcerated, the Government produced the electronic surveillance materials to which he would have been entitled under Lochiatto.   No challenge of any nature was ever made to the validity of the wiretap, nor was an appeal taken from the civil contempt order or the court's denial of the motion to vacate or suspend the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next raised the Lochiatto issue at the time of his criminal contempt trial, when he again claimed that the civil contempt order was invalid because Lochiatto had not been complied with.  The district judge again ruled that this matter had to be raised before the contempt order issued, and not having been timely raised, was considered waived.  Thereafter the district court ruled that the Government had met its burden of proving that appellant acted knowingly and willfully in disobeying its order.  As part of this finding, the court determined that good faith (or the lack thereof) was only one factor to be weighed in determining whether the element of willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt had been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lochiatto, a witness before the grand jury who had been granted use immunity refused to testify, alleging that the inquiry of the government was the \"fruit\" of an illegal wiretap.  See 497 F.2d at 805.   In this case, the government admitted the existence of electronic surveillance but asserted that all information brought before the grand jury was the product of court-authorized wiretaps.  The district court rejected the various Lochiatto's defendants request for discovery of the supporting documentation and proceeded to hold them in civil contempt.  We reversed this ruling, holding that upon a proper request, the witness was entitled to inspect the appropriate documentation surrounding the issuance of the wiretap, e.g., the application, the supporting affidavits, the court order itself, and the government affidavit indicating the length of time the surveillance was conducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between Lochiatto and the present situation is apparent.  To begin with, the Lochiattos made a timely request for the wiretap information before the district court found them to be in contempt.  Although we will not attempt to delineate all possible scenarios regarding waiver of rights, the present circumstances spell out a waiver of Lochiatto rights not only because appellant failed to request disclosure of the wiretap information before the contempt ruling, but also because appellant took this action as a result of a bargain with the government in exchange for which he was allowed additional time to report for his civil incarceration.  There is no question that appellant made a conscious choice not to contest the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further significant difference from Lochiatto lies in the action taken by the Lochiattos upon their being found in contempt of the court's order.  They did not sit back in defiance, but instead followed orderly procedure, appealed, and were thus able to reverse the ruling because they had saved their rights.  In the present case not only did appellant fail to do the latter, but, even after receiving the discovery to which he would have been entitled, he did nothing except sit in jail in contumacious resistance.  He did not in any legal manner challenge the lawfulness of the order by seeking its revocation on appeal.  He waited until criminal charges were brought and then attempted to collaterally question the legitimacy of the civil contempt finding, on grounds already rejected in that prior proceeding.  Nothing in Lochiatto or any other case that we are aware of supports his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should further add that appellant cites no cases in support of his contention that proof of the absence of a good faith basis for refusing to comply with a court order is a separate element of criminal contempt.  In fact the cases are to the contrary.  See, e.g., Remini, 967 F.2d at 757-58 (Good faith misunderstanding of the law, including good faith reliance on the advice of counsel, is not a defense to a criminal contempt charge);  Michaud, 928 F.2d at 15;  United States v. Underwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526738\"><a href=\"/opinion/526738/united-states-v-peter-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 618 (1st Cir.1989);  United States v.

Additionally, the evidence in the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, see United States v. Akinola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600348\"><a href=\"/opinion/600348/united-states-v-michael-idowu-tunde-akinola/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span>, 1109 (1st Cir.1993), amply supports the finding that appellant's refusal to comply with the May 7, 1993 order to testify before the grand jury was not only willful, but clearly without any good-faith basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's motion for acquittal was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>V. The Application of the Proper Sentencing Guideline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was convicted of criminal contempt under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 401.  There is no specific sentence mandated for this offense.  The applicable Guideline for this offense is provided by &#167; 2J1.1, which directs that &#167; 2X5.1 be used.  That section in turn directs the use of the guideline for the most analogous offense.  The district court concluded that the obstruction of justice guideline, &#167; 2J1.2, is the most analogous.  Appellant disagrees and espouses &#167; 2J1.5, which deals with non-appearing material witnesses, as being the applicable provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue Marquardo appears to raise is whether U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X5.1, which requires the court to apply the guideline for \"the most analogous offense,\" excludes, in a case of criminal contempt for refusal to testify before a grand jury, a district court from turning to &#167; 2J1.2 (obstruction of justice) as the most apt analogue.  To state the proposition is to reveal its frivolity.  The question of the most appropriate analogy is essentially a question of fact, at most a mixed question of law and fact, and we give deference to the district court's factual determinations.  See United States v. Phath, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197960\"><a href=\"/opinion/197960/united-states-v-phath/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 149 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence submitted to the trial court was to the effect that appellant was a bookmaker who was privy to evidence of the extortion activities of members of the so-called Winter Hill Gang.  This gang and its members were under investigation by the federal grand jury before whom appellant ultimately refused to testify regarding these extortion activities.  The district court found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>[t]his is not like a case involving failure of a witness to comply with a subpoena to testify at trial.  The refusal of this defendant to answer a grand jury inquiry to him about his knowledge of the Winter Hill Gang interfered with grand jury proceedings bearing upon organized crime activities of large scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record in this case we can perceive no error in this conclusion, much less clear error.  We might add that although this is a matter of first impression in this circuit, other courts of appeal have upheld the application of &#167; 2J1.2 to criminal contempt convictions on similar findings.  See, e.g., United States v. Voss, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717569\"><a href=\"/opinion/717569/united-states-v-john-a-voss-united-states-of-america-v-mitchell-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span>, 1531 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's reliance on Underwood, 880 F.2d at 620, is misplaced, for in suggesting in that case that &#167; 2J1.5 was more closely analogous to that defendant's conduct, the Underwood panel observed that the defendant \"did not intend to obstruct justice\" but was afraid that the his testimony would be used against him in a pending case of his own before the same district judge.  As subsequent courts have concluded, the facts in Underwood made it \"a special case.\"  Remini, 967 F.2d at 760.   We reiterate that the question of which is the most appropriate analogy depends on the facts of the case.  It follows that, in some cases, criminal contempt findings might not be covered by &#167; 2J1.2 as \"obstruction of justice\" conduct.  On occasion, a district judge may find another analogy more apt to the facts in the case at bar, and, if so, the choice will be reviewed for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the district court found that \"[Appellant] knew that his refusal to answer a question of the grand jury about his association with the Winter Hill Gang ... would have an adverse effect upon and would obstruct the grand jury proceedings.\"   Nothing further is required considering the standard of deference that is due to a district court's decisions in a criminal contempt setting, in which the trial judge is uniquely in a position to assess the circumstances of defendant's actions.  See Voss, 82 F.3d at 1531.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered all other issues raised by appellant and find them lacking in merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's appeal is dismissed and his conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We express no opinion as to whether the violation of an order giving rise to a finding of civil contempt is necessarily also criminal contempt.
