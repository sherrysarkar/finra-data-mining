Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     John A. Donovan, III with whom Robert H. Gaynor and Sloane\n& Walsh, LLP were on brief for appellant.\n     James E. Kelleher with whom Revens, Lanni, Revens & St.\nPierre was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          December 5, 2000\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.         At issue on this appeal is the\n\nrefusal of the district judge, as a matter of discretion, to\n\nentertain a declaratory judgment action brought by the Hartford\n\nFire Insurance Company against the Rhode Island Public Transit\n\nAuthority (\"RIPTA\").     Hartford insures RIPTA under a commercial\n\ngeneral liability policy.         The pertinent background of this\n\nappeal are two different actions brought against RIPTA in state\n\ncourt by individuals injured by RIPTA buses, Jean Kelly and\n\nRobert Heckman.    These cases in turn gave rise to two further\n\nlawsuits by Hartford against RIPTA in federal court.\n\n          The first accident occurred on June 8, 1995, when a\n\npedestrian, Jean Kelly, was badly injured by a RIPTA bus in\n\nCranston, Rhode Island.         She then sued RIPTA in Rhode Island\n\nSuperior Court.    Kelly v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 95-4588 (Providence\n\nSuper.   Ct.)   (\"the   Kelly   case\").      In   an   amended   complaint\n\nincident to a second trial, Kelly charged not only negligence in\n\nthe operation of the bus (counts I, II, and V), but also\n\nnegligence by RIPTA in maintaining the bus \"turnaround\" station\n\nwhere the accident occurred (count III) and breach of common\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fcarrier duty of care (count IV).1       RIPTA notified Hartford of\n\nKelly's lawsuit.\n\n         The    liability   policy   issued   by   Hartford   to   RIPTA\n\ncontained the usual obligations to pay damages adjudged against\n\nRIPTA (the duty to indemnify), and to defend any suit seeking\n\nsuch damages (the duty to defend).     However, a provision in the\n\npolicy excluded coverage for bodily injury or property damage\n\n\"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment\n\nto others\" of any motor vehicle designed for travel on public\n\nroads.\n\n         Although Hartford assigned defense counsel to represent\n\nRIPTA, it also sent a reservation of rights letter stating that\n\nthe counts alleging negligent operation of the bus were outside\n\nthe policy.    It later amended the letter to reserve its right to\n\ndeny coverage to RIPTA for all of the claims, on the ground that\n\nKelly's injuries ultimately arose out of RIPTA's ownership and\n\nuse of a motor vehicle.       Trial in the state court began on\n\nFebruary 9, 1998, and the jury returned a verdict for RIPTA on\n\nthe three negligent operation of a motor vehicle counts and for\n\nKelly on the premises maintenance and common carrier counts.\n\n\n\n    1Apparently the breach of common carrier duty count did not\nspecify the conduct constituting the breach but, based on the\njury's later verdict, it appears that the count was read to\nembrace the negligent maintenance of premises claim.\n\n                                -3-\n\f            On February 20, 1998, Hartford filed a complaint in the\n\nfederal district court in Rhode Island seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment that it owed RIPTA no duty under the policy either to\n\ndefend or to indemnify RIPTA in the             Kelly case.        On summary\n\njudgment,    the   district     court   held    that    the   motor    vehicle\n\nexclusion clause negated any duty of Hartford to indemnify,\n\nregardless    of   the   way   the   counts    were    framed,    because   the\n\naccident grew out of the operation of the bus.                   Hartford Fire\n\nIns. Co. v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 98-094ML, slip op. at 15-16 (D.R.I.\n\nMar. 31, 1999) (\"the Hartford (Kelly) case\").\n\n            However, the district court also held that under Rhode\n\nIsland precedent, the premises negligence and common carrier\n\ncounts in the Kelly state-court complaint did trigger Hartford's\n\nduty to defend RIPTA.      Hartford (Kelly), slip op. at 10-11.             The\n\ndistrict court held that in Rhode Island, the insurer's duty to\n\ndefend is tested by mechanically comparing the policy and the\n\npertinent count of the complaint; and if the complaint alleges\n\nfacts even arguably within the risk coverage in the policy, the\n\ninsurer has a duty to defend regardless of the actual facts or\n\nthe case's ultimate outcome.         Id. at 7-8.       The court deemed the\n\npremises    negligence    and   common     carrier     counts     sufficiently\n\ndistinct from the policy exclusion to impose a duty to defend.\n\nId. at 10-11.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           RIPTA appealed to this court, arguing that Hartford did\n\nhave a duty to indemnify on the \"premises\" counts because its\n\noriginal reservation of rights letter had not named those counts\n\nas excluded from coverage.          This court rejected RIPTA's appeal\n\nin a per curiam opinion relying on the reasoning of the district\n\ncourt.   Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. RIPTA, Nos. 99-1525 & 99-1637,\n\n2000 WL 231253 (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 2000) (per curiam).              Hartford\n\nhad    taken   a   cross-appeal     challenging   the   district   court's\n\ndecision that Hartford had a duty to defend in Kelly; but this\n\nwas dismissed as moot--it appears that the Kelly case had come\n\nto an end so that the duty to defend was deemed of no further\n\nconsequence.\n\n           We now turn to the second accident which occurred on\n\nFebruary 3, 1996, when a RIPTA bus struck Robert Heckman while\n\nhe was entering his car on a street in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIn August 1997, Heckman filed a lawsuit against RIPTA in Rhode\n\nIsland Superior Court.            Heckman v.   RIPTA, C.A. No. 97-3839\n\n(Providence Super. Ct.) (\"the Heckman case\").                As amended in\n\nJanuary 1999, Heckman's complaint sought to hold RIPTA liable\n\nfor the driver's negligence in operating the bus (count II), but\n\nalso   charged     RIPTA   with   negligent    entrustment    (count   III),\n\nnegligent hiring (count IV) and negligent supervision, training\n\nand assignment (count V).\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f          Hartford     received      notice       of    the    Heckman       suit    in\n\nFebruary 1999 and issued a denial letter advising RIPTA that the\n\nHeckman claims were excluded by the policy's motor vehicle\n\nexclusion.    RIPTA    responded      by    asserting         that    each    of    the\n\nnegligence claims, other than negligent operation, were covered\n\nby the policy and that Hartford's coverage position was taken in\n\nbad faith.   Hartford says that RIPTA threatened to bring suit in\n\nfederal   court   if   Hartford      did    not   take    responsibility            for\n\ndefending the case.\n\n          Hartford sent a reservation of rights letter to RIPTA\n\nagreeing to provide counsel but reserving its right to disclaim\n\ncoverage, to withdraw from the defense at any time, and to seek\n\nreimbursement from RIPTA for defense costs if the exclusion were\n\nfound to apply.    Hartford then brought the present action in the\n\nfederal district court on July 9, 1999, seeking a declaration\n\nthat it had no duty to indemnify in the Heckman case and that it\n\nhad a right to withdraw from further representation and to\n\nrecover   money   spent   on   the    defense      to    date    in    that    case.\n\nHeckman v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 99-326ML, slip op. at 1 (D.R.I. Mar.\n\n14, 2000) (the \"Hartford (Heckman) case\").\n\n          In this new action, Hartford filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment which RIPTA opposed on the merits.                   On March 14, 2000,\n\nthe district court entered an order \"declin[ing] to exercise its\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fjurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action.\"    Hartford\n\n(Heckman), slip op. at 1.   The district court said that under\n\nwell-established law, a declaratory judgment action would be\n\njustified if useful to clarify and settle legal relations and to\n\neliminate uncertainty, insecurity and controversy.      It then\n\ncontinued:\n\n                Since this Court has already ruled on\n         this CGL policy and this exclusionary\n         provision in Hartford I [i.e., Hartford\n         (Kelly)], a declaratory judgment would\n         neither clarify the legal relations in issue\n         nor   afford    relief   from   uncertainty.\n         Furthermore, the parties in Hartford I\n         appealed this Court's decision and the court\n         of appeals affirmed.     The purpose of the\n         Declaratory Judgment Act is to address\n         unresolved disputes. This Court has already\n         determined    the    rights,   duties    and\n         obligations to the parties under this same\n         policy.   The Court therefore declines the\n         invitation to give an encore performance.\n\nId. at 2-3 (citation omitted).\n\n         Hartford now appeals to this court.   It concedes that\n\nthe decision to entertain a declaratory judgment action under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2201(a)(1994) is a \"discretionary\" one, Wilton v. Seven\n\nFalls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 289-90 (1995), but it argues that the\n\ndistrict court has abused its discretion in this case.         A\n\nrefusal to entertain a suit for declaratory relief is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion, id. at 289; DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124\n\nF.3d 298, 313 (1st Cir. 1997), and that concept can encompass\n\n\n                              -7-\n\feither an outright mistake of law or a serious misjudgment in\n\nthe weighing of pertinent considerations, I.P. Lund Trading ApS\n\nv. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          On    appeal,   Hartford    says    that,   because   of    the\n\ndifferences in the claims made in the Kelly and Heckman state-\n\ncourt actions, the district court erred in thinking that the\n\nduty to defend in Kelly--that it had found to exist in Hartford\n\n(Kelly)--also established a duty to defend in Heckman.               As we\n\nhave noted, the claims that triggered the duty to defend in the\n\nKelly state-court case were the maintenance of premises and\n\ncommon carrier claims.      No such claims have been made in the\n\nHeckman case, and the duty to defend in Heckman turns on the\n\npresence of negligent entrustment, hiring, supervision, training\n\nand assignment.\n\n          Because the critical counts in the two cases differ,\n\nno one could properly invoke collateral estoppel, often now\n\ncalled issue preclusion, to say that the decision in Hartford\n\n(Kelly) controls Hartford (Heckman).         See generally Restatement\n\n(Second) of Judgments §§ 17, 27 (1982).        And RIPTA makes no such\n\nclaim:   at oral argument, it agreed that collateral estoppel did\n\nnot apply.2    Further, in the district court, RIPTA stressed that\n\n\n     2\n     One might think that Hartford (Kelly) could have no\npreclusive effect on the duty to defend in later cases simply\nbecause mootness, through no fault of Hartford, precluded review\n\n                                -8-\n\fthe counts were different although it urged that the reasoning\n\nin   Hartford     (Kelly)    would,     if    applied    to    the      admittedly\n\ndifferent counts in Hartford (Heckman), warrant the finding of\n\na duty to defend.       This, seemingly, is what the district court\n\nmeant   when    it   said   that   it    declined   to    give     an   \"encore,\"\n\nHartford (Heckman), slip op. at 3.             Of course, a prior decision\n\nmay have precedential effect without being preclusive.                      Barber\n\nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (In re Smith), 964 F.2d 636,\n\n638 (7th Cir. 1992) (Posner, J.).\n\n            Assuming that the district court correctly understood\n\nRhode Island law in Hartford (Kelly), it might well follow that\n\nHartford had a duty to defend at least some of the counts in the\n\nHeckman   case.      Hartford      scarcely    troubles       to   argue   to   the\n\ncontrary.      Instead, Hartford, so far as we can tell from its\n\nbrief, would like us to decide that the district court was wrong\n\nin Hartford (Kelly) or at least that it overstated the scope of\n\nthe duty to defend and that a correct understanding would negate\n\nany such duty to defend in Heckman.            Only the latter possibility\n\nmatters here, and it cannot be ignored.\n\n\non that issue. At common law this was the rule, see Restatement\n(Second) of Judgments § 28(1) & cmt. a (1982), but the Supreme\nCourt in United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39-41\n(1950), said that a litigant who wants to avoid collateral\nestoppel effect should move to vacate the judgment below, which\nHartford did not trouble to do after our per curiam disposition\nof the appeal in Hartford (Kelly).\n\n                                        -9-\n\f          Rhode Island law on the scope of the duty to defend is\n\nnot a model of clarity.        The core meaning of the pertinent\n\n\"pleading\" test is that an insurer, faced with a claim against\n\nthe insured squarely within the coverage of the policy, cannot\n\nrefuse to defend the insured merely because it believes that the\n\nfacts at trial will show that the injury occurred in some way\n\nthat would not be covered.3    The pleading test may also mean that\n\nwhen one cannot tell what claim is being asserted against the\n\ninsured but it    may be one covered by the policy--as in the\n\ncommon carrier count in Kelly--the duty to defend continues, at\n\nleast until the scope of the claim is brought into focus.         E.g.,\n\nFlori v. Allstate Ins. Co., 388 A.2d 25, 27 (R.I. 1978).\n\n          But what happens where the injury assertedly derives\n\nfrom the operation of a bus but an anterior act of negligence\n\n(e.g., hiring a negligent driver) or contemporaneous conduct\n\n(e.g.,   badly   maintaining   a    turnaround)   is   charged   in   the\n\ncomplaint?   Such a case presents a different problem than the\n\ninsurer's denial of facts or a complaint's lack of clarity.\n\nWhether there is a duty to defend depends partly on how one\n\nreads the exclusion and partly on how Rhode Island courts want\n\n\n\n    3Peerless Ins. Co. v. Viegas, 667 A.2d 785, 787 (R.I. 1995)\n(citing Employers' Fire Ins. Co. v. Beals, 240 A.2d 397, 402\n(R.I. 1968)); Thomas v. American Universal Ins. Co., 93 A.2d\n309, 312 (R.I. 1952).\n\n                                   -10-\n\fto treat multiple-cause problems of this kind.       Lacking full\n\nbriefing, the answer is not obvious to us.\n\n         Certainly a duty to defend may exist even though in the\n\nend there may prove to be no duty to indemnify, see Flori, 388\n\nA.2d at 26; see also 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice §\n\n4684, at 83-85 (Berdal ed. 1979); and Kelly may have been such\n\na case, partly because the critical counts were drafted to\n\nmaintain some (count III) or almost total (count IV) ambiguity\n\nas to just what the plaintiff was alleging.    But it is not clear\n\nthat the same uncertainty inheres in Heckman; one might in the\n\nend   read   the   critical   count   in      the   complaint   as\n\nstraightforwardly alleging that Heckman was injured because he\n\nwas run down by a bus driver who had been negligently hired,\n\ntrained, supervised and entrusted with a bus.\n\n         If this is what the complaint means, it certainly poses\n\na legal issue as to coverage, but it is not apparent that\n\ncoverage in such a case differs as between the duty to defend\n\nand the duty to indemnify or requires a trial of the underlying\n\nliability case to resolve the coverage issue.         Even if the\n\nnegligence inhered almost entirely in hiring or training, one\n\nreading of the policy (quite possibly not the only one) could be\n\nthat the \"arising out of\" exclusion applied on the face of the\n\ncomplaint so as to negate any duty either to defend or to\n\n\n                              -11-\n\findemnify.    Cf. Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Heroux, 549 A.2d\n\n265, 266-67 (R.I. 1988).         Put differently, the duty to defend\n\nunder such a policy may presuppose at least a possible duty to\n\nindemnify.\n\n            However, the question on this appeal is not the merits-\n\n-on which we have no firm view--but whether the district court\n\npermissibly    declined    not   to    decide    the    merits.       From    the\n\ndistrict court's point of view, it had laid down a general\n\nprinciple in Hartford (Kelly) that it thought told Hartford that\n\nthe district court would also find a duty to defend (but not to\n\nindemnify) the Heckman case.          Could it be an abuse of discretion\n\nfor the district court to decline to repeat itself?                        In the\n\npeculiar circumstances of this case, we think that it was.\n\n            The district court may or may not have been right in\n\nHartford (Kelly) but the counts in Kelly that were decisive in\n\ncreating a duty to defend are not present in Heckman and, as\n\nalready noted, there is a possible reading of the policy that\n\nwould negate a duty to defend in Heckman.                   And, even if the\n\ndistrict court's view of the law in Hartford (Kelly) suggests\n\nthat   it   would   find   a   duty   to     defend    in   Heckman   as    well,\n\nHartford's legal obligation to defend in Heckman does remain\n\n\"unsettled\" (so far as the federal courts are concerned) until\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fthis court has spoken (the Supreme Court is unlikely to have\n\nmuch interest in the merits).\n\n          It is possible that the district court did not fully\n\nappreciate that this court had not ruled on the scope of the\n\nduty to defend under Rhode Island law.             Just before declining\n\n\"to give an encore performance,\" the district court said that\n\nits own   Hartford (Kelly) decision had removed any pertinent\n\nuncertainty and, on appeal, \"the court of appeals affirmed.\"\n\nHartford (Heckman), slip op. at 3.            As already noted, our\n\naffirmance in Hartford (Kelly) was as to the duty to indemnify;\n\nthe cross-appeal on the district court's duty-to-defend ruling\n\nwas dismissed by us as moot.\n\n          Insurers often need immediate guidance as to whether\n\nthey have an ongoing obligation to defend:          if they refuse, they\n\nmay be in breach of contract or worse, and if they accede, they\n\nsometimes find they have prejudiced their position.            It is also\n\nunclear how easy it would be for Hartford to obtain a prompt\n\ndeclaratory   ruling   in   the   Rhode   Island    state   courts.   Cf.\n\nFireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. E.W. Burman, Inc., 391 A.2d 99, 101\n\n(R.I. 1978) (courts have \"broad discretion\" to \"deny declaratory\n\nrelief\" as to insurance coverage); Beals, 240 A.2d at 400-02.\n\nThe issue before us would be more difficult if there were\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fclearly such a remedy and the district court had refused for\n\nthat reason to rule.\n\n           Accordingly, we think that the ground on which the\n\ndistrict court based its refusal to entertain the action does\n\nnot persuade.

Hartford insures RIPTA under a commercial general liability policy.  The pertinent background of this appeal are two different actions brought against RIPTA in state court by individuals injured by RIPTA buses, Jean Kelly and Robert Heckman.  These cases in turn gave rise to two further lawsuits by Hartford against RIPTA in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first accident occurred on June 8, 1995, when a pedestrian, Jean Kelly, was badly injured by a RIPTA bus in  Cranston, Rhode Island.  She then sued RIPTA in Rhode Island Superior Court.  Kelly v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 95-4588 (Providence Super. Ct.) (\"the Kelly case\").  In an amended complaint incident to a second trial, Kelly charged not only negligence in the operation of the bus (counts I, II, and V), but also negligence by RIPTA in maintaining the bus \"turnaround\" station where the accident occurred (count III) and breach of common carrier duty of care (count IV).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  RIPTA notified Hartford of Kelly's lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liability policy issued by Hartford to RIPTA contained the usual obligations to pay damages adjudged against RIPTA (the duty to indemnify), and to defend any suit seeking such damages (the duty to defend).  However, a provision in the policy excluded coverage for bodily injury or property damage \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others\" of any motor vehicle designed for travel on public roads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Hartford assigned defense counsel to represent RIPTA, it also sent a reservation of rights letter stating that the counts alleging negligent operation of the bus were outside the policy.  It later amended the letter to reserve its right to deny coverage to RIPTA for all of the claims, on the ground that Kelly's injuries ultimately arose out of RIPTA's ownership and use of a motor vehicle.  Trial in the state court began on February 9, 1998, and the jury returned a verdict for RIPTA on the three negligent operation of a motor vehicle counts and for Kelly on the premises maintenance and common carrier counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 20, 1998, Hartford filed a complaint in the federal district court in Rhode Island seeking a declaratory judgment that it owed RIPTA no duty under the policy either to defend or to indemnify RIPTA in the Kelly case.  On summary judgment, the district court held that the motor vehicle exclusion clause negated any duty of Hartford to indemnify, regardless of the way the counts were framed, because the accident grew out of the operation of the bus.  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 98-094ML, slip op. at 15-16 (D.R.I. Mar. 31, 1999) (\"the Hartford (Kelly) case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court also held that under Rhode Island precedent, the premises negligence and common carrier counts in the Kelly state-court complaint did trigger Hartford's duty to defend RIPTA.  Hartford (Kelly), slip op. at 10-11.  The district court held that in Rhode Island, the insurer's duty to defend is tested by mechanically comparing the policy and the pertinent count of the complaint; and if the complaint alleges facts even arguably within the risk coverage in the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend regardless of the actual facts or the case's ultimate outcome.  Id. at 7-8.  The court deemed the premises negligence and common carrier counts sufficiently distinct from the policy exclusion to impose a duty to defend.  Id. at 10-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIPTA appealed to this court, arguing that Hartford did have a duty to indemnify on the \"premises\" counts because its original reservation of rights letter had not named those counts as excluded from coverage.  This court rejected RIPTA's appeal in a per curiam opinion relying on the reasoning of the district court.  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. RIPTA, Nos. 99-1525 &amp; 99-1637, 2000 WL 231253 (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 2000) (per curiam).  Hartford had taken a cross-appeal challenging the district court's decision that Hartford had a duty to defend in Kelly; but this was dismissed as moot--it appears that the Kelly case had come to an end so that the duty to defend was deemed of no further consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the second accident which occurred on February 3, 1996, when a RIPTA bus struck Robert Heckman while he was entering his car on a street in Providence, Rhode Island.  In August 1997, Heckman filed a lawsuit against RIPTA in Rhode Island Superior Court.  Heckman v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 97-3839 (Providence Super. Ct.) (\"the Heckman case\").  As amended in January 1999, Heckman's complaint sought to hold RIPTA liable for the driver's negligence in operating the bus (count II), but also charged RIPTA with negligent entrustment (count III), negligent hiring (count IV) and negligent supervision, training and assignment (count V).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford received notice of the Heckman suit in February 1999 and issued a denial letter advising RIPTA that the Heckman claims were excluded by the policy's motor vehicle exclusion.  RIPTA responded by asserting that each of the negligence claims, other than negligent operation, were covered by the policy and that Hartford's coverage position was taken in bad faith.  Hartford says that RIPTA threatened to bring suit in federal court if Hartford did not take responsibility for defending the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford sent a reservation of rights letter to RIPTA agreeing to provide counsel but reserving its right to disclaim coverage, to withdraw from the defense at any time, and to seek reimbursement from RIPTA for defense costs if the exclusion were found to apply.  Hartford then brought the present action in the federal district court on July 9, 1999, seeking a declaration that it had no duty to indemnify in the Heckman case and that it had a right to withdraw from further representation and to recover money spent on the defense to date in that case.  Heckman v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 99-326ML, slip op. at 1 (D.R.I. Mar. 14, 2000) (the \"Hartford (Heckman) case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this new action, Hartford filed a motion for summary judgment which RIPTA opposed on the merits.  On March 14, 2000, the district court entered an order \"declin[ing] to exercise its jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action.\"  Hartford (Heckman), slip op. at 1.  The district court said that under well-established law, a declaratory judgment action would be justified if useful to clarify and settle legal relations and to eliminate uncertainty, insecurity and controversy.  It then continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this Court has already ruled on this CGL policy and this exclusionary provision in Hartford I [i.e., Hartford (Kelly)], a declaratory judgment would neither clarify the legal relations in issue nor afford relief from uncertainty.  Furthermore, the parties in Hartford I appealed this Court's decision and the court of appeals affirmed.  The purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to address unresolved disputes.  This Court has already determined the rights, duties and obligations to the parties under this same policy.  The Court therefore declines the invitation to give an encore performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 2-3 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford now appeals to this court.  It concedes that the decision to entertain a declaratory judgment action under 28 U.S.C.  2201(a)(1994) is a \"discretionary\" one, Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 289-90 (1995), but it argues that the district court has abused its discretion in this case.  A refusal to entertain a suit for declaratory relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion, id. at 289; DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 313 (1st Cir. 1997), and that concept can encompass either an outright mistake of law or a serious misjudgment in the weighing of pertinent considerations, I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hartford says that, because of the differences in the claims made in the Kelly and Heckman state-court actions, the district court erred in thinking that the duty to defend in Kelly--that it had found to exist in Hartford (Kelly)--also established a duty to defend in Heckman.  As we have noted, the claims that triggered the duty to defend in the Kelly state-court case were the maintenance of premises and common carrier claims.  No such claims have been made in the Heckman case, and the duty to defend in Heckman turns on the presence of negligent entrustment, hiring, supervision, training and assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the critical counts in the two cases differ, no one could properly invoke collateral estoppel, often now called issue preclusion, to say that the decision in Hartford (Kelly) controls Hartford (Heckman).  See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments  17, 27 (1982).  And RIPTA makes no such claim:  at oral argument, it agreed that collateral estoppel did not apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Further, in the district court, RIPTA stressed that the counts were different although it urged that the reasoning in Hartford (Kelly) would, if applied to the admittedly different counts in Hartford (Heckman), warrant the finding of a duty to defend.  This, seemingly, is what the district court meant when it said that it declined to give an \"encore,\" Hartford (Heckman), slip op. at 3.  Of course, a prior decision may have precedential effect without being preclusive.  Barber v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (In re Smith), 964 F.2d 636, 638 (7th Cir. 1992) (Posner, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the district court correctly understood Rhode Island law in Hartford (Kelly), it might well follow that Hartford had a duty to defend at least some of the counts in the Heckman case.  Hartford scarcely troubles to argue to the contrary.  Instead, Hartford, so far as we can tell from its brief, would like us to decide that the district court was wrong in Hartford (Kelly) or at least that it overstated the scope of the duty to defend and that a correct understanding would negate any such duty to defend in Heckman.  Only the latter possibility matters here, and it cannot be ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rhode Island law on the scope of the duty to defend is not a model of clarity.  The core meaning of the pertinent \"pleading\" test is that an insurer, faced with a claim against the insured squarely within the coverage of the policy, cannot refuse to defend the insured merely because it believes that the facts at trial will show that the injury occurred in some way that would not be covered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The pleading test may also mean that when one cannot tell what claim is being asserted against the insured but it may be one covered by the policy--as in the common carrier count in Kelly--the duty to defend continues, at least until the scope of the claim is brought into focus.  E.g., Flori v. Allstate Ins. Co., 388 A.2d 25, 27 (R.I. 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But what happens where the injury assertedly derives from the operation of a bus but an anterior act of negligence (e.g., hiring a negligent driver) or contemporaneous conduct (e.g., badly maintaining a turnaround) is charged in the complaint?  Such a case presents a different problem than the insurer's denial of facts or a complaint's lack of clarity.  Whether there is a duty to defend depends partly on how one reads the exclusion and partly on how Rhode Island courts want to treat multiple-cause problems of this kind.  Lacking full briefing, the answer is not obvious to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly a duty to defend may exist even though in the end there may prove to be no duty to indemnify, see Flori, 388 A.2d at 26; see also 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice  4684, at 83-85 (Berdal ed. 1979); and Kelly may have been such a case, partly because the critical counts were drafted to maintain some (count III) or almost total (count IV) ambiguity as to just what the plaintiff was alleging.  But it is not clear that the same uncertainty inheres in Heckman; one might in the end read the critical count in the complaint as straightforwardly alleging that Heckman was injured because he was run down by a bus driver who had been negligently hired, trained, supervised and entrusted with a bus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this is what the complaint means, it certainly poses a legal issue as to coverage, but it is not apparent that coverage in such a case differs as between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify or requires a trial of the underlying liability case to resolve the coverage issue.  Even if the negligence inhered almost entirely in hiring or training, one reading of the policy (quite possibly not the only one) could be that the \"arising out of\" exclusion applied on the face of the complaint so as to negate any duty either to defend or to indemnify.  Cf. Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Heroux, 549 A.2d 265, 266-67 (R.I. 1988).  Put differently, the duty to defend under such a policy may presuppose at least a possible duty to indemnify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the question on this appeal is not the merits--on which we have no firm view--but whether the district court permissibly declined not to decide the merits.  From the district court's point of view, it had laid down a general principle in Hartford (Kelly) that it thought told Hartford that the district court would also find a duty to defend (but not to indemnify) the Heckman case.  Could it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to decline to repeat itself?  In the peculiar circumstances of this case, we think that it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court may or may not have been right in Hartford (Kelly) but the counts in Kelly that were decisive in creating a duty to defend are not present in Heckman and, as already noted, there is a possible reading of the policy that would negate a duty to defend in Heckman.  And, even if the district court's view of the law in Hartford (Kelly) suggests that it would find a duty to defend in Heckman as well, Hartford's legal obligation to defend in Heckman does remain \"unsettled\" (so far as the federal courts are concerned) until this court has spoken (the Supreme Court is unlikely to have much interest in the merits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible that the district court did not fully appreciate that this court had not ruled on the scope of the duty to defend under Rhode Island law.  Just before declining \"to give an encore performance,\" the district court said that its own Hartford (Kelly) decision had removed any pertinent uncertainty and, on appeal, \"the court of appeals affirmed.\"  Hartford (Heckman), slip op. at 3.  As already noted, our affirmance in Hartford (Kelly) was as to the duty to indemnify; the cross-appeal on the district court's duty-to-defend ruling was dismissed by us as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insurers often need immediate guidance as to whether they have an ongoing obligation to defend:  if they refuse, they may be in breach of contract or worse, and if they accede, they sometimes find they have prejudiced their position.  It is also unclear how easy it would be for Hartford to obtain a prompt declaratory ruling in the Rhode Island state courts.  Cf. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. E.W. Burman, Inc., 391 A.2d 99, 101 (R.I. 1978) (courts have \"broad discretion\" to \"deny declaratory relief\" as to insurance coverage); Beals, 240 A.2d at 400-02.  The issue before us would be more difficult if there were clearly such a remedy and the district court had refused for that reason to rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we think that the ground on which the district court based its refusal to entertain the action does not persuade.  On remand, the district court is free to consider whether there is any other reason, as matters now stand, why the declaratory judgment action should not be entertained.  Assuming there is none, it is also free to enter a brief opinion denying relief on the merits, citing Hartford (Kelly), or to address the merits at greater length with the same or a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   Apparently the breach of common carrier duty count did not specify the conduct constituting the breach but, based on the jury's later verdict, it appears that the count was read to embrace the negligent maintenance of premises claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  One might think that Hartford (Kelly) could have no preclusive effect on the duty to defend in later cases simply because mootness, through no fault of Hartford, precluded review on that issue.  At common law this was the rule, see Restatement (Second) of Judgments  28(1) &amp; cmt. a (1982), but the Supreme Court in United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39-41 (1950), said that a litigant who wants to avoid collateral estoppel effect should move to vacate the judgment below, which Hartford did not trouble to do after our per curiam disposition of the appeal in Hartford (Kelly).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  Peerless Ins.

Id. at 10-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIPTA appealed to this court, arguing that Hartford did have a duty to indemnify on the \"premises\" counts because its original reservation of rights letter had not named those counts as excluded from coverage.  This court rejected RIPTA's appeal in a per curiam opinion relying on the reasoning of the district court.  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. RIPTA, Nos. 99-1525 &amp; 99-1637, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">231253</span></span> (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 2000) (per curiam).  Hartford had taken a cross-appeal challenging the district court's decision that Hartford had a duty to defend in Kelly; but this was dismissed as moot--it appears that the Kelly case had come to an end so that the duty to defend was deemed of no further consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the second accident which occurred on February 3, 1996, when a RIPTA bus struck Robert Heckman while he was entering his car on a street in Providence, Rhode Island.  In August 1997, Heckman filed a lawsuit against RIPTA in Rhode Island Superior Court.  Heckman v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 97-3839 (Providence Super. Ct.) (\"the Heckman case\").  As amended in January 1999, Heckman's complaint sought to hold RIPTA liable for the driver's negligence in operating the bus (count II), but also charged RIPTA with negligent entrustment (count III), negligent hiring (count IV) and negligent supervision, training and assignment (count V).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford received notice of the Heckman suit in February 1999 and issued a denial letter advising RIPTA that the Heckman claims were excluded by the policy's motor vehicle exclusion.  RIPTA responded by asserting that each of the negligence claims, other than negligent operation, were covered by the policy and that Hartford's coverage position was taken in bad faith.  Hartford says that RIPTA threatened to bring suit in federal court if Hartford did not take responsibility for defending the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford sent a reservation of rights letter to RIPTA agreeing to provide counsel but reserving its right to disclaim coverage, to withdraw from the defense at any time, and to seek reimbursement from RIPTA for defense costs if the exclusion were found to apply.  Hartford then brought the present action in the federal district court on July 9, 1999, seeking a declaration that it had no duty to indemnify in the Heckman case and that it had a right to withdraw from further representation and to recover money spent on the defense to date in that case.  Heckman v. RIPTA, C.A. No. 99-326ML, slip op. at 1 (D.R.I. Mar. 14, 2000) (the \"Hartford (Heckman) case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this new action, Hartford filed a motion for summary judgment which RIPTA opposed on the merits.  On March 14, 2000, the district court entered an order \"declin[ing] to exercise its jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action.\"  Hartford (Heckman), slip op. at 1.  The district court said that under well-established law, a declaratory judgment action would be justified if useful to clarify and settle legal relations and to eliminate uncertainty, insecurity and controversy.  It then continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this Court has already ruled on this CGL policy and this exclusionary provision in Hartford I [i.e., Hartford (Kelly)], a declaratory judgment would neither clarify the legal relations in issue nor afford relief from uncertainty.  Furthermore, the parties in Hartford I appealed this Court's decision and the court of appeals affirmed.  The purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to address unresolved disputes.  This Court has already determined the rights, duties and obligations to the parties under this same policy.  The Court therefore declines the invitation to give an encore performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 2-3 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hartford now appeals to this court.  It concedes that the decision to entertain a declaratory judgment action under 28 U.S.C.  2201(a)(1994) is a \"discretionary\" one, Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117948\"><a href=\"/opinion/117948/wilton-v-seven-falls-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 289-90 (1995), but it argues that the district court has abused its discretion in this case.  A refusal to entertain a suit for declaratory relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion, id. at 289; DeNovellis v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746214\"><a href=\"/opinion/746214/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1520-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45029-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir. 1997), and that concept can encompass either an outright mistake of law or a serious misjudgment in the weighing of pertinent considerations, I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198254\"><a href=\"/opinion/198254/kroni-inc-v-kohler-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hartford says that, because of the differences in the claims made in the Kelly and Heckman state-court actions, the district court erred in thinking that the duty to defend in Kelly--that it had found to exist in Hartford (Kelly)--also established a duty to defend in Heckman.  As we have noted, the claims that triggered the duty to defend in the Kelly state-court case were the maintenance of premises and common carrier claims.  No such claims have been made in the Heckman case, and the duty to defend in Heckman turns on the presence of negligent entrustment, hiring, supervision, training and assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the critical counts in the two cases differ, no one could properly invoke collateral estoppel, often now called issue preclusion, to say that the decision in Hartford (Kelly) controls Hartford (Heckman).  See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments  17, 27 (1982).  And RIPTA makes no such claim:  at oral argument, it agreed that collateral estoppel did not apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Further, in the district court, RIPTA stressed that the counts were different although it urged that the reasoning in Hartford (Kelly) would, if applied to the admittedly different counts in Hartford (Heckman), warrant the finding of a duty to defend.  This, seemingly, is what the district court meant when it said that it declined to give an \"encore,\" Hartford (Heckman), slip op. at 3.  Of course, a prior decision may have precedential effect without being preclusive.  Barber v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (In re Smith), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583658\"><a href=\"/opinion/583658/in-re-william-d-smith-and-juliana-m-smith-debtors-richard-e-barber/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 638 (7th Cir. 1992) (Posner, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the district court correctly understood Rhode Island law in Hartford (Kelly), it might well follow that Hartford had a duty to defend at least some of the counts in the Heckman case.  Hartford scarcely troubles to argue to the contrary.  Instead, Hartford, so far as we can tell from its brief, would like us to decide that the district court was wrong in Hartford (Kelly) or at least that it overstated the scope of the duty to defend and that a correct understanding would negate any such duty to defend in Heckman.  Only the latter possibility matters here, and it cannot be ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rhode Island law on the scope of the duty to defend is not a model of clarity.  The core meaning of the pertinent \"pleading\" test is that an insurer, faced with a claim against the insured squarely within the coverage of the policy, cannot refuse to defend the insured merely because it believes that the facts at trial will show that the injury occurred in some way that would not be covered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The pleading test may also mean that when one cannot tell what claim is being asserted against the insured but it may be one covered by the policy--as in the common carrier count in Kelly--the duty to defend continues, at least until the scope of the claim is brought into focus.  E.g., Flori v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1942880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1942880/flori-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 (R.I. 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But what happens where the injury assertedly derives from the operation of a bus but an anterior act of negligence (e.g., hiring a negligent driver) or contemporaneous conduct (e.g., badly maintaining a turnaround) is charged in the complaint?  Such a case presents a different problem than the insurer's denial of facts or a complaint's lack of clarity.  Whether there is a duty to defend depends partly on how one reads the exclusion and partly on how Rhode Island courts want to treat multiple-cause problems of this kind.  Lacking full briefing, the answer is not obvious to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly a duty to defend may exist even though in the end there may prove to be no duty to indemnify, see Flori, 388 A.2d at 26; see also 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice  4684, at 83-85 (Berdal ed. 1979); and Kelly may have been such a case, partly because the critical counts were drafted to maintain some (count III) or almost total (count IV) ambiguity as to just what the plaintiff was alleging.  But it is not clear that the same uncertainty inheres in Heckman; one might in the end read the critical count in the complaint as straightforwardly alleging that Heckman was injured because he was run down by a bus driver who had been negligently hired, trained, supervised and entrusted with a bus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this is what the complaint means, it certainly poses a legal issue as to coverage, but it is not apparent that coverage in such a case differs as between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify or requires a trial of the underlying liability case to resolve the coverage issue.  Even if the negligence inhered almost entirely in hiring or training, one reading of the policy (quite possibly not the only one) could be that the \"arising out of\" exclusion applied on the face of the complaint so as to negate any duty either to defend or to indemnify.  Cf. Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Heroux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260457/hingham-mut-fire-ins-co-v-heroux/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 266-67 (R.I. 1988).  Put differently, the duty to defend under such a policy may presuppose at least a possible duty to indemnify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the question on this appeal is not the merits--on which we have no firm view--but whether the district court permissibly declined not to decide the merits.  From the district court's point of view, it had laid down a general principle in Hartford (Kelly) that it thought told Hartford that the district court would also find a duty to defend (but not to indemnify) the Heckman case.  Could it be an abuse of discretion for the district court to decline to repeat itself?  In the peculiar circumstances of this case, we think that it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court may or may not have been right in Hartford (Kelly) but the counts in Kelly that were decisive in creating a duty to defend are not present in Heckman and, as already noted, there is a possible reading of the policy that would negate a duty to defend in Heckman.  And, even if the district court's view of the law in Hartford (Kelly) suggests that it would find a duty to defend in Heckman as well, Hartford's legal obligation to defend in Heckman does remain \"unsettled\" (so far as the federal courts are concerned) until this court has spoken (the Supreme Court is unlikely to have much interest in the merits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible that the district court did not fully appreciate that this court had not ruled on the scope of the duty to defend under Rhode Island law.  Just before declining \"to give an encore performance,\" the district court said that its own Hartford (Kelly) decision had removed any pertinent uncertainty and, on appeal, \"the court of appeals affirmed.\"  Hartford (Heckman), slip op. at 3.  As already noted, our affirmance in Hartford (Kelly) was as to the duty to indemnify; the cross-appeal on the district court's duty-to-defend ruling was dismissed by us as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insurers often need immediate guidance as to whether they have an ongoing obligation to defend:  if they refuse, they may be in breach of contract or worse, and if they accede, they sometimes find they have prejudiced their position.  It is also unclear how easy it would be for Hartford to obtain a prompt declaratory ruling in the Rhode Island state courts.  Cf. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. E.W. Burman, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956041/firemans-fund-ins-co-v-ew-burman-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 101 (R.I. 1978) (courts have \"broad discretion\" to \"deny declaratory relief\" as to insurance coverage); Beals, 240 A.2d at 400-02.  The issue before us would be more difficult if there were clearly such a remedy and the district court had refused for that reason to rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we think that the ground on which the district court based its refusal to entertain the action does not persuade.  On remand, the district court is free to consider whether there is any other reason, as matters now stand, why the declaratory judgment action should not be entertained.  Assuming there is none, it is also free to enter a brief opinion denying relief on the merits, citing Hartford (Kelly), or to address the merits at greater length with the same or a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>   Apparently the breach of common carrier duty count did not specify the conduct constituting the breach but, based on the jury's later verdict, it appears that the count was read to embrace the negligent maintenance of premises claim.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  One might think that Hartford (Kelly) could have no preclusive effect on the duty to defend in later cases simply because mootness, through no fault of Hartford, precluded review on that issue.  At common law this was the rule, see Restatement (Second) of Judgments  28(1) &amp; cmt. a (1982), but the Supreme Court in United States v.
