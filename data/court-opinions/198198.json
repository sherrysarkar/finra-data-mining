  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\n\nNo. 97-1657\r\n\nUNITED STATES,\r\n\nAppellee,\r\n\nv.\r\n\nCOLLIER VAZQUEZ-CARDONA, A/K/A CHINCO,\r\n\nDefendant, Appellant.\r\n\n\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n[Hon. Jos Antonio Fust, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n\n\nBefore\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nLynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n\n\nGabriel Hernndez-Rivera, by appointment of the Court, for\r\nappellant.\r\nGrace Chung Becker, Trial Attorney, Narcotic and Dangerous\r\nDrug Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, with\r\nwhom James K. Robinson, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\r\nDivision, U.S. Department of Justice, and Theresa M.B. Van Vliet,\r\nChief, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, Criminal Division, U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n\n\nNovember 10, 1998\r\n         Per Curiam.  This is an appeal from a sentence imposed\r\nafter defendant pled guilty pursuant to an agreement.  Defendant-\r\nappellant argues on appeal that the sentence was in error in that\r\nhe was a minor participant and should therefore have been given a\r\ntwo point reduction in his Base Offense Level.\r\nAssuming dubitante that there is any jurisdiction over\r\nthis appeal in light of defendant's agreement that the Base Offense\r\nLevel would be 36 and he would be entitled to no other reduction\r\nthan the three level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,\r\nwe nonetheless affirm.  There is adequate evidence that the\r\ndefendant was not a minor participant.\n",
