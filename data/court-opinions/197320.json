Dr. Mario J.  Tomasini appeals\r                                       \r\n\nfrom an adverse judgment against him for medical malpractice.\r\n\nDr. Tomasini makes several claims of error, only one of which\r\n\nrequires extended discussion.   On that claim, which presents\r\n\na difficult question concerning  offsets to damage awards, we\r\n\nconclude that a deduction is required in this case to account\r\n\nfor payment already received  in settlement by the plaintiff,\r\n\nAwilda  Villarini-Garcia,  from  the  hospital for  the  same\r\n\ninjury.\r\n\n     This  case  began with  an  operation  performed by  Dr.\r\n\nTomasini  in September 1986 at Hospital del Maestro in Puerto\r\n\nRico.  During the operation, Dr. Tomasini removed a birthmark\r\n\nor  mole from Villarini's back, and a piece of muscle tissue.\r\n\nIn her later complaint against Dr. Tomasini and the hospital,\r\n\nVillarini charged the doctor  with negligence in removing the\r\n\nmuscle  tissue,  causing  her  continuing  pain and  severely\r\n\nimpairing her career as a concert pianist.\r\n\n     Villarini did not file  her complaint against the doctor\r\n\nand hospital until June 1990, well after Puerto Rico's normal\r\n\none year  statute  of  limitations.    31  L.P.R.A.     5298.\r\n\nVillarini  argued that  the statute  was tolled  under Puerto\r\n\nRico's discovery rule until she acquired sufficient knowledge\r\n\nof the basis of her claim.  The district  court dismissed the\r\n\ncase on summary judgment  for failure to meet the  statute of\r\n\nlimitations, and Villarini appealed.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     This  court  affirmed  the  dismissal  as  to  three  of\r\n\nVillarini's  four claims of negligence but reversed as to one\r\n\nclaim.  Villarini  v. Hospital  del Maestro, 8  F.3d 81  (1st\r                                                       \r\n\nCir.  1993).    On that  last  claim,  we  said that  summary\r\n\njudgment was  improper and  that it was  likely to be  a jury\r\n\nquestion  whether  Villarini  had  exercised  sufficient  due\r\n\ndiligence  to give her the  protection of the discovery rule.\r\n\nFollowing  remand,  the hospital  settled with  Villarini for\r\n\n$50,000,  and  the  case   proceeded  to  trial  against  Dr.\r\n\nTomasini.\r\n\n     At  the end  of the  trial,  the jury  awarded Villarini\r\n\n$100,000 for physical and mental damage and $500,000 for loss\r\n\nof earnings.   Among other post-trial  requests, Dr. Tomasini\r\n\nsought a deduction from the judgment of $50,000, representing\r\n\nthe amount that  the hospital  had paid in  settlement.   The\r\n\ndistrict court refused.   This appeal  followed.  On  appeal,\r\n\nDr.  Tomasini makes six claims  of error, the  last one being\r\n\nthe denial of the deduction.\r\n\n     Four  of  the  claims   relate  to  sufficiency  of  the\r\n\nevidence:     Dr.  Tomasini   says  that  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient  to allow  Villarini  to escape  the statute  of\r\n\nlimitations,  or  to   establish  malpractice,  or  to   show\r\n\ncausation, or to support  the amount awarded.  A  fifth claim\r\n\nis  directed  at  testimony   of  an  agent,  who  represents\r\n\nmusicians, offered  by Villarini to support  her claimed loss\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nof  income;  Dr.  Tomasini  says  that the  witness  was  not\r\n\nqualified and lacked an adequate basis for his testimony. \r\n\n     The  challenges  to   the  evidence--as  to  timeliness,\r\n\nnegligence,  causation,  and damages--are  legitimate issues;\r\n\nbut having  considered the  evidence described in  the briefs\r\n\nand set forth in the record, we think that the jury's verdict\r\n\nis  not  irrational  on any  of  these  issues  and that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court acted  within its  discretion in  holding the\r\n\nexpert to  be qualified and his  opinion adequately grounded.\r\n\nThere is nothing about  these fact-bound issues that warrants\r\n\ndiscussion in a published opinion.\r\n\n     The  one  issue  that  does require  discussion  is  Dr.\r\n\nTomasini's  final argument  that  the  $600,000 jury  verdict\r\n\nshould be reduced by $50,000  to reflect the amount Villarini\r\n\nreceived  in  settlement from  his  former  co-defendant, the\r\n\nHospital  del Maestro.  After  the jury rendered its verdict,\r\n\nDr.  Tomasini filed  a timely  motion under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n59(e) to amend the judgment to deduct the $50,000 settlement,\r\n\nand the district court denied the motion.  \r\n\n     The court based its denial on the fact that the hospital\r\n\nwas  not  \"jointly\" liable  for  the  injury along  with  Dr.\r\n\nTomasini;  rather it  was  sued only  on vicarious  liability\r\n\ngrounds.  See 31 L.P.R.A.   5142.  Villarini presses the same\r                         \r\n\nobjection  on  appeal.    Implicit in  the  district  court's\r\n\nruling, and  explicit in Villarini's argument,  is the notion\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nthat there is no  right to offset an earlier  settlement made\r\n\nby a  co-defendant where  the remaining co-defendant  did not\r\n\nhave  a  right  of  contribution  against  the  settling  co-\r\n\ndefendant.1   This presents a legal issue that we consider de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo,  and  conclude that  the  linkage  of contribution  and\r                \r\n\noffset has no sound basis.\r\n\n     In almost all jurisdictions,  settlement payments to the\r\n\nplaintiff from one  of several  joint tortfeasors--those  who\r\n\nactively  contributed to the same injury--reduce any judgment\r\n\nlater   secured   against   the  nonsettling   tortfeasor(s).\r\n\nMcDermott v. AmClyde,  511 U.S.  202, 208 (1994).   The  only\r                                \r\n\ndebate is  whether this reduction  is to be made  by a simple\r\n\ndollar-for-dollar   offset  or  through  a  more  complicated\r\n\nproportional liability formula.  Id. at 208-17.  See 6 Minzer\r                                                                \r\n\net al., Damages in Tort Actions   51.25[1] (1966).\r                                           \r\n\n     Conversely, the  usual rule is that  a plaintiff's award\r\n\nwill  not be reduced  for payments or  benefits received from\r\n\nsources  independent   of  those   who  wronged  him.     See\r                                                                         \r\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts    920A(2) (1991); Robertson v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWhite,  81 F.3d 752, 758  (8th Cir. 1996).   This \"collateral\r                 \r\n\nsource\" rule allows  a plaintiff to receive  payments such as\r\n\ncharitable  donations  and  payments  from  his  own  insurer\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1For  obvious  reasons,  under   Puerto  Rico  law,   as\r\nelsewhere, the active tortfeasor has no right of contribution\r\nagainst  another whose  liability  to the  victim is  at best\r\nvicarious.  See  FDIC v. Consolidated Mortgage, 805  F.2d 14,\r                                                          \r\n19 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwithout  losing the ability to recover the full amount of his\r\n\nloss from the wrongdoer or wrongdoers.\r\n\n     A few courts have  refused to offset payments made  by a\r\n\nsettling co-defendant  who turned out later not  to be liable\r\n\nas a joint tortfeasor with  the nonsettling defendant.  E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMedical Center of Delaware v. Mullins, 637 A.2d 6, 9-10 (Del.\r                                                 \r\n\n1994); Collier  v.

The rationale of these  holdings is\r\n\nthat  since the  primarily liable  defendant would  have been\r\n\nobligated to pay  the entire  damage amount  if the  settling\r\n\nparty had never  been sued  (or did not  settle), the  former\r\n\nshould not reap the benefit of a fortuitous settlement by the\r\n\nlatter.  Mullins, 637 A.2d at 10.  \r                            \r\n\n     The so-called \"modern rule\" expressed in the Restatement\r                                                                         \r\n\n(Second) of Torts is very much to the contrary:  it says that\r                             \r\n\nany payment \"made in compensation of a claim for a harm\" will\r\n\nreduce the liability of the remaining defendants, \"whether or\r\n\nnot  the person making the  payment is liable  to the injured\r\n\nperson.\"  Id.   885(3) and comment (f).  See also Restatement\r                                                                         \r\n\n(Second) of Judgments   50(2) (1982).  Many cases express the\r                                 \r\n\nright  of  offset  in  the  same  unqualified  terms  as  the\r\n\nRestatement (although  not all  happen to involve  a settling\r                       \r\n\nco-defendant who  is vicariously liable).2   So, too,  does a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2See Husky  Refining Co. v.

But no such\r\n\nruling has been cited to us, and we can find none on our own.\r\n\nIn  such  situations  we  may  refer  to  common  law  rules.\r\n\nFireman's Fund Am. Ins.  Co. v.

Perhaps  more importantly,  we do  know that\r\n\nPuerto Rico  has disallowed  double recoveries in  a somewhat\r\n\nanalogous context,  expressing a general hostility  to double\r\n\nrecovery.\r\n\n     In a set of cases, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico held\r\n\nthat  a  plaintiff's  tort  recovery  against  a non-employer\r\n\ndefendant  must  be  reduced  by  any  workers'  compensation\r\n\npayments that the plaintiff had already  received from, or on\r\n\nbehalf  of, his employer.

Tomasini appeals from an adverse judgment against him for medical malpractice.  Dr. Tomasini makes several claims of error, only one of which requires extended discussion.  On that claim, which presents a difficult question concerning offsets to damage awards, we conclude that a deduction is required in this case to account for payment already received in settlement by the plaintiff, Awilda Villarini-Garcia, from the hospital for the same injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case began with an operation performed by Dr. Tomasini in September 1986 at Hospital del Maestro in Puerto Rico.  During the operation, Dr. Tomasini removed a birthmark or mole from Villarini's back, and a piece of muscle tissue.  In her later complaint against Dr. Tomasini and the hospital, Villarini charged the doctor with negligence in removing the muscle tissue, causing her continuing pain and severely impairing her career as a concert pianist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarini did not file her complaint against the doctor and hospital until June 1990, well after Puerto Rico's normal one year statute of limitations.  31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298.  Villarini argued that the statute was tolled under Puerto Rico's discovery rule until she acquired sufficient knowledge of the basis of her claim.  The district court dismissed the case on summary judgment for failure to meet the statute of limitations, and Villarini appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court affirmed the dismissal as to three of Villarini's four claims of negligence but reversed as to one claim.  Villarini-Garcia v. Hospital Del Maestro, 8 F.3d 81 (1st Cir.1993).  On that last claim, we said that summary judgment was improper and that it was likely to be a jury question whether Villarini had exercised sufficient due diligence to give her the protection of the discovery rule.  Following remand, the hospital settled with Villarini for $50,000, and the case proceeded to trial against Dr. Tomasini.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the trial, the jury awarded Villarini $100,000 for physical and mental damage and $500,000 for loss of earnings.  Among other post-trial requests, Dr. Tomasini sought a deduction from the judgment of $50,000, representing the amount that the hospital had paid in settlement.  The district court refused.  This appeal followed.  On appeal, Dr. Tomasini makes six claims of error, the last one being the denial of the deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of the claims relate to sufficiency of the evidence:  Dr. Tomasini says that the evidence was insufficient to allow Villarini to escape the statute of limitations, or to establish malpractice, or to show causation, or to support the amount awarded.  A fifth claim is directed at testimony of an agent, who represents musicians, offered by Villarini to support her claimed loss of income;  Dr. Tomasini says that the witness was not qualified and lacked an adequate basis for his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenges to the evidence--as to timeliness, negligence, causation, and damages--are legitimate issues;  but having considered the evidence described in the briefs and set forth in the record, we think that the jury's verdict is not irrational on any of these issues and that the district court acted within its discretion in holding the expert to be qualified and his opinion adequately grounded.  There is nothing about these fact-bound issues that warrants discussion in a published opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one issue that does require discussion is Dr. Tomasini's final argument that the $600,000 jury verdict should be reduced by $50,000 to reflect the amount Villarini received in settlement from his former co-defendant, the Hospital del Maestro.  After the jury rendered its verdict, Dr. Tomasini filed a timely motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) to amend the judgment to deduct the $50,000 settlement, and the district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court based its denial on the fact that the hospital was not \"jointly\" liable for the injury along with Dr. Tomasini;  rather it was sued only on vicarious liability grounds.  See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5142.  Villarini presses the same objection on appeal.  Implicit in the district court's ruling, and explicit in Villarini's argument, is the notion that there is no right to offset an earlier settlement made by a codefendant where the remaining co-defendant did not have a right of contribution against the settling co-defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This presents a legal issue that we consider de novo, and conclude that the linkage of contribution and offset has no sound basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In almost all jurisdictions, settlement payments to the plaintiff from one of several joint tortfeasors--those who actively contributed to the same injury--reduce any judgment later secured against the nonsettling tortfeasor(s).  McDermott v. AmClyde, 511 U.S. 202, 208, 114 S.Ct. 1461, 1465, 128 L.Ed.2d 148 (1994).  The only debate is whether this reduction is to be made by a simple dollar-for-dollar offset or through a more complicated proportional liability formula.  Id. at 208-17, 114 S.Ct. at 1465-66.   See 6 Minzer et al., Damages in Tort Actions &#167; 51.25 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, the usual rule is that a plaintiff's award will not be reduced for payments or benefits received from sources independent of those who wronged him.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 920A(2) (1991);  Robertson v. White, 81 F.3d 752, 758 (8th Cir.1996).  This \"collateral source\" rule allows a plaintiff to receive payments such as charitable donations and payments from his own insurer without losing the ability to recover the full amount of his loss from the wrongdoer or wrongdoers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few courts have refused to offset payments made by a settling co-defendant who turned out later not to be liable as a joint tortfeasor with the nonsettling defendant.  E.g., Medical Center of Delaware v. Mullins, 637 A.2d 6, 9-10 (Del.1994);  Collier v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 86 Md.App. 38, 585 A.2d 256, 265-67 (1991).  The rationale of these holdings is that since the primarily liable defendant would have been obligated to pay the entire damage amount if the settling party had never been sued (or did not settle), the former should not reap the benefit of a fortuitous settlement by the latter.  Mullins, 637 A.2d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The so-called \"modern rule\" expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts is very much to the contrary:  it says that any payment \"made in compensation of a claim for a harm\" will reduce the liability of the remaining defendants, \"whether or not the person making the payment is liable to the injured person.\"  Id. &#167; 885(3) and comment (f).  See also Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 50(2) (1982).  Many cases express the right of offset in the same unqualified terms as the Restatement (although not all happen to involve a settling codefendant who is vicariously liable).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  So, too, does a lucid discussion in the leading text, together with reasons for the Restatement rule.  Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts &#167; 49, at 335-36 (5th ed.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico law is controlling in this case and if the Puerto Rico courts had spoken to the precise question before us, their expressed view would be followed here.  But no such ruling has been cited to us, and we can find none on our own.  In such situations we may refer to common law rules.  Fireman's Fund Am.  Ins. Co. v. Almacenes Miramar, Inc., 649 F.2d 21, 25 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1981);  Futurama Import Corp. v. Trans Caribbean Airways, 104 D.P.R. 609, 4 O.T.S.C.P.R. 854, 861-62 (1976).  Perhaps more importantly, we do know that Puerto Rico has disallowed double recoveries in a somewhat analogous context, expressing a general hostility to double recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a set of cases, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico held that a plaintiff's tort recovery against a non-employer defendant must be reduced by any workers' compensation payments that the plaintiff had already received from, or on behalf of, his employer.  See Robles v. Superior Court, 85 P.R.R. 640, 647 (1962);  Sanabria v. White Star Bus Line, 50 P.R.R. 722, 725 (1936);  Machado v. The American R.R. Co. of P.R., 49 P.R.R. 823, 831-32 (1936).  The Robles court said that these cases were \"inspired on the principle that no one should or may unjustly enrich himself by receiving double compensation for the same accident.\"   85 P.R.R. at 647.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The collateral source rule, also followed in Puerto Rico, Futurama, 4 O.T.S.C.P.R. at 857-60, obviously does permit double recovery in certain situations;  but it does so primarily where the extra benefit comes from insurance for which the plaintiff could easily have paid or from private generosity aimed at benefiting the victim rather than a wrongdoer.  Payments from prospective co-defendants, whether vicariously or jointly liable, are clearly of a different character.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 50, comment (e) (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent good reason--and none is suggested to us--courts are loath to promote double recoveries.  See generally Torres-Troche v. Municipality of Yauco, 873 F.2d 499, 501-02 (1st Cir.1989).  Even more troubling, without an offset the primary tortfeasor could easily be made to pay twice:  ordinarily, a vicariously liable master who settled would have an independent claim for indemnification against the careless servant.  See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5143;  Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 401 and comment (d) (1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we are told that the hospital not only paid $50,000 to Villarini but purported to transfer its claim for indemnification to Villarini;  and Villarini told us at oral argument that no further suit on the indemnification claim is now possible.  Even so, no apparent justification is suggested here for double recovery by the victim.  The jury assessed total injury at $600,000 and until Puerto Rico instructs otherwise, we see no reason why Villarini should enjoy compensation of $650,000 from the former co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court, direct that the judgment be reduced by $50,000 representing the amount paid in settlement by the hospital, and otherwise affirm the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For obvious reasons, under Puerto Rico law, as elsewhere, the active tortfeasor has no right of contribution against another whose liability to the victim is at best vicarious.

Tomasini appeals from an adverse judgment against him for medical malpractice.  Dr. Tomasini makes several claims of error, only one of which requires extended discussion.  On that claim, which presents a difficult question concerning offsets to damage awards, we conclude that a deduction is required in this case to account for payment already received in settlement by the plaintiff, Awilda Villarini-Garcia, from the hospital for the same injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case began with an operation performed by Dr. Tomasini in September 1986 at Hospital del Maestro in Puerto Rico.  During the operation, Dr. Tomasini removed a birthmark or mole from Villarini's back, and a piece of muscle tissue.  In her later complaint against Dr. Tomasini and the hospital, Villarini charged the doctor with negligence in removing the muscle tissue, causing her continuing pain and severely impairing her career as a concert pianist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Villarini did not file her complaint against the doctor and hospital until June 1990, well after Puerto Rico's normal one year statute of limitations.  31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298.  Villarini argued that the statute was tolled under Puerto Rico's discovery rule until she acquired sufficient knowledge of the basis of her claim.

Villarini-Garcia v. Hospital Del Maestro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194998\"><a href=\"/opinion/194998/villarini-garcia-v-hospital-del-maestro/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993).  On that last claim, we said that summary judgment was improper and that it was likely to be a jury question whether Villarini had exercised sufficient due diligence to give her the protection of the discovery rule.  Following remand, the hospital settled with Villarini for $50,000, and the case proceeded to trial against Dr. Tomasini.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the trial, the jury awarded Villarini $100,000 for physical and mental damage and $500,000 for loss of earnings.  Among other post-trial requests, Dr. Tomasini sought a deduction from the judgment of $50,000, representing the amount that the hospital had paid in settlement.  The district court refused.  This appeal followed.  On appeal, Dr. Tomasini makes six claims of error, the last one being the denial of the deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of the claims relate to sufficiency of the evidence:  Dr. Tomasini says that the evidence was insufficient to allow Villarini to escape the statute of limitations, or to establish malpractice, or to show causation, or to support the amount awarded.  A fifth claim is directed at testimony of an agent, who represents musicians, offered by Villarini to support her claimed loss of income;  Dr. Tomasini says that the witness was not qualified and lacked an adequate basis for his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenges to the evidence--as to timeliness, negligence, causation, and damages--are legitimate issues;  but having considered the evidence described in the briefs and set forth in the record, we think that the jury's verdict is not irrational on any of these issues and that the district court acted within its discretion in holding the expert to be qualified and his opinion adequately grounded.  There is nothing about these fact-bound issues that warrants discussion in a published opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one issue that does require discussion is Dr. Tomasini's final argument that the $600,000 jury verdict should be reduced by $50,000 to reflect the amount Villarini received in settlement from his former co-defendant, the Hospital del Maestro.  After the jury rendered its verdict, Dr. Tomasini filed a timely motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) to amend the judgment to deduct the $50,000 settlement, and the district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court based its denial on the fact that the hospital was not \"jointly\" liable for the injury along with Dr. Tomasini;  rather it was sued only on vicarious liability grounds.  See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5142.  Villarini presses the same objection on appeal.  Implicit in the district court's ruling, and explicit in Villarini's argument, is the notion that there is no right to offset an earlier settlement made by a codefendant where the remaining co-defendant did not have a right of contribution against the settling co-defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This presents a legal issue that we consider de novo, and conclude that the linkage of contribution and offset has no sound basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In almost all jurisdictions, settlement payments to the plaintiff from one of several joint tortfeasors--those who actively contributed to the same injury--reduce any judgment later secured against the nonsettling tortfeasor(s).  McDermott v. AmClyde, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117838\"><a href=\"/opinion/117838/mcdermott-inc-v-amclyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 208, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117838\"><a href=\"/opinion/117838/mcdermott-inc-v-amclyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span>, 1465, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117838\"><a href=\"/opinion/117838/mcdermott-inc-v-amclyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span> (1994).  The only debate is whether this reduction is to be made by a simple dollar-for-dollar offset or through a more complicated proportional liability formula.  Id. at 208-17, 114 S.Ct. at 1465-66.   See 6 Minzer et al., Damages in Tort Actions &#167; 51.25 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, the usual rule is that a plaintiff's award will not be reduced for payments or benefits received from sources independent of those who wronged him.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 920A(2) (1991);  Robertson v. White, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716665\"><a href=\"/opinion/716665/fed-sec-l-rep-p-99200-thomas-e-robertson-jr-as-trustee-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 758 (8th Cir.1996).  This \"collateral source\" rule allows a plaintiff to receive payments such as charitable donations and payments from his own insurer without losing the ability to recover the full amount of his loss from the wrongdoer or wrongdoers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few courts have refused to offset payments made by a settling co-defendant who turned out later not to be liable as a joint tortfeasor with the nonsettling defendant.  E.g., Medical Center of Delaware v. Mullins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1948151\"><a href=\"/opinion/1948151/medical-center-of-delaware-v-mullins/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9-10 (Del.1994);  Collier v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 86 Md.App. 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1486280\"><a href=\"/opinion/1486280/collier-v-eagle-picher-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 265-67 (1991).  The rationale of these holdings is that since the primarily liable defendant would have been obligated to pay the entire damage amount if the settling party had never been sued (or did not settle), the former should not reap the benefit of a fortuitous settlement by the latter.  Mullins, 637 A.2d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The so-called \"modern rule\" expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts is very much to the contrary:  it says that any payment \"made in compensation of a claim for a harm\" will reduce the liability of the remaining defendants, \"whether or not the person making the payment is liable to the injured person.\"  Id. &#167; 885(3) and comment (f).  See also Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 50(2) (1982).  Many cases express the right of offset in the same unqualified terms as the Restatement (although not all happen to involve a settling codefendant who is vicariously liable).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  So, too, does a lucid discussion in the leading text, together with reasons for the Restatement rule.  Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts &#167; 49, at 335-36 (5th ed.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico law is controlling in this case and if the Puerto Rico courts had spoken to the precise question before us, their expressed view would be followed here.  But no such ruling has been cited to us, and we can find none on our own.  In such situations we may refer to common law rules.  Fireman's Fund Am.  Ins. Co. v. Almacenes Miramar, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390422\"><a href=\"/opinion/390422/firemans-fund-american-insurance-company-and-masters-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 25 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1981);  Futurama Import Corp. v. Trans Caribbean Airways, 104 D.P.R. 609, 4 O.T.S.C.P.R. 854, 861-62 (1976).  Perhaps more importantly, we do know that Puerto Rico has disallowed double recoveries in a somewhat analogous context, expressing a general hostility to double recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a set of cases, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico held that a plaintiff's tort recovery against a non-employer defendant must be reduced by any workers' compensation payments that the plaintiff had already received from, or on behalf of, his employer.  See Robles v. Superior Court, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></span>, 647 (1962);  Sanabria v. White Star Bus Line, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span>, 725 (1936);  Machado v. The American R.R. Co. of P.R., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></span>, 831-32 (1936).  The Robles court said that these cases were \"inspired on the principle that no one should or may unjustly enrich himself by receiving double compensation for the same accident.\"   85 P.R.R. at 647.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The collateral source rule, also followed in Puerto Rico, Futurama, 4 O.T.S.C.P.R. at 857-60, obviously does permit double recovery in certain situations;  but it does so primarily where the extra benefit comes from insurance for which the plaintiff could easily have paid or from private generosity aimed at benefiting the victim rather than a wrongdoer.  Payments from prospective co-defendants, whether vicariously or jointly liable, are clearly of a different character.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 50, comment (e) (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent good reason--and none is suggested to us--courts are loath to promote double recoveries.  See generally Torres-Troche v. Municipality of Yauco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522156\"><a href=\"/opinion/522156/carlos-torres-troche-v-municipality-of-yauco/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 501-02 (1st Cir.1989).  Even more troubling, without an offset the primary tortfeasor could easily be made to pay twice:  ordinarily, a vicariously liable master who settled would have an independent claim for indemnification against the careless servant.  See 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5143;  Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 401 and comment (d) (1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we are told that the hospital not only paid $50,000 to Villarini but purported to transfer its claim for indemnification to Villarini;  and Villarini told us at oral argument that no further suit on the indemnification claim is now possible.  Even so, no apparent justification is suggested here for double recovery by the victim.  The jury assessed total injury at $600,000 and until Puerto Rico instructs otherwise, we see no reason why Villarini should enjoy compensation of $650,000 from the former co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court, direct that the judgment be reduced by $50,000 representing the amount paid in settlement by the hospital, and otherwise affirm the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For obvious reasons, under Puerto Rico law, as elsewhere, the active tortfeasor has no right of contribution against another whose liability to the victim is at best vicarious.

Consolidated Mortgage, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479204\"><a href=\"/opinion/479204/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-consolidated-mortgage-and-finance/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1986)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See Husky Refining Co. v.
