Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                and O'Toole, District Judge.\r\n\n   Elisa Bobonis Lang for appellants.\r\n   Luis R. Perez-Giusti, with whom Leonard Mignucci &amp; Perez\r\nGiusti was on brief for appellees.\r\n\nDecember 8, 1999\r\n\n                                CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  This appeal is from the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction of\r\nplaintiffs DeCastros' diversity action for personal injuries caused\r\nby a waste disposal truck in Puerto Rico.  Plaintiffs have sued\r\nSanifill, Inc. (\"Sanifill\"), a Delaware corporation with its\r\nprincipal place of business in Houston, Texas.  On the basis of\r\ndocumentary evidence garnered in the course of limited discovery,\r\nthe district court held that Sanifill lacked the minimum contacts\r\nnecessary for  Puerto Rico to exercise personal jurisdiction over\r\nit.  The district court also dismissed the action insofar as it\r\nsought to proceed against \"John Doe, Inc., Richard Doe and ABC\r\nWaste, Inc.\"  We affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\nIn dismissing the complaint against Sanifill, the\r\ndistrict court determined, in effect, that the activities of\r\nrelevance to the truck-caused injury in Puerto Rico were largely\r\nattributable to Sanifill's wholly-owned Puerto Rican subsidiaries,\r\nprimarily two Puerto Rican corporations named Sanifill of San Juan,\r\nInc. (\"Sanifill San Juan\") and E.C. Waste of Puerto Rico, Inc.\r\n(\"E.C. Waste\").  Sanifill San Juan was organized on August 21,\r\n1995, and E.C. Waste on October 31, 1995.  On August 25, 1995  \r\nprior to the  formation of E.C. Waste   a municipal solid waste\r\nservices agreement was executed between the Municipality of San\r\nJuan and a joint venture entitled El Coqui of San Juan (\"El\r\nCoqui\"), the latter described as being composed of the two said\r\ncorporations.  Signing for the joint venture were the general\r\nmanager and officers of E.C. Waste and Sanifill San Juan.  \r\nThe injury for which plaintiffs sued occurred on January\r\n3, 1996.  The truck alleged to have caused the accident was\r\nregistered to Sanifill San Juan.  It was used for hauling waste\r\npursuant to the August 25, 1995, agreement between the Municipality\r\nof San Juan and the joint venture, El Coqui.  Its driver is said to\r\nhave been employed by the joint venture itself.\r\nThere is no evidence directly establishing that Sanifill,\r\nthe parent corporation, owned or operated the truck or controlled\r\nthe day-to-day activities of its subsidiaries or of the joint\r\nventure.  Clearly, Sanifill's mere ownership of the two local\r\ncorporate entities that participated in the El Coqui joint venture\r\nwould not establish a measure of control over them sufficient for\r\nus to reject their own corporate identity; nor would the fact that\r\nthe officers and directors of the two local corporations were also\r\nofficers and directors of the parent.  See United Elec., Radio and\r\nMach. Workers of America v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp., 960 F.2d\r\n1080, 1091 (1st Cir. 1992), rev'd on other grounds, 987 F.2d 39\r\n(1st Cir. 1993); Miller v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., 779 F.2d 769, 772\r\n(1st Cir. 1985); Escude Cruz v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 619\r\nF.2d 902, 905 (1st Cir. 1980).\r\nThis court has said, citing a pronouncement of the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico, that to establish jurisdiction over\r\nthe parent, a party must produce \"strong and robust\" evidence of\r\ncontrol by the parent company over the subsidiary, rendering the\r\nlatter a \"mere shell.\"  Escude Cruz, 619 F.2d at 905, citing San\r\nMiguel Fertilizer v. P.R. Drydock &amp; Marine Terminals, 94 P.R.R.\r\n403, 409 (1967).  In the present case, while there was no direct\r\nevidence of parental involvement, as such, in the day-to-day\r\nactivities of the two subsidiaries or in their joint venture, the\r\nplaintiffs point to convincing evidence that the subsidiaries\r\nlacked assets and were not themselves active following execution of\r\nthe waste haulage agreement on behalf of the joint venture.  Apart\r\nfrom certificates attesting to the organization of the two\r\nsubsidiary corporations on the above dates, there is little else to\r\nsuggest their viability.  Annual reports for 1995 and 1996 that\r\nwere filed after the accident with Puerto Rican authorities on\r\nbehalf of each company list the names of directors but state\r\nexpressly that both corporations had zero assets in 1995 and 1996. \r\nLetters from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, directed to the subsidiaries'\r\nrespective boards of directors, state that the accountants had\r\nconducted no audit of either company's books because each company\r\n\"was inactive and had no assets within Puerto Rico in the year\r\n1996.\"  From this it can be surmised that neither subsidiary\r\nmaintained books or records indicating the value of its interest in\r\nthe joint venture, nor had active bank accounts or employees on its\r\npayroll.  The parent, Sanifill, presumably received the proceeds\r\nfrom its Puerto Rican ventures in some manner, but not through the\r\nostensible venturers, Sanifill San Juan and E.C. Waste.\r\nIt thus appears that, besides executing the waste haulage\r\nagreement with the municipality of San Juan in August of 1995 on\r\nbehalf of the El Coqui joint venture, and registering the truck in\r\nquestion in the name of Sanifill San Juan, neither subsidiary was\r\nactive.  This assumption is consistent not only with the companies'\r\nannual reports and their accountants' statements, but with an\r\nunsworn declaration filed on behalf of defendants by Pablo De Jesus\r\nRamos, who stated therein that he was the operations manager of El\r\nCoqui, the joint venture.  In the declaration, De Jesus Ramos\r\nindicated that the decisional and operational activities of the\r\njoint venture under the contract with the Municipality of San Juan\r\nwere conducted directly by El Coqui itself.  We note also the\r\nexistence of another corporate subsidiary of Sanifill entitled El\r\nCoqui de San Juan, Inc., which conceivably assisted in the\r\noperations of the joint venture, although its actual role is not\r\nexplained anywhere in the record.\r\nThe question arises on these facts whether the two\r\nsubsidiaries in question were so shell-like by virtue of their\r\ninactivity as to forfeit recognition as corporations separate from\r\ntheir parent, whose interests they serve.  In determining whether\r\nto disregard the corporate form, courts normally conduct a highly\r\nfact-specific inquiry, including, inter alia, consideration of the\r\nextent to which a subsidiary may have disregarded corporate\r\nformalities; the degree of control exercised by the parent over the\r\nday-to-day operations of the subsidiary; overlap in ownership,\r\nofficers, directors, and personnel; and whether the subsidiary was\r\nadequately capitalized.  See Miller v. Honda Motor Co., 779 F.2d\r\n769, 772 (1st Cir. 1985) (applying Massachusetts law); Gardemal v.\r\nWestin Hotel Co., 186 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir. 1999) (applying\r\nTexas law); Wm. Passalaqua Builders, Inc. v. Resnick Developers\r\nSouth, Inc., 933 F.2d 131, 139 (2d Cir. 1991) (applying New York\r\nlaw).  See also William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the\r\nLaw of Private Corporations  43.70 (1999 ed.).\r\nIn some cases, undercapitalization has been held to\r\nindicate that the company is merely a \"conduit or business tool.\" \r\nGardemal, 186 F.3d at 593-94.  See also Birbara v. Locke, 99 F.3d\r\n1233, 1241 (1st Cir. 1996); 163 Pleasant Street Corp., 960 F.2d at\r\n1093.  The adequacy of capital, however, is determined within the \r\ncontext of the relevant corporate purposes and activities, see NLRB\r\nv. Greater Kansas City Roofing, 2 F.3d 1047, 1053 &amp; n.8 (10th Cir.\r\n1993), and one can argue here that no capital was shown to have\r\nbeen needed for Sanifill San Juan and E.C. Waste to enter into the\r\njoint venture.  Undercapitalization has been called a particularly\r\ncritical factor in tort cases, where equitable concern about a\r\ncompany's inability to pay a judgment to a prevailing plaintiff\r\ncomes into play.  See Gardemal, 186 F.3d at 594; Fletcher, supra at\r\n41.45.  Still, the mere lack of funding has been held\r\ninsufficient to pierce the corporate veil, and courts are reluctant\r\nto infer injustice unless the particular facts so suggest.  See\r\nGreater Kansas City Roofing, 2 F.3d at 1053 &amp;  n.8, and cases\r\ncited.\r\nHere, the apparent purpose of the subsidiaries was to set\r\nup the El Coqui joint venture and empower it (rather than\r\nthemselves) to carry out the functions described in the affidavit\r\nof De Jesus Ramos: i.e., quality control; execution of contracts;\r\nsupervision, hiring and firing of personnel; and accounting and\r\ninvoicing.  When viewed \"in light of the nature and magnitude of\r\nthe corporate undertaking,\" the lack of capital does not\r\nnecessarily indicate that each subsidiary is merely a \"conduit or\r\nbusiness tool\" of Sanifill.  See id. at 1053 n.8.  As we have\r\nsaid, there is no direct evidence of Sanifill's control of day-to-\r\nday operations.  And while inferring such control from the\r\ninactivity of the subsidiaries might be appropriate under some\r\ncircumstances, here there is evidence that the decision-making and\r\nday-to-day operational functions were carried out by the El Coqui\r\njoint venture itself rather than Sanifill.  Furthermore, while\r\nthere is substantial overlap among the officers and directors of\r\nSanifill and the subsidiaries, formal corporate separateness was\r\nobserved at the most basic level.  In sum, although this is a close\r\ncase, we are inclined to believe that these facts fall short of the\r\n\"strong and robust\" evidence required to pierce the corporate veil\r\nunder Puerto Rico law.\r\n                            II.\r\nThe district court also dismissed plaintiffs' claims\r\nagainst several unnamed defendants for failure to prosecute,\r\nstating that those defendants had not been identified or summoned. \r\nPlaintiffs contend that this was error, as discovery thus far had\r\nbeen limited to the issue of personal jurisdiction and they had not\r\nyet had the opportunity to identify the unnamed defendants.  \r\nWe review a district court's dismissal for failure to\r\nprosecute for abuse of discretion.  Benjamin v. Aroostook Medical\r\nCenter, Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).  In their\r\ncomplaint, plaintiffs described \"John Doe, Inc.\" and \"Richard Doe\"\r\nas being \"in charge of the business operation that used and\r\ncontrolled the vehicle that caused the accident, the owners of such\r\nvehicle, or the persons responsible for its use, operation and\r\nmaintenance.\"  Moreover, they stated that \"ABC Waste Inc.\" is an\r\nunnamed corporation \"who acquire or merge with Sanifill\" [sic]. \r\nThe purported roles of these unnamed defendants are very closely\r\nlinked with the issues of corporate identity that were the subject\r\nof the jurisdictional discovery that the district court allowed. \r\nWe think that the allowed discovery afforded plaintiffs sufficient\r\nopportunity to pursue these defendants' identities.  Accordingly,\r\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the\r\ncomplaint against the unnamed defendants.\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n",

When viewed \"in light of the nature and magnitude of\r\nthe corporate undertaking,\" the lack of capital does not\r\nnecessarily indicate that each subsidiary is merely a \"conduit or\r\nbusiness tool\" of Sanifill.  See id. at 1053 n.8.  As we have\r\nsaid, there is no direct evidence of Sanifill's control of day-to-\r\nday operations.  And while inferring such control from the\r\ninactivity of the subsidiaries might be appropriate under some\r\ncircumstances, here there is evidence that the decision-making and\r\nday-to-day operational functions were carried out by the El Coqui\r\njoint venture itself rather than Sanifill.  Furthermore, while\r\nthere is substantial overlap among the officers and directors of\r\nSanifill and the subsidiaries, formal corporate separateness was\r\nobserved at the most basic level.  In sum, although this is a close\r\ncase, we are inclined to believe that these facts fall short of the\r\n\"strong and robust\" evidence required to pierce the corporate veil\r\nunder Puerto Rico law.\r\n                            II.\r\nThe district court also dismissed plaintiffs' claims\r\nagainst several unnamed defendants for failure to prosecute,\r\nstating that those defendants had not been identified or summoned. \r\nPlaintiffs contend that this was error, as discovery thus far had\r\nbeen limited to the issue of personal jurisdiction and they had not\r\nyet had the opportunity to identify the unnamed defendants.  \r\nWe review a district court's dismissal for failure to\r\nprosecute for abuse of discretion.  Benjamin v. Aroostook Medical\r\nCenter, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196155\"><a href=\"/opinion/196155/benjamin-v-aroostook-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).  In their\r\ncomplaint, plaintiffs described \"John Doe, Inc.\" and \"Richard Doe\"\r\nas being \"in charge of the business operation that used and\r\ncontrolled the vehicle that caused the accident, the owners of such\r\nvehicle, or the persons responsible for its use, operation and\r\nmaintenance.\"  Moreover, they stated that \"ABC Waste Inc.\" is an\r\nunnamed corporation \"who acquire or merge with Sanifill\" [sic]. \r\nThe purported roles of these unnamed defendants are very closely\r\nlinked with the issues of corporate identity that were the subject\r\nof the jurisdictional discovery that the district court allowed. \r\nWe think that the allowed discovery afforded plaintiffs sufficient\r\nopportunity to pursue these defendants' identities.  Accordingly,\r\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the\r\ncomplaint against the unnamed defendants.\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n</pre>",
