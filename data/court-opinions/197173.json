Her  belongings  arrived at  their\r\n\ndestination on August 27,  but certain items were missing.   Rini\r\n\nproceeded  to file a claim with United.  Following an acrimonious\r\n\nattempt to settle the  claim, Rini filed a complaint  in district\r\n\ncourt  on December 22, 1992.  The complaint included claims under\r\n\nthe Carmack  Amendment to the Interstate Commerce  Act, 49 U.S.C.\r\n\n  11707  (1992),1 as  well  as state  law  claims of  negligence,\r\n\nmisrepresentation, use of unfair  and deceptive acts in violation\r\n\nof Mass.

See Rini, 903 F. Supp. at  230.  On the claim of\r                                   \r\n\nintentional infliction of emotional  distress, the jury found for\r\n\nUnited.   Id.  The district court  found that United, in handling\r                       \r\n\nRini's claim, had willfully violated chapter 93A.

In addition, Rini was awarded attorney's fees in the  amount\r\n\nof $146,950,  costs in the  amount of $7,359.60,  and prejudgment\r\n\ninterest in  the amount of  $100,000.

This appeal by United ensued.\r\n\n          We must determine whether the state law claims on which\r\n\nRini prevailed are  preempted by  the Carmack  Amendment.   These\r\n\nclaims are  for negligence,  misrepresentation, and  violation of\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 93A.\r\n\n             I.  Preemption and the Carmack Amendment\r                       I.  Preemption and the Carmack Amendment\r\n\n          The  Carmack Amendment to  the Interstate Commerce Act,\r\n\n49 U.S.C.    11707, passed  in 1906 as  part of the  Hepburn Act,\r\n\nch. 5391, 34  Stat. 584,  governs the  liability of carriers  for\r\n\nlost  or damaged goods.   The relevant portions  of the Amendment\r\n\nare:\r\n\n            A  common carrier  . .  . subject  to the\r\n            jurisdiction  of the  Interstate Commerce\r\n            Commission . . . shall issue a receipt or\r\n            a bill of lading for property it receives\r\n            for transportation . .  . .  That carrier\r\n            . . .  and any other common  carrier that\r\n            delivers  the  property and  is providing\r\n            transportation or service subject  to the\r\n            jurisdiction  of the Commission . . . are\r\n            liable  to the person entitled to recover\r\n            under the receipt or bill of lading.  The\r\n            liability imposed under this paragraph is\r\n            for actual loss or injury to the property\r\n            caused by (1)  the receiving carrier, (2)\r\n            the  delivering  carrier, or  (3) another\r\n            carrier  over  whose lines  or  route the\r\n            property is transported  into the  United\r\n            States . . . .\r\n\n49 U.S.C.   11707.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Article VI  of the United States  Constitution provides\r\n\nthat the laws of the  United States \"shall be the supreme  Law of\r\n\nthe Land,\" notwithstanding contrary state laws.  U.S. Const. art.\r\n\nVI,   2.   It is settled, therefore, \"that  all conflicting state\r\n\nprovisions be without effect.\"   Maryland v. Louisiana, 451  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n725, 746 (1981).  When faced with a preemption question, however,\r\n\nconsideration  \"starts with  the  assumption  that  the  historic\r\n\npowers of the States [are] not to be superseded  by . . . Federal\r\n\nActs  unless  that  [is]  the   clear  and  manifest  purpose  of\r\n\nCongress.\"  Rice  v. Santa Fe Elevator  Corp., 331 U.S.  218, 230\r                                                       \r\n\n(1947).\r\n\n            Such  a purpose  [to displace  state law]\r\n            may be  evidenced in  several ways.   The\r\n            scheme  of federal  regulation may  be so\r\n            pervasive  as  to  make   reasonable  the\r\n            inference that Congress left no  room for\r\n            the States to supplement  it.  Or the Act\r\n            of Congress  may touch  a field  in which\r\n            the federal interest is so  dominant that\r\n            the  federal  system will  be  assumed to\r\n            preclude enforcement of state laws in the\r\n            same  subject.    Likewise,   the  object\r\n            sought to  be obtained by the federal law\r\n            and the character of  obligations imposed\r\n            by it may reveal the same purpose.\r\n\nId.   Finally, a  state statute is  void to the  extent it  is in\r             \r\n\nconflict with a federal statute.  Maryland, 451 U.S. at 747.\r                                                    \r\n\n          In determining the scope of Carmack preemption, we look\r\n\nto the intent of Congress and  the purpose of the Amendment.  Our\r\n\ninquiry  into the  intent  of  Congress  is made  more  difficult\r\n\nbecause the  Carmack Amendment was adopted  without discussion or\r\n\ndebate.  40  Cong. Rec. 7075  (1906).  It  is accepted,  however,\r\n\nthat the  principal  purpose  of the  Amendment  was  to  achieve\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nnational uniformity in the liability assigned to carriers.  \"[I]t\r\n\nis evident that  Congress intended  to adopt a  uniform rule  and\r\n\nrelieve such contracts from the diverse regulation to  which they\r\n\nhad  been theretofore subject.\"   Adams Express Co. v. Croninger,\r                                                                          \r\n\n226  U.S.  491, 506  (1912).   The  importance of  uniformity has\r\n\nfrequently  been stressed  in subsequent Supreme  Court opinions.\r\n\nSee, e.g., New York, N.H.  &amp; Hartford R.R. Co. v.  Nothnagle, 346\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 128, 131 (1953); Atchison, Topeka  &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. Harold,\r                                                                          \r\n\n241 U.S. 371, 378 (1916).\r\n\n          The foundation for Carmack preemption analysis is Adams\r                                                                           \r\n\nExpress,  in which  the Supreme  Court considered  the preemptive\r                 \r\n\nscope of the Carmack Amendment, concluding:\r\n\n            That the legislation  supersedes all  the\r\n            regulations and policies of  a particular\r\n            state upon the same subject  results from\r\n            its general character.   It embraces  the\r\n            subject of  the liability of  the carrier\r\n            under  a bill  of  lading which  he  must\r\n            issue,  and  limits his  power  to exempt\r\n            himself by rule, regulation, or contract.\r\n            Almost every  detail  of the  subject  is\r\n            covered so completely  that there can  be\r\n            no  rational  doubt  but   that  Congress\r\n            intended  to  take   possession  of   the\r\n            subject,   and    supersede   all   state\r\n            regulation with reference to it.\r\n\nAdams Express, 226 U.S. at 505-06.  The Court stated further that\r                       \r\n\nto  allow state regulations  to affect the  liability of carriers\r\n\n\"would  be to  revert  to the  uncertainties  and diversities  of\r\n\nrulings which led to the amendment.\"  Id. at 506.\r                                                   \r\n\n          The  preemptive effect  of the  Carmack  Amendment over\r\n\nstate law  governing damages for the loss  or damage of goods has\r\n\nbeen reiterated by  the Supreme Court in  many cases and  is well\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nestablished.   See,  e.g.,  Southeastern Express  Co. v.  Pastime\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmusement  Co.,  299 U.S.  28  (1936)  (claim of  negligence  for\r                        \r\n\nfailure to deliver  a film  on time is  preempted); Charleston  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nWestern Carolina Ry.

Varnville Furniture Co., 237 U.S. 597\r                                                             \r\n\n(1915) (state  statute  imposing a  penalty  for failure  to  pay\r\n\nclaims to a shipper within 40 days is preempted).\r\n\n          Unfortunately, the  Supreme Court  case  law  does  not\r\n\nprovide clear guidance  on the reach of the  preemption doctrine.\r\n\nIn  particular, the Court has  not clarified the  extent to which\r\n\nstate law provisions pertaining to the claims process, as opposed\r\n\nto the shipping of goods, are preempted.  Two cases, however, are\r\n\ninstructive.  First, in Missouri, Kansas, &amp; Texas Railway Company\r                                                                           \r\n\nof  Texas v. Harris, 234 U.S. 412  (1914), the Court considered a\r                             \r\n\nTexas  statute  that  allowed  for  the  recovery  of  reasonable\r\n\nattorney's  fees in cases where  the value of  the claims did not\r\n\nexceed  two hundred  dollars.   The Court  held that  because the\r\n\nstate statute at issue \"had a broad sweep which only incidentally\r\n\nincludes  claims rising  out of  interstate commerce,  it follows\r\n\nthat it  cannot be held to  constitute a direct burden  upon such\r\n\ncommerce.\"  Id. at 416.   For this reason, the statute  was ruled\r                         \r\n\nto  be valid and able  to exist alongside  the Carmack Amendment.\r\n\nThe important distinction made  by the Court was that  \"the Texas\r\n\nstatute  . .  . does  not  anywhere either  enlarge or  limit the\r\n\nresponsibility of  the carrier for the loss of property intrusted\r\n\nto it in transportation, and only incidentally affects the remedy\r\n\nfor  enforcing that responsibility.\"   Id. at  420.  Furthermore,\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n\"[t]he  local statute . . . does not  at all affect the ground of\r\n\nrecovery,  or the  measure  of recovery;  it  deals only  with  a\r\n\nquestion  of costs,  respecting which  Congress has  not spoken.\"\r\n\nId. at 421-22.\r             \r\n\n          Second,  in Varnville,  the  Court ruled  that a  South\r                                         \r\n\nCarolina  statute  that imposed  a fine  of  $50 on  carriers for\r\n\nfailure to  pay within 40 days for damage to goods transported in\r\n\ninterstate  commerce  was  preempted by  the  Carmack  Amendment.\r\n\nVarnville,  237  U.S. at  603.   The  Court determined  that \"the\r                   \r\n\nspecial regulations  and policies  of particular states  upon the\r\n\nsubject  of  the  carrier's  liability  for  loss  or  damage  to\r\n\ninterstate shipments, and the  contracts of carriers with respect\r\n\nthereto,  have been superseded.\"  Id. at  603.  The state statute\r                                               \r\n\nbefore  the  Court was  found to  \"overlap[]  the Federal  act in\r\n\nrespect of the subjects, the grounds, and the extent of liability\r\n\nfor loss.\"  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          These  two cases  are  of particular  relevance to  the\r\n\ninstant  case  because the  state laws  at  issue did  not govern\r\n\nclaims arising directly out of damage to goods.  Like the instant\r\n\ncase, both  Harris and   Varnville  consider state  remedies that\r                                            \r\n\nrelate  to the claims process.   The distinction  between the two\r\n\ncases was made in Varnville, where the Court stated that:\r                                     \r\n\n            [i]t   is  true  that   in  [Harris]  the\r                                                         \r\n            inclusion  of  the  attorney's  fee,  not\r\n            exceeding   $20,   in   the  costs   upon\r\n            judgments  for  certain small  claims was\r\n            upheld,  although  incidentally including\r\n            some  claims  arising  out of  interstate\r\n            commerce.    But  apart  from  the effect\r\n            being only incidental, the  ground relied\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n            upon was that the statute did not 'in any\r\n            way  enlarge  the  responsibility of  the\r\n            carrier' for  loss or 'at all  affect the\r\n            ground  of  recovery, or  the  measure of\r\n            recovery'.   The  South Carolina  Act, on\r\n            the other hand, extends the  liability to\r\n            losses   on   other   roads    in   other\r\n            jurisdictions, and increases it by a fine\r\n            difficult to escape.\r\n\nId. at 603 (citations omitted).\r             \r\n\n          The lesson from these cases is  that state statutes are\r\n\npreempted  by the Carmack Amendment  if they \"in  any way enlarge\r\n\nthe responsibility  of the carrier for loss  or at all affect the\r\n\nground of recovery, or the measure of recovery.\"  Id.\r                                                               \r\n\n          The  Carmack   Amendment   and  the   set  of   federal\r\n\nregulations  that  complement  it   cover  not  only  the  actual\r\n\ntransport of goods, but they also govern the claims process.  For\r\n\nexample,  the Amendment itself  provides that a  carrier \"may not\r\n\nprovide . . . a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim .\r\n\n. . and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action\r\n\nagainst it under this section.\"  49 U.S.C.   11707(e).2\r\n\n          In light of  the Court's holding in  Varnville, we find\r                                                                  \r\n\nthat  all state laws that  impose liability on  carriers based on\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2     See  also  49  C.F.R.      1005.2-1005.5.    These  federal\r                         \r\nregulations govern the filing of claims,   1005.2, acknowledgment\r\nof  claims,    1005.3, investigation  of  claims,    1005.4,  and\r\ndisposition  of claims,   1005.5.   Failure to  comply with these\r\nfederal regulations subjects the carrier  to sanctions.  See Zola\r                                                                           \r\nv.

Although\r                        \r\n\"the mere existence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme\r\n. .  . does not  by itself  imply preemption of  state remedies,\"\r\nEnglish v. General Elec. Co.,  496 U.S. 72, 87 (1990), the  above\r                                      \r\nfederal regulations  indicate that  the claims process  is within\r\nthe scope  of the  shipper-carrier relationship that  the federal\r\ngovernment seeks to regulate.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthe  loss or damage of shipped goods  are preempted.  A state law\r                                              \r\n\n\"enlarges  the responsibility of the  carrier for loss  or at all\r\n\naffects  the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery,\" id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 603,  where, in the  absence of an  injury separate and  apart\r\n\nfrom the loss  or damage of goods, it increases  the liability of\r\n\nthe carrier.   Preempted state law claims, therefore, include all\r\n\nliability  stemming  from  damage  or loss  of  goods,  liability\r\n\nstemming  from the claims  process, and liability  related to the\r\n\npayment  of claims.   Thus, the  forty day  limit for  payment at\r\n\nissue  in Varnville is preempted.   On the  other hand, liability\r                             \r\n\narising from separate harms  -- apart from the loss or  damage of\r\n\ngoods --  is not preempted.   For example, if an  employee of the\r\n\ncarrier  assaulted and  injured the  shipper, state  law remedies\r\n\nwould not  be  preempted.   Similarly,  a claim  for  intentional\r\n\ninfliction of  emotional distress alleges  a harm to  the shipper\r\n\nthat is  independent from  the loss  or damage  to goods  and, as\r\n\nsuch, would not be preempted.3\r\n\n                         II.  Application\r                                   II.  Application\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   We are aware  that our holding  today conflicts with  certain\r\nprevious decisions  of the District  Court of Massachusetts.   In\r\nparticular, we note that the cases of Sokhos v. Mayflower Transit\r                                                                           \r\nInc.,  691 F. Supp. 1578 (D. Mass  1988), and Mesta v. Allied Van\r                                                                           \r\nLines,  695 F. Supp. 63  (D. Mass. 1988),  allowed certain claims\r               \r\nthat  would  be preempted  under the  decision  that we  lay down\r\ntoday.  To the  extent these decisions are inconsistent  with our\r\nholding, they  do not represent the  law of the circuit.   We are\r\nalso aware that our own decision in Fredette v. Allied van Lines,\r                                                                          \r\n66  F.3d 369 (1st Cir. 1995), involved both Carmack Amendment and\r\nstate  law claims.   Id.  at 372.   That  case did  not, however,\r                                  \r\naddress  the  preemption  issue  and,  therefore,  offers  us  no\r\nguidance.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          In the instant  appeal, the state  law claims at  issue\r\n\nall stem  from the  loss of  goods.   The alleged negligence  and\r\n\nmisrepresentation took  place in the  course of settling  a claim\r\n\nfor damages stemming from the move.   Rini suffered no harm other\r\n\nthan the loss  of goods and, therefore, her state  law claims are\r\n\npreempted  by the Carmack Amendment.   Had Rini  prevailed on her\r\n\nclaim for intentional infliction  of emotional distress, it would\r\n\nnot have been preempted.  Because the three state claims at issue\r\n\nin  this  appeal involve  no injury  save  the loss  of property,\r\n\nhowever, we find them to be preempted.\r\n\n          Our conclusion is consistent with the view taken by the\r\n\nSecond Circuit in Cleveland v. Beltman North American Company, 30\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 373 (2d Cir. 1994), cert denied,  115 S. Ct. 901 (1995).  In\r                                              \r\n\nthat  case, the  court described  the plaintiffs'  allegations as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n            In   handling  plaintiffs'   claims,  the\r\n            moving  company --  in  a deliberate  and\r\n            determined     effort    to     frustrate\r\n            plaintiffs'  collection  of  damages  for\r\n            their  losses  --  was  guilty  of  foot-\r\n            dragging  and stonewalling.   It  did not\r\n            deal fairly  and in good  faith with  the\r\n            couple.\r\n\nId.  at 374.   The  claim addressed  by the  court was  a federal\r             \r\n\ncommon law claim for breach of  an implied covenant of good faith\r\n\nand  fair dealing in the claims process, damages from which \"were\r\n\nto be exclusive of damages awarded for actual loss under the bill\r\n\nof lading.\"   Id. at  376.   The Second Circuit  held that  there\r                           \r\n\ncould be no federal common law  claim for a breach of the implied\r\n\ncovenant of  good faith  and fair dealing.   Id.  at 379.   In so\r                                                          \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ndeciding, the court concluded  that \"[a] claim for breach  of the\r\n\nimplied covenant of good  faith and fair dealing resulting  in an\r\n\naward  of punitive damages could  well thwart one  of the primary\r\n\npurposes  of  the Carmack  Amendment;  that is,  to  provide some\r\n\nuniformity in the disposition  of claims brought under a  bill of\r\n\nlading.\"  Id.  Although Cleveland dealt with an  issue of federal\r                                           \r\n\ncommon law, the  same reasoning implies  that state law  remedies\r\n\nfor loss or damage to goods would be preempted.\r\n\n          The  instant case  presents  the same  question as  did\r\n\nCleveland.  We face a plaintiff  who has been ill-treated in  her\r                   \r\n\nattempts  to  settle her  claim  with  United.   As  a  result of\r\n\nUnited's  unfair  practices,  the  jury  found  for  Rini on  the\r\n\nnegligence and misrepresentation counts and the trial judge found\r\n\nfor Rini on the use of unfair and deceptive acts count.  Like our\r\n\nsister circuit before us, we note that although \"[i]t may be that\r\n\nCongress'  enforcement  scheme  does  not  provide  a  sufficient\r\n\ndeterrent  to the  type of  conduct  defendants employed  in this\r\n\ncase,\" id.  at 379, we find that the federal scheme has preempted\r                    \r\n\nnegligence, misrepresentation, and chapter 93A claims.\r\n\n          Finally,  we  note   that  our  ruling   preserves  the\r\n\nuniformity  of  the  federal  scheme by  protecting  the  federal\r\n\ngovernment's  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  the  shipper-carrier\r\n\nrelationship,  the importance  of which  has been  underscored on\r\n\nnumerous occasions.4   \"The purpose of [the Carmack Amendment] is\r\n\nto  establish  uniform federal  guidelines  designed  in part  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  See supra pp. 4-5.\r                      \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nremove  the uncertainty  surrounding a  carrier's liability  when\r\n\ndamage occurs  to a  shipper's interstate  shipment.\"   Hughes v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited Van Lines, Inc., 829 F.2d 1407, 1415  (7th Cir. 1987); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso Cleveland, 30 F.3d  at 379 (stating that one  of the primary\r                        \r\n\npurposes of the Carmack Amendment is to provide uniformity in the\r\n\ndisposition of claims brought  under a bill of lading).   Because\r\n\nthe  Carmack  Amendment was  intended  to  provide uniformity  to\r\n\nclaims for the loss or damage to goods, the goal of uniformity is\r\n\nnot  frustrated by the allowance of state law claims for injuries\r\n\nthat are separate and distinct from such loss or damage.\r\n\n                         III.  Conclusion\r                                   III.  Conclusion\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  conclusion  of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court regarding  the preemptive  effect of  the Carmack\r\n\nAmendment  is reversed.   In  light of  our ruling,  the district\r                                \r\n\ncourt's judgment  as to costs, fees and prejudgment interest must\r\n\nbe revisited.  The case is remanded to the district court for the\r                                             \r\n\nentry of an order with  respect to damages and a ruling  on fees,\r\n\ncosts, and interest consistent with this decision.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n",

Our inquiry into the intent of Congress is made more difficult because the Carmack Amendment was adopted without discussion or debate.  40 Cong.  Rec. 7075 (1906).  It is accepted, however, that the principal purpose of the Amendment was to achieve national uniformity in the liability assigned to carriers.  \"[I]t is evident that Congress intended to adopt a uniform rule and relieve such contracts from the diverse regulation to which they had been theretofore subject.\"  Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U.S. 491, 506, 33 S.Ct. 148, 152, 57 L.Ed. 314 (1913).  The importance of uniformity has frequently been stressed in subsequent Supreme Court opinions.  See, e.g., New York, N.H. &amp; Hartford R.R. Co. v. Nothnagle, 346 U.S. 128, 131, 73 S.Ct. 986, 988, 97 L.Ed. 1500 (1953);  Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v.

It embraces the subject of the liability of the carrier under a bill of lading which he must issue, and limits his power to exempt himself by rule, regulation, or contract.  Almost every detail of the subject is covered so completely that there can be no rational doubt but that Congress intended to take possession of the subject, and supersede all state regulation with reference to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams Express, 226 U.S. at 505-06, 33 S.Ct. at 152.   The Court stated further that to allow state regulations to affect the liability of carriers \"would be to revert to the uncertainties and diversities of rulings which led to the amendment.\"  Id. at 506, 33 S.Ct. at 152.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preemptive effect of the Carmack Amendment over state law governing damages for the loss or damage of goods has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in many cases and is well established.  See, e.g., Southeastern Express Co. v. Pastime Amusement Co., 299 U.S. 28, 57 S.Ct. 73, 81 L.Ed. 20 (1936) (claim of negligence for failure to deliver a film on time is preempted);  Charleston &amp; Western Carolina Ry. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., 237 U.S. 597, 35 S.Ct. 715, 59 L.Ed. 1137 (1915) (state statute imposing a penalty for failure to pay claims to a shipper within 40 days is preempted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the Supreme Court case law does not provide clear guidance on the reach of the preemption doctrine.  In particular, the Court has not clarified the extent to which state law provisions pertaining to the claims process, as opposed to the shipping of goods, are preempted.  Two cases, however, are instructive.  First, in Missouri, Kansas, &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas v. Harris, 234 U.S. 412, 34 S.Ct. 790, 58 L.Ed. 1377 (1914), the Court considered a Texas statute that allowed for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees in cases where the value of the claims did not exceed two hundred dollars.  The Court held that because the state statute at issue \"had a broad sweep which only incidentally includes claims arising out of interstate commerce, it follows that it cannot be held to constitute a direct burden upon such commerce.\"  Id. at 416, 34 S.Ct. at 791.   For this reason, the statute was ruled to be valid and able to exist alongside the Carmack Amendment.  The important distinction made by the Court was that \"the Texas statute ... does not anywhere either enlarge or limit the responsibility of the carrier for the loss of property intrusted to it in transportation, and only incidentally affects the remedy for enforcing that responsibility.\"  Id. at 420, 34 S.Ct. at 793-94.   Furthermore, \"[t]he local statute ... does not at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery;  it deals only with a question of costs, respecting which Congress has not spoken.\"  Id. at 421-22, 34 S.Ct. at 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in Varnville, the Court ruled that a South Carolina statute that imposed a fine of $50 on carriers for failure to pay within 40 days for damage to goods transported in interstate commerce was preempted by the Carmack Amendment.  Varnville, 237 U.S. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716.   The Court determined that \"the special regulations and policies of particular states upon the subject of the carrier's liability for loss or damage to interstate shipments, and the contracts of carriers with respect thereto, have been superseded.\"  Id. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716.   The state statute before the Court was found to \"overlap[ ] the Federal act in respect of the subjects, the grounds, and the extent of liability for loss.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two cases are of particular relevance to the instant case because the state laws at issue did not govern claims arising directly out of damage to goods.  Like the instant case, both Harris and Varnville consider state remedies that relate to the claims process.  The distinction between the two cases was made in Varnville, where the Court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[i]t is true that in [Harris ] the inclusion of the attorney's fee, not exceeding $20, in the costs upon judgments for certain small claims was upheld, although incidentally including some claims arising out of interstate commerce.  But apart from the effect being only incidental, the ground relied upon was that the statute did not 'in any way enlarge the responsibility of the carrier' for loss or 'at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery'.  The South Carolina Act, on the other hand, extends the liability to losses on other roads in other jurisdictions, and increases it by a fine difficult to escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lesson from these cases is that state statutes are preempted by the Carmack Amendment if they \"in any way enlarge the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Carmack Amendment and the set of federal regulations that complement it cover not only the actual transport of goods, but they also govern the claims process.  For example, the Amendment itself provides that a carrier \"may not provide ... a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim ... and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section.\"  49 U.S.C. &#167; 11707(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the Court's holding in Varnville, we find that all state laws that impose liability on carriers based on the loss or damage of shipped goods are preempted.  A state law \"enlarges the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affects the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery,\" id. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716, where, in the absence of an injury separate and apart from the loss or damage of goods, it increases the liability of the carrier.  Preempted state law claims, therefore, include all liability stemming from damage or loss of goods, liability stemming from the claims process, and liability related to the payment of claims.  Thus, the forty day limit for payment at issue in Varnville is preempted.  On the other hand, liability arising from separate harms--apart from the loss or damage of goods--is not preempted.  For example, if an employee of the carrier assaulted and injured the shipper, state law remedies would not be preempted.  Similarly, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress alleges a harm to the shipper that is independent from the loss or damage to goods and, as such, would not be preempted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant appeal, the state law claims at issue all stem from the loss of goods.  The alleged negligence and misrepresentation took place in the course of settling a claim for damages stemming from the move.  Rini suffered no harm other than the loss of goods and, therefore, her state law claims are preempted by the Carmack Amendment.  Had Rini prevailed on her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, it would not have been preempted.  Because the three state claims at issue in this appeal involve no injury save the loss of property, however, we find them to be preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is consistent with the view taken by the Second Circuit in Cleveland v. Beltman North American Company, 30 F.3d 373 (2d Cir.1994), cert denied, 513 U.S. 1110, 115 S.Ct. 901, 130 L.Ed.2d 785 (1995).  In that case, the court described the plaintiffs' allegations as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>In handling plaintiffs' claims, the moving company--in a deliberate and determined effort to frustrate plaintiffs' collection of damages for their losses--was guilty of foot-dragging and stonewalling.  It did not deal fairly and in good faith with the couple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 374.   The claim addressed by the court was a federal common law claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the claims process, damages from which \"were to be exclusive of damages awarded for actual loss under the bill of lading.\"  Id. at 376.   The Second Circuit held that there could be no federal common law claim for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Id. at 379.   In so deciding, the court concluded that \"[a] claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing resulting in an award of punitive damages could well thwart one of the primary purposes of the Carmack Amendment;  that is, to provide some uniformity in the disposition of claims brought under a bill of lading.\"  Id.  Although Cleveland dealt with an issue of federal common law, the same reasoning implies that state law remedies for loss or damage to goods would be preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case presents the same question as did Cleveland.   We face a plaintiff who has been ill-treated in her attempts to settle her claim with United.  As a result of United's unfair practices, the jury found for Rini on the negligence and misrepresentation counts and the trial judge found for Rini on the use of unfair and deceptive acts count.  Like our sister circuit before us, we note that although \"[i]t may be that Congress' enforcement scheme does not provide a sufficient deterrent to the type of conduct defendants employed in this case,\" id. at 379, we find that the federal scheme has preempted negligence, misrepresentation, and chapter 93A claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that our ruling preserves the uniformity of the federal scheme by protecting the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over the shipper-carrier relationship, the importance of which has been underscored on numerous occasions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  \"The purpose of [the Carmack Amendment] is to establish uniform federal guidelines designed in part to remove the uncertainty surrounding a carrier's liability when damage occurs to a shipper's interstate shipment.\"  Hughes v. United Van Lines, Inc., 829 F.2d 1407, 1415 (7th Cir.1987);  see also Cleveland, 30 F.3d at 379 (stating that one of the primary purposes of the Carmack Amendment is to provide uniformity in the disposition of claims brought under a bill of lading).  Because the Carmack Amendment was intended to provide uniformity to claims for the loss or damage to goods, the goal of uniformity is not frustrated by the allowance of state law claims for injuries that are separate and distinct from such loss or damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the conclusion of the district court regarding the preemptive effect of the Carmack Amendment is reversed.   In light of our ruling, the district court's judgment as to costs, fees and prejudgment interest must be revisited.  The case is remanded to the district court for the entry of an order with respect to damages and a ruling on fees, costs, and interest consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There have been amendments to the Carmack Amendment since 1990 when the events at issue in this case took place.

Failure to comply with these federal regulations subjects the carrier to sanctions.  See Zola v. I.C.C., 889 F.2d 508, 509 (3d Cir.1989);  Aaacon Auto Transp., Inc. v. I.C.C., 792 F.2d 1156, 1158 (D.C.Cir.1986).  Although \"the mere existence of a federal regulatory or enforcement scheme ... does not by itself imply preemption of state remedies,\" English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 87, 110 S.Ct. 2270, 2279, 110 L.Ed.2d 65 (1990), the above federal regulations indicate that the claims process is within the scope of the shipper-carrier relationship that the federal government seeks to regulate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We are aware that our holding today conflicts with certain previous decisions of the District Court of Massachusetts.  In particular, we note that the cases of Sokhos v. Mayflower Transit Inc., 691 F.Supp. 1578 (D.Mass.1988), and Mesta v. Allied Van Lines, 695 F.Supp. 63 (D.Mass.1988), allowed certain claims that would be preempted under the decision that we lay down today.  To the extent these decisions are inconsistent with our holding, they do not represent the law of the circuit.  We are also aware that our own decision in Fredette v. Allied Van Lines, 66 F.3d 369 (1st Cir.1995), involved both Carmack Amendment and state law claims.  Id. at 372.   That case did not, however, address the preemption issue and, therefore, offers us no guidance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> See supra p. 504</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

It embraces the subject of the liability of the carrier under a bill of lading which he must issue, and limits his power to exempt himself by rule, regulation, or contract.  Almost every detail of the subject is covered so completely that there can be no rational doubt but that Congress intended to take possession of the subject, and supersede all state regulation with reference to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams Express, 226 U.S. at 505-06, 33 S.Ct. at 152.

In particular, the Court has not clarified the extent to which state law provisions pertaining to the claims process, as opposed to the shipping of goods, are preempted.  Two cases, however, are instructive.  First, in Missouri, Kansas, &amp; Texas Railway Company of Texas v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98238\"><a href=\"/opinion/98238/missouri-k-tr-co-of-tex-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98238\"><a href=\"/opinion/98238/missouri-k-tr-co-of-tex-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1377</span></a></span> (1914), the Court considered a Texas statute that allowed for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees in cases where the value of the claims did not exceed two hundred dollars.  The Court held that because the state statute at issue \"had a broad sweep which only incidentally includes claims arising out of interstate commerce, it follows that it cannot be held to constitute a direct burden upon such commerce.\"  Id. at 416, 34 S.Ct. at 791.   For this reason, the statute was ruled to be valid and able to exist alongside the Carmack Amendment.  The important distinction made by the Court was that \"the Texas statute ... does not anywhere either enlarge or limit the responsibility of the carrier for the loss of property intrusted to it in transportation, and only incidentally affects the remedy for enforcing that responsibility.\"  Id. at 420, 34 S.Ct. at 793-94.   Furthermore, \"[t]he local statute ... does not at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery;  it deals only with a question of costs, respecting which Congress has not spoken.\"  Id. at 421-22, 34 S.Ct. at 794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in Varnville, the Court ruled that a South Carolina statute that imposed a fine of $50 on carriers for failure to pay within 40 days for damage to goods transported in interstate commerce was preempted by the Carmack Amendment.  Varnville, 237 U.S. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716.   The Court determined that \"the special regulations and policies of particular states upon the subject of the carrier's liability for loss or damage to interstate shipments, and the contracts of carriers with respect thereto, have been superseded.\"  Id. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716.   The state statute before the Court was found to \"overlap[ ] the Federal act in respect of the subjects, the grounds, and the extent of liability for loss.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two cases are of particular relevance to the instant case because the state laws at issue did not govern claims arising directly out of damage to goods.  Like the instant case, both Harris and Varnville consider state remedies that relate to the claims process.  The distinction between the two cases was made in Varnville, where the Court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[i]t is true that in [Harris ] the inclusion of the attorney's fee, not exceeding $20, in the costs upon judgments for certain small claims was upheld, although incidentally including some claims arising out of interstate commerce.  But apart from the effect being only incidental, the ground relied upon was that the statute did not 'in any way enlarge the responsibility of the carrier' for loss or 'at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery'.  The South Carolina Act, on the other hand, extends the liability to losses on other roads in other jurisdictions, and increases it by a fine difficult to escape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lesson from these cases is that state statutes are preempted by the Carmack Amendment if they \"in any way enlarge the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Carmack Amendment and the set of federal regulations that complement it cover not only the actual transport of goods, but they also govern the claims process.  For example, the Amendment itself provides that a carrier \"may not provide ... a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim ... and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section.\"  49 U.S.C. &#167; 11707(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the Court's holding in Varnville, we find that all state laws that impose liability on carriers based on the loss or damage of shipped goods are preempted.  A state law \"enlarges the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affects the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery,\" id. at 603, 35 S.Ct. at 716, where, in the absence of an injury separate and apart from the loss or damage of goods, it increases the liability of the carrier.  Preempted state law claims, therefore, include all liability stemming from damage or loss of goods, liability stemming from the claims process, and liability related to the payment of claims.  Thus, the forty day limit for payment at issue in Varnville is preempted.  On the other hand, liability arising from separate harms--apart from the loss or damage of goods--is not preempted.  For example, if an employee of the carrier assaulted and injured the shipper, state law remedies would not be preempted.  Similarly, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress alleges a harm to the shipper that is independent from the loss or damage to goods and, as such, would not be preempted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Application</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant appeal, the state law claims at issue all stem from the loss of goods.  The alleged negligence and misrepresentation took place in the course of settling a claim for damages stemming from the move.  Rini suffered no harm other than the loss of goods and, therefore, her state law claims are preempted by the Carmack Amendment.  Had Rini prevailed on her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, it would not have been preempted.  Because the three state claims at issue in this appeal involve no injury save the loss of property, however, we find them to be preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is consistent with the view taken by the Second Circuit in Cleveland v. Beltman North American Company, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675105\"><a href=\"/opinion/675105/donald-l-cleveland-christa-a-cleveland-v-beltman-north-american-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1994), cert denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></span> (1995).  In that case, the court described the plaintiffs' allegations as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>In handling plaintiffs' claims, the moving company--in a deliberate and determined effort to frustrate plaintiffs' collection of damages for their losses--was guilty of foot-dragging and stonewalling.  It did not deal fairly and in good faith with the couple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 374.   The claim addressed by the court was a federal common law claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the claims process, damages from which \"were to be exclusive of damages awarded for actual loss under the bill of lading.\"  Id. at 376.   The Second Circuit held that there could be no federal common law claim for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Id. at 379.   In so deciding, the court concluded that \"[a] claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing resulting in an award of punitive damages could well thwart one of the primary purposes of the Carmack Amendment;  that is, to provide some uniformity in the disposition of claims brought under a bill of lading.\"  Id.  Although Cleveland dealt with an issue of federal common law, the same reasoning implies that state law remedies for loss or damage to goods would be preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case presents the same question as did Cleveland.   We face a plaintiff who has been ill-treated in her attempts to settle her claim with United.  As a result of United's unfair practices, the jury found for Rini on the negligence and misrepresentation counts and the trial judge found for Rini on the use of unfair and deceptive acts count.  Like our sister circuit before us, we note that although \"[i]t may be that Congress' enforcement scheme does not provide a sufficient deterrent to the type of conduct defendants employed in this case,\" id. at 379, we find that the federal scheme has preempted negligence, misrepresentation, and chapter 93A claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that our ruling preserves the uniformity of the federal scheme by protecting the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over the shipper-carrier relationship, the importance of which has been underscored on numerous occasions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  \"The purpose of [the Carmack Amendment] is to establish uniform federal guidelines designed in part to remove the uncertainty surrounding a carrier's liability when damage occurs to a shipper's interstate shipment.\"  Hughes v. United Van Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495035\"><a href=\"/opinion/495035/edward-and-nancy-hughes-v-united-van-lines-inc-and-291-sisser-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1407</span></a></span>, 1415 (7th Cir.1987);  see also Cleveland, 30 F.3d at 379 (stating that one of the primary purposes of the Carmack Amendment is to provide uniformity in the disposition of claims brought under a bill of lading).  Because the Carmack Amendment was intended to provide uniformity to claims for the loss or damage to goods, the goal of uniformity is not frustrated by the allowance of state law claims for injuries that are separate and distinct from such loss or damage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the conclusion of the district court regarding the preemptive effect of the Carmack Amendment is reversed.   In light of our ruling, the district court's judgment as to costs, fees and prejudgment interest must be revisited.  The case is remanded to the district court for the entry of an order with respect to damages and a ruling on fees, costs, and interest consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There have been amendments to the Carmack Amendment since 1990 when the events at issue in this case took place.
