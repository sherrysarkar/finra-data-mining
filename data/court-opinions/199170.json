Angel     Luis    Burgos-Hernandez,        a\n\n Commonwealth of Puerto Rico prisoner, appeals pro se from\n\n the dismissal of his lawsuit brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n § 1983.     The district court interpreted the complaint to be\n\n limited to a challenge to Burgos-Hernandez's transfer in\n\n 1981 from a prison in Puerto Rico to a federal facility in\n\n Pennsylvania.     Burgos-Hernandez makes no argument that this\n\n interpretation was too narrow.            The court concluded that the\n\n transfer    claim     is    barred   by    the    one-year    statute     of\n\n limitations applicable to § 1983 actions in Puerto Rico.                  We\n\n agree.\n\n             Burgos-Hernandez's suggestion that his transfer\n\n claim     survives     on   a   continuing       violation    theory      is\n\n meritless.     The argument overlooks what \"we have termed the\n\n 'critical    distinction'       between     a    continuing   act   and    a\n\n singular act that brings continuing consequences in its\n\n roiled wake.\"        Gilbert v.

The transfer was\n\n a discrete event that occurred in 1981.                Burgos-Hernandez\n\n cannot avoid the limitations period by claiming continuing\n\n adverse effects from the transfer.1\n\n    1The alleged continuing adverse effects of the transfer\ninclude lack of access to Puerto Rico legal materials and denial\n\f           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nof good-time credits. Our disposition is without prejudice to\nBurgos-Hernandez pursuing these matters as separate issues\n(i.e., apart from the transfer decision) in a new action(s). We\nexpress no opinion as to whether Burgos-Hernandez has viable,\nseparate claims or whether the denial of good-time credits can\nbe pursued in a § 1983 action (as opposed to habeas proceeding).\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
