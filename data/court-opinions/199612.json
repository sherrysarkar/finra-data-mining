Richard Pacheco appeals from an adverse\n\n judgment    in     his     civil     rights     suit      against   various\n\n defendants.      In pertinent part, Pacheco, who is a public\n\n school employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement\n\n between    the    school    committee      defendant       and   the   union\n\n defendant, claimed that he had been suspended without pay\n\n for five days in violation of his federal due process rights\n\n after he failed to pay the service fee required by the\n\n collective bargaining agreement.              The district judge granted\n\n certain defendants' motion to dismiss when Pacheco did not\n\n file a timely opposition,1 and he granted the remaining\n\n defendants'      motion    for     judgment    on   the    pleadings   in   a\n\n Memorandum and Order dated September 29, 2000.                   We affirm,\n\n essentially for the reasons given by the district judge in\n\n his Memorandum and Order and for the reasons given by the\n\n defendants in their appellate briefs.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n    1 In response to defendants' motion, the judge later struck\na belated opposition. On appeal, Pacheco has not contended that\nthe judge abused his discretion, or otherwise erred, in striking\nhis opposition.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
