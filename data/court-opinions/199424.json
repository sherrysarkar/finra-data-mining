Lyndon Benjamin appeals his\n\nconvictions for one count of bank fraud, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1344, and two counts of engaging in transactions over\n\n$10,000      with   property   derived    from   a    specified     unlawful\n\nactivity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\nBenjamin asserts six arguments on appeal.            We reject each of his\n\narguments and affirm his convictions.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n             We briefly describe the facts of this case, in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, discussing the details more\n\nfully   in    our   consideration   of    Benjamin's    challenge    to   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.\n\n             In February 1998, Benjamin obtained a Massachusetts\n\nphoto identification card using the false name \"Ralph Chapel\"\n\nand an unauthorized social security number.               He also filed a\n\nbusiness certificate with the City of Boston for a business\n\ncalled Eastside Motorsports.        On March 31, 1998, Benjamin used\n\nthe false identification card to open a bank account at Fleet\n\nBank in the name of \"Ralph Chapel d/b/a Eastside Motorsports\"\n\n(Eastside Motorsports account).           He made a deposit of $100 to\n\nopen the account.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f                 On April 9, 1998, a man identified as Ian DeCosta\n\ndeposited two checks totaling approximately $202,000 into the\n\naccount recently opened by Benjamin.                 Frank Maggelet, a fraud\n\ninvestigator employed by Fleet Financial Group, testified that\n\nthese deposits were made with deposit slips issued by the bank\n\nand pre-printed with the account information for the Eastside\n\nMotorsports account that Benjamin had just opened.1 These checks\n\nwere made payable to Stratus Computer, Incorporated.                    Testimony\n\nat trial indicated that these checks were intended to go to a\n\npost       office   box   for   processing,    and    that    Stratus    did   not\n\nauthorize         the   deposit   of     the   checks    into    the    Eastside\n\nMotorsports account.\n\n                 Benjamin made large withdrawals from the account the\n\nsame       day   that   DeCosta   made   the   deposit   of     over    $200,000.\n\nSpecifically, he wrote two checks, for $25,000 each, to Prime\n\nSpeed, an auto parts business.            Benjamin wrote a third check for\n\n$30,000 to Unique Creations hair salon.              Additional draws on the\n\naccount totaling $18,700 were made with checks written to cash\n\nand signed by Ralph Chapel on April 13, 14, 28, and 30, 1998.\n\n\n\n       1\n      Although Maggelet originally misidentified the individual\nwho deposited these checks as Benjamin, not DeCosta, he\ntestified at trial that he made this misidentification on the\nbasis of photographs of the defendant he considered to be of\npoor quality.    This misidentification does not affect our\nanalysis.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fSurveillance photographs indicated that Benjamin was the person\n\ncashing all of these checks.\n\n           On April 16, 1998, Benjamin purchased a bank check for\n\n$10,900 from Citizens Bank.      This check was made payable to\n\nBenjamin, and the name \"Ralph Chapel\" was noted on the line of\n\nthe check marked \"memo.\"   Benjamin purchased a second bank check\n\nfor $17,000 from BankBoston on April 17, also made payable to\n\n\"Lyndon Benjamin.\"    Benjamin used these checks to purchase a\n\n1998 Lexus in his own name.\n\n           On May 11, 1998, two checks totaling approximately\n\n$180,000 were deposited into the Eastside Motorsports account.\n\nSurveillance photos from the bank indicated that Benjamin made\n\nthese   deposits.    One   of   the   checks,    in   the   amount   of\n\napproximately $170,000, was made payable to Ben & Jerry's, and\n\nthe other check, in the amount of approximately $10,000, was\n\nmade payable to Clearmount Corporation.         Representatives from\n\nthese companies testified that Benjamin was not authorized to\n\nobtain these funds or deposit them into the Eastside Motorsports\n\naccount.\n\n           During this time, Benjamin, as Ralph Chapel, also\n\ncashed six checks from Prime Speed, the auto parts business to\n\nwhich he had written two checks of $25,000 each on the day that\n\nDeCosta first deposited large sums of money into the Eastside\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fMotorsports account.          These six checks, ranging in amount from\n\n$2,000 to $19,900, were all made payable to Ralph Chapel, doing\n\nbusiness as Eastside Motorsports.                The checks were cashed by\n\nBenjamin using the name Ralph Chapel and his Massachusetts\n\nidentification card.          Kevin Primus, the owner of Prime Speed,\n\ntestified that these checks were refunds to Benjamin of deposits\n\nhe had made for auto parts that Primus was subsequently not able\n\nto obtain from his suppliers.\n\n              A nine-count indictment was returned against Benjamin\n\non September 23, 1998.         Count one charged him with bank fraud in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344.           Counts two through seven charged\n\nhim   with     money    laundering      in     violation   of     18   U.S.C.    §\n\n1956(a)(1)(B)(i).2       Counts eight and nine charged Benjamin with\n\nengaging in monetary transactions over $10,000 with property\n\nderived from a specified unlawful activity, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   1957(a)   and    aiding    and    abetting   that    offense,     in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.          Following a six-day trial in April\n\n1999, a jury convicted Benjamin of counts one, eight, and nine.\n\nHe was sentenced in November 1999 to three years in prison and\n\nordered to make restitution to Fleet Bank of approximately\n\n$160,000.\n\n\n\n      2The jury acquitted Benjamin of the six counts of money\nlaundering.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           Benjamin makes the following arguments on appeal: 1)\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; 2) the\n\ndistrict court improperly instructed the jury; 3) there was a\n\nvariance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof\n\noffered   at    trial;   4)   the   government         failed   to    disclose\n\nexculpatory evidence; 5) African-Americans were underrepresented\n\non   Benjamin's   jury   venire;    and   6)    he   was   denied    effective\n\nassistance of counsel.        Benjamin has not appealed his sentence\n\nor the order that he pay restitution.            We reject his claims and\n\naffirm his convictions.\n\n                  II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n           Following the close of the government's evidence, and\n\nat the end of the trial, Benjamin moved unsuccessfully for a\n\njudgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.                        In\n\nconsidering    Benjamin's     challenge   to     the   sufficiency     of    the\n\nevidence on appeal, we view the evidence and draw all inferences\n\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution.                     See United\n\nStates v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 678 (1st Cir. 2000).                       \"The\n\nevidence is legally sufficient so long as, taken as a whole, it\n\nwarrants a judgment of conviction.\"            Id.   We examine both direct\n\nand circumstantial evidence in making this evaluation.                 Id.\n\nA. Bank Fraud\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            In Count One of the indictment, the government charged\n\nthat Benjamin\n\n            did knowingly execute and attempt to execute\n            a scheme and artifice to defraud Fleet Bank,\n            a federally insured financial institution,\n            and to obtain money owned by and under the\n            custody and control of Fleet Bank, by means\n            of   false    and   fraudulent    pretenses,\n            representations and promises, in that he\n            deposited into a fraudulently opened account\n            at Fleet Bank checks he knew to be stolen\n            and to contain forged endorsements; and then\n            withdrew or otherwise transferred out of the\n            account a portion of the monies so deposited\n            and credited to the fraudulent account.\n\n\"To prove bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344,3 the prosecution\n\nmust show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1)\n\nengaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or made false\n\nstatements or misrepresentations to obtain money from; (2) a\n\nfederally     insured   financial    institution;   and   (3)   did   so\n\nknowingly.\"     United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).    See also United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).    A scheme or artifice to defraud is \"any plan,\n\n\n    3 The bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1344, provides:\n    Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a\n    scheme or artifice--\n    (1) to defraud a financial institution; or\n    (2) to obtain any of the money, funds, credits,\n    assets, securities, or other property owned by, or\n    under the custody or control of, a financial\n    institution,   by  means   of  false   or  fraudulent\n    pretenses, representations, or promises;\n    shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned\n    not more than 30 years, or both.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fpattern or course of action, including false and fraudulent\n\npretenses and misrepresentations intended to deceive others in\n\norder to obtain something of value.\"      United States v. Blasini-\n\nLluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (quotations omitted).\n\nThe prosecution must prove that the scheme involved a material\n\nfalsehood, and that the defendant had an intent to defraud the\n\nbank.   See Kenrick, 221 F.3d at 30.     We have defined \"intent to\n\ndefraud\" as \"an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain\n\nfrom it money or other property.\"       Id.\n\n           We find ample evidence of Benjamin's intent to deceive\n\nFleet Bank.   Maggelet testified that Benjamin opened an account\n\nat Fleet under a false name and social security number, and that\n\nthe business, Eastside Motorsports, in whose name the account\n\nwas opened, did not actually exist.           An employee of Stratus\n\nComputer   testified   that   neither   DeCosta   nor   Benjamin   was\n\nauthorized to cash or deposit the two checks totaling over\n\n$200,000, made payable to Stratus Computer, into the Eastside\n\nMotorsports account. Notwithstanding Benjamin's contention that\n\nhe did not know the money deposited by DeCosta was stolen, the\n\njury could have inferred Benjamin's awareness of this fraudulent\n\ntransaction, and acquiescence to it, from DeCosta's use of the\n\npre-printed deposit slip for the Eastside Motorsports account\n\n(presumably issued to Benjamin, as Ralph Chapel, after he opened\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fthe account) and the fact that Benjamin wrote three checks\n\ntotaling $80,000 withdrawing money from the account later that\n\nsame   day.      Surveillance   photos   at   the   bank   indicated   that\n\nBenjamin himself deposited two large checks into the account on\n\nMay 11, 1998.      Employees of the companies to which those checks\n\nwere made payable testified that Benjamin was not authorized to\n\ndeposit those checks, with fraudulent endorsements, into the\n\nEastside Motorsports account.\n\n              The jury could have found further that this deception\n\nand DeCosta's deposit were intended to obtain something of value\n\nfrom the bank because the Eastside Motorsports account was\n\ncredited for over $370,000 as a result of the deposits Benjamin\n\nand DeCosta made.      Benjamin benefitted further from the scheme\n\nthrough his withdrawal from the account of large amounts of the\n\nstolen funds he had deposited there, using the false name Ralph\n\nChapel.\n\nB. Engaging in Monetary Transactions Over $10,000 in Property\nDerived From a Specified Unlawful Activity\n\n              Counts eight and nine charged Benjamin with violating\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1957, which criminalizes \"knowingly engag[ing] or\n\nattempt[ing] to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally\n\nderived property of a value greater than $10,000 and . . .\n\nderived from specified unlawful activity.\"           Specifically, count\n\neight charged a monetary transaction on April 16, 1998 involving\n\n                                   -9-\n\fa Citizens Bank check made payable to Lyndon Benjamin in the\n\namount of $10,893.60.     Count nine charged a monetary transaction\n\non April 17, 1998 involving a BankBoston check made payable to\n\nLyndon Benjamin in the amount of $17,000.      The government had to\n\nestablish in the circumstances of this case that the money used\n\nto purchase the bank checks could be linked to the account\n\nBenjamin had fraudulently established at Fleet Bank and funded\n\nwith stolen money.\n\n            Benjamin   cites   three   deficiencies   in   the   §   1957\n\nevidence.    He claims that the government failed to prove: (1)\n\nthat he knew the property was derived from a specified unlawful\n\nactivity; (2) that he knew the transactions involved criminally\n\nderived property; and (3) that the two monetary transactions\n\ninvolving the bank checks affected interstate commerce.                In\n\nUnited States v.       Richard, 234 F.3d 763 (1st Cir. 2000), we\n\nconsidered the prosecution's burden of proof for the elements of\n\n§ 1957 relating to \"specified unlawful activity\" and \"criminally\n\nderived property\":\n\n            A defendant may not be convicted under\n            section 1957(a) unless he knew that the\n            transaction involved \"criminally derived\n            property,\" but he need not know that the\n            property was derived from the \"specified\n            unlawful activity.\"    18 U.S.C. § 1957(c).\n            In other words, the government must prove\n            (1)  that   [the   defendant]  had   general\n            knowledge of the subject property's criminal\n            nature, and (2) that the property, in fact,\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            was derived from a specified offense listed\n            in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7).     18 U.S.C. §\n            1957(f)(3).  The government need not prove\n            that [the defendant] had knowledge of the\n            specified offense, or that he committed it.\n\n\nRichard, 234 F.3d at 769.           We discuss the elements of the\n\noffense in turn.\n\n            1. Property derived from a specified unlawful activity\n\n            We easily dispose of Benjamin's argument that the\n\ngovernment had to prove that he knew the two bank checks were\n\nderived from a specified unlawful activity.           This claim misreads\n\nthe plain language of § 1957.         Subsection (c) of that statute\n\nstates: \"the Government is not required to prove the defendant\n\nknew that the offense from which the criminally derived property\n\nwas derived was specified unlawful activity.\"                18 U.S.C. §\n\n1957(c).      See also United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).      It is sufficient under § 1957 that the two\n\nbank checks were, in fact, derived from bank fraud, which is\n\nlisted   in   18   U.S.C.   §   1956(c)(7)   as   a   specified   unlawful\n\nactivity.     Benjamin's lack of knowledge that bank fraud is among\n\nthe enumerated activities was irrelevant.\n\n            As we have explained in the preceding section, there\n\nwas ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that\n\nBenjamin committed bank fraud when he opened the account with an\n\nassumed name, presented stolen checks for deposit, asked that\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe funds be credited to the Eastside Motorsports account, and,\n\nas Ralph Chapel, obtained cash from the funds in this account\n\neither by writing checks drawn on the account directly to cash,\n\nor by writing large checks to Prime Speed and receiving checks\n\nback from Prime Speed which he then cashed.                   More specifically,\n\nBenjamin cashed a check for approximately $19,900 from Prime\n\nSpeed on April 14.           Benjamin also withdrew $8,700 in cash from\n\nthe Eastside Motorsports account in two transactions on April 13\n\nand April 14.          Thus, Benjamin had a total of $28,600 cash in his\n\npossession only a few days before he obtained bank checks on\n\nApril 16 and April 17 for $10,900 and $17,000, respectively.\n\nBased     on    this    evidence,    the   jury    could     have   inferred   that\n\nBenjamin used that cash, which was derived from bank fraud, to\n\nobtain the two bank checks.            Thus, the jury could have concluded\n\nthat the two bank checks charged in counts eight and nine were\n\nin   fact      drawn    on   funds   obtained     from   a   specified   unlawful\n\nactivity.4\n\n\n      4While the government did not have to prove that Benjamin\nknew the property was derived from a specified unlawful\nactivity, the district court instructed the jury that they\nneeded to find \"that the defendant knew the property was derived\nfrom bank fraud.\" The court acknowledged at a later proceeding\nthat this instruction improperly increased the burden for the\ngovernment. Thus, while there was no need for the government to\nprove Benjamin's knowledge on this point, the improper\ninstruction likely meant that the jury found that Benjamin had\nsuch knowledge.    Even if he did not have that knowledge,\nhowever, that fact does not affect our analysis of the\n\n                                        -12-\n\f            2. Criminally derived property\n\n            Next, Benjamin argues that the government failed to\n\nprove that he knew that the transactions involved criminally\n\nderived property.        Section 1957 defines \"criminally derived\n\nproperty\"    as   \"any   property     constituting,     or   derived     from,\n\nproceeds    obtained     from   a   criminal   offense.\"       18    U.S.C.   §\n\n1957(f)(2).       We have interpreted this element to require a\n\ndefendant to have \"general knowledge of the subject property's\n\ncriminal    nature.\"      Richard,    234   F.3d   at   769.        Benjamin's\n\nconviction for bank fraud provided evidence that he realized the\n\nfunds originally in the Eastside Motorsports account - which\n\nwere then used to obtain the bank checks - were derived from\n\ncriminal activity.\n\n            Benjamin does not persuade us otherwise.                He claims\n\nthat the issuance of the bank checks in his own name, and his\n\nuse of the checks to purchase a car in his own name, indicate\n\nhis lack of knowledge that the funds were criminally derived.\n\nHowever, Benjamin's use of his own name for these transactions\n\nis irrelevant.      The subject property at issue for the monetary\n\n\n\nsufficiency of the evidence under § 1957 because we consider\nwhat the jury needed to find as though it had been instructed\nproperly.   As we have held, \"[a] patently erroneous . . .\ninstruction does not establish the standard by which we measure\nthe sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.\" United States v.\nZanghi, 189 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                     -13-\n\ftransactions charged in counts eight and nine is the money used\n\nto obtain the bank checks.              As we have explained, those funds\n\nwere criminally derived because they originally arrived in the\n\nEastside Motorsports account as a product of bank fraud.\n\n              Benjamin also claims that there is \"no evidence, that\n\nthe    defendant      was     aware   of     the    nature,      location,     source,\n\nownership      or    control    of    the    checks       deposited    by    DeCosta.\"\n\nHowever, those unauthorized deposits of stolen checks were made\n\nwith deposit slips pre-printed with the account information for\n\nthe Eastside Motorsports account.                   Benjamin does not dispute\n\nthat he was responsible for opening that account and that he did\n\nso using a false name and a false social security number.\n\nBecause Benjamin opened the account, the jury reasonably could\n\nhave found that Benjamin was aware of DeCosta's deposits into\n\nthe account using the pre-printed slips provided by the bank.\n\nAdditionally, Benjamin, signing checks as Ralph Chapel, wrote\n\nthree checks totaling $80,000 from the account later in the same\n\nday    that   DeCosta       deposited       the    two    stolen    checks.      These\n\ncircumstances reasonably could lead rational jurors to conclude\n\nthat    Benjamin       realized       that    the        funds   in    the    Eastside\n\nMotorsports         account    were   derived       from     some     activity   of   a\n\ncriminal or fraudulent nature.               See, e.g., Richard, 234 F.3d at\n\n769 (upholding conviction under § 1957 where \"[b]ased upon [the\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fdefendant's]     convictions   of   both   mail   fraud   and   securities\n\nfraud, it is clear that he had sufficient knowledge that the\n\nmoney he received from his investors - the subject property -\n\nwas criminally derived\"); United States v. Butler, 211 F.3d 826,\n\n830 (4th Cir. 2000) (finding that five cashiers' checks drawn on\n\nfunds obtained through bankruptcy fraud constituted \"criminally\n\nderived property\").        As we discussed above, there was also\n\nevidence regarding Benjamin's cash withdrawals and cashing of\n\nother checks from which the jury could have inferred that the\n\ntwo bank checks were drawn on funds that were derived from the\n\nbank fraud.     Therefore, we find the evidence sufficient for the\n\njury to have found that Benjamin realized the bank checks were\n\nproperty derived from criminal activity.\n\n           3. Monetary transaction affecting interstate commerce\n\n           Finally, Benjamin claims that the monetary transactions\n\ndid not have the requisite connection to interstate commerce.\n\nSection 1957(f) defines \"monetary transaction\" as \"the deposit,\n\nwithdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate or\n\nforeign commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument . . . by,\n\nthrough,   or    to   a   financial    institution.\"       18   U.S.C.   §\n\n1957(f)(1).     Section 1957(f) only requires that the transactions\n\nhave a de minimis effect on commerce.             See United States v.\n\nOwens, 167 F.3d 739, 754 (1st Cir. 1999) (construing 18 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f§ 1956).5      As proof on this point, the government offered Fleet\n\nBank's certificate of insurance issued by the Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC).             This document, certifying that\n\nthe    bank    is   federally      insured,     suffices    to    satisfy    the\n\nrequirement that the transactions had at least a minimal impact\n\non interstate commerce.            See United States v. Ford, 184 F.3d\n\n566, 584 (6th Cir. 1999) (construing 18 U.S.C. § 1956 and §\n\n1957).\n\n                          III. Jury Instructions\n\n              Benjamin   objects     to   the   jury   instructions     on   two\n\ngrounds.       He argues first that the district court omitted an\n\ninstruction on the materiality of the fraud in its instructions\n\non    bank    fraud.     Second,    Benjamin     claims    that   the   court's\n\ninstructions on § 1957 did not require the jury to find the\n\nrequisite      connection   between       the   monetary    transaction      and\n\ninterstate commerce.         Because Benjamin did not raise these\n\nobjections before the district court, our review is for plain\n\nerror.       See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); see also United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993); Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 680.\n\nThus, before deciding that any error requires a new trial, we\n\nmust find that the error        affected Benjamin's substantial rights\n\n\n       5\n       The interstate commerce element of § 1957 and § 1956\n(money laundering) has been construed similarly.    See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ford, 184 F.3d 566, 583 (6th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                      -16-\n\fby affecting the outcome of the trial.            See Olano, 507 U.S. at\n\n731; Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 682.\n\nA. Bank Fraud Instruction\n\n            As the government concedes, the district court did not\n\ninstruct the jury that materiality was a required element of the\n\n\"scheme or artifice to defraud\" prong of bank fraud under §\n\n1344(1).6   Since the time of Benjamin's trial, the Supreme Court\n\nhas declared that materiality is an element of bank fraud in\n\nproving that a defendant engaged in a scheme or artifice to\n\ndefraud.    See United States v. Neder, 527 U.S. 1, 25 (1999);\n\nUnited States v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThus, the court's failure to instruct the jury on this point was\n\nerror.   As we noted above, Benjamin's failure to object to this\n\nomission    means   that   we    will   correct   the   error   only   if   we\n\nconclude that it affected his substantial rights.                See Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 731.      To answer this question, we must determine\n\n\"whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead\n\nto a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\"\n\nNeder, 527 U.S. at 19.          See also Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 682.\n\n\n\n\n     6Under the false pretenses prong of bank fraud, § 1344(2),\nthe district court did instruct the jury that the false\nrepresentations needed to \"relate to a material aspect of the\ntransaction in question.\" Thus, Benjamin challenges the jury\ninstructions on only one of the two prongs of the statute.\n\n                                     -17-\n\f         In Neder, the Court defined a matter as \"material\" if\n\n\"a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or\n\nnonexistence   in   determining    his   choice   of    action   in   the\n\ntransaction in question.\"    Neder, 527 U.S. at 222 n.5 (quoting\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 538 (1976)).           We find that the\n\njury, properly instructed on this issue, easily would have found\n\nBenjamin's use of a false identification card and phony business\n\nto be material.     In making the unauthorized deposits into and\n\nwithdrawals out of the account, Benjamin further represented\n\nthat he was Ralph Chapel and implicitly represented that he was\n\nauthorized to cash or deposit the stolen checks.            Fleet Bank\n\nlikely would have found Benjamin's use of false identifying\n\ninformation important in determining whether the institution\n\nwould allow him to become a banking customer and whether the\n\nbank would credit his account for the amount of the stolen\n\nchecks he and DeCosta presented for deposit.           Thus, the record\n\ndoes not contain evidence that could have led a rational jury to\n\nreach a contrary finding on materiality.\n\nB. Jury Instruction on Engaging in Monetary Transactions Over\n$10,000 in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity\n\n         Benjamin's objection to the jury instructions on these\n\ncounts is similar to his challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence: he argues that the district court instructed the jury\n\nin a way that allowed it to find him guilty without determining\n\n                                  -18-\n\fthat   the     two    transactions    affected      interstate    commerce.\n\nContrary to his claim, however, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury properly.        As part of its explanation of \"monetary\n\ntransaction,\" the court stated: \"The term monetary transaction\n\nmeans the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange in or\n\naffecting interstate or foreign commerce of funds or a monetary\n\ninstrument by or through - by, through, or to a financial\n\ninstitution.\"        The jury received an additional instruction on\n\nthis   point    after    it   requested     a   clarification    during   its\n\ndeliberations on the definition of interstate commerce.                   In\n\nresponse to this inquiry, the district court instructed the\n\njury, in part, as follows:\n\n\n                    [Y]ou must still find that the\n             transactions had at least a minimal effect\n             on interstate commerce; that is, that the\n             activities affected commerce in any way or\n             degree.\n                    Now, the interstate commerce element\n             can be established in several ways. First,\n             if you find that the government has proved\n             bank fraud as alleged in Count 1 of the\n             indictment, you are free to consider whether\n             or not the bank fraud, which is the\n             specified unlawful activity designated in\n             Counts 2 through 7 [the money laundering\n             counts], affected interstate commerce.\n                    Second, you are free to consider, if\n             you find that an initial deposit of funds\n             was made to Fleet Bank, whether that initial\n             deposit of checks was to an FDIC-insured\n             financial institution.\n                    Third, you are free to consider\n             whether or not the source of that initial\n\n                                     -19-\n\f         deposit to Fleet Bank affected interstate\n         commerce in any way or degree.\n\nWe discern no error in this instruction.       As we have explained,\n\n§ 1957 requires only that the monetary transaction have a de\n\nminimis effect on interstate commerce.        See Owens, 167 F.3d at\n\n754.   The theory of the government's case was that the four\n\nstolen checks deposited in the Eastside Motorsports account at\n\nFleet Bank provided the funds for the purchase of the two bank\n\nchecks at issue in counts eight and nine.            Therefore, the\n\ninstruction that the jury could find that these initial deposits\n\nof stolen funds had a de minimis effect on interstate commerce -\n\neither because the bank to which they were deposited was FDIC-\n\ninsured or because the source of that deposit actually affected\n\ninterstate commerce to any degree - adequately described the\n\nrequirements of § 1957.\n\n                             IV. Variance\n\n         Benjamin argues that there was a variance between what\n\nwas alleged in count one of the indictment, charging him with\n\nbank fraud, and the proof offered at trial.       We will reverse a\n\nconviction for this reason only where \"the variance works a\n\nsubstantial   interference    with   the   defendant's   right   to    be\n\ninformed of the charges.\"     United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).     We consider this question de novo.          See\n\nUnited States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 700 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                 -20-\n\f           Benjamin seems to argue in his brief that a variance\n\nexisted because the indictment charged him with bank fraud,\n\nrequiring the prosecution to prove that he personally deposited\n\nall of the checks involved, while the evidence demonstrated that\n\nIan DeCosta made the two-check deposit on April 9.                    However,\n\ncount one of the indictment charged Benjamin with bank fraud\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1344, as well as with aiding and abetting that\n\ncrime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.              There is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant personally commit an act to be held responsible\n\nfor aiding and abetting the commission of that act.                  See Colon-\n\nMunoz, 192 F.3d at 223; United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586,\n\n590-91 (1st Cir. 1994).             The indictment alleged that Benjamin\n\nengaged in a scheme to defraud Fleet Bank, and the evidence at\n\ntrial   was    offered     to   prove   exactly    that   scheme.      We   thus\n\nconclude      that   the    indictment      provided   adequate      notice   to\n\nBenjamin, and there was no variance in the proof offered.\n\n                           V. Exculpatory Evidence\n\n           Benjamin        claims    that   the   district   court    erred   in\n\ndenying his motion for a new trial based on the government's\n\nfailure to disclose handwriting exemplars he gave at the time of\n\nhis arrest in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n\n(1963).    We review the district court's denial of his motion for\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fan abuse of discretion.           See United States v. Montilla Rivera,\n\n171 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           The handwriting samples at issue here were taken at the\n\ntime of Benjamin's arrest as part of routine Secret Service\n\nprocedures.      The     government      never   analyzed      the    samples      or\n\nintroduced them at trial.          Benjamin requested them in September\n\n1999 following his conviction, and the record indicates that\n\ncounsel for the government had not been aware of the exemplars\n\n(presumably because they were never analyzed or used for any\n\npurpose)   prior    to    Benjamin's       request.         While    it    was   the\n\ngovernment's position then, and remains now, that it was not\n\nrequired to produce the handwriting samples because they were\n\nnot   analyzed     or    even   used,     counsel     nonetheless         responded\n\npromptly to Benjamin's letter and produced the exemplars.\n\n           The prosecution is obligated to provide a defendant\n\naccess to material exculpatory evidence that is in its control.\n\nSee United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 675-76 (1985); Brady,\n\n373 U.S. at 87.         Evidence is material only when \"there is a\n\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to\n\nthe   defense,   the     result    of   the    proceeding     would       have   been\n\ndifferent.\"        Bagley,      473     U.S.    at   682.       A     \"reasonable\n\nprobability\" is one that is \"sufficient to undermine confidence\n\nin the outcome.\"        Id.\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\f            We conclude easily that Benjamin received a fair trial\n\nwithout presenting the handwriting exemplars for the jury's\n\nconsideration.      He has not even attempted to explain how the\n\nsamples are material in the sense that they undermine confidence\n\nin   the   jury's   verdict   of   guilty.       Indeed,     as   noted,   the\n\nexemplars    were    never    analyzed      or   used   as    part   of    the\n\nprosecution's case.     The case against Benjamin did not rest on\n\nan identification of his handwriting.             Thus, we find that no\n\nBrady violation occurred.\n\n     VI. Underrepresentation of African-Americans in the Jury\n\n                                   Venire\n\n            Benjamin, who is African-American, claims that the\n\nunderrepresentation of African-Americans in his jury venire\n\nviolated his rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Jury\n\nSelection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1861.                 Guided by our\n\nrecent decision in United States v. Royal, 174 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), we reject this argument.\n\n            \"[T]he American concept of the jury trial contemplates\n\na jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.\"\n\nTaylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527 (1975).             This requirement\n\nis fundamental to the right to jury trial guaranteed by the\n\nSixth Amendment.     See id. at 530; Royal, 174 F.3d at 6.           To make\n\na prima facie case that the right to a jury drawn from a fair\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fcross-section of the community has been violated, a defendant\n\nmust establish the following:\n\n           (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is\n           a \"distinctive\" group in the community;\n           (2) that the representation of this group in\n           venires from which juries are selected is\n           not fair and reasonable in relation to the\n           number of such persons in the community; and\n           (3) that this underrepresentation is due to\n           systematic exclusion of the group in the\n           jury- selection process.\n\nDuren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364 (1979).               See also Royal,\n\n174 F.3d at 6.\n\n           In Royal, as here, the defendant argued that he was\n\nentitled to a new trial because the jury selection process for\n\nthe   District   of     Massachusetts    produced   a    systematic    under-\n\nrepresentation of African-American jurors.          Royal was allowed to\n\ninspect the jury records for 1994 to investigate his claim, and\n\nhe retained an expert to analyze this data.             See Royal, 174 F.3d\n\nat 4-5.   We noted at the outset of that opinion that \"[t]here is\n\nno dispute that Royal has satisfied the first prong of [the\n\nDuren] test; blacks are unquestionably a 'distinctive' group for\n\nthe purpose of a fair cross-section analysis.\"             Id. at 6.    Thus,\n\nwe turn to the second prong of the Duren test to analyze\n\nBenjamin's claim.\n\n           We    need    not   discuss   the   complicated    mathematical\n\nanalyses we considered in Royal.           For the purpose of evaluating\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fBenjamin's claim, we rely on our conclusion that the statistics\n\nabout     the   jury    selection     procedure       in     Massachusetts        were\n\n\"insufficient to satisfy Royal's burden under the second prong\n\nof Duren.\"       Royal, 174 F.3d at 11.          Benjamin attempts to avoid\n\nthis result by claiming only that the statistical analysis in\n\nRoyal \"uses outdated numbers from 1994.\"                   However, he has not\n\narticulated even a vague reason to suspect that the statistics\n\ndiscussed in Royal are no longer accurate, let alone that such\n\ndifferent       statistics,      if   they     existed,      would      suffice     to\n\nestablish a violation under Duren.                In sum, Benjamin has not\n\nexplained       why    Royal   should    not     guide     our     analysis       here.\n\nAccordingly,      we    cannot    conclude     that    the    representation         of\n\nAfrican-Americans         in   the    jury     venires       \"is    not    fair    and\n\nreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the\n\ncommunity.\"       Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.7\n\n                 VII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n            Finally,      Benjamin      argues   that      his     Sixth    Amendment\n\nrights were violated by the ineffective assistance of his trial\n\nlawyer.    However, \"[w]e have held with a regularity bordering on\n\nthe     monotonous      that     fact-specific        claims       of     ineffective\n\n\n      7 Because we find that Benjamin's claim falters on the\nsecond prong of the Duren test, we do not consider whether the\nalleged underrepresentation of African-Americans in the jury\nvenires results from their systematic exclusion from the jury\nselection process.

Benjamin asserts six arguments on appeal. We reject each of his arguments and affirm his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts of this case, in the light most favorable to the verdict, discussing the details more fully in our consideration of Benjamin's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, Benjamin obtained a Massachusetts photo identification card using the false name \"Ralph Chapel\" and an unauthorized social security number. He also filed a business certificate with the City of Boston for a business called Eastside Motorsports. On March 31, 1998, Benjamin used the false identification card to open a bank account at Fleet Bank in the name of \"Ralph Chapel d/b/a Eastside Motorsports\" (Eastside Motorsports account). He made a deposit of $100 to open the account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1998, a man identified as Ian DeCosta deposited two checks totaling approximately $202,000 into the account recently opened by Benjamin. Frank Maggelet, a fraud investigator employed by Fleet Financial Group, testified that these deposits were made with deposit slips issued by the bank and pre-printed with the account information for the Eastside Motorsports account that Benjamin had just opened.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These checks were made payable to Stratus Computer, Incorporated. Testimony at trial indicated that these checks were intended to go to a post office box for processing, and that Stratus did not authorize the deposit of the checks into the Eastside Motorsports account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin made large withdrawals from the account the same day that DeCosta made the deposit of over $200,000. Specifically, he wrote two checks, for $25,000 each, to Prime Speed, an auto parts business. Benjamin wrote a third check for $30,000 to Unique Creations hair salon. Additional draws on the account totaling $18,700 were made with checks written to cash and signed by Ralph Chapel on April 13, 14, 28, and 30, 1998. Surveillance photographs indicated that Benjamin was the person cashing all of these checks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 16, 1998, Benjamin purchased a bank check for $10,900 from Citizens Bank. This check was made payable to Benjamin, and the name \"Ralph Chapel\" was noted on the line of the check marked \"memo.\" Benjamin purchased a second bank check for $17,000 from Bank Boston on April 17, also made payable to \"Lyndon Benjamin.\" Benjamin used these checks to purchase a 1998 Lexus in his own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1998, two checks totaling approximately $180,000 were deposited into the Eastside Motorsports account. Surveillance photos from the bank indicated that Benjamin made these deposits. One of the checks, in the amount of approximately $170,000, was made payable to Ben &amp; Jerry's, and the other check, in the amount of approximately $10,000, was made payable to Clearmount Corporation. Representatives from these companies testified that Benjamin was not authorized to obtain these funds or deposit them into the Eastside Motorsports account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time, Benjamin, as Ralph Chapel, also cashed six checks from Prime Speed, the auto parts business to which he had written two checks of $25,000 each on the day that DeCosta first deposited large sums of money into the Eastside Motorsports account. These six checks, ranging in amount from $2,000 to $19,900, were all made payable to Ralph Chapel, doing business as Eastside Motorsports. The checks were cashed by Benjamin using the name Ralph Chapel and his Massachusetts identification card. Kevin Primus, the owner of Prime Speed, testified that these checks were refunds to Benjamin of deposits he had made for auto parts that Primus was subsequently not able to obtain from his suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A nine-count indictment was returned against Benjamin on September 23, 1998. Count one charged him with bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Counts two through seven charged him with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Counts eight and nine charged Benjamin with engaging in monetary transactions over $10,000 with property derived from a specified unlawful activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(a) and aiding and abetting that offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. Following a six-day trial in April 1999, a jury convicted Benjamin of counts one, eight, and nine. He was sentenced in November 1999 to three years in prison and ordered to make restitution to Fleet Bank of approximately $160,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin makes the following arguments on appeal: 1) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; 2) the district court improperly instructed the jury; 3) there was a variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof offered at trial; 4) the government failed to disclose exculpatory evidence; 5) African-Americans were under represented on Benjamin's jury venire; and 6) he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Benjamin has not appealed his sentence or the order that he pay restitution. We reject his claims and affirm his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the close of the government's evidence, and at the end of the trial, Benjamin moved unsuccessfully for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. In considering Benjamin's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, we view the evidence and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution. See United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 678 (1st Cir. 2000). \"The evidence is legally sufficient so long as, taken as a whole, it warrants a judgment of conviction.\" Id. We examine both direct and circumstantial evidence in making this evaluation. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Bank Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count One of the indictment, the government charged that Benjamin</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did knowingly execute and attempt to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud Fleet Bank, a federally insured financial institution, and to obtain money owned by and under the custody and control of Fleet Bank, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises, in that he deposited into a fraudulently opened account at Fleet Bank checks he knew to be stolen and to contain forged endorsements; and then withdrew or otherwise transferred out of the account a portion of the monies so deposited and credited to the fraudulent account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To prove bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the prosecution must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or made false statements or misrepresentations to obtain money from; (2) a federally insured financial institution; and (3) did so knowingly.\" United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir. 1994). See also United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir. 2000). A scheme or artifice to defraud is \"any plan, pattern or course of action, including false and fraudulent pretenses and misrepresentations intended to deceive others in order to obtain something of value.\" United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (quotations omitted). The prosecution must prove that the scheme involved a material falsehood, and that the defendant had an intent to defraud the bank. See Kenrick, 221 F.3d at 30. We have defined \"intent to defraud\" as \"an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find ample evidence of Benjamin's intent to deceive Fleet Bank. Maggelet testified that Benjamin opened an account at Fleet under a false name and social security number, and that the business, Eastside Motorsports, in whose name the account was opened, did not actually exist. An employee of Stratus Computer testified that neither DeCosta nor Benjamin was authorized to cash or deposit the two checks totaling over $200,000, made payable to Stratus Computer, into the Eastside Motorsports account. Notwithstanding Benjamin's contention that he did not know the money deposited by DeCosta was stolen, the jury could have inferred Benjamin's awareness of this fraudulent transaction, and acquiescence to it, from DeCosta's use of the pre-printed deposit slip for the Eastside Motorsports account (presumably issued to Benjamin, as Ralph Chapel, after he opened the account) and the fact that Benjamin wrote three checks totaling $80,000 withdrawing money from the account later that same day. Surveillance photos at the bank indicated that Benjamin himself deposited two large checks into the account on May 11, 1998. Employees of the companies to which those checks were made payable testified that Benjamin was not authorized to deposit those checks, with fraudulent endorsements, into the Eastside Motorsports account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have found further that this deception and DeCosta's deposit were intended to obtain something of value from the bank because the Eastside Motorsports account was credited for over $370,000 as a result of the deposits Benjamin and DeCosta made. Benjamin benefitted further from the scheme through his withdrawal from the account of large amounts of the stolen funds he had deposited there, using the false name Ralph Chapel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Engaging in Monetary Transactions Over $10,000 in Property Derived From a Specified Unlawful Activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts eight and nine charged Benjamin with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957, which criminalizes \"knowingly engag[ing] or attempt[ing] to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than $10,000 and . . . derived from specified unlawful activity.\" Specifically, count eight charged a monetary transaction on April 16, 1998 involving a Citizens Bank check made payable to Lyndon Benjamin in the amount of $10,893.60. Count nine charged a monetary transaction on April 17, 1998 involving a Bank Boston check made payable to Lyndon Benjamin in the amount of $17,000. The government had to establish in the circumstances of this case that the money used to purchase the bank checks could be linked to the account Benjamin had fraudulently established at Fleet Bank and funded with stolen money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin cites three deficiencies in the &#167; 1957 evidence. He claims that the government failed to prove: (1) that he knew the property was derived from a specified unlawful activity; (2) that he knew the transactions involved criminally derived property; and (3) that the two monetary transactions involving the bank checks affected interstate commerce. In United States v. Richard, 234 F.3d 763 (1st Cir. 2000), we considered the prosecution's burden of proof for the elements of &#167; 1957 relating to \"specified unlawful activity\" and \"criminally derived property\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived property,\" but he need not know that the property was derived from the \"specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(c). In other words, the government must prove (1) that [the defendant] had general knowledge of the subject property's criminal nature, and (2) that the property, in fact, was derived from a specified offense listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(7). 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(3). The government need not prove that [the defendant] had knowledge of the specified offense, or that he committed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard, 234 F.3d at 769. We discuss the elements of the offense in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Property derived from a specified unlawful activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We easily dispose of Benjamin's argument that the government had to prove that he knew the two bank checks were derived from a specified unlawful activity. This claim misreads the plain language of &#167; 1957. Subsection (c) of that statute states: \"the Government is not required to prove the defendant knew that the offense from which the criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(c). See also United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 65 (1st Cir. 1995). It is sufficient under &#167; 1957 that the two bank checks were, in fact, derived from bank fraud, which is listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(7) as a specified unlawful activity. Benjamin's lack of knowledge that bank fraud is among the enumerated activities was irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained in the preceding section, there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Benjamin committed bank fraud when he opened the account with an assumed name, presented stolen checks for deposit, asked that the funds be credited to the Eastside Motorsports account, and, as Ralph Chapel, obtained cash from the funds in this account either by writing checks drawn on the account directly to cash, or by writing large checks to Prime Speed and receiving checks back from Prime Speed which he then cashed. More specifically, Benjamin cashed a check for approximately $19,900 from Prime Speed on April 14. Benjamin also withdrew $8,700 in cash from the Eastside Motorsports account in two transactions on April 13 and April 14. Thus, Benjamin had a total of $28,600 cash in his possession only a few days before he obtained bank checks on April 16 and April 17 for $10,900 and $17,000, respectively. Based on this evidence, the jury could have inferred that Benjamin used that cash, which was derived from bank fraud, to obtain the two bank checks. Thus, the jury could have concluded that the two bank checks charged in counts eight and nine were in fact drawn on funds obtained from a specified unlawful activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Criminally derived property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Benjamin argues that the government failed to prove that he knew that the transactions involved criminally derived property. Section 1957 defines \"criminally derived property\" as \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(2). We have interpreted this element to require a defendant to have \"general knowledge of the subject property's criminal nature.\" Richard, 234 F.3d at 769. Benjamin's conviction for bank fraud provided evidence that he realized the funds originally in the Eastside Motorsports account - which were then used to obtain the bank checks - were derived from criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin does not persuade us otherwise. He claims that the issuance of the bank checks in his own name, and his use of the checks to purchase a car in his own name, indicate his lack of knowledge that the funds were criminally derived. However, Benjamin's use of his own name for these transactions is irrelevant. The subject property at issue for the monetary transactions charged in counts eight and nine is the money used to obtain the bank checks. As we have explained, those funds were criminally derived because they originally arrived in the Eastside Motorsports account as a product of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin also claims that there is \"no evidence, that the defendant was aware of the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the checks deposited by DeCosta.\" However, those unauthorized deposits of stolen checks were made with deposit slips pre-printed with the account information for the Eastside Motorsports account. Benjamin does not dispute that he was responsible for opening that account and that he did so using a false name and a false social security number. Because Benjamin opened the account, the jury reasonably could have found that Benjamin was aware of DeCosta's deposits into the account using the pre-printed slips provided by the bank. Additionally, Benjamin, signing checks as Ralph Chapel, wrote three checks totaling $80,000 from the account later in the same day that DeCosta deposited the two stolen checks. These circumstances reasonably could lead rational jurors to conclude that Benjamin realized that the funds in the Eastside Motorsports account were derived from some activity of a criminal or fraudulent nature. See, e.g., Richard, 234 F.3d at 769 (upholding conviction under &#167; 1957 where \"[b]ased upon [the defendant's] convictions of both mail fraud and securities fraud, it is clear that he had sufficient knowledge that the money he received from his investors - the subject property - was criminally derived\"); United States v. Butler, 211 F.3d 826, 830 (4th Cir. 2000) (finding that five cashiers' checks drawn on funds obtained through bankruptcy fraud constituted \"criminally derived property\"). As we discussed above, there was also evidence regarding Benjamin's cash withdrawals and cashing of other checks from which the jury could have inferred that the two bank checks were drawn on funds that were derived from the bank fraud. Therefore, we find the evidence sufficient for the jury to have found that Benjamin realized the bank checks were property derived from criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Monetary transaction affecting interstate commerce</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Benjamin claims that the monetary transactions did not have the requisite connection to interstate commerce. Section 1957(f) defines \"monetary transaction\" as \"the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument . . . by, through, or to a financial institution.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(1). Section 1957(f) only requires that the transactions have a de minimis effect on commerce. See United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 754 (1st Cir. 1999) (construing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As proof on this point, the government offered Fleet Bank's certificate of insurance issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This document, certifying that the bank is federally insured, suffices to satisfy the requirement that the transactions had at least a minimal impact on interstate commerce. See United States v. Ford, 184 F.3d 566, 584 (6th Cir. 1999) (construing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956 and &#167; 1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin objects to the jury instructions on two grounds. He argues first that the district court omitted an instruction on the materiality of the fraud in its instructions on bank fraud. Second, Benjamin claims that the court's instructions on &#167; 1957 did not require the jury to find the requisite connection between the monetary transaction and interstate commerce. Because Benjamin did not raise these objections before the district court, our review is for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993); Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 680. Thus, before deciding that any error requires a new trial, we must find that the error affected Benjamin's substantial rights by affecting the outcome of the trial. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 731; Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Bank Fraud Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government concedes, the district court did not instruct the jury that materiality was a required element of the \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" prong of bank fraud under &#167; 1344(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Since the time of Benjamin's trial, the Supreme Court has declared that materiality is an element of bank fraud in proving that a defendant engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud. See United States v. Neder, 527 U.S. 1, 25 (1999); United States v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir. 1999). Thus, the court's failure to instruct the jury on this point was error. As we noted above, Benjamin's failure to object to this omission means that we will correct the error only if we conclude that it affected his substantial rights. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 731. To answer this question, we must determine \"whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 19. See also Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Neder, the Court defined a matter as \"material\" if \"a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 222 n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 538 (1976)). We find that the jury, properly instructed on this issue, easily would have found Benjamin's use of a false identification card and phony business to be material. In making the unauthorized deposits into and withdrawals out of the account, Benjamin further represented that he was Ralph Chapel and implicitly represented that he was authorized to cash or deposit the stolen checks. Fleet Bank likely would have found Benjamin's use of false identifying information important in determining whether the institution would allow him to become a banking customer and whether the bank would credit his account for the amount of the stolen checks he and DeCosta presented for deposit. Thus, the record does not contain evidence that could have led a rational jury to reach a contrary finding on materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instruction on Engaging in Monetary Transactions Over $10,000 in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin's objection to the jury instructions on these counts is similar to his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence: he argues that the district court instructed the jury in a way that allowed it to find him guilty without determining that the two transactions affected interstate commerce. Contrary to his claim, however, the district court instructed the jury properly. As part of its explanation of \"monetary transaction,\" the court stated: \"The term monetary transaction means the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce of funds or a monetary instrument by or through - by, through, or to a financial institution.\" The jury received an additional instruction on this point after it requested a clarification during its deliberations on the definition of interstate commerce. In response to this inquiry, the district court instructed the jury, in part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]ou must still find that the transactions had at least a minimal effect on interstate commerce; that is, that the activities affected commerce in any way or degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the interstate commerce element can be established in several ways. First, if you find that the government has proved bank fraud as alleged in Count 1 of the indictment, you are free to consider whether or not the bank fraud, which is the specified unlawful activity designated in Counts 2 through 7 [the money laundering counts], affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, you are free to consider, if you find that an initial deposit of funds was made to Fleet Bank, whether that initial deposit of checks was to an FDIC-insured financial institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, you are free to consider whether or not the source of that initial deposit to Fleet Bank affected interstate commerce in any way or degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error in this instruction. As we have explained, &#167; 1957 requires only that the monetary transaction have a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. See Owens, 167 F.3d at 754. The theory of the government's case was that the four stolen checks deposited in the Eastside Motorsports account at Fleet Bank provided the funds for the purchase of the two bank checks at issue in counts eight and nine. Therefore, the instruction that the jury could find that these initial deposits of stolen funds had a de minimis effect on interstate commerce - either because the bank to which they were deposited was FDIC-insured or because the source of that deposit actually affected interstate commerce to any degree - adequately described the requirements of &#167; 1957.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin argues that there was a variance between what was alleged in count one of the indictment, charging him with bank fraud, and the proof offered at trial. We will reverse a conviction for this reason only where \"the variance works a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be informed of the charges.\" United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994). We consider this question de novo. See United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 700 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin seems to argue in his brief that a variance existed because the indictment charged him with bank fraud, requiring the prosecution to prove that he personally deposited all of the checks involved, while the evidence demonstrated that Ian DeCosta made the two-check deposit on April 9. However, count one of the indictment charged Benjamin with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, as well as with aiding and abetting that crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. There is no requirement that a defendant personally commit an act to be held responsible for aiding and abetting the commission of that act. See Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d at 223; United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 590-91 (1st Cir. 1994). The indictment alleged that Benjamin engaged in a scheme to defraud Fleet Bank, and the evidence at trial was offered to prove exactly that scheme. We thus conclude that the indictment provided adequate notice to Benjamin, and there was no variance in the proof offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Exculpatory Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin claims that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the government's failure to disclose handwriting exemplars he gave at the time of his arrest in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). We review the district court's denial of his motion for an abuse of discretion. See United States v. Montilla Rivera, 171 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The handwriting samples at issue here were taken at the time of Benjamin's arrest as part of routine Secret Service procedures. The government never analyzed the samples or introduced them at trial. Benjamin requested them in September 1999 following his conviction, and the record indicates that counsel for the government had not been aware of the exemplars (presumably because they were never analyzed or used for any purpose) prior to Benjamin's request. While it was the government's position then, and remains now, that it was not required to produce the handwriting samples because they were not analyzed or even used, counsel nonetheless responded promptly to Benjamin's letter and produced the exemplars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution is obligated to provide a defendant access to material exculpatory evidence that is in its control. See United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 675-76 (1985); Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. Evidence is material only when \"there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. A \"reasonable probability\" is one that is \"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude easily that Benjamin received a fair trial without presenting the handwriting exemplars for the jury's consideration. He has not even attempted to explain how the samples are material in the sense that they undermine confidence in the jury's verdict of guilty. Indeed, as noted, the exemplars were never analyzed or used as part of the prosecution's case. The case against Benjamin did not rest on an identification of his handwriting. Thus, we find that no Brady violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. Under representation of African-Americans in the Jury Venire</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin, who is African-American, claims that the under representation of African-Americans in his jury venire violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1861. Guided by our recent decision in United States v. Royal, 174 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999), we reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he American concept of the jury trial contemplates a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.\" Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527 (1975). This requirement is fundamental to the right to jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See id. at 530; Royal, 174 F.3d at 6. To make a prima facie case that the right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community has been violated, a defendant must establish the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \"distinctive\" group in the community;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) that this under representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury- selection process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364 (1979). See also Royal, 174 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Royal, as here, the defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the jury selection process for the District of Massachusetts produced a systematic under-representation of African-American jurors. Royal was allowed to inspect the jury records for 1994 to investigate his claim, and he retained an expert to analyze this data. See Royal, 174 F.3d at 4-5. We noted at the outset of that opinion that \"[t]here is no dispute that Royal has satisfied the first prong of [the Duren] test; blacks are unquestionably a 'distinctive' group for the purpose of a fair cross-section analysis.\" Id. at 6. Thus, we turn to the second prong of the Duren test to analyze Benjamin's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not discuss the complicated mathematical analyses we considered in Royal. For the purpose of evaluating Benjamin's claim, we rely on our conclusion that the statistics about the jury selection procedure in Massachusetts were \"insufficient to satisfy Royal's burden under the second prong of Duren.\" Royal, 174 F.3d at 11. Benjamin attempts to avoid this result by claiming only that the statistical analysis in Royal \"uses outdated numbers from 1994.\" However, he has not articulated even a vague reason to suspect that the statistics discussed in Royal are no longer accurate, let alone that such different statistics, if they existed, would suffice to establish a violation under Duren. In sum, Benjamin has not explained why Royal should not guide our analysis here. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the representation of African-Americans in the jury venires \"is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community.\" Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Benjamin argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the ineffective assistance of his trial lawyer. However, \"[w]e have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 841 (1st Cir. 1998). Although we have occasionally reviewed ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, \"we travel this route only when the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.\" Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063. Concluding that this is not such a case, we decline to consider Benjamin's claim. This action, of course, is without prejudice to Benjamin's right to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a proceeding for post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VIII. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Benjamin's convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Maggelet originally misidentified the individual who deposited these checks as Benjamin, not DeCosta, he testified at trial that he made this misidentification on the basis of photographs of the defendant he considered to be of poor quality. This misidentification does not affect our analysis.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The jury acquitted Benjamin of the six counts of money laundering.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, provides:</p>\n        <p>Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice--</p>\n        <p>(1) to defraud a financial institution; or</p>\n        <p>(2) to obtain any of the money, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises; shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While the government did not have to prove that Benjamin knew the property was derived from a specified unlawful activity, the district court instructed the jury that they needed to find \"that the defendant knew the property was derived from bank fraud.\" The court acknowledged at a later proceeding that this instruction improperly increased the burden for the government. Thus, while there was no need for the government to prove Benjamin's knowledge on this point, the improper instruction likely meant that the jury found that Benjamin had such knowledge. Even if he did not have that knowledge, however, that fact does not affect our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence under &#167; 1957 because we consider what the jury needed to find as though it had been instructed properly. As we have held, \"[a] patently erroneous . . . instruction does not establish the standard by which we measure the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.\" United States v. Zanghi, 189 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The interstate commerce element of &#167; 1957 and &#167; 1956 (money laundering) has been construed similarly.

He also filed a business certificate with the City of Boston for a business called Eastside Motorsports. On March 31, 1998, Benjamin used the false identification card to open a bank account at Fleet Bank in the name of \"Ralph Chapel d/b/a Eastside Motorsports\" (Eastside Motorsports account). He made a deposit of $100 to open the account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1998, a man identified as Ian DeCosta deposited two checks totaling approximately $202,000 into the account recently opened by Benjamin. Frank Maggelet, a fraud investigator employed by Fleet Financial Group, testified that these deposits were made with deposit slips issued by the bank and pre-printed with the account information for the Eastside Motorsports account that Benjamin had just opened.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> These checks were made payable to Stratus Computer, Incorporated. Testimony at trial indicated that these checks were intended to go to a post office box for processing, and that Stratus did not authorize the deposit of the checks into the Eastside Motorsports account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin made large withdrawals from the account the same day that DeCosta made the deposit of over $200,000. Specifically, he wrote two checks, for $25,000 each, to Prime Speed, an auto parts business. Benjamin wrote a third check for $30,000 to Unique Creations hair salon. Additional draws on the account totaling $18,700 were made with checks written to cash and signed by Ralph Chapel on April 13, 14, 28, and 30, 1998.

This check was made payable to Benjamin, and the name \"Ralph Chapel\" was noted on the line of the check marked \"memo.\" Benjamin purchased a second bank check for $17,000 from Bank Boston on April 17, also made payable to \"Lyndon Benjamin.\" Benjamin used these checks to purchase a 1998 Lexus in his own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1998, two checks totaling approximately $180,000 were deposited into the Eastside Motorsports account. Surveillance photos from the bank indicated that Benjamin made these deposits. One of the checks, in the amount of approximately $170,000, was made payable to Ben &amp; Jerry's, and the other check, in the amount of approximately $10,000, was made payable to Clearmount Corporation. Representatives from these companies testified that Benjamin was not authorized to obtain these funds or deposit them into the Eastside Motorsports account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this time, Benjamin, as Ralph Chapel, also cashed six checks from Prime Speed, the auto parts business to which he had written two checks of $25,000 each on the day that DeCosta first deposited large sums of money into the Eastside Motorsports account. These six checks, ranging in amount from $2,000 to $19,900, were all made payable to Ralph Chapel, doing business as Eastside Motorsports. The checks were cashed by Benjamin using the name Ralph Chapel and his Massachusetts identification card. Kevin Primus, the owner of Prime Speed, testified that these checks were refunds to Benjamin of deposits he had made for auto parts that Primus was subsequently not able to obtain from his suppliers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A nine-count indictment was returned against Benjamin on September 23, 1998.

Following a six-day trial in April 1999, a jury convicted Benjamin of counts one, eight, and nine.

The prosecution must prove that the scheme involved a material falsehood, and that the defendant had an intent to defraud the bank. See Kenrick, 221 F.3d at 30.

Maggelet testified that Benjamin opened an account at Fleet under a false name and social security number, and that the business, Eastside Motorsports, in whose name the account was opened, did not actually exist. An employee of Stratus Computer testified that neither DeCosta nor Benjamin was authorized to cash or deposit the two checks totaling over $200,000, made payable to Stratus Computer, into the Eastside Motorsports account. Notwithstanding Benjamin's contention that he did not know the money deposited by DeCosta was stolen, the jury could have inferred Benjamin's awareness of this fraudulent transaction, and acquiescence to it, from DeCosta's use of the pre-printed deposit slip for the Eastside Motorsports account (presumably issued to Benjamin, as Ralph Chapel, after he opened the account) and the fact that Benjamin wrote three checks totaling $80,000 withdrawing money from the account later that same day. Surveillance photos at the bank indicated that Benjamin himself deposited two large checks into the account on May 11, 1998. Employees of the companies to which those checks were made payable testified that Benjamin was not authorized to deposit those checks, with fraudulent endorsements, into the Eastside Motorsports account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could have found further that this deception and DeCosta's deposit were intended to obtain something of value from the bank because the Eastside Motorsports account was credited for over $370,000 as a result of the deposits Benjamin and DeCosta made. Benjamin benefitted further from the scheme through his withdrawal from the account of large amounts of the stolen funds he had deposited there, using the false name Ralph Chapel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Count nine charged a monetary transaction on April 17, 1998 involving a Bank Boston check made payable to Lyndon Benjamin in the amount of $17,000. The government had to establish in the circumstances of this case that the money used to purchase the bank checks could be linked to the account Benjamin had fraudulently established at Fleet Bank and funded with stolen money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin cites three deficiencies in the &#167; 1957 evidence. He claims that the government failed to prove: (1) that he knew the property was derived from a specified unlawful activity; (2) that he knew the transactions involved criminally derived property; and (3) that the two monetary transactions involving the bank checks affected interstate commerce. In United States v. Richard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199197\"><a href=\"/opinion/199197/united-states-v-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2000), we considered the prosecution's burden of proof for the elements of &#167; 1957 relating to \"specified unlawful activity\" and \"criminally derived property\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may not be convicted under section 1957(a) unless he knew that the transaction involved \"criminally derived property,\" but he need not know that the property was derived from the \"specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(c). In other words, the government must prove (1) that [the defendant] had general knowledge of the subject property's criminal nature, and (2) that the property, in fact, was derived from a specified offense listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(7). 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(3). The government need not prove that [the defendant] had knowledge of the specified offense, or that he committed it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard, 234 F.3d at 769. We discuss the elements of the offense in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Property derived from a specified unlawful activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We easily dispose of Benjamin's argument that the government had to prove that he knew the two bank checks were derived from a specified unlawful activity. This claim misreads the plain language of &#167; 1957. Subsection (c) of that statute states: \"the Government is not required to prove the defendant knew that the offense from which the criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful activity.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(c). See also United States v. Gabriele, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196253\"><a href=\"/opinion/196253/united-states-v-gabriele/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir. 1995). It is sufficient under &#167; 1957 that the two bank checks were, in fact, derived from bank fraud, which is listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(7) as a specified unlawful activity. Benjamin's lack of knowledge that bank fraud is among the enumerated activities was irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have explained in the preceding section, there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Benjamin committed bank fraud when he opened the account with an assumed name, presented stolen checks for deposit, asked that the funds be credited to the Eastside Motorsports account, and, as Ralph Chapel, obtained cash from the funds in this account either by writing checks drawn on the account directly to cash, or by writing large checks to Prime Speed and receiving checks back from Prime Speed which he then cashed. More specifically, Benjamin cashed a check for approximately $19,900 from Prime Speed on April 14. Benjamin also withdrew $8,700 in cash from the Eastside Motorsports account in two transactions on April 13 and April 14. Thus, Benjamin had a total of $28,600 cash in his possession only a few days before he obtained bank checks on April 16 and April 17 for $10,900 and $17,000, respectively. Based on this evidence, the jury could have inferred that Benjamin used that cash, which was derived from bank fraud, to obtain the two bank checks. Thus, the jury could have concluded that the two bank checks charged in counts eight and nine were in fact drawn on funds obtained from a specified unlawful activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Criminally derived property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Benjamin argues that the government failed to prove that he knew that the transactions involved criminally derived property. Section 1957 defines \"criminally derived property\" as \"any property constituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(2). We have interpreted this element to require a defendant to have \"general knowledge of the subject property's criminal nature.\" Richard, 234 F.3d at 769. Benjamin's conviction for bank fraud provided evidence that he realized the funds originally in the Eastside Motorsports account - which were then used to obtain the bank checks - were derived from criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin does not persuade us otherwise. He claims that the issuance of the bank checks in his own name, and his use of the checks to purchase a car in his own name, indicate his lack of knowledge that the funds were criminally derived. However, Benjamin's use of his own name for these transactions is irrelevant. The subject property at issue for the monetary transactions charged in counts eight and nine is the money used to obtain the bank checks. As we have explained, those funds were criminally derived because they originally arrived in the Eastside Motorsports account as a product of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin also claims that there is \"no evidence, that the defendant was aware of the nature, location, source, ownership or control of the checks deposited by DeCosta.\" However, those unauthorized deposits of stolen checks were made with deposit slips pre-printed with the account information for the Eastside Motorsports account. Benjamin does not dispute that he was responsible for opening that account and that he did so using a false name and a false social security number. Because Benjamin opened the account, the jury reasonably could have found that Benjamin was aware of DeCosta's deposits into the account using the pre-printed slips provided by the bank. Additionally, Benjamin, signing checks as Ralph Chapel, wrote three checks totaling $80,000 from the account later in the same day that DeCosta deposited the two stolen checks. These circumstances reasonably could lead rational jurors to conclude that Benjamin realized that the funds in the Eastside Motorsports account were derived from some activity of a criminal or fraudulent nature. See, e.g., Richard, 234 F.3d at 769 (upholding conviction under &#167; 1957 where \"[b]ased upon [the defendant's] convictions of both mail fraud and securities fraud, it is clear that he had sufficient knowledge that the money he received from his investors - the subject property - was criminally derived\"); United States v. Butler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768618\"><a href=\"/opinion/768618/united-states-v-edward-r-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 830 (4th Cir. 2000) (finding that five cashiers' checks drawn on funds obtained through bankruptcy fraud constituted \"criminally derived property\"). As we discussed above, there was also evidence regarding Benjamin's cash withdrawals and cashing of other checks from which the jury could have inferred that the two bank checks were drawn on funds that were derived from the bank fraud. Therefore, we find the evidence sufficient for the jury to have found that Benjamin realized the bank checks were property derived from criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Monetary transaction affecting interstate commerce</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Benjamin claims that the monetary transactions did not have the requisite connection to interstate commerce. Section 1957(f) defines \"monetary transaction\" as \"the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, of funds or a monetary instrument . . . by, through, or to a financial institution.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957(f)(1). Section 1957(f) only requires that the transactions have a de minimis effect on commerce. See United States v. Owens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198347\"><a href=\"/opinion/198347/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 754 (1st Cir. 1999) (construing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As proof on this point, the government offered Fleet Bank's certificate of insurance issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This document, certifying that the bank is federally insured, suffices to satisfy the requirement that the transactions had at least a minimal impact on interstate commerce. See United States v. Ford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765268\"><a href=\"/opinion/765268/united-states-v-donald-g-ford-97-60976270-sandra-hutchins-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 584 (6th Cir. 1999) (construing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956 and &#167; 1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin objects to the jury instructions on two grounds. He argues first that the district court omitted an instruction on the materiality of the fraud in its instructions on bank fraud. Second, Benjamin claims that the court's instructions on &#167; 1957 did not require the jury to find the requisite connection between the monetary transaction and interstate commerce. Because Benjamin did not raise these objections before the district court, our review is for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); see also United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 731 (1993); Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 680. Thus, before deciding that any error requires a new trial, we must find that the error affected Benjamin's substantial rights by affecting the outcome of the trial. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 731; Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Bank Fraud Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government concedes, the district court did not instruct the jury that materiality was a required element of the \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" prong of bank fraud under &#167; 1344(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Since the time of Benjamin's trial, the Supreme Court has declared that materiality is an element of bank fraud in proving that a defendant engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud. See United States v. Neder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 25 (1999); United States v. Colon-Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198655\"><a href=\"/opinion/198655/united-states-v-colon-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 221 (1st Cir. 1999). Thus, the court's failure to instruct the jury on this point was error. As we noted above, Benjamin's failure to object to this omission means that we will correct the error only if we conclude that it affected his substantial rights. See Olano, 507 U.S. at 731. To answer this question, we must determine \"whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 19. See also Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Neder, the Court defined a matter as \"material\" if \"a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question.\" Neder, 527 U.S. at 222 n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 538 (1976)). We find that the jury, properly instructed on this issue, easily would have found Benjamin's use of a false identification card and phony business to be material. In making the unauthorized deposits into and withdrawals out of the account, Benjamin further represented that he was Ralph Chapel and implicitly represented that he was authorized to cash or deposit the stolen checks. Fleet Bank likely would have found Benjamin's use of false identifying information important in determining whether the institution would allow him to become a banking customer and whether the bank would credit his account for the amount of the stolen checks he and DeCosta presented for deposit. Thus, the record does not contain evidence that could have led a rational jury to reach a contrary finding on materiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instruction on Engaging in Monetary Transactions Over $10,000 in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin's objection to the jury instructions on these counts is similar to his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence: he argues that the district court instructed the jury in a way that allowed it to find him guilty without determining that the two transactions affected interstate commerce. Contrary to his claim, however, the district court instructed the jury properly. As part of its explanation of \"monetary transaction,\" the court stated: \"The term monetary transaction means the deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or exchange in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce of funds or a monetary instrument by or through - by, through, or to a financial institution.\" The jury received an additional instruction on this point after it requested a clarification during its deliberations on the definition of interstate commerce. In response to this inquiry, the district court instructed the jury, in part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Y]ou must still find that the transactions had at least a minimal effect on interstate commerce; that is, that the activities affected commerce in any way or degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the interstate commerce element can be established in several ways. First, if you find that the government has proved bank fraud as alleged in Count 1 of the indictment, you are free to consider whether or not the bank fraud, which is the specified unlawful activity designated in Counts 2 through 7 [the money laundering counts], affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, you are free to consider, if you find that an initial deposit of funds was made to Fleet Bank, whether that initial deposit of checks was to an FDIC-insured financial institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, you are free to consider whether or not the source of that initial deposit to Fleet Bank affected interstate commerce in any way or degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error in this instruction. As we have explained, &#167; 1957 requires only that the monetary transaction have a de minimis effect on interstate commerce. See Owens, 167 F.3d at 754. The theory of the government's case was that the four stolen checks deposited in the Eastside Motorsports account at Fleet Bank provided the funds for the purchase of the two bank checks at issue in counts eight and nine. Therefore, the instruction that the jury could find that these initial deposits of stolen funds had a de minimis effect on interstate commerce - either because the bank to which they were deposited was FDIC-insured or because the source of that deposit actually affected interstate commerce to any degree - adequately described the requirements of &#167; 1957.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin argues that there was a variance between what was alleged in count one of the indictment, charging him with bank fraud, and the proof offered at trial. We will reverse a conviction for this reason only where \"the variance works a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be informed of the charges.\" United States v. Arcadipane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1994). We consider this question de novo. See United States v. Portela, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 700 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin seems to argue in his brief that a variance existed because the indictment charged him with bank fraud, requiring the prosecution to prove that he personally deposited all of the checks involved, while the evidence demonstrated that Ian DeCosta made the two-check deposit on April 9. However, count one of the indictment charged Benjamin with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, as well as with aiding and abetting that crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. There is no requirement that a defendant personally commit an act to be held responsible for aiding and abetting the commission of that act. See Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d at 223; United States v. Loder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 590-91 (1st Cir. 1994). The indictment alleged that Benjamin engaged in a scheme to defraud Fleet Bank, and the evidence at trial was offered to prove exactly that scheme. We thus conclude that the indictment provided adequate notice to Benjamin, and there was no variance in the proof offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Exculpatory Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin claims that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the government's failure to disclose handwriting exemplars he gave at the time of his arrest in violation of Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span> (1963). We review the district court's denial of his motion for an abuse of discretion. See United States v. Montilla Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198383\"><a href=\"/opinion/198383/united-states-v-montilla-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The handwriting samples at issue here were taken at the time of Benjamin's arrest as part of routine Secret Service procedures. The government never analyzed the samples or introduced them at trial. Benjamin requested them in September 1999 following his conviction, and the record indicates that counsel for the government had not been aware of the exemplars (presumably because they were never analyzed or used for any purpose) prior to Benjamin's request. While it was the government's position then, and remains now, that it was not required to produce the handwriting samples because they were not analyzed or even used, counsel nonetheless responded promptly to Benjamin's letter and produced the exemplars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution is obligated to provide a defendant access to material exculpatory evidence that is in its control. See United States v. Bagley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 675-76 (1985); Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. Evidence is material only when \"there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. A \"reasonable probability\" is one that is \"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude easily that Benjamin received a fair trial without presenting the handwriting exemplars for the jury's consideration. He has not even attempted to explain how the samples are material in the sense that they undermine confidence in the jury's verdict of guilty. Indeed, as noted, the exemplars were never analyzed or used as part of the prosecution's case. The case against Benjamin did not rest on an identification of his handwriting. Thus, we find that no Brady violation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. Under representation of African-Americans in the Jury Venire</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Benjamin, who is African-American, claims that the under representation of African-Americans in his jury venire violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1861. Guided by our recent decision in United States v. Royal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198410\"><a href=\"/opinion/198410/united-states-v-royal/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1999), we reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he American concept of the jury trial contemplates a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.\" Taylor v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109133\"><a href=\"/opinion/109133/taylor-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 527 (1975). This requirement is fundamental to the right to jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See id. at 530; Royal, 174 F.3d at 6. To make a prima facie case that the right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community has been violated, a defendant must establish the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \"distinctive\" group in the community;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) that this under representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury- selection process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duren v. Missouri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109965\"><a href=\"/opinion/109965/duren-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 364 (1979). See also Royal, 174 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Royal, as here, the defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the jury selection process for the District of Massachusetts produced a systematic under-representation of African-American jurors. Royal was allowed to inspect the jury records for 1994 to investigate his claim, and he retained an expert to analyze this data. See Royal, 174 F.3d at 4-5. We noted at the outset of that opinion that \"[t]here is no dispute that Royal has satisfied the first prong of [the Duren] test; blacks are unquestionably a 'distinctive' group for the purpose of a fair cross-section analysis.\" Id. at 6. Thus, we turn to the second prong of the Duren test to analyze Benjamin's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not discuss the complicated mathematical analyses we considered in Royal. For the purpose of evaluating Benjamin's claim, we rely on our conclusion that the statistics about the jury selection procedure in Massachusetts were \"insufficient to satisfy Royal's burden under the second prong of Duren.\" Royal, 174 F.3d at 11. Benjamin attempts to avoid this result by claiming only that the statistical analysis in Royal \"uses outdated numbers from 1994.\" However, he has not articulated even a vague reason to suspect that the statistics discussed in Royal are no longer accurate, let alone that such different statistics, if they existed, would suffice to establish a violation under Duren. In sum, Benjamin has not explained why Royal should not guide our analysis here. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the representation of African-Americans in the jury venires \"is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community.\" Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Benjamin argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the ineffective assistance of his trial lawyer. However, \"[w]e have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Berrios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749864\"><a href=\"/opinion/749864/united-states-v-george-berrios-aka-antonio-candelario-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 841 (1st Cir. 1998). Although we have occasionally reviewed ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, \"we travel this route only when the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.\" Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063. Concluding that this is not such a case, we decline to consider Benjamin's claim. This action, of course, is without prejudice to Benjamin's right to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a proceeding for post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VIII. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Benjamin's convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Maggelet originally misidentified the individual who deposited these checks as Benjamin, not DeCosta, he testified at trial that he made this misidentification on the basis of photographs of the defendant he considered to be of poor quality. This misidentification does not affect our analysis.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The jury acquitted Benjamin of the six counts of money laundering.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, provides:</p>\n        <p>Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice--</p>\n        <p>(1) to defraud a financial institution; or</p>\n        <p>(2) to obtain any of the money, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises; shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While the government did not have to prove that Benjamin knew the property was derived from a specified unlawful activity, the district court instructed the jury that they needed to find \"that the defendant knew the property was derived from bank fraud.\" The court acknowledged at a later proceeding that this instruction improperly increased the burden for the government. Thus, while there was no need for the government to prove Benjamin's knowledge on this point, the improper instruction likely meant that the jury found that Benjamin had such knowledge. Even if he did not have that knowledge, however, that fact does not affect our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence under &#167; 1957 because we consider what the jury needed to find as though it had been instructed properly. As we have held, \"[a] patently erroneous . . . instruction does not establish the standard by which we measure the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.\" United States v. Zanghi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198610\"><a href=\"/opinion/198610/united-states-v-zanghi/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The interstate commerce element of &#167; 1957 and &#167; 1956 (money laundering) has been construed similarly. See, e.g., United States v. Ford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765268\"><a href=\"/opinion/765268/united-states-v-donald-g-ford-97-60976270-sandra-hutchins-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 583 (6th Cir. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Under the false pretenses prong of bank fraud, &#167; 1344(2), the district court did instruct the jury that the false representations needed to \"relate to a material aspect of the transaction in question.\" Thus, Benjamin challenges the jury instructions on only one of the two prongs of the statute.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Because we find that Benjamin's claim falters on the second prong of the Duren test, we do not consider whether the alleged under representation of African-Americans in the jury venires results from their systematic exclusion from the jury selection process.
