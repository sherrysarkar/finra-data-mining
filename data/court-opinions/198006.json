D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges,\r\n\nand Schwarzer, Senior District Judge.\r\n\n   Thomas A. Dougherty, by appointment of the court, for\r\nappellant.\r\n   Margaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Jonathan R.\r\nChapman, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nJune 10, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Luis Arestigueta was charged with conspiracy\r\nto possess cocaine with intent to distribute and, separately, with\r\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  21 U.S.C. \r\n841(a)(1), 846.  The jury convicted Arestigueta on the conspiracy\r\ncount but found him not guilty on the charge of possession with\r\nintent to distribute.  Arestigueta appeals, raising two different\r\nissues.\r\n1.  The first claim of error is addressed to the district\r\ncourt's refusal to suppress evidence obtained on the arrest of\r\nArestigueta and his \"partner,\" Raymond Maxwell.  The two men were\r\ntaken into custody, and a quantity of cocaine was seized from their\r\nvehicle, when they were stopped during a drive back from New York\r\nCity to Maine.  The basis for the suppression motion was a claim\r\nthat the affidavit supporting the search warrant contained false\r\ninformation.\r\nThe affidavit supporting the warrant described\r\ninformation linking Arestigueta and Maxwell with an intended trip\r\nto New York to obtain cocaine, and the information itself was more\r\nthan adequate to support the warrant, but much of it was attributed\r\nto an informant.  The gist of Arestigueta's complaint is that the\r\naffidavit described the informant as a \"concerned citizen\" when in\r\nfact the individual had previously been in police custody and had\r\na criminal record.  On this basis, Arestigueta sought a hearing\r\nunder Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).\r\nUnder Franks, a defendant can obtain a suppression\r\nhearing if he makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false\r\nstatement, made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth,\r\nwas included in the affidavit and was necessary to finding probable\r\ncause.  See id. at 155-56.  In this instance, the reference to a\r\n\"concerned citizen\" standing alone might have been misleading; but\r\nthe affidavit also disclosed the existence of the informant's\r\ncriminal record, and the usage \"concerned citizen\"--although\r\nunwise--may only have been intended to make clear that the source\r\nwas not a regularly used confidential informant.\r\nIn all events, it is patent that the label \"concerned\r\ncitizen\" was unnecessary to the warrant and that the remaining\r\ninformation in the affidavit amply justified the warrant.  The\r\nsource provided a detailed description of the intended crime, and\r\nsubsequent police observation confirmed the preparatory steps in a\r\nmanner consistent with the source's description.  All this was\r\nrecounted in the affidavit.  The district court was clearly right\r\nin denying a Franks hearing.\r\n2.  The more substantial issue on appeal concerns\r\nArestigueta's request for new trial based on newly discovered\r\nevidence.  A critical witness against Arestigueta was his partner-\r\nin-crime, Raymond Maxwell.  Maxwell's evidence was ample to convict\r\nArestigueta, if believed, but Maxwell had a criminal record and was\r\ncaught on the stand in some inconsistencies.  Nevertheless, the\r\njury was persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Arestigueta knew\r\nabout and had agreed to acquire the cocaine for distribution, even\r\nif he had not actually possessed it.\r\nAfter his conviction, Arestigueta produced two prisoners\r\nfrom the facility in which Maxwell was incarcerated; both were\r\nprepared to say that Maxwell had told them after the conviction\r\nthat Arestigueta had not known of the presence of the cocaine in\r\nthe car.  The district judge held a hearing on the motion for new\r\ntrial, the government agreeing that the evidence from the prisoners\r\nwas not previously known or available to Arestigueta.  See United\r\nStates v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 1992).  The government\r\nalso conceded that there was no lack of diligence in obtaining the\r\nnew evidence and that the evidence was material.  See id.\r\nThe remaining requirement for a new trial in a criminal\r\ncase is that \"the impact of the new evidence is so strong that an\r\nacquittal would probably result upon retrial.\"  Slade, 980 F.2d at\r\n29 (emphasis added).  The district court concluded that\r\nArestigueta failed to carry his burden of establishing this\r\nprerequisite, and Arestigueta seeks our review on this issue.  The\r\ndistrict court's judgment on the issue is reviewed under an abuse\r\nof discretion standard.  United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017,\r\n1019 (1st Cir. 1980).\r\n   Taken alone, a post-trial admission by the principal\r\nprosecution witness that he had lied about the defendant's guilty\r\nknowledge might appear very telling.  But in this instance, Maxwell\r\nwas also prepared to testify that he had made these remarks out of\r\nfear of being labeled a \"rat\" in prison, and that one of the new\r\n\"witnesses\" had intimidated Maxwell into disavowing his court\r\ntestimony.  The jury on retrial would have been told by Maxwell\r\nthat his original trial testimony was truthful and had been\r\nrecanted only out of a fear that few would find implausible.\r\n   Of course, the case against Arestigueta depended heavily\r\nupon Maxwell, whose past record and continued misstatements during\r\nhis trial testimony made him a vulnerable witness.  But all this\r\nwas known to the jury.  It is far from clear that Maxwell's later\r\nadmissions to fellow prisoners, plausibly explained as they were,\r\nwould have done much more to damage Maxwell's credibility.  The\r\nadmissions were certainly material evidence but their weight as\r\nimpeaching evidence was limited.\r\n   At the same time, the case against Arestigueta was\r\nreasonably strong.  Arestigueta had made an unexplained brief trip\r\nto New York with Maxwell and signed on as a co-driver of the rental\r\ncar.  In New York, he had admittedly visited his family, whom\r\nMaxwell said were the source of the drugs.  And cocaine was found\r\nunder the front seat of the car when, on their return trip to\r\nMaine, Maxwell and Arestigueta were arrested in accordance with the\r\ninformant's tip.\r\n   Under these circumstances, we agree that the new evidence\r\nis not such as would \"probably\" have resulted in an acquittal, and\r\nwe certainly do not think that the district court's well-reasoned\r\ndecision denying the new trial motion was an abuse of discretion.\r\n   Affirmed.\n",
