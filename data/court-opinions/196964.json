Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nrecord,  we conclude that the sentence imposed was proper for\r\n\nthe reasons  stated by the district  court.  We add  only the\r\n\nfollowing comments.\r\n\n     1.   Contrary to defendant's  arguments, the  transcript\r\n\nof  the  sentencing hearing  shows  that  the district  court\r\n\nadequately considered  all the  circumstances.   Further, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  acted within  its discretion  in determining\r\n\nthat no  downward departure was warranted and that a sentence\r\n\nat  the high end of the applicable range was appropriate.  We\r\n\nwill not review  those determinations.  See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555,  560 (1st Cir. 1996) (discretionary\r                       \r\n\ndecision not  to depart); United States  v.

The  record provides  no  support  for  defendant's\r\n\nassertion that the prosecutor acted in bad faith in declining\r\n\nto file a motion under U.S.S.G.    5K1.1.  See Wade v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 504 U.S. 181, 187 (1992); United States v.
