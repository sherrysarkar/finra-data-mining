We reach  this conclusion\r\n\nessentially for the reasons  stated in the magistrate judge's\r\n\nreport and recommendation dated August 26, 1996.  We add only\r\n\nthese comments.\r\n\n     1.   The  constitutionality  of   the  \"cost  of   care\"\r\n\nreimbursement  provision,  N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    622:53-58\r\n\n(Supp. 1995), is not fit  for review at this time and  better\r\n\nmay be evaluated in the context of a live  case.

Ann.     622:31-a  &amp; 623-B:1-3\r\n\n(Supp.  1995), are  alterations in  the prevailing  legal and\r\n\nadministrative regime, rather than  increases in the  measure\r\n\nof  punishment.   Therefore, those  provisions are  not penal\r\n\nlaws  violative of the Ex Post Facto clause, U.S. Const. art.\r\n\n1   10.  See California Department of Corrections v.
