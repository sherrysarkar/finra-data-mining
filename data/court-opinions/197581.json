Michael Nwogugu  appeals  pro se  from  a\r                                                                \r\n\ndistrict  court judgment dismissing his complaint in light of\r\n\npending arbitration,  as well  as  from the  denial of  post-\r\n\njudgment motions  to reconsider and  to reopen his case.   We\r\n\naffirm.1\r                   1\r\n\n     Contrary  to Nwogugu's suggestion, we think this case is\r\n\ngoverned by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),  9 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1-16, because  there was  a written  agreement  to submit  an\r\n\nexisting controversy  to arbitration, see  9 U.S.C.   2.   We\r                                                     \r\n\nreject   Nwogugu's  contention  that   he  falls  within  the\r\n\nexclusionary clause  in    1 of the  FAA because  the dispute\r\n\narises  out of  an  employment  contract.   In  Dickstein  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nduPont,  443  F.2d  783,  785 (1st  Cir.  1971),  this  court\r                  \r\n\nnarrowly  construed  the     1  exclusion  of  \"contracts  of\r\n\nemployment of . . .  workers engaged in foreign or interstate\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Nwogugu also seeks,  by way of separate  motions, summary\r               1\r\ndisposition  of the instant appeal and reconsideration of our\r\nprevious  denial of mandamus  relief.  Although  Nwogugu does\r\nnot  seek  mandamus  relief  on  the  ground  that  appellate\r\njurisdiction  may  be  lacking,   and  appellees  have  never\r\nquestioned our appellate jurisdiction, we note that it is not\r\nentirely  clear that the dismissal in favor of arbitration is\r\na  final, appealable order.  Compare McCarthy v. Providential\r                                                                         \r\nCorp., 1997 WL 471876, at **2-4 (9th Cir. Aug. 20, 1997) (2-1\r                 \r\ndecision)  (dismissing, as  interlocutory, appeal  from order\r\ncompelling arbitration and dismissing  complaint) with Armijo\r                                                                         \r\nv. Prudential  Ins. Co.  of America, 72  F.3d 793,  979 (10th\r                                               \r\nCir. 1995)  (holding that dismissal  as a result of  order to\r\ncompel arbitration  presents an  appealable final  decision).\r\nWe  need not resolve the jurisdictional  issue since it would\r\nnot  alter the  outcome.   We  deny the  motions for  summary\r\ndisposition  and reconsideration  of the  denial  of mandamus\r\nrelief on the ground that we  have found no error, much  less\r\nclear and indisputable error. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncommerce\"  as  limited  to those  employees  \"involved  in or\r\n\nclosely related to the actual movement of goods in interstate\r\n\ncommerce.\"  Nwogugu was a real estate analyst.   Since he was\r\n\nnot  involved in  the  transportation industry  (or otherwise\r\n\ninvolved in the  movement of goods), the  exclusionary clause\r\n\ndoes not apply. \r\n\n     Although  Nwogugu  cites  to   civil  rights  and  other\r\n\nstatutes  in his  brief, we  are persuaded that  his lawsuit,\r\n\nfairly construed, was limited  to common law claims.2   These\r                                                                2\r\n\ncommon law  claims  appear to  be,  at bottom,  identical  to\r\n\nclaims  which Nwogugu agreed  to arbitrate, and,  indeed, was\r\n\npursuing in arbitration  during the pendency of  his lawsuit.\r\n\nUnder  the  circumstance,  the district  court  appropriately\r\n\ndismissed   the  case,  see,  e.g.,  Alford  v.  Dean  Witter\r                                                                         \r\n\nReynolds,  Inc., 975  F.2d 1161,  1164 (5th  Cir.  1992), and\r                           \r\n\nthere is no  need for us to address  Nwogugu's arguments that\r\n\nvarious statutory claims are non-arbitrable.3  \r                                                        3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Nwogugu's  amended complaint lists a series of common law\r               2\r\nclaimsand this same list is repeated in subsequent filings.  \r\n\n   3Nwogugu also contends that his common law claims are non-\r               3\r\narbitrable  because  punitive  damages  are  unavailable   in\r\narbitration.  In support of this argument, he points out that\r\nthe employment contract  provides that it \"shall  be governed\r\nby the law of the State of New York,\" and that New York state\r\nlaw  prohibits  arbitral  awards  of  punitive  damages,  see\r                                                                         \r\nGarrity v. Lyle  Stuart, Inc., 40 N.Y.2d 354,  353 N.E.2d 793\r                                         \r\n(1976).  Nwogugu raised this argument for the first time in a\r\npost-judgment motion.  See FDIC v. World Univ. Inc., 978 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n10, 16  (1st Cir.  1992) (observing  that Rule 59(e)  motions\r\nshould  not  be used  to  raise  arguments which  could,  and\r\nshould, have been made before judgment issued).   We perceive\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Nwogugu complains  that \"justice  and the  right to  due\r\n\nprocess\"  demanded that the  district court hold  hearings on\r\n\nhis various  preliminary  motions (including  motions  for  a\r\n\ntemporary restraining order,  preliminary injunction, writ of\r\n\nattachment, and  summary judgment).    However, the  district\r\n\ncourt properly deferred  ruling on these motions  pending its\r\n\ndecision on the motion to dismiss, and the dismissal obviated\r\n\nthe need to explicitly address them.\r\n\n     Nwogugu  argues that he was entitled to summary judgment\r\n\non  the ground that  defendants failed to  oppose his (tardy)\r\n\nstatement of facts.   See Carreiro v.  Rhodes Gill &amp; Co.,  68\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d  1443, 1446  n.3 (1st Cir.  1995) (observing  that under\r\n\nLocal  Rule 56.1 of  the District of  Massachusetts, properly\r\n\nsupported  facts set  forth  by the  moving party  are deemed\r\n\nadmitted  unless controverted by the factual statement of the\r\n\nopposing party).  This argument fails.  Having concluded that\r\n\nNwogugu agreed to  arbitrate his dispute, the  district court\r\n\nappropriately refrained from reaching the merits of Nwogugu's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nno manifest error  of law.  \"The potential  unavailability of\r\npunitive damages  is not  a ground for  denying effect  to an\r\notherwise valid  agreement to  arbitrate.\"   Morgan v.  Smith\r                                                                         \r\nBarney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., 729 F.2d 1163, 1168 n.7 (8th Cir.\r                                      \r\n1984).  We add that it is  by no means apparent that punitive\r\ndamages, if otherwise  proper, are unavailable to  Nwogugu in\r                                                                      \r\narbitration.   See  Mastrobuono  v. Shearson  Lehman  Hutton,\r                                                                         \r\nInc.,  115  S.  Ct.  1212,  1216 (1995)  (observing  that  if\r                \r\ncontracting  parties  agree to  include  claims for  punitive\r\ndamages within the  issues to be arbitrated, the  FAA ensures\r\nthat their agreement  will be enforced according to its terms\r\neven  if a  rule of  state law  would otherwise  exclude such\r\nclaims from arbitration).   \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment.   \r\n\n     Nwogugu  contends  that  his  lawsuit should  have  been\r\n\nreopened based upon  a post-dismissal letter to  the National\r\n\nAssociation of Securities Dealers requesting to withdraw  his\r\n\nclaims in  arbitration conditional  upon  the district  court\r\n\nreopening  his action.   We  disagree.   Having agreed  to an\r\n\nalternative  forum, Nwogugu cannot simply change his mind and\r\n\ndecide  he wants  a  judicial forum  after  all.   Otherwise,\r\n\narbitration agreements would be unenforceable.\r\n\n     We   have  carefully   considered  Nwogugu's   remaining\r\n\narguments and reject them as without merit.  Accordingly, the\r\n\njudgment below is affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

We  deny the  motions for  summary\r\ndisposition  and reconsideration  of the  denial  of mandamus\r\nrelief on the ground that we  have found no error, much  less\r\nclear and indisputable error. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncommerce\"  as  limited  to those  employees  \"involved  in or\r\n\nclosely related to the actual movement of goods in interstate\r\n\ncommerce.\"  Nwogugu was a real estate analyst.   Since he was\r\n\nnot  involved in  the  transportation industry  (or otherwise\r\n\ninvolved in the  movement of goods), the  exclusionary clause\r\n\ndoes not apply. \r\n\n     Although  Nwogugu  cites  to   civil  rights  and  other\r\n\nstatutes  in his  brief, we  are persuaded that  his lawsuit,\r\n\nfairly construed, was limited  to common law claims.2   These\r                                                                2\r\n\ncommon law  claims  appear to  be,  at bottom,  identical  to\r\n\nclaims  which Nwogugu agreed  to arbitrate, and,  indeed, was\r\n\npursuing in arbitration  during the pendency of  his lawsuit.\r\n\nUnder  the  circumstance,  the district  court  appropriately\r\n\ndismissed   the  case,  see,  e.g.,  Alford  v.

However, the  district\r\n\ncourt properly deferred  ruling on these motions  pending its\r\n\ndecision on the motion to dismiss, and the dismissal obviated\r\n\nthe need to explicitly address them.\r\n\n     Nwogugu  argues that he was entitled to summary judgment\r\n\non  the ground that  defendants failed to  oppose his (tardy)\r\n\nstatement of facts.

This argument fails.  Having concluded that\r\n\nNwogugu agreed to  arbitrate his dispute, the  district court\r\n\nappropriately refrained from reaching the merits of Nwogugu's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nno manifest error  of law.  \"The potential  unavailability of\r\npunitive damages  is not  a ground for  denying effect  to an\r\notherwise valid  agreement to  arbitrate.\"   Morgan v.

We  disagree.   Having agreed  to an\r\n\nalternative  forum, Nwogugu cannot simply change his mind and\r\n\ndecide  he wants  a  judicial forum  after  all.   Otherwise,\r\n\narbitration agreements would be unenforceable.\r\n\n     We   have  carefully   considered  Nwogugu's   remaining\r\n\narguments and reject them as without merit.
