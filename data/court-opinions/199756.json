This appeal presents a series\n\nof    questions,       some    of    novel      impression        in     this      circuit,\n\nconcerning       various      federal         drug-trafficking           laws.        Those\n\nquestions      touch    upon      the    quantum         of   evidence      necessary      to\n\nestablish the existence of a drug-trafficking conspiracy; the\n\nnecessity (if any) for a showing of reasonable foreseeability in\n\na prosecution for selling heroin, death resulting; and the type\n\nand kind of proof that the government must adduce to convict a\n\ndefendant of selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school.                                  We\n\nresolve most of these questions favorably to the government, but\n\nwe resolve the last question favorably to the defendant (finding\n\nthat    the   government       did      not    present        evidence      from   which    a\n\nrational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nheroin     sales    occurred         within         1,000      feet    of     a    school).\n\nAccordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n              We limn the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, consistent with record support.                           United States v.\n\nHoulihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1277 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              On the morning of July 21, 1999, five men — Thomas\n\nDudek, Christopher Stevenson, Edward Thompson, Matthew Lawrence,\n\nand    Granger     Fulton     —   gathered          at   Stevenson's        apartment      in\n\nSunderland, Massachusetts.               The men drank heavily, and Lawrence\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fand Fulton eventually passed out.             Despite having consumed\n\nbetween ten and twenty beers apiece, the other three drove to\n\nHolyoke in search of cocaine.       Dudek, apparently the most drug-\n\nsavvy of the three, directed Thompson to drive to 67 Newton St.\n\nThompson remained in the car while his confreres climbed an\n\nexterior staircase at the back of the building.\n\n            Dudek previously had purchased cocaine on the second\n\nfloor, but this time he and Stevenson ascended to the third-\n\nfloor landing where a makeshift door, constructed of plywood and\n\nchicken    wire,   blocked   further     access.    Defendant-appellant\n\nAnibal Soler met them at that point.               When asked what they\n\nwanted,    Stevenson    replied,    \"$200    worth.\"       The    appellant\n\nretreated inside and emerged with twenty plastic bags labeled\n\n\"Me Salve.\"    He handed them to Dudek in exchange for cash.\n\n            As matters turned out, the bags contained heroin, not\n\ncocaine.      Dudek   apparently   recognized      that   fact,   but   said\n\nnothing to the others.        Stevenson began to snort some of the\n\nheroin inside the car.       The men drove to Thompson's apartment in\n\nChicopee, where all three proceeded to snort heroin until they\n\ncollapsed.\n\n            Thompson's girlfriend appeared on the scene hours later\n\nand tried to revive him.      Failing in this effort, she called for\n\nhelp.     Dudek awoke before the paramedics arrived, but his two\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffriends remained comatose.            The paramedics rushed all three men\n\nto the hospital and, soon thereafter, Thompson was pronounced\n\ndead.\n\n           The authorities immediately undertook an investigation\n\nand enlisted Dudek's cooperation (Stevenson did not awake from\n\nhis coma until seven days later).              Upon learning the source of\n\nthe   heroin,   they    decided       to   dispatch    an   undercover     state\n\ntrooper, Juan Colon, to 67 Newton St.                  On the following day\n\n(July 22), Colon, posing as a customer, climbed the exterior\n\nstairs to the third-floor landing.                  When he called into the\n\napartment, a pregnant female emerged and asked what he wanted.\n\nColon    responded,    \"two    bags.\"         The   woman   left   the   doorway\n\nmomentarily (as the appellant had done when Dudek appeared) and\n\nreturned with two bags of heroin, one stamped \"e Salve\" (an\n\nobvious error in which the \"M\" in \"Me Salve\" presumably missed\n\nthe bag's surface during the stamping process) and the other\n\n\"Blunt.\"    Colon handed her a $20 bill and departed.\n\n           Later    that      day,    Colon    revisited     the   third-floor\n\nlanding.    This time, the appellant responded and sold him two\n\nbags of heroin, both labeled \"Blunt.\"                Once again, Colon paid\n\nfor the drugs with a $20 bill.             The authorities then executed a\n\nsearch    warrant     for   the      third-floor     apartment.      Both    the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fappellant and the pregnant woman were there when the police\n\narrived — and both attempted to flee.\n\n            A search of the premises yielded, among other things,\n\nthirty bags of heroin (all labeled \"Blunt\") and over $5,000 in\n\nUnited States currency.          Stashed with the heroin was $1,010 in\n\ncash, including the two $20 bills that Colon had used to pay for\n\nhis   purchases    from    the    pregnant   woman    and   the   appellant,\n\nrespectively.\n\n            In due course, a federal grand jury handed up a five-\n\ncount indictment.         The indictment charged the appellant with\n\ndistribution of heroin, death resulting, on July 21, 1999, in\n\nviolation    of   21   U.S.C.    §   841(a)(1)   &   (b)(1)(C)    (count   1);\n\npossession of heroin with intent to distribute on July 22, 1999,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (count 3); possession of\n\nheroin with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school\n\non each of those two dates, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860(a)\n\n(counts 2 and 4); and conspiracy to possess and distribute\n\nheroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846 (count 5).1\n\nFollowing a ten-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty\n\non all five counts.         On December 5, 2000, the district court\n\nimposed concurrent sentences of life imprisonment on counts 1,\n\n\n\n      1\n     For ease in reference, we reprint pertinent portions of\nthese statutes in an appendix hereto.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f2, and 5, thirty years on count 3, and sixty years on count 4.\n\nThe   court   sentences   were     enhanced    because   the   government,\n\npursuant   to   21   U.S.C.   §   851,   appropriately   brought   to   the\n\ncourt's    attention   the    appellant's     previous   convictions    for\n\nunrelated drug-trafficking felonies. This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE\n\n           We turn first to the appellant's conviction on the\n\nconspiracy count and to his contention that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to prove that charge.            The appellant raised the\n\nsame point in a timely motion for judgment of acquittal.                See\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29.          The district court denied the motion,\n\nfinding the evidence adequate.           We review the district court's\n\ndenial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo, applying\n\nthe same standard as the lower court.           This means that we must\n\nuphold the verdict unless the evidence, viewed in the light most\n\nhospitable to the government's theory of the case, could not\n\nhave persuaded a rational trier of fact, beyond any reasonable\n\ndoubt, of the defendant's guilt.            United States v. Lara, 181\n\nF.3d 183, 200 (1st Cir. 1999).           In other words, the verdict can\n\nstand if — and only if — the evidence, viewed in the requisite\n\nlight, suffices to establish each element of the offense of\n\nconviction beyond a reasonable doubt.           Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f         To prove the existence of a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 846, \"the government must present clear evidence sufficient to\n\nshow beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement to commit the\n\nsubstantive offense actually existed, and that the individual\n\ndefendant knew of the agreement, had intent to agree, and had\n\nintent to commit the substantive offense.\"         United States v.\n\nLopez-Pena, 912 F.2d 1536, 1537 (1st Cir. 1989).           When direct\n\nevidence of any one or more of these elements is lacking, that\n\nelement may be proven by circumstantial evidence.         United States\n\nv. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n         In this instance, the appellant claims that there is\n\nno significantly probative evidence to show that he and the\n\npregnant woman (who was taken into custody, but who was neither\n\ncharged in this indictment nor called as a witness at the trial)\n\nwere acting in concert.      Although the appellant concedes that\n\nthe jury could have found that each of them was selling drugs\n\nfrom the identical locus, he asserts that their mere presence in\n\nthe same apartment is not enough to establish the existence of\n\na conspiracy.   See United States v. Ocampo, 964 F.2d 80, 82-83\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (holding that mere presence of two defendants in\n\nthe same apartment is insufficient to prove that both knowingly\n\nparticipated    in   drug   trafficking   within   that    apartment).\n\nRelatedly, he asserts that a conspiracy, by definition, requires\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmore than one member, and that the woman's participation in a\n\nsingle    heroin      sale        does    not       establish     her   status     as     a\n\ncoconspirator.        See United States v. Izzi, 613 F.2d 1205, 1210\n\n(1st Cir. 1980) (finding participation in a single drug sale,\n\nwithout     more,     to     be    inadequate         to   sustain      a    conspiracy\n\nconviction).\n\n            This      argument           is   cleverly      constructed,        but      it\n\nunderstates the force of the government's proof.                            Here, unlike\n\nin   Ocampo,    the   evidence           showed     that   both   occupants      of     the\n\napartment were actively engaged in the sale of drugs.                          Thus, the\n\njury could have found that the pregnant woman was not merely\n\npresent, but culpably present.                  Cf. United States v. Ortiz, 966\n\nF.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992) (distinguishing between \"mere\n\npresence\" and \"culpable presence\").                    And here, unlike in Izzi,\n\nthe proof did not show only a single drug sale, but, rather,\n\nthree sales over a two-day period — with an inventory of heroin\n\nsuggesting a readiness to engage in future transactions.\n\n            Even apart from these distinctions, the government's\n\nevidence is significantly more elaborate than the appellant\n\nsuggests.      The two alleged coconspirators were operating out of\n\nthe same \"store\" and selling identically marked bags from the\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\fsame inventory.2             Both of them were in the apartment at the time\n\nof the police raid — and both attempted to flee.                   Finally, and\n\nperhaps most damagingly, the $20 bills tendered to the pregnant\n\nwoman and to the appellant, respectively, were found commingled\n\nin a pile of cash stored with the drugs.                   We think that this\n\nevidence constitutes substantial proof that the two were engaged\n\nin a common enterprise, the proceeds of which were pooled.                    See\n\ngenerally United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"In reviewing a jury's finding that a single conspiracy\n\nexisted,          we    consider     specifically   such     factors     as   the\n\ncommonality            vel     non   of   the    nature,     motive,     design,\n\nimplementation, and logistics of the illegal activities as well\n\nas the scope of coconspirator involvement.\").\n\n              The appellant interposes a final objection, noting that\n\nthere was no evidence of the pregnant woman's participation in\n\nthe venture on the first day of the alleged two-day conspiracy.\n\nThis objection is wide of the mark.                 There is no requirement\n\nthat       each    coconspirator      participate   in     every   act   of   the\n\nconspiracy.            Cf. United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 735 (1st\n\n\n\n       2\n     The appellant confessed at one point that he had been\nselling Me Salve heroin but that his supply of Me Salve had been\nexhausted on July 22, at which point he switched to Blunt. The\nserial sales, including the pregnant woman's sale to Colon, fit\ninto this pattern and strongly suggest that both vendors were\nselling from the same inventory.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fCir. 1991) (explaining that one who joins a conspiracy may be\n\nheld \"accountable for the earlier acts of his coconspirators in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy\").      Here, the government adduced\n\ncompetent proof that the object of the conspiracy — heroin\n\ndistribution — took place over a two-day period.     We think that\n\na rational jury easily could conclude — as this jury did — that\n\nthese activities came within the scope of a tacit agreement\n\nbetween the two coconspirators.       Consequently, we affirm the\n\nappellant's conviction on count 5.\n\nIII.   THE \"DEATH RESULTING\" CHARGE\n\n          In count 1 of the indictment, the grand jury charged\n\na violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).     Under that statute, a\n\ndrug trafficker faces an enhanced sentence \"if death or serious\n\nbodily injury results from the use [of the drugs purveyed].\"\n\nThe appellant argues that the statute is inapposite because the\n\nkey event leading to the death — Thompson's snorting of heroin\n\nunder the misimpression that it was cocaine — was not reasonably\n\nforeseeable (and, thus, the death itself was not reasonably\n\nforeseeable).   This brings us to the preliminary question of\n\nwhether the operation of section 841(b)(1)(C) depends to any\n\nextent upon proof that death was reasonably foreseeable.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f            This is a question of first impression in this circuit.\n\nThe district court answered it in the negative.3                        Because this\n\nis a purely legal issue, we review the correctness of the\n\ndistrict court's disposition de novo.                  United States v. Pitrone,\n\n115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            By    its    terms,       the    statute    of     conviction     applies\n\nwhenever \"death . . . results\" from the use of drugs supplied by\n\nthe defendant.          21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).               The fact that the\n\nstatute    does    not    speak       to    the    defendant's        state   of       mind\n\nundercuts the appellant's argument that we should impose some\n\nkind of foreseeability test.                After all, Congress knows how to\n\nwrite    statutes       containing      state-of-mind          requirements        —    and\n\nCongress    demonstrated        that        facility    in     crafting   this         very\n\nstatute.         E.g.,    id.     §    841(a)      (prohibiting         knowing         and\n\nintentional drug trafficking).                 This makes the omission of an\n\nexplicit intent requirement in section 841(b)(1)(C) telling.\n\nSee Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 2125 (2001) (\"'[W]here\n\nCongress    includes      particular         language     in    one    section         of   a\n\n\n    3   The court charged the jury in pertinent part:\n\n    The government need not prove that the defendant knew\n    his distribution of heroin could result in the death\n    of another . . . . All that the government must prove\n    beyond a reasonable doubt is that Mr. Thompson used\n    the heroin the defendant distributed, and that but for\n    Mr. Thompson's use of the defendant's heroin, Mr.\n    Thompson would not have died.\n\n                                            -12-\n\fstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is\n\ngenerally      presumed    that   Congress       acts    intentionally      and\n\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\") (quoting\n\nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)); In re 229\n\nMain St. Ltd. P'ship, 262 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n              The case law tracks in the same direction.               Although\n\nthe   appellant    cites   several    cases     that    he   claims   impose   a\n\nreasonable foreseeability requirement, those cases all involve\n\nliability of one coconspirator for the acts of others.                    E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Swiney, 203 F.3d 397, 339 (6th Cir. 2000);\n\nUnited States v. Chisholm, 73 F.3d 304, 208 (11th Cir. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. DePriest, 6 F.3d 1201, 1212-13 (7th Cir. 1993).\n\nWhen the defendant's own conduct has caused the harm, those\n\ncases   are    inapposite.    Rather,       a   rule    of   strict   liability\n\napplies.      See United States v. McIntosh, 236 F.3d 968, 972 (8th\n\nCir. 2001) (holding, in the context of subsection 841(b)(1)(A),\n\nthat \"giving effect to [the statute's] plain meaning prohibits\n\nus from superimposing upon the statute a foreseeability or\n\nproximate cause requirement\"); United States v. Patterson, 38\n\nF.3d 139, 145 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that section 841(b)(1)(C)\n\ndoes not require a finding that death resulting from the use of\n\na distributed drug was reasonably foreseeable).                  Thus, when a\n\ndefendant deals drugs and a user of those drugs dies as a\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fresult, section 841(b)(1)(C) applies without any independent\n\nproof    that    the   death   was    a   reasonably    foreseeable    event.\n\nBecause the lower court correctly apprehended this point, we\n\naffirm the appellant's conviction on count 1.\n\nIV.     THE \"SCHOOLYARD\" COUNTS\n\n            21 U.S.C. § 860(a), colloquially called \"the schoolyard\n\nstatute,\" provides enhanced penalties, inter alia, for the sale\n\nof drugs within 1,000 feet of a school.              The jury convicted the\n\nappellant of violating this statute on both July 21 (count 2)\n\nand July 22 (count 4).              The appellant mounts a two-pronged\n\nchallenge       to   these   convictions.       We   consider   each   prong\n\nseparately.\n\n                               A.    The School.\n\n            The schoolyard statute focuses on the sale of drugs\n\nwithin 1,000 feet of any \"real property comprising a public or\n\nprivate elementary, vocational, or secondary school . . . .\"               21\n\nU.S.C. § 860(a).       The appellant questions whether the government\n\npresented sufficient evidence that such a facility existed in\n\nthe vicinity of 67 Newton St.             We think that it did.\n\n            To be sure, the government's proof is grudgingly bare.\n\nThe only testimony on the point came from a Holyoke police\n\nofficer, William Lempke, who identified a nearby structure as\n\n\"Lawrence Elementary School\" and stated that it was \"a public\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fschool in Holyoke.\"   The appellant insists that Lempke was not\n\na competent witness on the point — but he did not object to the\n\ntestimony when it was adduced and has waived any right to\n\nchallenge the witness's competence on appeal.   United States v.\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967,972 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing operation of\n\nthe raise-or-waive rule).\n\n         Of course, even if Lempke was a competent witness, it\n\nis arguable that his testimony, standing alone, was insufficient\n\nto prove the existence of a school beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nOn this point, the appellant strikes a responsive chord when he\n\nposits that the introduction of a map, the testimony of a city\n\nplanner, or evidence from a school official would have been a\n\nvastly preferable means of establishing that fact.   The issue,\n\nhowever, is not whether the government proved this element of\n\nthe offense in the best or most effective way, but, rather,\n\nwhether the proof adduced was legally adequate.      After all,\n\nsufficiency of evidence is a context-specific concern, and it\n\nmust be determined by whether a rational juror could have found\n\nthe essential fact beyond a reasonable doubt.     See Lara, 181\n\nF.3d at 200.\n\n         In the case at hand, the witness had been a member of\n\nthe local police force for fifteen years.   He testified that he\n\nwas intimately familiar with the neighborhood and that he worked\n\n\n                              -15-\n\fout of a police station located within a block of 67 Newton St.\n\n(and, thus, quite close to the structure that he identified as\n\na school).         Taking these facts into account and giving the\n\ngovernment     the      benefit       of   the       inferences        therefrom,     see\n\nHoulihan,     92    F.3d   at    1277,     we       conclude    that    the   officer's\n\ntestimony was enough — if barely — to prove the existence of a\n\nschool.4\n\n                            B.        The Measurement.\n\n            The second prong of the appellant's argument is more\n\nfinely honed.           He faults the government for not presenting\n\nadequate evidence that a drug transaction took place within the\n\nproscribed area — the 1,000-foot distance specified in section\n\n860(a).\n\n            This court has not spoken to how distance ought to be\n\nmeasured in cases brought under the schoolyard statute.                             We do\n\nso   today.        In   order    to    convict       under     section    860(a),     the\n\ngovernment     must      prove    beyond        a    reasonable    doubt      that    the\n\n\n      4\n     This case is distinguishable from United States v. Smith,\n13 F.3d 380 (10th Cir. 1993), much bruited by the appellant.\nThere, the court found testimony that a park contained a\nplayground insufficient for purposes of section 860.        The\nstatute, however, contains a specific definition of what\nconstitutes a playground, see 21 U.S.C. § 860(e) (stating that\na playground must have \"three or more separate [recreational]\napparatus\"), and the police officer who testified in Smith did\nnot speak to this aspect of the definition, see 13 F.3d at 382.\nSection 860 contains no such qualifying language for what\nconstitutes a school.\n\n                                           -16-\n\fdistance from a school to the actual site of the transaction,\n\nnot merely to the curtilage or exterior wall of the structure in\n\nwhich the transaction takes place, is 1,000 feet or less.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Harrison, 103 F.3d 986, 990 (D.C. Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited    States v.    Johnson, 46 F.3d 1166, 1169-70 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1995).    To achieve this benchmark here, the government again\n\nrelies upon officer Lempke's testimony.              Lempke stated that he\n\nused a measuring wheel as he walked from the rear entrance of 67\n\nNewton St. to the corner of the school building.               He calculated\n\nthat distance to be 963 feet.            But this left an obvious gap —\n\nthe distance between the base of the Newton St. building and the\n\nthird-floor landing on which the heroin was sold — and the\n\ngovernment offered no direct evidence as to that distance.\n\n           In    an   effort   to   fill     this    void,   the    government\n\nasseverates that a reasonable jury could have determined the\n\nunmeasured      distance   based    on   a   videotape       made   during    an\n\nunrelated drug raid earlier that month.             This asseveration rings\n\nhollow.    Precise measurements may be unnecessary in some cases\n\nwhere the spatial leeway is relatively great and the gap in the\n\nchain of proof is relatively small.                 E.g., United States v.\n\nGlover, 153 F.3d 749, 756 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (holding 326-foot\n\nleeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from front door of\n\nconvenience store to the store's basement); Harrison, 103 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fat 990 (holding 528-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement\n\ngap from the exterior of an apartment building to defendant's\n\nunit); United States v. Baylor, 97 F.3d 542, 546 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996) (holding 466-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement\n\ngap from the exterior of an apartment building to defendant's\n\nbasement apartment).     In such extreme instances, common sense,\n\ncommon knowledge, and rough indices of distance can carry the\n\nday.   When the spatial leeway is modest, however, and personal\n\nliberty is at stake, courts must examine the government's proof\n\nwith a more critical eye.\n\n          United States v. Applewhite, 72 F.3d 140 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1995), illustrates the point.          There, the court of appeals\n\nreversed a conviction on the ground that there was no evidence\n\nfrom which a jury could conclude that the defendant's kitchen,\n\nwhere drugs were found, was within the relatively small leeway\n\n(under eighty feet) left open by a measurement of the distance\n\nbetween the school and the entrance to the apartment building in\n\nwhich the defendant resided.    Id. at 143-44.   So too Johnson, in\n\nwhich the court reversed a conviction where the only evidence of\n\ndistance was a measurement of 994 feet up to the walkway of the\n\ndefendant's house.     46 F.3d at 1169-70.\n\n          The case at hand is one in which the spatial leeway is\n\nexceedingly modest:    the gap here is thirty-seven feet.   We have\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fviewed    the   videotape       mentioned    by   the   government       and   find\n\nunconvincing the assertion that the jury could have determined\n\nfrom it beyond a reasonable doubt that the vertical distance was\n\nless than thirty-seven feet.          Although the videotape was played\n\nseveral times for the jury, it was neither filmed with an eye\n\ntoward    elucidating      relative    distances        nor    introduced       into\n\nevidence for that purpose.            Moreover, it showed the relevant\n\nportion of the building fleetingly and as an incidental matter;\n\nthe camera angles were distorted by the repeated use of a zoom\n\nlens; and the prosecutor did not even attempt to draw the jury's\n\nattention to the scale involved.\n\n            To say more on this point would be supererogatory.\n\nDistances       are   notoriously      difficult        to    gauge   in       still\n\nphotographs, see Baylor, 97 F.3d at 546 (\"Spatial relationships\n\nare hardly intuitive, and photographs can distort distances.\"),\n\nand more so in motion pictures (such as videotapes).                     This case\n\nis   no   exception.       We    conclude    that    the     videotape    is    some\n\ntangential evidence of the unmeasured distance, but it is not\n\nsufficient      evidence   to    establish    that      measurement      beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt.       The spatial leeway is too small and the risk\n\nof error too great.        Although it is possible (indeed, probable)\n\nthat the distance from the school to the site of the heroin\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fsales was less than 1,000 feet,5 that is not good enough.             The\n\ngovernment   must   prove   the   elements   of   an   offense   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt — and its proof here simply does not conform to\n\nthat high standard.\n\n          We are constrained to add that, in this instance, the\n\ngovernment plainly has been the author of its own misfortune.\n\nA simple measuring tape dropped from the third-floor landing\n\nwould have closed the gap and resolved all doubt. 6               If that\n\nmeasurement would have favored the government, it is hard to\n\nimagine why the government did not undertake it.          In all events,\n\nthe insufficiency of the evidence on this point undermines the\n\nappellant's convictions on counts 2 and 4.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n     5\n     One reason for this intuition is that the government's 963-\nfoot measurement likely overstates the distance from the school\nto the corner of the apartment building.       That measurement\nstarted at the school building itself, rather than at the \"real\nproperty comprising [the] school.\"    21 U.S.C. § 860(a).    The\ngovernment has made no such argument, however, and it has\nprovided no basis for calculating the distance from the school\nbuilding to the lot line. We therefore do not probe the point.\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(explaining that arguments not properly developed on appeal are\ndeemed waived).\n     6\n     A direct vertical measurement, rather than one following\nthe winding staircase, would have been appropriate, as the\nschoolyard   statute  envisions   straight-line   rather   than\npedestrian-route measurements. Johnson, 46 F.3d at 1170; United\nStates v. Watson, 887 F.2d 980, 981 (9th Cir. 1989).\n\n                                  -20-\n\f          We need go no further.          The government introduced\n\nsufficient evidence on the conspiracy charge, and the district\n\ncourt   correctly   refused   to   instruct   the   jury   that   section\n\n841(b)(1)(C)      contains     a     requirement      of     reasonable\n\nforeseeability.     Thus, we affirm the appellant's convictions on\n\ncounts 1, 3, and 5, and leave intact the sentences on those\n\ncounts.    The government, however, failed to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that any drug transaction occurred within 1,000\n\nfeet of a school.    Hence, we reverse the appellant's convictions\n\non counts 2 and 4, and vacate the sentences imposed on those\n\ncounts.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\f                              Appendix\n\nRelevant excerpts from the United States Code      21 U.S.C. §§ 841,\n\n846, 860 (1994 & Supp. V 1999).\n\n\n\n§ 841.

Hon. Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge[Copyrighted Material Omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Richard Abbott, by appointment of the court, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Todd E. Newhouse, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom James B. Farmer, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Rosenn<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents a series of questions, some of novel impression in this circuit, concerning various federal drug-trafficking laws. Those questions touch upon the quantum of evidence necessary to establish the existence of a drug-trafficking conspiracy; the necessity (if any) for a showing of reasonable foreseeability in a prosecution for selling heroin, death resulting; and the type and kind of proof that the government must adduce to convict a defendant of selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. We resolve most of these questions favorably to the government, but we resolve the last question favorably to the defendant (finding that the government did not present evidence from which a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that heroin sales occurred within 1,000 feet of a school). Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We limn the facts in the light most favorable to the government, consistent with record support. United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1277 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of July 21, 1999, five men -- Thomas Dudek, Christopher Stevenson, Edward Thompson, Matthew Lawrence, and Granger Fulton -- gathered at Stevenson's apartment in Sunderland, Massachusetts. The men drank heavily, and Lawrence and Fulton eventually passed out. Despite having consumed between ten and twenty beers apiece, the other three drove to Holyoke in search of cocaine. Dudek, apparently the most drug-savvy of the three, directed Thompson to drive to 67 Newton St. Thompson remained in the car while his confreres climbed an exterior staircase at the back of the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dudek previously had purchased cocaine on the second floor, but this time he and Stevenson ascended to the third-floor landing where a makeshift door, constructed of plywood and chicken wire, blocked further access. Defendant-appellant Anibal Soler met them at that point. When asked what they wanted, Stevenson replied, \"$200 worth.\" The appellant retreated inside and emerged with twenty plastic bags labeled \"Me Salve.\" He handed them to Dudek in exchange for cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As matters turned out, the bags contained heroin, not cocaine. Dudek apparently recognized that fact, but said nothing to the others. Stevenson began to snort some of the heroin inside the car. The men drove to Thompson's apartment in Chicopee, where all three proceeded to snort heroin until they collapsed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson's girlfriend appeared on the scene hours later and tried to revive him. Failing in this effort, she called for help. Dudek awoke before the paramedics arrived, but his two friends remained comatose. The paramedics rushed all three men to the hospital and, soon thereafter, Thompson was pronounced dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities immediately undertook an investigation and enlisted Dudek's cooperation (Stevenson did not awake from his coma until seven days later). Upon learning the source of the heroin, they decided to dispatch an undercover state trooper, Juan Colon, to 67 Newton St. On the following day (July 22), Colon, posing as a customer, climbed the exterior stairs to the third-floor landing. When he called into the apartment, a pregnant female emerged and asked what he wanted. Colon responded, \"two bags.\" The woman left the doorway momentarily (as the appellant had done when Dudek appeared) and returned with two bags of heroin, one stamped \"e Salve\" (an obvious error in which the \"M\" in \"Me Salve\" presumably missed the bag's surface during the stamping process) and the other \"Blunt.\" Colon handed her a $20 bill and departed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Colon revisited the third-floor landing. This time, the appellant responded and sold him two bags of heroin, both labeled \"Blunt.\" Once again, Colon paid for the drugs with a $20 bill. The authorities then executed a search warrant for the third-floor apartment. Both the appellant and the pregnant woman were there when the police arrived -- and both attempted to flee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search of the premises yielded, among other things, thirty bags of heroin (all labeled \"Blunt\") and over $5,000 in United States currency. Stashed with the heroin was $1,010 in cash, including the two $20 bills that Colon had used to pay for his purchases from the pregnant woman and the appellant, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury handed up a five-count indictment. The indictment charged the appellant with distribution of heroin, death resulting, on July 21, 1999, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C) (count 1); possession of heroin with intent to distribute on July 22, 1999, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (count 3); possession of heroin with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school on each of those two dates, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a) (counts 2 and 4); and conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846 (count 5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following a ten-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty on all five counts. On December 5, 2000, the district court imposed concurrent sentences of life imprisonment on counts 1, 2, and 5, thirty years on count 3, and sixty years on count 4. The court sentences were enhanced because the government, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851, appropriately brought to the court's attention the appellant's previous convictions for unrelated drug-trafficking felonies. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the appellant's conviction on the conspiracy count and to his contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove that charge. The appellant raised the same point in a timely motion for judgment of acquittal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. The district court denied the motion, finding the evidence adequate. We review the district court's denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo, applying the same standard as the lower court. This means that we must uphold the verdict unless the evidence, viewed in the light most hospitable to the government's theory of the case, could not have persuaded a rational trier of fact, beyond any reasonable doubt, of the defendant's guilt. United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 200 (1st Cir. 1999). In other words, the verdict can stand if -- and only if -- the evidence, viewed in the requisite light, suffices to establish each element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the existence of a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, \"the government must present clear evidence sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement to commit the substantive offense actually existed, and that the individual defendant knew of the agreement, had intent to agree, and had intent to commit the substantive offense.\" United States v. Lopez-Pena, 912 F.2d 1536, 1537 (1st Cir. 1989). When direct evidence of any one or more of these elements is lacking, that element may be proven by circumstantial evidence. United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the appellant claims that there is no significantly probative evidence to show that he and the pregnant woman (who was taken into custody, but who was neither charged in this indictment nor called as a witness at the trial) were acting in concert. Although the appellant concedes that the jury could have found that each of them was selling drugs from the identical locus, he asserts that their mere presence in the same apartment is not enough to establish the existence of a conspiracy. See United States v. Ocampo, 964 F.2d 80, 82-83 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that mere presence of two defendants in the same apartment is insufficient to prove that both knowingly participated in drug trafficking within that apartment). Relatedly, he asserts that a conspiracy, by definition, requires more than one member, and that the woman's participation in a single heroin sale does not establish her status as a coconspirator. See United States v. Izzi, 613 F.2d 1205, 1210 (1st Cir. 1980) (finding participation in a single drug sale, without more, to be inadequate to sustain a conspiracy conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is cleverly constructed, but it understates the force of the government's proof. Here, unlike in Ocampo, the evidence showed that both occupants of the apartment were actively engaged in the sale of drugs. Thus, the jury could have found that the pregnant woman was not merely present, but culpably present. Cf. United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992) (distinguishing between \"mere presence\" and \"culpable presence\"). And here, unlike in Izzi, the proof did not show only a single drug sale, but, rather, three sales over a two-day period -- with an inventory of heroin suggesting a readiness to engage in future transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even apart from these distinctions, the government's evidence is significantly more elaborate than the appellant suggests. The two alleged coconspirators were operating out of the same \"store\" and selling identically marked bags from the same inventory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Both of them were in the apartment at the time of the police raid -- and both attempted to flee. Finally, and perhaps most damagingly, the $20 bills tendered to the pregnant woman and to the appellant, respectively, were found commingled in a pile of cash stored with the drugs. We think that this evidence constitutes substantial proof that the two were engaged in a common enterprise, the proceeds of which were pooled. See generally United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"In reviewing a jury's finding that a single conspiracy existed, we consider specifically such factors as the commonality vel non of the nature, motive, design, implementation, and logistics of the illegal activities as well as the scope of coconspirator involvement.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant interposes a final objection, noting that there was no evidence of the pregnant woman's participation in the venture on the first day of the alleged two-day conspiracy. This objection is wide of the mark. There is no requirement that each coconspirator participate in every act of the conspiracy. Cf. United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 735 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that one who joins a conspiracy may be held \"accountable for the earlier acts of his coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\"). Here, the government adduced competent proof that the object of the conspiracy -- heroin distribution -- took place over a two-day period. We think that a rational jury easily could conclude -- as this jury did -- that these activities came within the scope of a tacit agreement between the two coconspirators. Consequently, we affirm the appellant's conviction on count 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE \"DEATH RESULTING\" CHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In count 1 of the indictment, the grand jury charged a violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). Under that statute, a drug trafficker faces an enhanced sentence \"if death or serious bodily injury results from the use [of the drugs purveyed].\" The appellant argues that the statute is inapposite because the key event leading to the death -- Thompson's snorting of heroin under the misimpression that it was cocaine -- was not reasonably foreseeable (and, thus, the death itself was not reasonably foreseeable). This brings us to the preliminary question of whether the operation of section 841(b)(1)(C) depends to any extent upon proof that death was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a question of first impression in this circuit. The district court answered it in the negative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because this is a purely legal issue, we review the correctness of the district court's disposition de novo. United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the statute of conviction applies whenever \"death . . . results\" from the use of drugs supplied by the defendant. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The fact that the statute does not speak to the defendant's state of mind undercuts the appellant's argument that we should impose some kind of foreseeability test. After all, Congress knows how to write statutes containing state-of-mind requirements -- and Congress demonstrated that facility in crafting this very statute. E.g., id. &#167; 841(a) (prohibiting knowing and intentional drug trafficking). This makes the omission of an explicit intent requirement in section 841(b)(1)(C) telling. See Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 2125 (2001) (\"'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)); In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship, 262 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law tracks in the same direction. Although the appellant cites several cases that he claims impose a reasonable foreseeability requirement, those cases all involve liability of one coconspirator for the acts of others. E.g., United States v. Swiney, 203 F.3d 397, 339 (6th Cir. 2000); United States v. Chisholm, 73 F.3d 304, 208 (11th Cir. 1996); United States v. DePriest, 6 F.3d 1201, 1212-13 (7th Cir. 1993). When the defendant's own conduct has caused the harm, those cases are inapposite. Rather, a rule of strict liability applies. See United States v. McIntosh, 236 F.3d 968, 972 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding, in the context of subsection 841(b)(1)(A), that \"giving effect to [the statute's] plain meaning prohibits us from superimposing upon the statute a foreseeability or proximate cause requirement\"); United States v. Patterson, 38 F.3d 139, 145 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that section 841(b)(1)(C) does not require a finding that death resulting from the use of a distributed drug was reasonably foreseeable). Thus, when a defendant deals drugs and a user of those drugs dies as a result, section 841(b)(1)(C) applies without any independent proof that the death was a reasonably foreseeable event. Because the lower court correctly apprehended this point, we affirm the appellant's conviction on count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE \"SCHOOLYARD\" COUNTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a), colloquially called \"the schoolyard statute,\" provides enhanced penalties, inter alia, for the sale of drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. The jury convicted the appellant of violating this statute on both July 21 (count 2) and July 22 (count 4). The appellant mounts a two-pronged challenge to these convictions. We consider each prong separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The schoolyard statute focuses on the sale of drugs within 1,000 feet of any \"real property comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school . . . .\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a). The appellant questions whether the government presented sufficient evidence that such a facility existed in the vicinity of 67 Newton St. We think that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government's proof is grudgingly bare. The only testimony on the point came from a Holyoke police officer, William Lempke, who identified a nearby structure as \"Lawrence Elementary School\" and stated that it was \"a public school in Holyoke.\" The appellant insists that Lempke was not a competent witness on the point -- but he did not object to the testimony when it was adduced and has waived any right to challenge the witness's competence on appeal. United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967,972 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing operation of the raise-or-waive rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, even if Lempke was a competent witness, it is arguable that his testimony, standing alone, was insufficient to prove the existence of a school beyond a reasonable doubt. On this point, the appellant strikes a responsive chord when he posits that the introduction of a map, the testimony of a city planner, or evidence from a school official would have been a vastly preferable means of establishing that fact. The issue, however, is not whether the government proved this element of the offense in the best or most effective way, but, rather, whether the proof adduced was legally adequate. After all, sufficiency of evidence is a context-specific concern, and it must be determined by whether a rational juror could have found the essential fact beyond a reasonable doubt. See Lara, 181 F.3d at 200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the witness had been a member of the local police force for fifteen years. He testified that he was intimately familiar with the neighborhood and that he worked out of a police station located within a block of 67 Newton St. (and, thus, quite close to the structure that he identified as a school). Taking these facts into account and giving the government the benefit of the inferences therefrom, see Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1277, we conclude that the officer's testimony was enough -- if barely -- to prove the existence of a school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Measurement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the appellant's argument is more finely honed. He faults the government for not presenting adequate evidence that a drug transaction took place within the proscribed area -- the 1,000-foot distance specified in section 860(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not spoken to how distance ought to be measured in cases brought under the schoolyard statute. We do so today. In order to convict under section 860(a), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the distance from a school to the actual site of the transaction, not merely to the curtilage or exterior wall of the structure in which the transaction takes place, is 1,000 feet or less. See United States v. Harrison, 103 F.3d 986, 990 (D.C. Cir. 1997); United States v. Johnson, 46 F.3d 1166, 1169-70 (D.C. Cir. 1995). To achieve this benchmark here, the government again relies upon officer Lempke's testimony. Lempke stated that he used a measuring wheel as he walked from the rear entrance of 67 Newton St. to the corner of the school building. He calculated that distance to be 963 feet. But this left an obvious gap -- the distance between the base of the Newton St. building and the third-floor landing on which the heroin was sold -- and the government offered no direct evidence as to that distance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to fill this void, the government asseverates that a reasonable jury could have determined the unmeasured distance based on a videotape made during an unrelated drug raid earlier that month. This asseveration rings hollow. Precise measurements may be unnecessary in some cases where the spatial leeway is relatively great and the gap in the chain of proof is relatively small. E.g., United States v. Glover, 153 F.3d 749, 756 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (holding 326-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from front door of convenience store to the store's basement); Harrison, 103 F.3d at 990 (holding 528-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from the exterior of an apartment building to defendant's unit); United States v. Baylor, 97 F.3d 542, 546 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (holding 466-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from the exterior of an apartment building to defendant's basement apartment). In such extreme instances, common sense, common knowledge, and rough indices of distance can carry the day. When the spatial leeway is modest, however, and personal liberty is at stake, courts must examine the government's proof with a more critical eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Applewhite, 72 F.3d 140 (D.C. Cir. 1995), illustrates the point. There, the court of appeals reversed a conviction on the ground that there was no evidence from which a jury could conclude that the defendant's kitchen, where drugs were found, was within the relatively small leeway (under eighty feet) left open by a measurement of the distance between the school and the entrance to the apartment building in which the defendant resided. Id. at 143-44. So too Johnson, in which the court reversed a conviction where the only evidence of distance was a measurement of 994 feet up to the walkway of the defendant's house. 46 F.3d at 1169-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is one in which the spatial leeway is exceedingly modest: the gap here is thirty-seven feet. We have viewed the videotape mentioned by the government and find unconvincing the assertion that the jury could have determined from it beyond a reasonable doubt that the vertical distance was less than thirty-seven feet. Although the videotape was played several times for the jury, it was neither filmed with an eye toward elucidating relative distances nor introduced into evidence for that purpose. Moreover, it showed the relevant portion of the building fleetingly and as an incidental matter; the camera angles were distorted by the repeated use of a zoom lens; and the prosecutor did not even attempt to draw the jury's attention to the scale involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. Distances are notoriously difficult to gauge in still photographs, see Baylor, 97 F.3d at 546 (\"Spatial relationships are hardly intuitive, and photographs can distort distances.\"), and more so in motion pictures (such as videotapes). This case is no exception. We conclude that the videotape is some tangential evidence of the unmeasured distance, but it is not sufficient evidence to establish that measurement beyond a reasonable doubt. The spatial leeway is too small and the risk of error too great. Although it is possible (indeed, probable) that the distance from the school to the site of the heroin sales was less than 1,000 feet,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that is not good enough. The government must prove the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt -- and its proof here simply does not conform to that high standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are constrained to add that, in this instance, the government plainly has been the author of its own misfortune. A simple measuring tape dropped from the third-floor landing would have closed the gap and resolved all doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> If that measurement would have favored the government, it is hard to imagine why the government did not undertake it. In all events, the insufficiency of the evidence on this point undermines the appellant's convictions on counts 2 and 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The government introduced sufficient evidence on the conspiracy charge, and the district court correctly refused to instruct the jury that section 841(b)(1)(C) contains a requirement of reasonable foreseeability. Thus, we affirm the appellant's convictions on counts 1, 3, and 5, and leave intact the sentences on those counts. The government, however, failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any drug transaction occurred within 1,000 feet of a school. Hence, we reverse the appellant's convictions on counts 2 and 4, and vacate the sentences imposed on those counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For ease in reference, we reprint pertinent portions of these statutes in an appendix hereto.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant confessed at one point that he had been selling Me Salve heroin but that his supply of Me Salve had been exhausted on July 22, at which point he switched to Blunt.

All that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Mr. Thompson used the heroin the defendant distributed, and that but for Mr. Thompson's use of the defendant's heroin, Mr. Thompson would not have died.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This case is distinguishable from United States v. Smith, 13 F.3d 380 (10th Cir. 1993), much bruited by the appellant. There, the court found testimony that a park contained a playground insufficient for purposes of section 860. The statute, however, contains a specific definition of what constitutes a playground, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(e) (stating that a playground must have \"three or more separate [recreational] apparatus\"), and the police officer who testified in Smith did not speak to this aspect of the definition, see 13 F.3d at 382. Section 860 contains no such qualifying language for what constitutes a school.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> One reason for this intuition is that the government's 963-foot measurement likely overstates the distance from the school to the corner of the apartment building. That measurement started at the school building itself, rather than at the \"real property comprising [the] school.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a). The government has made no such argument, however, and it has provided no basis for calculating the distance from the school building to the lot line. We therefore do not probe the point. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that arguments not properly developed on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> A direct vertical measurement, rather than one following the winding staircase, would have been appropriate, as the schoolyard statute envisions straight-line rather than pedestrian-route measurements.

Hon. Michael A.

Newhouse, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom James B. Farmer, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Rosenn<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents a series of questions, some of novel impression in this circuit, concerning various federal drug-trafficking laws. Those questions touch upon the quantum of evidence necessary to establish the existence of a drug-trafficking conspiracy; the necessity (if any) for a showing of reasonable foreseeability in a prosecution for selling heroin, death resulting; and the type and kind of proof that the government must adduce to convict a defendant of selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. We resolve most of these questions favorably to the government, but we resolve the last question favorably to the defendant (finding that the government did not present evidence from which a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that heroin sales occurred within 1,000 feet of a school). Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We limn the facts in the light most favorable to the government, consistent with record support. United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1277 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of July 21, 1999, five men -- Thomas Dudek, Christopher Stevenson, Edward Thompson, Matthew Lawrence, and Granger Fulton -- gathered at Stevenson's apartment in Sunderland, Massachusetts. The men drank heavily, and Lawrence and Fulton eventually passed out. Despite having consumed between ten and twenty beers apiece, the other three drove to Holyoke in search of cocaine. Dudek, apparently the most drug-savvy of the three, directed Thompson to drive to 67 Newton St. Thompson remained in the car while his confreres climbed an exterior staircase at the back of the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dudek previously had purchased cocaine on the second floor, but this time he and Stevenson ascended to the third-floor landing where a makeshift door, constructed of plywood and chicken wire, blocked further access. Defendant-appellant Anibal Soler met them at that point. When asked what they wanted, Stevenson replied, \"$200 worth.\" The appellant retreated inside and emerged with twenty plastic bags labeled \"Me Salve.\" He handed them to Dudek in exchange for cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As matters turned out, the bags contained heroin, not cocaine. Dudek apparently recognized that fact, but said nothing to the others. Stevenson began to snort some of the heroin inside the car. The men drove to Thompson's apartment in Chicopee, where all three proceeded to snort heroin until they collapsed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson's girlfriend appeared on the scene hours later and tried to revive him. Failing in this effort, she called for help. Dudek awoke before the paramedics arrived, but his two friends remained comatose. The paramedics rushed all three men to the hospital and, soon thereafter, Thompson was pronounced dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities immediately undertook an investigation and enlisted Dudek's cooperation (Stevenson did not awake from his coma until seven days later). Upon learning the source of the heroin, they decided to dispatch an undercover state trooper, Juan Colon, to 67 Newton St. On the following day (July 22), Colon, posing as a customer, climbed the exterior stairs to the third-floor landing. When he called into the apartment, a pregnant female emerged and asked what he wanted. Colon responded, \"two bags.\" The woman left the doorway momentarily (as the appellant had done when Dudek appeared) and returned with two bags of heroin, one stamped \"e Salve\" (an obvious error in which the \"M\" in \"Me Salve\" presumably missed the bag's surface during the stamping process) and the other \"Blunt.\" Colon handed her a $20 bill and departed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Colon revisited the third-floor landing. This time, the appellant responded and sold him two bags of heroin, both labeled \"Blunt.\" Once again, Colon paid for the drugs with a $20 bill. The authorities then executed a search warrant for the third-floor apartment. Both the appellant and the pregnant woman were there when the police arrived -- and both attempted to flee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search of the premises yielded, among other things, thirty bags of heroin (all labeled \"Blunt\") and over $5,000 in United States currency. Stashed with the heroin was $1,010 in cash, including the two $20 bills that Colon had used to pay for his purchases from the pregnant woman and the appellant, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury handed up a five-count indictment. The indictment charged the appellant with distribution of heroin, death resulting, on July 21, 1999, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C) (count 1); possession of heroin with intent to distribute on July 22, 1999, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (count 3); possession of heroin with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school on each of those two dates, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a) (counts 2 and 4); and conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846 (count 5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following a ten-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty on all five counts. On December 5, 2000, the district court imposed concurrent sentences of life imprisonment on counts 1, 2, and 5, thirty years on count 3, and sixty years on count 4. The court sentences were enhanced because the government, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851, appropriately brought to the court's attention the appellant's previous convictions for unrelated drug-trafficking felonies. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE CONSPIRACY CHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the appellant's conviction on the conspiracy count and to his contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove that charge. The appellant raised the same point in a timely motion for judgment of acquittal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. The district court denied the motion, finding the evidence adequate. We review the district court's denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo, applying the same standard as the lower court. This means that we must uphold the verdict unless the evidence, viewed in the light most hospitable to the government's theory of the case, could not have persuaded a rational trier of fact, beyond any reasonable doubt, of the defendant's guilt. United States v. Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir. 1999). In other words, the verdict can stand if -- and only if -- the evidence, viewed in the requisite light, suffices to establish each element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the existence of a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, \"the government must present clear evidence sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement to commit the substantive offense actually existed, and that the individual defendant knew of the agreement, had intent to agree, and had intent to commit the substantive offense.\" United States v. Lopez-Pena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547459\"><a href=\"/opinion/547459/united-states-v-esnoel-lopez-pena-united-states-of-america-v-hector/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1536</span></a></span>, 1537 (1st Cir. 1989). When direct evidence of any one or more of these elements is lacking, that element may be proven by circumstantial evidence. United States v. Barnes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199335\"><a href=\"/opinion/199335/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 175 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the appellant claims that there is no significantly probative evidence to show that he and the pregnant woman (who was taken into custody, but who was neither charged in this indictment nor called as a witness at the trial) were acting in concert. Although the appellant concedes that the jury could have found that each of them was selling drugs from the identical locus, he asserts that their mere presence in the same apartment is not enough to establish the existence of a conspiracy. See United States v. Ocampo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583580\"><a href=\"/opinion/583580/united-states-v-anna-marie-ocampo/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 82-83 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that mere presence of two defendants in the same apartment is insufficient to prove that both knowingly participated in drug trafficking within that apartment). Relatedly, he asserts that a conspiracy, by definition, requires more than one member, and that the woman's participation in a single heroin sale does not establish her status as a coconspirator. See United States v. Izzi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373883\"><a href=\"/opinion/373883/united-states-v-eugene-j-izzi-aka-gino-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span>, 1210 (1st Cir. 1980) (finding participation in a single drug sale, without more, to be inadequate to sustain a conspiracy conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is cleverly constructed, but it understates the force of the government's proof. Here, unlike in Ocampo, the evidence showed that both occupants of the apartment were actively engaged in the sale of drugs. Thus, the jury could have found that the pregnant woman was not merely present, but culpably present. Cf. United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 712 (1st Cir. 1992) (distinguishing between \"mere presence\" and \"culpable presence\"). And here, unlike in Izzi, the proof did not show only a single drug sale, but, rather, three sales over a two-day period -- with an inventory of heroin suggesting a readiness to engage in future transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even apart from these distinctions, the government's evidence is significantly more elaborate than the appellant suggests. The two alleged coconspirators were operating out of the same \"store\" and selling identically marked bags from the same inventory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Both of them were in the apartment at the time of the police raid -- and both attempted to flee. Finally, and perhaps most damagingly, the $20 bills tendered to the pregnant woman and to the appellant, respectively, were found commingled in a pile of cash stored with the drugs. We think that this evidence constitutes substantial proof that the two were engaged in a common enterprise, the proceeds of which were pooled. See generally United States v. LiCausi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198296\"><a href=\"/opinion/198296/united-states-v-licausi/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"In reviewing a jury's finding that a single conspiracy existed, we consider specifically such factors as the commonality vel non of the nature, motive, design, implementation, and logistics of the illegal activities as well as the scope of coconspirator involvement.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant interposes a final objection, noting that there was no evidence of the pregnant woman's participation in the venture on the first day of the alleged two-day conspiracy. This objection is wide of the mark. There is no requirement that each coconspirator participate in every act of the conspiracy. Cf. United States v. David, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that one who joins a conspiracy may be held \"accountable for the earlier acts of his coconspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\"). Here, the government adduced competent proof that the object of the conspiracy -- heroin distribution -- took place over a two-day period. We think that a rational jury easily could conclude -- as this jury did -- that these activities came within the scope of a tacit agreement between the two coconspirators. Consequently, we affirm the appellant's conviction on count 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE \"DEATH RESULTING\" CHARGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In count 1 of the indictment, the grand jury charged a violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). Under that statute, a drug trafficker faces an enhanced sentence \"if death or serious bodily injury results from the use [of the drugs purveyed].\" The appellant argues that the statute is inapposite because the key event leading to the death -- Thompson's snorting of heroin under the misimpression that it was cocaine -- was not reasonably foreseeable (and, thus, the death itself was not reasonably foreseeable). This brings us to the preliminary question of whether the operation of section 841(b)(1)(C) depends to any extent upon proof that death was reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a question of first impression in this circuit. The district court answered it in the negative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because this is a purely legal issue, we review the correctness of the district court's disposition de novo. United States v. Pitrone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197373\"><a href=\"/opinion/197373/united-states-v-pitrone/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the statute of conviction applies whenever \"death . . . results\" from the use of drugs supplied by the defendant. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The fact that the statute does not speak to the defendant's state of mind undercuts the appellant's argument that we should impose some kind of foreseeability test. After all, Congress knows how to write statutes containing state-of-mind requirements -- and Congress demonstrated that facility in crafting this very statute. E.g., id. &#167; 841(a) (prohibiting knowing and intentional drug trafficking). This makes the omission of an explicit intent requirement in section 841(b)(1)(C) telling. See Duncan v. Walker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2120</span></a></span>, 2125 (2001) (\"'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\") (quoting Russello v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23 (1983)); In re 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199568\"><a href=\"/opinion/199568/229-main-street-v-massachusetts-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law tracks in the same direction. Although the appellant cites several cases that he claims impose a reasonable foreseeability requirement, those cases all involve liability of one coconspirator for the acts of others. E.g., United States v. Swiney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767605\"><a href=\"/opinion/767605/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant98-50195343/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 339 (6th Cir. 2000); United States v. Chisholm, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710332\"><a href=\"/opinion/710332/united-states-v-elwyn-jerome-chisholm-aka-gary-and-clarence-aaron/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 208 (11th Cir. 1996); United States v. DePriest, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654616\"><a href=\"/opinion/654616/united-states-v-kevin-o-depriest-and-steve-morrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span>, 1212-13 (7th Cir. 1993). When the defendant's own conduct has caused the harm, those cases are inapposite. Rather, a rule of strict liability applies. See United States v. McIntosh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771659\"><a href=\"/opinion/771659/united-states-v-steven-curtis-mcintosh/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span>, 972 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding, in the context of subsection 841(b)(1)(A), that \"giving effect to [the statute's] plain meaning prohibits us from superimposing upon the statute a foreseeability or proximate cause requirement\"); United States v. Patterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680720\"><a href=\"/opinion/680720/united-states-v-marvin-joe-patterson-united-states-of-america-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 145 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that section 841(b)(1)(C) does not require a finding that death resulting from the use of a distributed drug was reasonably foreseeable). Thus, when a defendant deals drugs and a user of those drugs dies as a result, section 841(b)(1)(C) applies without any independent proof that the death was a reasonably foreseeable event. Because the lower court correctly apprehended this point, we affirm the appellant's conviction on count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE \"SCHOOLYARD\" COUNTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a), colloquially called \"the schoolyard statute,\" provides enhanced penalties, inter alia, for the sale of drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. The jury convicted the appellant of violating this statute on both July 21 (count 2) and July 22 (count 4). The appellant mounts a two-pronged challenge to these convictions. We consider each prong separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The School.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The schoolyard statute focuses on the sale of drugs within 1,000 feet of any \"real property comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school . . . .\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a). The appellant questions whether the government presented sufficient evidence that such a facility existed in the vicinity of 67 Newton St. We think that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government's proof is grudgingly bare. The only testimony on the point came from a Holyoke police officer, William Lempke, who identified a nearby structure as \"Lawrence Elementary School\" and stated that it was \"a public school in Holyoke.\" The appellant insists that Lempke was not a competent witness on the point -- but he did not object to the testimony when it was adduced and has waived any right to challenge the witness's competence on appeal. United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967,972 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing operation of the raise-or-waive rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, even if Lempke was a competent witness, it is arguable that his testimony, standing alone, was insufficient to prove the existence of a school beyond a reasonable doubt. On this point, the appellant strikes a responsive chord when he posits that the introduction of a map, the testimony of a city planner, or evidence from a school official would have been a vastly preferable means of establishing that fact. The issue, however, is not whether the government proved this element of the offense in the best or most effective way, but, rather, whether the proof adduced was legally adequate. After all, sufficiency of evidence is a context-specific concern, and it must be determined by whether a rational juror could have found the essential fact beyond a reasonable doubt. See Lara, 181 F.3d at 200.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the witness had been a member of the local police force for fifteen years. He testified that he was intimately familiar with the neighborhood and that he worked out of a police station located within a block of 67 Newton St. (and, thus, quite close to the structure that he identified as a school). Taking these facts into account and giving the government the benefit of the inferences therefrom, see Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1277, we conclude that the officer's testimony was enough -- if barely -- to prove the existence of a school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Measurement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the appellant's argument is more finely honed. He faults the government for not presenting adequate evidence that a drug transaction took place within the proscribed area -- the 1,000-foot distance specified in section 860(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not spoken to how distance ought to be measured in cases brought under the schoolyard statute. We do so today. In order to convict under section 860(a), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the distance from a school to the actual site of the transaction, not merely to the curtilage or exterior wall of the structure in which the transaction takes place, is 1,000 feet or less. See United States v. Harrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732417\"><a href=\"/opinion/732417/united-states-v-george-harrison-aka-gregory-peck-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span>, 990 (D.C. Cir. 1997); United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688684\"><a href=\"/opinion/688684/united-states-v-michael-joseph-johnson-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span>, 1169-70 (D.C. Cir. 1995). To achieve this benchmark here, the government again relies upon officer Lempke's testimony. Lempke stated that he used a measuring wheel as he walked from the rear entrance of 67 Newton St. to the corner of the school building. He calculated that distance to be 963 feet. But this left an obvious gap -- the distance between the base of the Newton St. building and the third-floor landing on which the heroin was sold -- and the government offered no direct evidence as to that distance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to fill this void, the government asseverates that a reasonable jury could have determined the unmeasured distance based on a videotape made during an unrelated drug raid earlier that month. This asseveration rings hollow. Precise measurements may be unnecessary in some cases where the spatial leeway is relatively great and the gap in the chain of proof is relatively small. E.g., United States v. Glover, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span>, 756 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (holding 326-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from front door of convenience store to the store's basement); Harrison, 103 F.3d at 990 (holding 528-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from the exterior of an apartment building to defendant's unit); United States v. Baylor, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span>, 546 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (holding 466-foot leeway sufficient to cover measurement gap from the exterior of an apartment building to defendant's basement apartment). In such extreme instances, common sense, common knowledge, and rough indices of distance can carry the day. When the spatial leeway is modest, however, and personal liberty is at stake, courts must examine the government's proof with a more critical eye.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Applewhite, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span> (D.C. Cir. 1995), illustrates the point. There, the court of appeals reversed a conviction on the ground that there was no evidence from which a jury could conclude that the defendant's kitchen, where drugs were found, was within the relatively small leeway (under eighty feet) left open by a measurement of the distance between the school and the entrance to the apartment building in which the defendant resided. Id. at 143-44. So too Johnson, in which the court reversed a conviction where the only evidence of distance was a measurement of 994 feet up to the walkway of the defendant's house. 46 F.3d at 1169-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is one in which the spatial leeway is exceedingly modest: the gap here is thirty-seven feet. We have viewed the videotape mentioned by the government and find unconvincing the assertion that the jury could have determined from it beyond a reasonable doubt that the vertical distance was less than thirty-seven feet. Although the videotape was played several times for the jury, it was neither filmed with an eye toward elucidating relative distances nor introduced into evidence for that purpose. Moreover, it showed the relevant portion of the building fleetingly and as an incidental matter; the camera angles were distorted by the repeated use of a zoom lens; and the prosecutor did not even attempt to draw the jury's attention to the scale involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. Distances are notoriously difficult to gauge in still photographs, see Baylor, 97 F.3d at 546 (\"Spatial relationships are hardly intuitive, and photographs can distort distances.\"), and more so in motion pictures (such as videotapes). This case is no exception. We conclude that the videotape is some tangential evidence of the unmeasured distance, but it is not sufficient evidence to establish that measurement beyond a reasonable doubt. The spatial leeway is too small and the risk of error too great. Although it is possible (indeed, probable) that the distance from the school to the site of the heroin sales was less than 1,000 feet,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that is not good enough. The government must prove the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt -- and its proof here simply does not conform to that high standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are constrained to add that, in this instance, the government plainly has been the author of its own misfortune. A simple measuring tape dropped from the third-floor landing would have closed the gap and resolved all doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> If that measurement would have favored the government, it is hard to imagine why the government did not undertake it. In all events, the insufficiency of the evidence on this point undermines the appellant's convictions on counts 2 and 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The government introduced sufficient evidence on the conspiracy charge, and the district court correctly refused to instruct the jury that section 841(b)(1)(C) contains a requirement of reasonable foreseeability. Thus, we affirm the appellant's convictions on counts 1, 3, and 5, and leave intact the sentences on those counts. The government, however, failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any drug transaction occurred within 1,000 feet of a school. Hence, we reverse the appellant's convictions on counts 2 and 4, and vacate the sentences imposed on those counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For ease in reference, we reprint pertinent portions of these statutes in an appendix hereto.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant confessed at one point that he had been selling Me Salve heroin but that his supply of Me Salve had been exhausted on July 22, at which point he switched to Blunt.

All that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Mr. Thompson used the heroin the defendant distributed, and that but for Mr. Thompson's use of the defendant's heroin, Mr. Thompson would not have died.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This case is distinguishable from United States v.

There, the court found testimony that a park contained a playground insufficient for purposes of section 860. The statute, however, contains a specific definition of what constitutes a playground, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(e) (stating that a playground must have \"three or more separate [recreational] apparatus\"), and the police officer who testified in Smith did not speak to this aspect of the definition, see 13 F.3d at 382. Section 860 contains no such qualifying language for what constitutes a school.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> One reason for this intuition is that the government's 963-foot measurement likely overstates the distance from the school to the corner of the apartment building. That measurement started at the school building itself, rather than at the \"real property comprising [the] school.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a). The government has made no such argument, however, and it has provided no basis for calculating the distance from the school building to the lot line. We therefore do not probe the point. See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that arguments not properly developed on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> A direct vertical measurement, rather than one following the winding staircase, would have been appropriate, as the schoolyard statute envisions straight-line rather than pedestrian-route measurements.
