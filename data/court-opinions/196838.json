Defendant Yves Lerebours was\r                    CUMMINGS, Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nconvicted  for various  drug-related offenses.   He  raises three\r\n\nissues  in this  appeal:   whether  the  district court  properly\r\n\nrefused  to dismiss based upon a Commerce Clause challenge to the\r\n\ncriminal statute; whether the  district court properly refused to\r\n\nenter  a judgment  of  acquittal for  insufficient evidence;  and\r\n\nwhether  the  defendant's  sentence  was  appropriate  under  the\r\n\nSentencing   Guidelines.     We  affirm   the  district   court's\r\n\nconclusions.\r\n\n          In 1994  and 1995 the police  department of Manchester,\r\n\nNew Hampshire, investigated  the sale of crack  cocaine and other\r\n\nnarcotics in that city.  During September 1994 the police focused\r\n\non drug activities at  309 Cedar Street in  Manchester.  In  that\r\n\nmonth a police  department detective  knocked at the  door of  an\r\n\napartment on the third  floor of that address.   A woman directed\r\n\nhim to the  driveway at the  rear of 315  Cedar Street.  At  that\r\n\nplace he  spoke to a  Hispanic male whom  he later  identified as\r\n\ndefendant  and said \"I want  three.\"  Defendant  then entered the\r\n\nrear door and  several minutes later  handed three small  plastic\r\n\nbaggies to a juvenile  who asked the detective to  accompany him.\r\n\nThe detective purchased  three baggies from the boy for $60.  The\r\n\ncontents consisted of .39 grams of crack cocaine.\r\n\n          On  September 19  the  same detective  returned to  309\r\n\nCedar  Street.  Defendant was  inside an apartment  there and the\r\n\ndetective again asked for \"three.\"   The defendant instructed him\r\n\nto  wait downstairs in the alley where the detective bought three\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nbaggies  from defendant for $60.  The contents again consisted of\r\n\n.39  grams of crack cocaine.   Defendant told  the detective that\r\n\nthe next time  he came for \"crack,\" he should  go to the driveway\r\n\nin back of  315 Cedar Street,  ask for Tony,  and say that  Oshee\r\n\nsent him.  Defendant later testified that his nickname was Yoshi.\r\n\nIn  January 1995  the same  detective identified a  photograph of\r\n\ndefendant  as  the individual  selling him  crack cocaine  in the\r\n\nprior  September.   He also  identified defendant  in court.   He\r\n\ntestified that he was trained to remember faces of suspects.\r\n\n          In  March  1995  another  detective of  the  Manchester\r\n\npolice  department  was investigating  drug  sales  at 249  Cedar\r\n\nStreet in Manchester.   On March 7 this detective  purchased five\r\n\nrocks of crack cocaine  for $100 from Henry Favreau at 290 Auburn\r\n\nStreet.   On the  following day  Favreau took  him to  290 Auburn\r\n\nStreet where the detective  was told \"they were in  there cutting\r\n\nit up,\" and the detective then made a second purchase.   On March\r\n\n14 he made his third  purchase of five rocks from Favreau  at 290\r\n\nAuburn Street.\r\n\n          On March 15, after  obtaining a search warrant, several\r\n\npolice officers  executed a search at 290  Auburn Street.  One of\r\n\nthe  detectives sketched the apartment for  his police report and\r\n\nidentified the rooms searched as including a kitchen, a northwest\r\n\nbedroom  and  a  northeast  bedroom.    A  brown  vinyl  box  was\r\n\ndiscovered above  the ceiling tiles in the kitchen that contained\r\n\nbaggies, tissue, a cup,  a 13-inch-long Ginsu knife,  a six-inch-\r\n\nlong  test tube, and scissors.  The knife, scissors and test tube\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncontained  cocaine residue.    One of  the detectives  identified\r\n\ndefendant as being present at 290 Auburn Street when the officers\r\n\narrived to execute the search warrant.\r\n\n          Still  another  detective,  accompanied  by  his  drug-\r\n\ndetection  dog, searched the northwest bedroom.  The dog began to\r\n\nbite and  scratch on one of  the two mattresses.   On lifting the\r\n\nmattress, the detective observed a number  of rocks consisting of\r\n\n1.88 grams  of  crack  cocaine.    During  the  search  defendant\r\n\ninformed a police sergeant that  the northwest bedroom was shared\r\n\nby him and his girlfriend.\r\n\n          In  April  1995  defendant  was  indicted for  offenses\r\n\ninvolving  cocaine and cocaine base.   The indictment  was in six\r\n\ncounts.   The first count charged a conspiracy to distribute such\r\n\ndrugs  in 1994 and 1995 in violation  of 21 U.S.C.   846.  Counts\r\n\ntwo and  four charged their  distribution in September  1994, and\r\n\ncounts  three, five and six  charged possession of  such drugs in\r\n\nSeptember 1994 and March  1995.  Finally, counts two  through six\r\n\nalleged  violations of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) providing that it is\r\n\nunlawful  \"to manufacture,  distribute,  or dispense,  or possess\r\n\nwith intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled\r\n\nsubstance.\"    Counts  three  and  five  were  dismissed  by  the\r\n\ngovernment.\r\n\n          After  the  government  presented  its  case, defendant\r\n\nsought  acquittal  on  all counts  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule of\r\n\nCriminal Procedure 29.  He also asked that  the case be dismissed\r\n\nbased upon  United States v. L pez,     U.S.   , 115  S. Ct. 1624\r                                            \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n(1995).   The district judge commented that he would be surprised\r\n\n\"if the federal drug  laws could ever be brought within the scope\r\n\nof those  category of laws  that cannot withstand  scrutiny under\r\n\nthe commerce clause test.\"  Before denying dismissal, he added:\r\n\n            Cocaine trafficking is a  huge interstate\r\n            economic enterprise.  Congress could well\r\n            decide  to  regulate  that enterprise  by\r\n            prohibiting  the distribution  of cocaine\r\n            or  the possession of cocaine with intent\r\n            to  distribute.    The crime  necessarily\r\n            implicates    interstate   and    foreign\r\n            commerce   since    cocaine   cannot   be\r\n            manufactured and sold  solely within  any\r\n            one  state's  boundaries.    So  for that\r\n            reason  I'm  going  to  deny  your  L pez\r                                                               \r\n            motion.\r\n\n          Elizabeth Rivera, defendant's  fianc e, and her  mother\r\n\nMargarita then offered alibi  testimony, obviously disbelieved by\r\n\nthe jury, concerning events  on September 16, 1994, and  in March\r\n\n1995.   Defendant again moved for acquittal  under Rule 29 of the\r\n\nFederal  Rules  of Criminal  Procedure  and  for dismissal  under\r\n\nUnited States v. L pez, but both motions  were denied.  After the\r                                \r\n\nthree-day jury trial defendant was found guilty on counts one and\r\n\nfour and not guilty on counts two and six.\r\n\n          Both  sides  filed  sentencing  memoranda.    Defendant\r\n\nrequested that he be  held accountable for only the  .39 grams of\r\n\ncocaine base  that was the subject  of count four.   Since he was\r\n\nacquitted under counts two and six, he argued that  he should not\r\n\nbe held accountable  for the drugs  distributed on September  16,\r\n\n1994,  and March  15, 1995.   In  turn, the  government requested\r\n\naccountability for a total drug quantity of 4.15 grams of cocaine\r\n\nbase.     Based  upon   that  amount,  the   revised  presentence\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ninvestigation report  computed a  base  offense level  of 24  for\r\n\ndefendant.\r\n\n          The district judge  decided that the following  amounts\r\n\nwere attributable to defendant:  .37 grams on September 16, 1994;\r\n\n.39 grams  on September  19, 1994;  and 1.88  grams on  March 15,\r\n\n1995, or a total of 2.64  grams.  The judge explained his rulings\r\n\nas follows:\r\n\n            . . . just because the jury found him not\r\n            guilty,  [sic]  that March  event doesn't\r\n            mean that  I have  to find that  he [sic]\r\n            hasn't established by a  preponderance of\r\n            the  evidence that  that cocaine  is his.\r\n            . . .\r\n\n            I have no difficulty  in finding that the\r\n            .37 [sic] grams on 9/16, the .39 grams on\r\n            9/19   that  was   the  subject   of  the\r\n            conviction, and the .188 [sic] grams that\r\n            was the subject of the acquittal in March\r\n            are all part of the same conspiracy; that\r\n            the   defendant   did   engage   in   the\r\n            transactions on  9/16 and 9/19,  and that\r\n            the   crack   cocaine  found   under  the\r\n            defendant's bed was  his cocaine and  was\r\n            possessed  by  him  with  the  intent  to\r\n            distribute as part of the same conspiracy\r\n            that led to the conspiracy conviction and\r\n            the conviction for the 9/19 sale.\r\n\n            With respect to  the 9/16 transaction,  I\r\n            found  the  officer's  testimony   to  be\r\n            persuasive   and    convincing,   and   I\r\n            personally  have no  doubt about  in fact\r\n            that that was the defendant who made that\r\n            sale.\r\n\n            And with respect to the 1.88 grams  found\r\n            on  March 15,  I  have  no difficulty  in\r\n            finding   by   a  preponderance   of  the\r\n            evidence    that    that    cocaine    is\r\n            attributable to the defendant and that it\r\n            is related to the count of conviction.  I\r\n            just  find   completely  implausible  the\r\n            speculation that someone  else, like  Mr.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            Luna, would  come in and put  the cocaine\r\n            where it was found.\r\n\n            So for  those reasons I am  going to find\r\n            attributable to the  defendant .37  grams\r\n            on  9/16,  .39  grams on  9/19,  and 1.88\r\n            grams on 3/15.\r\n\nDefendant  was sentenced  to  57 months'  imprisonment and  three\r\n\nyears of supervised release.\r\n\n     Denial of Motion to Dismiss Under United States v.

Likewise, count one  related to the  events of March\r\n\n15, 1995.  There was adequate evidence to support the convictions\r\n\non counts  one and four.  Thus the district court properly denied\r\n\ndefendant's Rule 29 motions.\r\n\n                            Sentencing\r                                      Sentencing\r\n\n          It  is  immaterial that  defendant  was  assessed crack\r\n\nquantities  underlying  counts two  and  six,  for which  he  was\r\n\nacquitted, because they were included in conspiracy count one, on\r\n\nwhich he was convicted.

He raises three issues in this appeal:  whether the district court properly refused to dismiss based upon a Commerce Clause challenge to the criminal statute;  whether the district court properly refused to enter a judgment of acquittal for insufficient evidence;  and whether the defendant's sentence was appropriate under the Sentencing Guidelines.  We affirm the district court's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994 and 1995 the police department of Manchester, New Hampshire, investigated the sale of crack cocaine and other narcotics in that city.  During September 1994 the police focused on drug activities at 309 Cedar Street in Manchester.  In that month a police department detective knocked at the door of an apartment on the third floor of that address.  A woman directed him to the driveway at the rear of 315 Cedar Street.  At that place he spoke to a Hispanic male whom he later identified as defendant and said \"I want three.\"   Defendant then entered the rear door and several minutes later handed three small plastic baggies to a juvenile who asked the detective to accompany him.  The detective purchased three baggies from the boy for $60.  The contents consisted of .39 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 19 the same detective returned to 309 Cedar Street.  Defendant was inside an apartment there and the detective again asked for \"three.\"   The defendant instructed him to wait downstairs in the alley where the detective bought three baggies from defendant for $60.  The contents again consisted of .39 grams of crack cocaine.  Defendant told the detective that the next time he came for \"crack,\" he should go to the driveway in back of 315 Cedar Street, ask for Tony, and say that Oshee sent him.  Defendant later testified that his nickname was Yoshi.  In January 1995 the same detective identified a photograph of defendant as the individual selling him crack cocaine in the prior September.  He also identified defendant in court.  He testified that he was trained to remember faces of suspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1995 another detective of the Manchester police department was investigating drug sales at 249 Cedar Street in Manchester.  On March 7 this detective purchased five rocks of crack cocaine for $100 from Henry Favreau at 290 Auburn Street.  On the following day Favreau took him to 290 Auburn Street where the detective was told \"they were in there cutting it up,\" and the detective then made a second purchase.  On March 14 he made his third purchase of five rocks from Favreau at 290 Auburn Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, after obtaining a search warrant, several police officers executed a search at 290 Auburn Street.  One of the detectives sketched the apartment for his police report and identified the rooms searched as including a kitchen, a northwest bedroom and a northeast bedroom.  A brown vinyl box was discovered above the ceiling tiles in the kitchen that contained baggies, tissue, a cup, a 13-inch-long Ginsu knife, a six-inch-long test tube, and scissors.  The knife, scissors and test tube contained cocaine residue.  One of the detectives identified defendant as being present at 290 Auburn Street when the officers arrived to execute the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still another detective, accompanied by his drug-detection dog, searched the northwest bedroom.  The dog began to bite and scratch on one of the two mattresses.  On lifting the mattress, the detective observed a number of rocks consisting of 1.88 grams of crack cocaine.  During the search defendant informed a police sergeant that the northwest bedroom was shared by him and his girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1995 defendant was indicted for offenses involving cocaine and cocaine base.  The indictment was in six counts.  The first count charged a conspiracy to distribute such drugs in 1994 and 1995 in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  Counts two and four charged their distribution in September 1994, and counts three, five and six charged possession of such drugs in September 1994 and March 1995.  Finally, counts two through six alleged violations of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) providing that it is unlawful \"to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\"   Counts three and five were dismissed by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government presented its case, defendant sought acquittal on all counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.  He also asked that the case be dismissed based upon United States v. Lopez, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995).  The district judge commented that he would be surprised \"if the federal drug laws could ever be brought within the scope of those category of laws that cannot withstand scrutiny under the commerce clause test.\"   Before denying dismissal, he added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Cocaine trafficking is a huge interstate economic enterprise.  Congress could well decide to regulate that enterprise by prohibiting the distribution of cocaine or the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  The crime necessarily implicates interstate and foreign commerce since cocaine cannot be manufactured and sold solely within any one state's boundaries.  So for that reason I'm going to deny your Lopez motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elizabeth Rivera, defendant's fiancee, and her mother Margarita then offered alibi testimony, obviously disbelieved by the jury, concerning events on September 16, 1994, and in March 1995.  Defendant again moved for acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and for dismissal under United States v. Lopez, but both motions were denied.  After the three-day jury trial defendant was found guilty on counts one and four and not guilty on counts two and six.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides filed sentencing memoranda.  Defendant requested that he be held accountable for only the .39 grams of cocaine base that was the subject of count four.  Since he was acquitted under counts two and six, he argued that he should not be held accountable for the drugs distributed on September 16, 1994, and March 15, 1995.  In turn, the government requested accountability for a total drug quantity of 4.15 grams of cocaine base.  Based upon that amount, the revised presentence investigation report computed a base offense level of 24 for defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge decided that the following amounts were attributable to defendant:  .37 grams on September 16, 1994;  .  39 grams on September 19, 1994;  and 1.88 grams on March 15, 1995, or a total of 2.64 grams.  The judge explained his rulings as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>... just because the jury found him not guilty, [sic] that March event doesn't mean that I have to find that he [sic] hasn't established by a preponderance of the evidence that that cocaine is his....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I have no difficulty in finding that the .37[sic] grams on 9/16, the .39 grams on 9/19 that was the subject of the conviction, and the .188[sic] grams that was the subject of the acquittal in March are all part of the same conspiracy;  that the defendant did engage in the transactions on 9/16 and 9/19, and that the crack cocaine found under the defendant's bed was his cocaine and was possessed by him with the intent to distribute as part of the same conspiracy that led to the conspiracy conviction and the conviction for the 9/19 sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>With respect to the 9/16 transaction, I found the officer's testimony to be persuasive and convincing, and I personally have no doubt about in fact that that was the defendant who made that sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>And with respect to the 1.88 grams found on March 15, I have no difficulty in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that that cocaine is attributable to the defendant and that it is related to the count of conviction.  I just find completely implausible the speculation that someone else, like Mr. Luna, would come in and put the cocaine where it was found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>So for those reasons I am going to find attributable to the defendant .37 grams on 9/16, .39 grams on 9/19, and 1.88 grams on 3/15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Denial of Motion to Dismiss Under United States v. Lopez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Seventh Circuit explained in United States v. Bell, 70 F.3d 495, 497 (7th Cir.1995), Lopez challenges to various statutes have almost invariably failed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  More importantly, three courts of appeals have already rejected Lopez constitutional attacks on the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 801 et seq.   Thus in United States v. Leshuk, 65 F.3d 1105 (4th Cir.1995), the court noted that Lopez reaffirmed the principle that \"where a general regulatory statute [like the one here] bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.\"  Id. at 1112.   In United States v. Brown, 72 F.3d 96 (8th Cir.1995), in upholding a conviction for use of a firearm during a drug-trafficking offense, the court relied on Leshuk for rejecting a Lopez Commerce Clause challenge and noted that the statute involved here had been found constitutional.  Id. at 97.   Accord United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453, 1475 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant argues that this case amounts to an abridgment of the reservation of police powers to the states under the Tenth Amendment.  Such an argument was rejected in United States v. Owens, 996 F.2d 59, 60-61 (5th Cir.1993), because courts will not strike down a statute under the Tenth Amendment where Congress was within its powers under the Commerce Clause to enact the statute.  As we have already acknowledged, Congress had authority under the Commerce Clause to criminalize the conduct under the statutes involved here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant contends that he should have been acquitted on counts one and four because of insufficient evidence, stating that the affidavit for the search warrant for 290 Auburn Street on March 15, 1995, did not mention him and because the detective's identification of defendant as the person from whom he purchased crack cocaine on September 19, 1994, was uncorroborated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to count one, it is immaterial that the affidavit for the March 15, 1995 search at 290 Auburn Street did not mention defendant because detective Boles identified him as being present when the officers arrived to execute the search warrant and defendant informed one of the police officers that he shared the northwest bedroom in that apartment where a number of rocks of crack cocaine were found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count four, covering the distribution of cocaine on September 19, was supported by a detective's testimony that he requested three rocks of cocaine and purchased them from defendant on September 19, 1994, in the alley outside defendant's apartment.  Likewise, count one related to the events of March 15, 1995.  There was adequate evidence to support the convictions on counts one and four.  Thus the district court properly denied defendant's Rule 29 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is immaterial that defendant was assessed crack quantities underlying counts two and six, for which he was acquitted, because they were included in conspiracy count one, on which he was convicted.  We so ruled in United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 222-24 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1322, 131 L.Ed.2d 202 (1995), and United States v.

As the district judge found, the drugs involved in the September 16, 1994, and March 15, 1995, incidents were parts of the scheme underlying the conspiracy count.  The judge also found all the cocaine was part of the same conspiracy charged in count one, so that it was proper for him to aggregate them to determine the base offense level.

One of the detectives sketched the apartment for his police report and identified the rooms searched as including a kitchen, a northwest bedroom and a northeast bedroom.  A brown vinyl box was discovered above the ceiling tiles in the kitchen that contained baggies, tissue, a cup, a 13-inch-long Ginsu knife, a six-inch-long test tube, and scissors.  The knife, scissors and test tube contained cocaine residue.  One of the detectives identified defendant as being present at 290 Auburn Street when the officers arrived to execute the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still another detective, accompanied by his drug-detection dog, searched the northwest bedroom.  The dog began to bite and scratch on one of the two mattresses.  On lifting the mattress, the detective observed a number of rocks consisting of 1.88 grams of crack cocaine.  During the search defendant informed a police sergeant that the northwest bedroom was shared by him and his girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1995 defendant was indicted for offenses involving cocaine and cocaine base.  The indictment was in six counts.  The first count charged a conspiracy to distribute such drugs in 1994 and 1995 in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  Counts two and four charged their distribution in September 1994, and counts three, five and six charged possession of such drugs in September 1994 and March 1995.  Finally, counts two through six alleged violations of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) providing that it is unlawful \"to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\"   Counts three and five were dismissed by the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government presented its case, defendant sought acquittal on all counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.  He also asked that the case be dismissed based upon United States v. Lopez, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1995).  The district judge commented that he would be surprised \"if the federal drug laws could ever be brought within the scope of those category of laws that cannot withstand scrutiny under the commerce clause test.\"   Before denying dismissal, he added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Cocaine trafficking is a huge interstate economic enterprise.  Congress could well decide to regulate that enterprise by prohibiting the distribution of cocaine or the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  The crime necessarily implicates interstate and foreign commerce since cocaine cannot be manufactured and sold solely within any one state's boundaries.  So for that reason I'm going to deny your Lopez motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elizabeth Rivera, defendant's fiancee, and her mother Margarita then offered alibi testimony, obviously disbelieved by the jury, concerning events on September 16, 1994, and in March 1995.  Defendant again moved for acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and for dismissal under United States v. Lopez, but both motions were denied.  After the three-day jury trial defendant was found guilty on counts one and four and not guilty on counts two and six.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both sides filed sentencing memoranda.  Defendant requested that he be held accountable for only the .39 grams of cocaine base that was the subject of count four.  Since he was acquitted under counts two and six, he argued that he should not be held accountable for the drugs distributed on September 16, 1994, and March 15, 1995.  In turn, the government requested accountability for a total drug quantity of 4.15 grams of cocaine base.  Based upon that amount, the revised presentence investigation report computed a base offense level of 24 for defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge decided that the following amounts were attributable to defendant:  .37 grams on September 16, 1994;  .  39 grams on September 19, 1994;  and 1.88 grams on March 15, 1995, or a total of 2.64 grams.  The judge explained his rulings as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>... just because the jury found him not guilty, [sic] that March event doesn't mean that I have to find that he [sic] hasn't established by a preponderance of the evidence that that cocaine is his....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>I have no difficulty in finding that the .37[sic] grams on 9/16, the .39 grams on 9/19 that was the subject of the conviction, and the .188[sic] grams that was the subject of the acquittal in March are all part of the same conspiracy;  that the defendant did engage in the transactions on 9/16 and 9/19, and that the crack cocaine found under the defendant's bed was his cocaine and was possessed by him with the intent to distribute as part of the same conspiracy that led to the conspiracy conviction and the conviction for the 9/19 sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>With respect to the 9/16 transaction, I found the officer's testimony to be persuasive and convincing, and I personally have no doubt about in fact that that was the defendant who made that sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>And with respect to the 1.88 grams found on March 15, I have no difficulty in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that that cocaine is attributable to the defendant and that it is related to the count of conviction.  I just find completely implausible the speculation that someone else, like Mr. Luna, would come in and put the cocaine where it was found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>So for those reasons I am going to find attributable to the defendant .37 grams on 9/16, .39 grams on 9/19, and 1.88 grams on 3/15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Denial of Motion to Dismiss Under United States v.

Thus in United States v. Leshuk, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703993\"><a href=\"/opinion/703993/united-states-v-steve-leshuk/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1995), the court noted that Lopez reaffirmed the principle that \"where a general regulatory statute [like the one here] bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.\"  Id. at 1112.   In United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709591\"><a href=\"/opinion/709591/united-states-v-corey-d-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1995), in upholding a conviction for use of a firearm during a drug-trafficking offense, the court relied on Leshuk for rejecting a Lopez Commerce Clause challenge and noted that the statute involved here had been found constitutional.  Id. at 97.   Accord United States v. Wacker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710261\"><a href=\"/opinion/710261/united-states-v-lewis-theodore-wacker-united-states-of-america-v-leroy/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1453</span></a></span>, 1475 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendant argues that this case amounts to an abridgment of the reservation of police powers to the states under the Tenth Amendment.  Such an argument was rejected in United States v. Owens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609232\"><a href=\"/opinion/609232/united-states-v-keithan-jerome-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 60-61 (5th Cir.1993), because courts will not strike down a statute under the Tenth Amendment where Congress was within its powers under the Commerce Clause to enact the statute.  As we have already acknowledged, Congress had authority under the Commerce Clause to criminalize the conduct under the statutes involved here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant contends that he should have been acquitted on counts one and four because of insufficient evidence, stating that the affidavit for the search warrant for 290 Auburn Street on March 15, 1995, did not mention him and because the detective's identification of defendant as the person from whom he purchased crack cocaine on September 19, 1994, was uncorroborated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to count one, it is immaterial that the affidavit for the March 15, 1995 search at 290 Auburn Street did not mention defendant because detective Boles identified him as being present when the officers arrived to execute the search warrant and defendant informed one of the police officers that he shared the northwest bedroom in that apartment where a number of rocks of crack cocaine were found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count four, covering the distribution of cocaine on September 19, was supported by a detective's testimony that he requested three rocks of cocaine and purchased them from defendant on September 19, 1994, in the alley outside defendant's apartment.  Likewise, count one related to the events of March 15, 1995.  There was adequate evidence to support the convictions on counts one and four.  Thus the district court properly denied defendant's Rule 29 motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is immaterial that defendant was assessed crack quantities underlying counts two and six, for which he was acquitted, because they were included in conspiracy count one, on which he was convicted.
