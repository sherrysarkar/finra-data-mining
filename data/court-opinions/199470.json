Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n         Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond L. Sanchez Maceira, by Appointment of the Court, on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Thomas F. Klumper,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\f                                 June 27, 2001\n\n\n\n\n    Per curiam.         Appellant Silo Diaz-Paulino seeks dismissal of\n\na criminal complaint charging him with illegal reentry into the\n\nUnited States, see 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), on the ground that his\n\nfirst appearance before a magistrate occurred more than 48 hours\n\nafter his warrantless arrest, in violation of Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 5(a).         He also argues that the district court\n\nerred by refusing his request for a downward departure in his\n\nsentence.      Neither argument is viable on appeal.\n\n    Appellant did not raise the Rule 5(a) issue before the\n\ndistrict court, and it consequently is subject to plain error\n\nreview.     United States v. Paradis, 219 F.3d 22, 25 (lst Cir.\n\n2000).      Even    under   a    more   lenient       standard,     however,    the\n\nargument would be futile.               We previously have held that §\n\n1326(b)(2)     is   a   status    offense      that    does   not    trigger    the\n\nprotections of Rule 5(a) until the criminal process has been\n\ninitiated against the detained alien.                  See United States v.\n\nEncarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 399 (lst Cir. 2001).                     In a separate\n\ndecision issued today, we explain the circumstances in which an\n\nalien    who   is   detained     civilly      in   connection     with   a   status\n\noffense may challenge his detention.                    See United States v.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fTejada, No. 00-1241, slip op. at 5-6 (June 27, 2001).           Here, as\n\nthere, there is no evidence of a pretextual detention and thus\n\nno basis under Rule 5(a) to consider dismissing the charge\n\nagainst him.1\n\n      Appellant's sentencing argument is similarly meritless.          A\n\ndistrict court's discretionary refusal to depart downward under\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines is unreviewable on appeal. United\n\nStates v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 28 (lst Cir. 2001).         The record\n\nclearly shows that the court understood its authority to depart,\n\nbut   chose   not   to   do   so.     Accordingly,   we   are   without\n\njurisdiction to review its judgment.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      1 We note that the proceedings here occurred more\nexpeditiously than in Tejada's case. Diaz was interviewed by an\nofficer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) the\nday after his arrest, and he was brought before a magistrate\njudge for an initial appearance seven days later, more than a\nweek sooner than Tejada was given such a hearing.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f",
