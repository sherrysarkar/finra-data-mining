Boudewyns, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Donna M. Nesselbush and Green, Greenberg &amp; Nesselbush on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Michael P.\r\nIannotti, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Wayne G. Lewis, Assistant\r\nRegional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 25, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.    Claimant Patricia Skodras appeals from\r\na district court judgment affirming the decision of the\r\nCommissioner of Social Security that she was not entitled to\r\ndisability benefits.  We have carefully reviewed the record and\r\nclaimant's contentions on appeal and conclude that the judgment\r\nmust be affirmed essentially for the reasons stated in the\r\nFebruary 26, 1998 Memorandum and Order of the magistrate judge. \r\nWe add only the following comments.\r\n          Claimant's arguments that the administrative law\r\njudge (ALJ) ignored the opinions of her treating physicians and\r\ninstead relied on his own lay opinion in determining that she\r\nwas not disabled proceed on the assumption that to constitute\r\n\"substantial gainful activity\" for the purpose of deciding\r\nwhether a claimant was disabled during a particular period,\r\nwork performed during that period must have been executed on a\r\nfull-time basis.  However, the Social Security regulations\r\nspecifically state that \"[y]our work may be substantial even if\r\nit is done on a part-time basis or if you do less, get paid\r\nless, or have less responsibility than when you worked before.\" \r\n20 C.F.R.  404.1572(a) (emphasis added).  Claimant has not\r\nadequately addressed this regulation.\r\n          Once it is established that part-time work may\r\nconstitute substantial gainful activity, it becomes obvious\r\nthat the ALJ, in fact, relied on claimant's treating\r\nphysician's opinions in making the determination that\r\nclaimant's impairment had not lasted for a continuous period of\r\nnot less than 12 months.  See 42 U.S.C.  423(d)(1)(A). \r\nSpecifically, the ALJ pointed to Dr. Shulman's opinion that as\r\nof April 28, 1994, claimant was capable of performing part-time\r\nwork.  Indeed, claimant herself, on April 28, had stated that\r\nshe was capable of returning to part-time work.  Finally, there\r\nwas substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ's\r\nimplicit conclusion that the part-time work claimant performed,\r\nin fact, constituted substantial gainful activity.  Claimant\r\ntherefore did not meet her burden of showing that she was not\r\nengaged in substantial gainful activity during the time in\r\nquestion.  See Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137, 146 n.5 (1987). \r\n        Further, Dr. Shulman, in January 1994, had opined\r\nthat claimant might be better off working.  This opinion, of\r\ncourse, implicitly assumes that claimant was well enough to\r\ntolerate work.  Finally, the RFC assessment completed in\r\nDecember 1993 is compatible with the conclusion that claimant\r\ncould perform sedentary work as of that date.  Thus, there is\r\nevidence, that even prior to May 1994, claimant had the\r\ncapacity to resume her former job on at least a part-time\r\nbasis.  That Dr. Dec might have disagreed with these\r\nassessments is not dispositive since conflicts in the evidence\r\nare for the Commissioner, not the courts.  See Rodriguez v.\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1stCir. 1981).\r\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  SeeLocal Rule 27.1.\n",
