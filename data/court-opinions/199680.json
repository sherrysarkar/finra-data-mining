Brian        Eugene       Meserve\n\n(“Meserve”) appeals from his conviction for robbery and firearms\n\noffenses in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMaine.    On appeal, Meserve claims four errors occurred during\n\nthe course of his two-day trial; specifically that (A) the\n\ndistrict court allowed a witness to repeat the out-of-court\n\nstatement of a third party in violation of Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 802, (B) the district court barred the defense from\n\ncross-examining         a     government      witness    about    the       omission    of\n\ncertain    information          stated     at    trial    from    her       grand     jury\n\ntestimony in violation of Meserve’s Sixth Amendment right of\n\nconfrontation, (C) the government used a stale conviction to\n\nimpeach    a    defense       witness    in     violation   of    Federal       Rule    of\n\nEvidence 609(b), and (D) the government cross-examined a defense\n\nwitness    about        his    character        for   violence        and    his    prior\n\nconvictions in violation of Federal Rules of Evidence 608 and\n\n609.      Meserve       further    asserts       that    even    if    these       errors,\n\nconsidered individually, do not necessitate a new trial, the\n\ncumulative effect of the errors cannot be considered harmless.\n\nI.             Background\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f               On April 24, 1998, the Ferris Market, a family-owned\n\nconvenience store in Vassalboro, Maine, was robbed at gunpoint.\n\nIn a four-count indictment, Meserve was charged with the robbery\n\nand the associated firearms offenses.1\n\n               Viewing the evidence adduced at trial in the light most\n\nfavorable to the jury verdict, United States v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d\n\n1182, 1185 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996), the facts are as follows:                    At\n\naround 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the robbery, Meserve showed\n\nhis   girlfriend       and     accomplice,    Holly   Grant    (“Grant”),     a\n\nsawed-off shotgun and told her that he was going to rob the\n\nFerris Market.        After nightfall, Meserve and Grant drove to the\n\nFerris Market together in Meserve’s car, where they waited until\n\nthe store became less busy.            Meserve then got out of the car,\n\nwhile Grant stayed behind.\n\n               Meserve, wearing a ski mask and carrying a black bag\n\nand a short gun with a brown handle, entered the Ferris Market.\n\nHe forced Shawna Vashon, an employee, and Sumayah Ferris, the\n\nmother    of    the   owner,    to   the   floor,   and   ordered   Amy   Craig\n\n\n      1Count I of the indictment charged Meserve with the use of\nforce and violence in the commission of a robbery that affected\ncommerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). Count II charged\nMeserve with carrying and using a firearm during and in relation\nto a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C § 924(c). Count\nIII charged Meserve with possession of an unregistered sawed-off\nshotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d). Count IV charged\nMeserve with being a felon in possession of a firearm in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\n                                       -3-\n\f(“Craig”), a second employee, to give him the money in the cash\n\nregister.    Craig handed Meserve everything that was in the cash\n\nregister -- one hundred dollars.                 Meserve then fled from the\n\nstore, passing a customer on his way out of the building.\n\n            When   Meserve    returned      to    the    car   where   Grant   was\n\nwaiting, he told Grant that the robbery was a “piece of cake,”\n\nand that the only problem was that “an old lady gave him a hard\n\ntime.”   During the drive away from the scene, Meserve tossed his\n\ngloves and ski mask, the bag used to carry the money, and the\n\ngun out of the car.      When Meserve and Grant arrived at Meserve’s\n\nmother’s house, he gave Grant his sweatshirt and asked her to\n\nburn it and buried his shoes in the woods.\n\n            Later that evening, Grant and Meserve went to the Chez\n\nParis and the Bob-In, two local bars, where they used the\n\nrobbery proceeds to buy drinks.          While Meserve and Grant were at\n\nthe Chez Paris, Craig came into the bar and Meserve commented to\n\nGrant that Craig was working at the Ferris Market when he robbed\n\nit.   Later that night, when a report about the robbery came on\n\nthe evening news, Meserve remarked to Grant, “If they only\n\nknew.”\n\n            At trial, Grant supplied many of the details about the\n\nrobbery and Meserve’s conduct afterwards.                Although Grant denied\n\nany   knowledge    of   the   crime   when       first    asked   about   it   by\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fDetective Sampson Pomerleau (“Detective Pomerleau”) in October\n\n1998, she later came to an agreement with the government.               Grant\n\nmet with prosecutors several times to go over her grand jury\n\ntestimony and police reports regarding her statements.              She also\n\ndiscussed    the   case    with    Sergeant     Gerard   Madden   (“Sergeant\n\nMadden”), a Maine State Trooper who testified on her behalf at\n\nher child custody proceeding.          Under direct examination, Grant\n\nadmitted to several prior bad acts, including fraudulently using\n\nher   grandmother’s       credit    card   on    multiple   occasions    and\n\nobtaining Aid for Families with Dependent Children after she no\n\nlonger had custody of her child.\n\n            Meserve presented a defense based on alibi and mistaken\n\nidentity. Both Meserve’s mother, Lindsay Overlock (“Overlock”),\n\nand his brother, Kevin Meserve (“Kevin”), testified that he was\n\nat home until a little after 8:00 p.m. on the evening of the\n\nrobbery.    Kevin testified that at approximately 8:10 p.m., he\n\nand Meserve went to the Chez Paris, where they stayed for two\n\nhours before heading to the Bob-In.             Kevin also testified that\n\nhe had seen Grant at the Chez Paris during the last week of\n\nAugust 1999, two months before the trial.                Kevin stated that\n\nGrant was drinking heavily at that time, and complained to him\n\nthat Sergeant Madden had been “keeping tabs on her,” and that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fevery time she met or spoke with Sergeant Madden, he would\n\ninstruct her what to say at trial.\n\n           Meserve’s       other   alibi     witness,    Jane    Morissette\n\n(“Morissette”), a bartender at the Chez Paris, testified that\n\nshe saw Meserve and his brother, Kevin, enter the bar around\n\n8:30 p.m., but that Grant was not with them.              She stated that\n\nlater in the evening, Meserve told her that he was going to the\n\nBob-In with Kevin, and asked her to let Grant know where he was\n\nwhen she arrived.         According to Morissette, Grant entered the\n\nChez Paris shortly thereafter and Morissette told her that\n\nMeserve had gone to the Bob-In.              Morissette testified that\n\nbetween   11:30    p.m.    and   midnight,   a   girl   named   Amy   (Craig)\n\narrived at the Chez Paris.          Morissette overheard Craig tell a\n\nman about a robbery that had occurred earlier that evening at a\n\nstore at which she worked in Vassalboro.\n\n           On October 21, 1999, the jury convicted Meserve on all\n\nfour counts.      Meserve filed a motion for a new trial, which was\n\ndenied on July 20, 2000.            Accordingly, on August 29, 2000,\n\nMeserve was sentenced to concurrent terms of one hundred months\n\nimprisonment on Counts I, III, and IV of the indictment and to\n\na consecutive term of one hundred twenty months on Count II of\n\nthe indictment.\n\nII.        Analysis\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f              A.     Hearsay Evidence\n\n              Generally, questions of admissibility of evidence that\n\ndo not raise issues of law are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n\nE.g., Baker v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust, 156 F.3d 248, 251-\n\n52 (1st Cir. 1995).              During the government’s case in chief,\n\nDetective Pomerleau was permitted to testify over the objection\n\nof the defense that he drove by Meserve’s house on the night of\n\nthe robbery “to see exactly where the subject was living.”\n\nDetective Pomerleau further testified, again over objection,\n\nthat Meserve became a suspect in the case because he matched the\n\ndescription of the robber and because Craig thought Meserve\n\nmight have been the robber because she knew him.                          Meserve\n\nasserts    that     this     testimony        constitutes    hearsay     and     is\n\ninadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 802.                 The government\n\nargues,    however,       that    the   district   court     admitted    Craig’s\n\nstatement not for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather\n\nto explain why Detective Pomerleau drove by Meserve’s home that\n\nevening.      Meserve counters that the statement was nevertheless\n\ninadmissible because, if not hearsay, the fact that Detective\n\nPomerleau drove by Meserve’s home shortly after the robbery had\n\nno    tendency       to     prove       any     issue   in       the     case.\n\n              Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove\n\nthe   truth    of   the    matter    asserted.      Fed.    R.   Evid.   801(c).\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fTestimony    that     is    not    offered     to   prove   the   truth     of    an\n\nout-of-court    statement,         but   is    instead    offered   to    provide\n\nrelevant    context    or    background,       is   not   considered      hearsay.\n\nE.g., United States v.            Mazza, 792 F.2d 1210, 1215 (1st Cir.\n\n1986); accord United States v. Freeman, 816 F.2d 558, 563 (10th\n\nCir. 1987); United States v. Love, 767 F.2d 1052, 1063 (4th Cir.\n\n1985).     Moreover, the hearsay rule does not apply to statements\n\nthat are offered to show what effect they produced on the\n\nactions of a listener.            United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d\n\n976, 981 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            In the instant case, however, the government’s espoused\n\nreason for introducing the testimony -- to explain why Detective\n\nPomerleau drove by Meserve’s house on the evening of the robbery\n\n-- is completely irrelevant to the government’s case.                  Detective\n\nPomerleau did not discover any evidence or valuable information\n\nduring his drive-by and made no observations pertinent to the\n\ninvestigation; thus, the fact that he went on such a drive has\n\nno “tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or\n\nless probable than it would be without the evidence.”                     Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 401.      Detective Pomerleau’s           motivation for driving by\n\nMeserve’s    home     is    likewise     irrelevant.        In    light    of    the\n\ngovernment’s baldly pretextual basis for the introduction of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCraig’s out-of-court statement, this court is not prepared to\n\nsay   that    the     statement    is    admissible   non-hearsay.     The\n\ngovernment is thus reduced to its claim that the error is\n\nharmless -- a matter considered below.\n\n             B.       Exclusion of Cross-Examination Using Grand Jury\n                      Testimony\n\n             Meserve claims that the district court erred by not\n\nallowing     the    defense   to   cross-examine      Grant   concerning   a\n\ndiscrepancy between her trial testimony and her grand jury\n\ntestimony.        At trial, Grant testified that Craig came into the\n\nChez Paris on the night of the robbery and that Craig’s entrance\n\nprompted Meserve to mention that Craig was working at the store\n\nwhen he robbed it.       In contrast, although Grant testified before\n\nthe grand jury that after the robbery she went to two bars with\n\nMeserve, the Chez Paris and the Bob-In, she never stated that\n\nshe saw Craig at the Chez Paris.              Nor did she mention seeing\n\nCraig that night at the Chez Paris even though, in response to\n\na question as to whether Meserve had recognized any of the\n\nFerris Market’s employees, Grant testified that Meserve told her\n\nthat he recognized a girl named Amy because she was dating a\n\nfriend of theirs.\n\n             When the defense sought to question Grant about why she\n\nhad not mentioned Craig’s presence at the Chez Paris in her\n\ngrand jury testimony, the district court barred this line of\n\n                                        -9-\n\fquestioning because Grant was not specifically asked about the\n\nincident    before   the   grand   jury.       Meserve   argues   that    this\n\nrestriction on Grant’s cross-examination violated his rights\n\nunder the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.                   E.g.,\n\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679-80 (1986); Davis v.\n\nAlaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318 (1974).          The government responds that\n\nGrant’s grand jury testimony was not inconsistent with her\n\ntestimony at trial and that even if error occurred, it was\n\nharmless.\n\n            Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness’s\n\ncredibility    may   be    impeached      by   asking    him   about     prior\n\ninconsistent statements.      Fed. R. Evid. 613(a); United States v.\n\nHudson, 970 F.2d 948, 953-54 (1st Cir. 1992).             The rule applies\n\n“when two statements, one made at trial and one made previously,\n\nare irreconcilably at odds.”        United States v. Winchenbach, 197\n\nF.3d 548, 558 (1st Cir. 1999).         Prior statements, such as the\n\ngrand jury testimony at issue here, that omit details included\n\nin a witness’s trial testimony are inconsistent if it would have\n\nbeen “natural” for the witness to include the details in the\n\nearlier statement.     United States v. Stock, 948 F.2d 1299, 1301\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1991) (citing Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U.S. 231, 239\n\n(1980)).    This test is an elastic one, because the “naturalness”\n\nof a witness’s decision not to include certain information in an\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fearlier   statement      may    depend   on     the   “nuances    of   the     prior\n\nstatement’s context, as well as [the witness’s] own loquacity.”\n\nId.\n\n           District      courts    have       broad    discretion      concerning\n\nwhether   two    statements      are    in    fact    inconsistent,      and   thus\n\nwhether the witness may be impeached by the prior statement.\n\nUdemba v. Nicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing United\n\nStates v. Agajanian, 852 F.2d 56, 58 (2d Cir. 1988);                         United\n\nStates    v.    Jones,    808    F.2d        561,    568   (7th   Cir.    1986)).\n\nNevertheless, under certain circumstances, a district court’s\n\nrefusal to permit a witness to be questioned about a prior\n\ninconsistent statement may constitute reversible error.                         See,\n\ne.g., Stock, 948 F.2d at 1301 (citing United States v. Standard\n\nOil Co., 316 F.2d 884, 891-92 (7th Cir. 1963); United States v.\n\nAyotte, 741 F.2d 865, 870-71 (6th Cir. 1984)).\n\n           Here, however, the district court did not abuse its\n\nwide discretion by refusing to allow Meserve to cross-examine\n\nGrant regarding the omission from her grand jury testimony of\n\ncertain details about which she testified at trial.                    Before the\n\ngrand jury, Grant was not asked whether she remembered anyone\n\ncoming into the Chez Paris on the night of the crime nor whether\n\nshe saw any of the victims of the crime at any point.                    Although\n\nMeserve argues that questions about whether Meserve recognized\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fany of the workers at the Ferris Market and about Grant and\n\nMeserve’s activities after they went to the Chez Paris should\n\nhave prompted Grant to mention that she saw Craig at the Chez\n\nParis that night, such nuances are peripheral and not directly\n\ninconsistent.             Thus,      the    district          court    did    not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to allow Grant to be questioned about her\n\nprior     omission.                 The     right        to     confrontation         through\n\ncross-examination is not unlimited.                       A district court has “wide\n\nlatitude       .     .    .    to    impose       reasonable          limits    on    .     .    .\n\ncross-examination based on concerns about . . . interrogation\n\nthat is repetitive or only marginally relevant.”                               Van Arsdall,\n\n475 U.S. at 679.              The district court appropriately exercised its\n\nauthority under the circumstances of this case.\n\n               C.         Impeachment by Stale Conviction\n\n               Meserve         argues      that    the    district       court       erred      by\n\nallowing the government to use a conviction for theft that was\n\nover twenty years old to impeach Morissette.                                 The government\n\nraises three counter-arguments:                          First, as Meserve did not\n\ncontemporaneously object to the question, the issue was not\n\npreserved for appeal.               Second, because Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n609     does        not   render          such     impeachment         evidence       per       se\n\ninadmissible, the lack of an objection deprived the district\n\ncourt of the opportunity to make the appropriate rulings with\n\n\n                                                 -12-\n\frespect to its admissibility.               Third, even if error occurred, it\n\nwas harmless.\n\n                 Meserve     concedes        that    he     failed      to   make     a\n\ncontemporaneous          objection      at     the     time       of    Morissette’s\n\ncross-examination.           Thus,     this    court       reviews     the   district\n\ncourt’s allowance of this impeachment evidence for plain error.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); Fed. R. Evid. 103(d).                     Review for plain\n\nerror “entails a quadripartite showing: (1) that there was\n\nerror; (2) that it was plain; (3) that the error affect[ed]\n\nsubstantial       rights;    and      (4)    that    the    error      affected     the\n\nfairness,     integrity,         or    public        reputation         of   judicial\n\nproceedings.”      United States v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)     (alteration       in   original)       (internal        quotation      marks\n\nomitted); see also Johnson v.                United States, 520 U.S. 461,\n\n465-67 (1997); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-32\n\n(1993).     In a plain error argument, the defendant bears the\n\nburden of persuasion.            United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408,\n\n1414 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 609(b), evidence\n\nof a conviction is not admissible to impeach a witness “if a\n\nperiod of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the\n\nconviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement\n\nimposed    for    that     conviction,        whichever      is   the    later    date\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f. . . .”    Id.    Thus, because Morissette’s conviction for theft\n\noccurred in 1978 and she had been released from any confinement\n\nby 1980, the conviction was stale under the terms of Rule\n\n609(b).    See United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            It is not clear, however, that the error was “plain.”\n\nRule   609(b)     contains   an    exception,    which   establishes    that\n\nevidence of convictions over ten years old may be admissible if\n\n“the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the\n\nprobative value of the conviction supported by specific facts\n\nand    circumstances     substantially       outweighs   its   prejudicial\n\neffect.” Fed. R. Evid. 609(b).              Meserve’s failure to make a\n\ntimely objection to the admission of the evidence deprived the\n\ndistrict court of the opportunity to determine whether the\n\nprobative value of the evidence substantially outweighed its\n\nprejudicial effect.       Thus, the “plainness” of the error cannot\n\nbe established on the current record.\n\n            And even if, by some stretch, this court were to\n\nconclude that the admission of a conviction over ten years old\n\nas impeachment evidence under the circumstances of this case\n\nconstituted plain error, Meserve cannot satisfy his burden of\n\nshowing    that   the   error     “seriously    affect[ed]   the   fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of [the] judicial proceeding[],”\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fJohnson, 520 U.S. at 469 (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 736)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).            As the government points\n\nout, “[t]he subject of Morissette’s prior conviction occupied a\n\nsingle question, produced a single answer and neither party\n\nreturned to the topic again either in the testimony or in\n\nsummations.”    See, e.g., United States v. Tse, 135 F.3d 200,\n\n209-10   (1st   Cir.   1998)    (finding      harmless   error    where    the\n\nimproperly admitted evidence played an insignificant role in the\n\nproceedings).      Even    Meserve    seems    to   acknowledge    that    the\n\nadmission of a single piece of impeachment evidence against a\n\nsingle   defense   witness     is   not   capable   of   depriving   him    of\n\nsubstantial rights.       Instead, Meserve attempts to argue that the\n\nimpeachment evidence was particularly likely to be damaging\n\nbecause it was “followed by the improper cross-examination of\n\n[Kevin].”   The argument that the cumulative effect of multiple\n\nerrors warrants reversal, however, is distinct from the argument\n\nthat the admission of impeachment evidence against Morissette --\n\nin and of itself -- constitutes reversible error.            Viewed alone,\n\nthe use of a stale conviction to impeach Morissette, even if\n\nsuch evidence was admitted in violation of Rule 609(b), was not\n\na sufficiently egregious violation of Meserve’s rights to have\n\ndeprived the proceedings of their fundamental integrity and\n\nfairness.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f-16-\n\f         D.       Cross-Examination of Kevin Meserve about his\nPrior             Convictions    and  Character   for Violence\n\n         Meserve    argues   that   the   district   court   committed\n\nreversible error by permitting the government to cross-examine\n\nhis brother, Kevin, about his disorderly person and assault\n\nconvictions and about his alleged violent reputation in the\n\ncommunity.    The challenged portion of Kevin’s cross-examination\n\nis as follows:\n\n         Q: Now, Mr. McKee asked you questions about\n         your conviction for unlawful sexual contact\n         in ‘94 and ‘95, but that’s not your only\n         conviction, is it?\n\n         A: I have a couple of assaults on my record.\n\n         Q: 1999-1979, disorderly conduct.\n\n                MR. McKEE: I object, Your Honor,\n         That’s improper cross-examination under Rule\n         609.   It specifically precludes that.     A\n         disorderly conduct?\n\n                MR. McCARTHY: I can lay a foundation\n         for it.\n\n                  THE COURT: Go ahead.\n\n         BY MR. McCARTHY:\n\n         Q: You’re a tough guy, aren’t you Kevin?\n\n                  MR. McKEE: I object.\n\n                  THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n         BY MR. McCARTHY:\n\n         Q: You’re a tough guy, aren’t you?\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fA: I wouldn’t classify myself as a tough\nguy.\n\nQ: Been in a lot of fights in your day?\n\n       MR.   McKEE:  I   object,        improper\ncharacter evidence, impeachment.\n\n       THE COURT: Just a minute. Objection’s\noverruled.\n\nA: How many would you classify as a lot?\n\nBY MR. McCARTHY:\n\nQ: More than one?\n\nA: Yeah, I’ve       been   in   more   than   one,\nprobably two.\n\nQ: Okay. And as a result of that, people in\nthe community are afraid of you, aren’t\nthey?\n\nA: No.\n\n       Mr. McKEE: Object, Your Honor.     A\ncontinuing objection to my client’s --\nexcuse me -- this witness’ alleged behavior\nin the past as not being relevant, as not\nbeing permissible character evidence under\nRule 608 or any other rule.\n\n         The COURT: Mr. McCarthy?\n\n       MR. McCARTHY: Well, Your Honor, I\ndisagree.     If his reputation in the\ncommunity is basically as an assaultive\nperson about whom people are afraid, that’s\nvery significant when it comes to the other\npeople’s testimony about him and about\nwhat’s happened.\n\n       THE COURT: I’m going to allow it over\nobjection.     You’ll   have  a   continuing\nobjection.\n\n                      -18-\n\f                     Mr. McKEE: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n          BY MR. McCARTHY:\n\n          Q: In fact, you were convicted of assault as\n          recently as 1997, weren’t you.\n\n                     MR. McKEE: Same objection, Your Honor.\n\n                 THE        COURT:     You     have    a     continuing\n          objection.\n\n                 MR. McKEE: This is with respect to\n          Rule 609.\n\n                     THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          BY MR. McCARTHY:\n\n          Q: Is that right?\n\n          A: Yes.\n\n          Meserve objects to this entire line of questioning,\n\nasserting that the questions about Kevin’s disorderly person and\n\nassault convictions were improper because these convictions were\n\nnot permissible subjects of cross-examination under Rule 609(a)\n\nand that the questions about Kevin being a “tough guy” and\n\nhaving   been   in   a    lot    of   fights    in     his    day   were   improper\n\ncharacter evidence under Rule 608.             The government counters that\n\nMeserve failed to preserve these issues for review and that any\n\nerrors   that   may       have   occurred       were       harmless,   given    the\n\ncumulative weight of the evidence against Meserve.\n\n                     1.     Preservation of the Issues for Review\n\n                                       -19-\n\f          The government devoted a great deal of space in its\n\nbrief and time at oral argument to defending the untenable\n\nposition that the issues raised by Meserve on appeal were not\n\npreserved for review because the defense failed to make both\n\ncontemporaneous objections and motions to strike and because\n\nKevin did not answer many of the government’s questions, or\n\nprovided answers arguably favorable to the defense.      Because of\n\nthe vehemence with which the government argues a position with\n\nno seeming support in the law, this court pauses to discuss the\n\nobligations placed on each of the parties to a trial by the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\n\n          It is a basic tenet of our law that in order to\n\npreserve an evidentiary issue for review, the party opposing the\n\nadmission of the evidence must make a timely objection.      Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 103(a)(1); United States v. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 130 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); United States v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1293 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 770 & n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); Willco Kuwait (Trading) S.A.K. v. deSavary, 843 F.2d\n\n618, 625 (1st Cir. 1988); see also United States v. Taylor, 54\n\nF.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir. 1995) (“In general, the law ministers to\n\nthe vigilant, not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.”).\n\nThus,   the   government   argues   that   the   defense’s   failure\n\nimmediately to object when Kevin was asked about convictions in\n\n\n                               -20-\n\faddition to his unlawful sexual contact convictions constrains\n\nthis court from considering the matter on appeal absent plain\n\nerror.     Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b);         Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-37.\n\nExamination of the transcript, however, reveals that Meserve’s\n\nattorney    objected    as   soon   as   it   became   obvious   that   the\n\ngovernment’s line of questioning was in violation of Rule 609,\n\ni.e., when the government indicated that the conviction about\n\nwhich it was asking was a twenty-year-old disorderly conduct\n\nconviction.   To be timely, an objection must be “made as soon as\n\nthe ground of it is known, or reasonably should have been known\n\nto the objector.”      United States v. Check, 582 F.2d 668, 676 (2d\n\nCir. 1978) (quoting 21 Charles Alan Wright & Kenneth W. Graham,\n\nJr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 5037 (1977) (quoting John\n\nHenry Wigmore, Code of Evidence 25 (3d ed. 1942)).           The general\n\nprinciple that an objection should be made after a question has\n\nbeen asked but before an answer has been given, Hutchinson v.\n\nGroskin, 927 F.2d 722, 725 (2d Cir. 1991), is flexible in\n\ndeference to the “heat of a hotly contested criminal trial,”\n\nCheck, 582 F.2d at 676.       Thus, the defense was not required to\n\nanticipate the government’s line of questioning in order for the\n\nobjection to be timely.        Compare Hutchinson, 927 F.2d at 725\n\n(holding that objection was timely, even though objection was\n\nnot made until after question was answered), and Inge v. United\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fStates, 356 F.2d 345, 350 n.17 (D.C. Cir. 1966) (holding that\n\ndefense counsel’s failure to object until after he learned the\n\nnature of the document being used to refresh the defendant’s\n\nrecollection did not render objection nugatory),                    with United\n\nStates v. Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 385 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding that because at least three pages of transcript were\n\nrecorded before the defendant objected, the objection came too\n\nlate to preserve the objection for appeal), and W. Fire Ins. Co.\n\nv. Word, 131 F.2d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir. 1942) (“It is a rule of\n\nlaw so old that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary\n\nthat   one    may    not    sit    by   without   objection   to    rulings       or\n\ninstructions, and then after verdict and judgment, and when it\n\nis too late for the court to change its rulings or charge, come\n\nforward with objections on appeal and seek to put the court in\n\nerror.”), cited with approval in Putnam Res. v. Pateman, 958\n\nF.2d   448,    457   n.6    (1st     Cir.    1992).     Meserve’s       objection,\n\nalthough delayed, was sufficiently contemporaneous to comport\n\nwith the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n             The government attempts to place an additional onus on\n\nparties opposing the admission of such evidence, however, by\n\narguing that the defense was further obligated to move to strike\n\nKevin’s    answers     to    the   government’s       questions    in    order    to\n\npreserve      Meserve’s      right      to   review.      According       to     the\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fgovernment, once a question has been answered, even if that\n\nanswer was provided pursuant to a district court’s evidentiary\n\nruling, the proper procedural vehicle to preserve rights for\n\nappeal is the motion to strike.   The government was able to cite\n\nno authority for this proposition during oral argument and the\n\ncourt has found none.2\n\n           The rule governing objections to evidence states that\n\n“error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or\n\nexcludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is\n\naffected, and . . . [i]n case the ruling is one admitting\n\nevidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of\n\nrecord.”   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1) (emphasis added).     Because\n\nRule 103 is written in the disjunctive, the right to review may\n\nbe preserved either by objecting or by moving to strike and\n\noffering specific grounds in support of that motion.    The rule\n\nis intended to ensure that the nature of an error was called to\n\nthe attention of the trial judge, so as to “alert him to the\n\nproper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take\n\n\n\n    2  The case thrice cited in the government’s brief, United\nStates v. Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849 (1st Cir. 1993), does\nnot support the government’s position.     Far from placing an\nadditional obligation on parties to move to strike, this case\nmerely states that because the appellants neither objected to\nthe admission of the challenged testimony at trial nor moved to\nstrike the testimony, the court was foreclosed from considering\nthe issue on appeal absent plain error. Id. at 853 n.5.\n\n                              -23-\n\fproper corrective measures.”               Fed. R. Evid. 103(a) advisory\n\ncommittee’s note.        Thus, both the plain language and underlying\n\ngoals   of    Rule    103(a)    indicate     that   a   party   opposing   the\n\nadmission     of     evidence   may   do    so   through   either   a   timely\n\nobjection or motion to strike.3\n\n             Moreover, the position espoused by the government is\n\ncontrary to logic.          According to the government, even if a\n\nwitness’s answer was given pursuant to a district court’s order\n\noverruling an objection, the party opposing admission of the\n\nevidence must move to strike the witness’s answer to escape\n\nplain error review.         Modern trial practice is unreceptive to\n\nsuch procedural redundancies, and were this court to adopt the\n\ngovernment’s view, it would take several steps back from the\n\nstreamlining that the Judicial Conference, the Supreme Court,\n\nand the Congress attempted to accomplish through the enactment\n\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975.                  Because the law\n\nimposes no obligation on a party opposing the admission of\n\nevidence both to object and to move to strike, Meserve’s timely\n\nobjections were sufficient to preserve his rights for review.\n\n\n\n    3  If a party does not challenge the evidence in a timely\nmanner, however, an after-the-fact motion to strike usually\ncannot “repair the forfeiture that flows from the failure to\ninterpose a contemporaneous objection.” A.J. Faigin v. Kelly,\n184 F.3d 67, 83 n.10 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing McKnight v. Johnson\nControls, Inc., 36 F.3d 1396, 1408 (8th Cir. 1994)).\n\n                                      -24-\n\f            In its final effort to prevent this court from reaching\n\nthe merits of Meserve’s claims, the government asserts that\n\nwhere Kevin did not answer the question posed, or where the\n\nanswer elicited was arguably favorable to the defense, review is\n\nnot warranted.    According to the government, “[n]o answer to the\n\nchallenged question having been given, no evidence was admitted,\n\nand thus there is no error to correct.”               This position is\n\nwithout support in the law.\n\n            No court has ever held that review is forestalled if\n\na witness does not answer a question posed or answers that\n\nquestion with a response favorable to the objecting party.\n\nAlthough    the   government   cites    two   cases    to   support    this\n\nproposition, United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) and    United States v.    Zaccaria, 240 F.3d 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), these cases simply stand for the proposition that under\n\nsuch circumstances, the harmless error analysis is likely to\n\nweigh in favor of the appellee.        See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 485\n\n(noting that because the challenged questions were not answered,\n\nthe prejudicial effect of the questions was lessened); see also\n\nZaccaria, 240 F.3d at 82-83 (holding that even if the district\n\ncourt erred in sustaining the objection, the error was harmless\n\nbecause the witness answered the question in the negative and\n\nthe    court        did    not     strike        his        answer).\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f         Even when a question elicits no answer or an answer\n\narguably favorable to the defense, the question itself may\n\nnevertheless prejudice a defendant because of the weight a jury\n\ngives to the questions asked by a prosecutor.      E.g., United\n\nStates v. Simonelli, 237 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2001) (“That [the\n\nwitness] denied these acts does not, of course, render the\n\nquestioning harmless.   There is a lingering odor left by such\n\nquestions . . . .”); United States v. Cudlitz, 72 F.3d 992, 999\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (“Under these circumstances, it would have been\n\neasy -- if not strictly fair -- for the jury to have given great\n\nweight to the [government’s] suggestion . . . .”); see also 1\n\nJohn Henry Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence § 17 (Peter Tillers ed.,\n\n1983) [hereinafter Wigmore] (“[F]acts of discreditable conduct\n\n[may be] groundlessly asked about in the hope that though denied\n\nthey will be assumed by the jury to be well founded.”).   The law\n\nprovides protection against illegitimately posed questions even\n\nwhere they produce no answer.\n\n         Furthermore, the district court’s instruction to the\n\njury here that the lawyers’ questions were not evidence may not\n\neliminate the potential taint of the government’s questions.\n\nCudlitz, 72 F.3d at 999.   The instruction did not occur during\n\nthe course of the challenged cross-examination, but rather as\n\npart of the court’s final jury charge several hours later.   The\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fcourt’s instruction was therefore unlikely to eradicate the\n\nimpression   left    on   the   jury   by   the   government’s   line   of\n\nquestioning.   Id. (“[T]he sting [of objectionable questions]\n\nsurvives such instructions, which is why lawyers ask impeaching\n\nquestions that they know will produce denials.”).\n\n         The government’s various arguments that Meserve failed\n\nto preserve his challenges to Kevin’s cross-examination for\n\nreview are therefore without merit.          Because timely objections\n\nto the government’s cross-examination of Kevin were raised at\n\ntrial and because objectionable questions may be reviewed even\n\nwhere they produced no answer or an arguably favorable answer,\n\nthe court considers Meserve’s arguments under the harmless error\n\nstandard of review, not the more demanding plain error standard.\n\nUnited States v. Joyner, 191 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                    2.    Review of Challenged Testimony\n\n         Having determined that Meserve’s challenges to the\n\ngovernment’s cross-examination of Kevin were properly preserved\n\nfor review, the court considers the testimony to which Meserve\n\nobjects, bearing in mind the following points:\n\n         First, the district court’s construction of\n         evidentiary rules is a question of law which\n         we review de novo. Second, the application\n         of an evidentiary rule to particular facts\n         is normally tested by an abuse of discretion\n         standard, which favors the prevailing party.\n         Finally, we may affirm the district court’s\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\f           evidentiary rulings on any ground apparent\n           from the record on appeal.\n\nUnited States v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1296 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n                       (a)   Federal Rule of Evidence 609\n\n           Meserve’s   first   challenge    to   the   government’s\n\ncross-examination of Kevin is that the government’s questions\n\nabout    Kevin’s disorderly conduct and assault convictions were\n\nimproper because these convictions were not permissible subjects\n\nof cross-examination under Rule 609(a). Pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 609(a):\n\n                  For the purpose of       attacking   the\n           credibility of a witness,\n\n                  (1) evidence that a witness other than\n           an accused has been convicted of a crime\n           shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if\n           the  crime   was   punishable   by   .  .   .\n           imprisonment in excess of one year under the\n           law under which the witness was convicted,\n           and evidence that an accused has been\n           convicted of such a crime shall be admitted\n           if the court determines that the probative\n           value of admitting this evidence outweighs\n           its prejudicial effect to the accused; and\n\n                  (2) evidence that any witness has been\n           convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it\n           involved dishonesty or false statement,\n           regardless of the punishment.\n\nId.     Thus, the government could only inquire about Kevin’s\n\nconvictions for disorderly conduct and assault if the crimes\n\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fwere punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year\n\nor involved dishonesty or false statement.\n\n            Under Maine law, disorderly conduct is a Class E crime,\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 501(6), punishable by a maximum\n\nterm of six months, id. § 1252(2)(E), and assault is a Class D\n\ncrime, id. § 207(2), punishable by a term of imprisonment less\n\nthan one year, id. § 1252(2)(D).                 Because the sentences for\n\nthese    crimes   do    not   exceed    one    year,      Meserve    argues    that\n\nevidence of these crimes is per se inadmissible under Rule\n\n609(a)(1).    In opposition, the government asserts that assault\n\nis not always a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for less\n\nthan one year in Maine; section 207(2) provides that when the\n\nperpetrator is at least eighteen years of age and the assault\n\nproduced bodily injury to a child under six years of age, the\n\ncrime is classified as a Class C crime, punishable by a prison\n\nterm of up to five years.         Id. § 207(2).\n\n            The record before this court does not resolve the\n\nquestion    whether     Kevin’s   assault      conviction      was    for    bodily\n\ninjury to a child less than six, an omission for which the\n\ngovernment    blames     Meserve:      “[I]t   is   Meserve’s       failure    [to]\n\ndevelop a record that leaves this court with inadequate facts to\n\nresolve the issue definitively.”              Through this simple sentence,\n\nthe     government     attempts   to     shift      the    burden    of     proving\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fadmissibility        from   the   proponent          of   evidence    to   the   party\n\nopposing the admission of the evidence.\n\n             It is a principle too simple to seem to need stating,\n\nhowever, that the government, as the party seeking to introduce\n\nevidence of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes under\n\nRule   609,    was    obligated        to    have     researched      Kevin’s    prior\n\noffenses and to have determined that they were admissible.\n\nE.g., 1 Wigmore, supra § 17.                  Upon Meserve’s challenge, the\n\ngovernment should have been prepared to produce to the district\n\ncourt concrete proof that Kevin had been convicted of a crime\n\npunishable by more than one year within the previous ten years.\n\nAdmittedly,     the    government       may        have   been   in   possession    of\n\nprecisely such proof, and merely failed to produce it because\n\nthe district court did not demand it upon Meserve’s objection.\n\nEven   so,    the    failure      of   the     district     court     to   press   the\n\ngovernment on this issue does not shift the burden to Meserve.\n\n             Nor do the convictions for disorderly conduct and\n\nassault introduced by the government against Kevin fall within\n\nRule 609(a)(2), as the legislative history of the rule makes\n\nclear:\n\n             [T]he   phrase    “dishonesty   and   false\n             statement” . . . means crimes such as\n             perjury or subornation of perjury, false\n             statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement, or\n             false pretense, or any other offense in the\n             nature of crimen falsi, the commission of\n\n                                            -30-\n\f            which involves some element of deceit,\n            untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on\n            the   accused's   propensity   to   testify\n            truthfully.\n\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1597, at 9 (1974),            reprinted in 1974\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 7098, 7103.       To be admissible under Rule 609(a)(2),\n\na   prior   conviction   must    involve   “some   element   of   deceit,\n\nuntruthfulness, or falsification which would tend to show that\n\nan accused would be likely to testify untruthfully,”               United\n\nStates v. Seamster, 568 F.2d 188, 190 (10th Cir. 1978), elements\n\nnot readily apparent in the crimes of disorderly conduct and\n\nassault.4\n\n            Because the government failed to develop an adequate\n\npredicate for admitting the convictions for disorderly conduct\n\nand assault, it was error to permit interrogation concerning\n\nthese convictions for the purposes of impeaching Kevin.\n\n                         (b)    Federal Rule of Evidence 608\n\n            Meserve   further     argues   that    the   questions    the\n\ngovernment posed to Kevin about being a “tough guy” and having\n\n“[b]een in a lot of fights in [his] day” were improper under\n\n\n\n\n      4Kevin’s 1979 conviction for disorderly conduct is also\nstale under Rule 609(b). Thus, the government bore a further\nobligation, which it does not appear to have satisfied, to\nprovide notice to the defense of its intent to introduce\nevidence of the conviction and to show that this evidence was\nmore probative than prejudicial.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fFederal Rule of Evidence 608.     The government counters that it\nwas entitled\n\nto introduce evidence that Kevin had previously been involved in\n\nfights as impeachment by contradiction following Kevin’s denial\n\nthat he was a “tough guy.”\n\n          Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 608(a):\n\n          The credibility of a witness may be attacked\n          or supported by evidence in the form of\n          opinion or reputation, but subject to these\n          limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only\n          to    character    for    truthfulness    or\n          untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful\n          character is admissible only after the\n          character of the witness for truthfulness\n          has been attacked by opinion or reputation\n          evidence or otherwise.\n\nId.   The government’s questions about Kevin’s status as a “tough\n\nguy” and his reputation in the community for violence were\n\ncompletely    irrelevant   on   the     facts    here    to    this   jury’s\n\ncredibility   determination.      Even     if,   as     suggested     by   the\n\ngovernment at trial, people in the community were afraid of\n\nKevin because he was an “assaultive person,” this has no bearing\n\non Kevin’s credibility as a witness, given the issues in this\n\ncase.   No other theory of admissibility is offered.\n\n          As the government’s questions about Kevin being a\n\n“tough guy” were impermissible, they cannot serve as a launching\n\npad for the admission of additional evidence.                 Moreover, the\n\ngovernment’s questions about Kevin’s involvement in a couple of\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\ffights are impermissible in their own right.             Under Rule 608(b):\n\n\n\n            Specific instances of the conduct of a\n            witness . . . . may . . . in the discretion\n            of the court, if probative of truthfulness\n            or untruthfulness, be inquired into on\n            cross-examination of the witness . . .\n            concerning   the  witness’   character  for\n            truthfulness or untruthfulness . . . .\n\nId.   The specific instances of prior conduct about which the\n\ngovernment questioned Kevin bore no relation whatsoever to his\n\ncharacter    for    truthfulness      or   untruthfulness.      As    Meserve\n\ncorrectly    states,       the   government     wanted   to   suggest,      and\n\nsucceeded in suggesting, that Kevin was a man with a violent\n\ndisposition.\n\n            E.       Harmless Error?\n\n            Since we conclude that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting evidence against Meserve violative of Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence 608, 609, and 802, the government perforce is reduced\n\nto    arguing      that     these     errors,   both     individually       and\n\ncollectively, were “harmless.”             Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) (“Any\n\nerror, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect\n\nsubstantial rights shall be disregarded.”); Fed R. Evid. 103(a)\n\n(“Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or\n\nexcludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is\n\naffected.”).       In     Kotteakos   v.   United   States,   328    U.S.   750\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\f(1946), the Supreme Court elucidated the harmless error standard\n\nfor cases involving non-constitutional errors, stating, “if one\n\ncannot    say,    with      fair    assurance,      after   pondering     all   that\n\nhappened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,\n\nthat the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it\n\nis impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not\n\naffected,”       id.   at    765.      The    applicable      standard    is    thus\n\ndifferent    than      that    applied       when    determining   whether       the\n\nevidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict: “The inquiry cannot\n\nbe merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart\n\nfrom the phase affected by the error.                  It is rather, even so,\n\nwhether   the     error     itself    had     substantial     influence.”        Id.\n\nTherefore, “we can uphold the conviction, in the teeth of an\n\nerror preserved by a timely objection, only where we think it\n\n‘highly    probable’        that     the    error    played   no   role    in   the\n\nconviction, that is to say, that the result would have been\n\nidentical regardless of the error.”                  Cudlitz, 72 F.3d at 1000\n\n(citing United States v. Rullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18-19 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)); see also Rose, 104 F.3d at 1414 (citing                        United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d 532, 543 (1st Cir. 1991);\n\nBenavente Gomez, 921 F.2d at 386).\n\n            Unlike the plain error analysis, the government bears\n\nthe burden of persuasion with respect to showing that the error\n\n\n                                           -34-\n\fwas harmless.        Olano, 507 U.S. at 734-35.         “[T]he greater the\n\nweight of the other evidence against the defendant, the less\n\nlikely it is that a given error swayed the jury,” but the\n\ngreater the probable impact of the error, the less likely it is\n\nthat   the    court   can    conclude   that   the   error    was    harmless.\n\nCudlitz, 72 F.3d at 999.            We consider factors such as “[t]he\n\ncentrality of the evidence, its prejudicial effect, whether it\n\nis cumulative, the use of the evidence by counsel and the\n\ncloseness of the case.”         Kowalski v. Gagne, 914 F.2d 299, 308\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Lataille v. Ponte, 754 F.2d 33, 37 (1st\n\nCir. 1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted).               Where evidence\n\nis admitted in violation of Rule 608, we examine additional\n\nfactors such as whether the admission permitted completely new\n\nevidence to go before the jury and whether the disputed evidence\n\nwas likely to arouse passion or prejudice.               Deary v. City of\n\nGloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 197 (1st Cir. 1993).                 Ultimately, the\n\nharmless error analysis “must be made in the context of the case\n\nas gleaned from the record as a whole.”           DeVasto v. Faherty, 658\n\nF.2d   859,    863    (1st   Cir.    1981);    accord   United      States   v.\n\nMateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 237 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing United\n\nStates v. Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n             Applying these principles, we consider the evidentiary\n\nerrors committed during Meserve’s trial:\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\f                     1.   The Hearsay Evidence\n\n            Detective Pomerleau’s statement that Craig identified\n\nMeserve as a possible suspect in the case was not itself central\n\nto the case, as it was less damaging than the properly admitted\n\ntestimony of other witnesses, including Craig, whose statements\n\ndirectly implicated Meserve in the robbery.                   At worst, the jury\n\nmay have credited the testimony of these witnesses somewhat more\n\nbecause     of    Detective      Pomerleau’s         repetition     of    Craig’s\n\nout-of-court statement.           The weight of the government’s case\n\nagainst Meserve was such, however, that Craig’s out-of-court\n\nstatement was but a small         contribution to the font of evidence.\n\n“[A]fter    pondering     all    that    happened     without     stripping      the\n\nerroneous action from the whole,” Mazza, 792 F.2d at 1216-17\n\n(quoting Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 765) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted),    we   conclude      that    it   is    highly     probable   that    the\n\nadmission of Craig’s out-of-court statement did not contribute\n\nto the jury’s verdict.\n\n                     2.   The Rule 608 and 609 Violations\n\n            Kevin,    however,         was     a    pivotal     figure    in     the\n\nconstruction of Meserve’s defense.                 Not only did Kevin provide\n\nMeserve with an alibi, he also offered testimony that impeached\n\nthe testimony of the government’s star witness, Grant.                          Even\n\nthough there were two additional alibi witnesses -- Overlook and\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fMorissette -- Kevin was the only witness who testified about\n\nGrant’s alleged coaching by the police.\n\n            Although certain impeachment evidence was elicited on\n\ndirect   examination,      such      as    Kevin’s    prior    convictions         for\n\nunlawful    sexual    conduct        and    Kevin    and    Meserve’s      familial\n\nrelationship, the government’s impeachment evidence far exceeded\n\nthat which had already entered the record.                      The government\n\nmanaged, in violation of the rules of evidence, to introduce\n\nevidence of two additional convictions, two prior bad acts for\n\nwhich no conviction resulted, and Kevin’s reputation in the\n\ncommunity    for     violence.            The    cumulative     weight      of     the\n\ngovernment’s impeachment evidence against Kevin was therefore\n\naugmented by the impermissible line of questioning.                       Moreover,\n\nas Meserve’s counsel aptly argued in both his brief and oral\n\nargument,    by    bringing     up    prior      offenses    that   the    defense,\n\ncorrectly    believing        to     be    inadmissible,       would      not     have\n\npreemptively placed before the jury, the government succeeded in\n\nmaking     Kevin    and,   by        association,      his     brother,         appear\n\nunforthcoming.      The impermissible line of questioning therefore\n\nenabled the government to suggest to the jury that Kevin was not\n\nentirely truthful about his criminal history when he testified\n\non direct examination and may have led the jury to conclude that\n\nKevin was an untrustworthy witness.                 This court is entitled to\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\fconclude   that       the   government    set    out    to    impeach   Kevin    by\n\nadmitting evidence of past crimes and a character for violence\n\nand that “the methods which were used [had] the effect which\n\nthey were obviously intended to have.”                 United States v. Ling,\n\n581 F.2d 1118, 1122 (4th Cir. 1978), quoted in United States v.\n\nPisari, 636 F.2d 855, 859-60 (1st Cir. 1981).                      In sum, the\n\nevidence illegitimately elicited by the government regarding\n\nKevin’s prior convictions and character for violence likely\n\nfigured    in     the       jury’s     credibility        determination.\n\n           The harmless error standard, however, requires not that\n\nthe error had an effect on the jury’s evaluation of a single\n\nwitness’s testimony, but rather that the error had an effect on\n\nthe case as a whole.         DeVasto, 658 F.2d at 863.            Thus, if this\n\ncourt can conclude that it is “highly probable” that the jury\n\nwould have convicted Meserve, even had the challenged evidence\n\nbeen excluded, then reversal is not warranted.\n\n           We    do    so   conclude     here.         Most   importantly,      the\n\ncumulative      weight      of   the     evidence       against    Meserve      was\n\nsubstantial, and “[u]nder such circumstances, it would be a\n\nwaste of judicial resources to require a new trial where the\n\nresult is likely to be the same.”                   Rose, 104 F.3d at 1414\n\n(quoting Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d at 543) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).        The government’s case included highly damaging\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\ftestimony by Meserve’s former girlfriend and accomplice, Grant,\n\nwho testified that Meserve planned the robbery, drove with her\n\nto the crime scene, fled the scene with her while discarding\n\npieces of evidence along the roadway, and spoke of the crime\n\nafterwards.       Moreover,       Grant,     although    the     government’s\n\nstrongest witness, was far from the only person to provide\n\nevidence implicating Meserve in the crime.               Specifically, the\n\ngovernment introduced testimony that Meserve had access to the\n\nweapon used in the crime, several witnesses described a man\n\nmeeting     Meserve’s    description,       and   the   weapon     was    found\n\nprecisely where Grant testified that Meserve discarded it.                   In\n\ncontrast, the defense case largely consisted of the testimony of\n\nthree   witnesses      with   a   strong    incentive    to    fabricate     on\n\nMeserve’s     behalf    --    his   mother,       his   brother,    and     his\n\nself-described “best friend.”              And, as discussed above, the\n\nevidence to which Meserve raises an objection was not the sole\n\npiece of impeachment evidence introduced against Kevin.                     The\n\njury also knew about Kevin’s familial relationship with Meserve\n\nand his recent convictions for sexual misconduct.                 Finally, in\n\nthe context of this case, the evidence improperly admitted to\n\nimpeach Kevin is unlikely to have made much of a difference.\n\nGrant, the government’s chief witness, was by her own admission\n\na participant in the crime and was guilty of several prior bad\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\facts    including    stealing      her     grandmother’s        credit   card   and\n\nreceiving welfare benefits illegitimately; John Nicholas, who\n\ntestified about Meserve’s access to the gun used during the\n\nrobbery, had previously been convicted of being a felon in\n\npossession of ammunition and had been served with a search\n\nwarrant to look for marijuana; Robert Vashon, who testified as\n\na rebuttal witness, had been convicted of marijuana trafficking\n\nand rape.       Despite these reasons to discredit the government’s\n\nwitnesses, however, the jury apparently believed their testimony\n\nover that of Meserve’s witnesses.                 Because it cannot be stated\n\n“with    fair    assurance    .    .   .   that    the   judgment    was   .    .    .\n\nsubstantially swayed by the error,” Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 765,\n\nthe government’s violations of Rules 608 and 609 were harmless\n\nand reversal is not warranted on this basis.\n\n                     3.   Cumulative Errors\n\n            Meserve asserts that the cumulative effect of the\n\nerrors to which counsel timely objected, which resulted in the\n\nadmission of evidence that bolstered the credibility of the\n\ngovernment’s      witnesses       while    demeaning      the    credibility        of\n\nMeserve’s witnesses, requires that a new trial be granted.                      See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\f            In Sepulveda, this circuit explicitly accepted the\n\ntheoretical underpinnings of the cumulative error argument.\n\nThis court observed that “[i]ndividual errors, insufficient in\n\nthemselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the aggregate have\n\na more debilitating effect.”           15 F.3d at 1195-96 (citing United\n\nStates v.       Dwyer, 843 F.2d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 1988);                   Dunn v.\n\nPerrin, 570 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1978)).               “[A] column of errors\n\nmay sometimes have a logarithmic effect, producing a total\n\nimpact    greater    than    the    arithmetic   sum     of   its    constituent\n\nparts.”    Id. at 1196.      Among the factors considered in assessing\n\nthe cumulative effect of the errors are “the nature and number\n\nof   errors     committed;    their    interrelationship,           if   any,   and\n\ncombined effect; how the district court dealt with the errors as\n\nthey arose (including the efficacy -- or lack of efficacy -- of\n\nany remedial efforts); and the strength of the government’s\n\ncase.”    Id. (citing United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268,\n\n274 n.4 (1st Cir. 1987)).              To determine whether cumulative\n\nerrors    are    harmless,    we    conduct    the   same     inquiry      as   for\n\nindividual       error,     i.e.,     we     consider     whether        Meserve’s\n\nsubstantial rights were affected.             United States v. Rivera, 900\n\nF.2d 1462, 1470 (10th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (citing United States\n\nv. Kartman, 417 F.2d 893, 894, 898 (9th Cir. 1969)).                     Thus our\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fcumulative error analysis focuses on “the underlying fairness of\n\nthe trial.”       Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 681.\n\n            Meserve’s appeal to the cumulative error doctrine is\n\nunavailing.       The errors committed during Meserve’s trial were\n\nindependent of each other.                   While the admission of Craig’s\n\nout-of-court identification of Meserve as a possible suspect\n\ninvolved    the      government’s          case    in    chief,     the    errors      that\n\noccurred     during         Kevin’s        cross-examination           involved        the\n\nimpeachment     of    but     one    of    Meserve’s      alibi      witnesses.         The\n\ncumulative effect of these errors therefore differs from a\n\nsituation    in      which,    for        example,      each   of    Meserve’s        alibi\n\nwitnesses was impeached by impermissible means.\n\n            Moreover, on the other side of the Sepulveda equation,\n\nthe   government’s      case        was    strong.       In    addition        to   Grant’s\n\ninculpatory testimony, several eye witnesses described a man\n\nfitting Meserve’s description, Meserve was linked to the gun\n\nused during the robbery, and the gun was found in the location\n\nwhere   Grant     stated      Meserve        had   thrown      it.        In    contrast,\n\nMeserve’s defense was weak, consisting of three alibi witnesses\n\nwith an incentive to lie -- Meserve’s mother, brother, and best\n\nfriend -- and speculations about other individuals who could\n\nhave committed the crime.                   Because of the strength of the\n\ngovernment’s case, the errors for which Meserve seeks reversal\n\n\n                                            -42-\n\f“do not come close to achieving the critical mass necessary to\n\ncast a shadow upon the integrity of the verdict.”        Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d at 1196.    In other words, it is highly unlikely, in light\n\nof the substantial evidence implicating Meserve in the crime,\n\nthat the errors committed here, even taken cumulatively, made an\n\nappreciable difference in the outcome of the trial.               E.g.,\n\nMejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274 n.4.      Although in an ideal world\n\nevery defendant would receive a trial free from error, “[t]he\n\nConstitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not\n\nto a mistake-free trial.”      Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1196 (citing\n\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 681; United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d\n\n414, 418 (1st Cir. 1988)).     It would therefore be inappropriate\n\nfor this court to place undue emphasis on the flaws in Meserve’s\n\ntrial   and   “unnecessarily   intervene[]   in   a   process   that   --\n\nalthough imperfect -- adequately protected [Meserve’s] rights.”\n\nUnited States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 321 (1st Cir. 1987).            We\n\ndo, however, note that the errors that occurred here were easily\n\npreventable by government counsel.      None arose in the heat of an\n\nunexpected development at trial; each reflects a deliberate\n\nchoice at trial -- a choice which but slight reflection should\n\nhave indicated was inappropriate. Government counsel especially\n\nbear an individual responsibility to engage in such reflection.\n\nSee Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935) (“The United\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fStates Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party\n\nto a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to\n\ngovern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern\n\nat all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution\n\nis not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be\n\ndone.”).\n\nIII.        Conclusion\n\n            Although errors occurred during the course of Meserve’s\n\ntrial,     these    errors,    considered   both     individually      and\n\ncumulatively,      were   harmless.   Accordingly,    the   judgment    of\n\nconviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\f",

Brian        Eugene       Meserve\n\n(“Meserve”) appeals from his conviction for robbery and firearms\n\noffenses in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMaine.    On appeal, Meserve claims four errors occurred during\n\nthe course of his two-day trial; specifically that (A) the\n\ndistrict court allowed a witness to repeat the out-of-court\n\nstatement of a third party in violation of Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 802, (B) the district court barred the defense from\n\ncross-examining         a     government      witness    about    the       omission    of\n\ncertain    information          stated     at    trial    from    her       grand     jury\n\ntestimony in violation of Meserve’s Sixth Amendment right of\n\nconfrontation, (C) the government used a stale conviction to\n\nimpeach    a    defense       witness    in     violation   of    Federal       Rule    of\n\nEvidence 609(b), and (D) the government cross-examined a defense\n\nwitness    about        his    character        for   violence        and    his    prior\n\nconvictions in violation of Federal Rules of Evidence 608 and\n\n609.      Meserve       further    asserts       that    even    if    these       errors,\n\nconsidered individually, do not necessitate a new trial, the\n\ncumulative effect of the errors cannot be considered harmless.\n\nI.

Josleyn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197023\"><a href=\"/opinion/197023/united-states-v-josleyn/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1185 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996), the facts are as follows:                    At\n\naround 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the robbery, Meserve showed\n\nhis   girlfriend       and     accomplice,    Holly   Grant    (“Grant”),     a\n\nsawed-off shotgun and told her that he was going to rob the\n\nFerris Market.        After nightfall, Meserve and Grant drove to the\n\nFerris Market together in Meserve’s car, where they waited until\n\nthe store became less busy.            Meserve then got out of the car,\n\nwhile Grant stayed behind.\n\n               Meserve, wearing a ski mask and carrying a black bag\n\nand a short gun with a brown handle, entered the Ferris Market.\n\nHe forced Shawna Vashon, an employee, and Sumayah Ferris, the\n\nmother    of    the   owner,    to   the   floor,   and   ordered   Amy   Craig\n\n\n      1Count I of the indictment charged Meserve with the use of\nforce and violence in the commission of a robbery that affected\ncommerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). Count II charged\nMeserve with carrying and using a firearm during and in relation\nto a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C § 924(c). Count\nIII charged Meserve with possession of an unregistered sawed-off\nshotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d). Count IV charged\nMeserve with being a felon in possession of a firearm in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\n                                       -3-\n\f(“Craig”), a second employee, to give him the money in the cash\n\nregister.    Craig handed Meserve everything that was in the cash\n\nregister -- one hundred dollars.                 Meserve then fled from the\n\nstore, passing a customer on his way out of the building.\n\n            When   Meserve    returned      to    the    car   where   Grant   was\n\nwaiting, he told Grant that the robbery was a “piece of cake,”\n\nand that the only problem was that “an old lady gave him a hard\n\ntime.”   During the drive away from the scene, Meserve tossed his\n\ngloves and ski mask, the bag used to carry the money, and the\n\ngun out of the car.      When Meserve and Grant arrived at Meserve’s\n\nmother’s house, he gave Grant his sweatshirt and asked her to\n\nburn it and buried his shoes in the woods.\n\n            Later that evening, Grant and Meserve went to the Chez\n\nParis and the Bob-In, two local bars, where they used the\n\nrobbery proceeds to buy drinks.          While Meserve and Grant were at\n\nthe Chez Paris, Craig came into the bar and Meserve commented to\n\nGrant that Craig was working at the Ferris Market when he robbed\n\nit.   Later that night, when a report about the robbery came on\n\nthe evening news, Meserve remarked to Grant, “If they only\n\nknew.”\n\n            At trial, Grant supplied many of the details about the\n\nrobbery and Meserve’s conduct afterwards.                Although Grant denied\n\nany   knowledge    of   the   crime   when       first    asked   about   it   by\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fDetective Sampson Pomerleau (“Detective Pomerleau”) in October\n\n1998, she later came to an agreement with the government.               Grant\n\nmet with prosecutors several times to go over her grand jury\n\ntestimony and police reports regarding her statements.              She also\n\ndiscussed    the   case    with    Sergeant     Gerard   Madden   (“Sergeant\n\nMadden”), a Maine State Trooper who testified on her behalf at\n\nher child custody proceeding.          Under direct examination, Grant\n\nadmitted to several prior bad acts, including fraudulently using\n\nher   grandmother’s       credit    card   on    multiple   occasions    and\n\nobtaining Aid for Families with Dependent Children after she no\n\nlonger had custody of her child.\n\n            Meserve presented a defense based on alibi and mistaken\n\nidentity. Both Meserve’s mother, Lindsay Overlock (“Overlock”),\n\nand his brother, Kevin Meserve (“Kevin”), testified that he was\n\nat home until a little after 8:00 p.m. on the evening of the\n\nrobbery.    Kevin testified that at approximately 8:10 p.m., he\n\nand Meserve went to the Chez Paris, where they stayed for two\n\nhours before heading to the Bob-In.             Kevin also testified that\n\nhe had seen Grant at the Chez Paris during the last week of\n\nAugust 1999, two months before the trial.                Kevin stated that\n\nGrant was drinking heavily at that time, and complained to him\n\nthat Sergeant Madden had been “keeping tabs on her,” and that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fevery time she met or spoke with Sergeant Madden, he would\n\ninstruct her what to say at trial.\n\n           Meserve’s       other   alibi     witness,    Jane    Morissette\n\n(“Morissette”), a bartender at the Chez Paris, testified that\n\nshe saw Meserve and his brother, Kevin, enter the bar around\n\n8:30 p.m., but that Grant was not with them.              She stated that\n\nlater in the evening, Meserve told her that he was going to the\n\nBob-In with Kevin, and asked her to let Grant know where he was\n\nwhen she arrived.         According to Morissette, Grant entered the\n\nChez Paris shortly thereafter and Morissette told her that\n\nMeserve had gone to the Bob-In.              Morissette testified that\n\nbetween   11:30    p.m.    and   midnight,   a   girl   named   Amy   (Craig)\n\narrived at the Chez Paris.          Morissette overheard Craig tell a\n\nman about a robbery that had occurred earlier that evening at a\n\nstore at which she worked in Vassalboro.\n\n           On October 21, 1999, the jury convicted Meserve on all\n\nfour counts.      Meserve filed a motion for a new trial, which was\n\ndenied on July 20, 2000.            Accordingly, on August 29, 2000,\n\nMeserve was sentenced to concurrent terms of one hundred months\n\nimprisonment on Counts I, III, and IV of the indictment and to\n\na consecutive term of one hundred twenty months on Count II of\n\nthe indictment.\n\nII.

During the government’s case in chief,\n\nDetective Pomerleau was permitted to testify over the objection\n\nof the defense that he drove by Meserve’s house on the night of\n\nthe robbery “to see exactly where the subject was living.”\n\nDetective Pomerleau further testified, again over objection,\n\nthat Meserve became a suspect in the case because he matched the\n\ndescription of the robber and because Craig thought Meserve\n\nmight have been the robber because she knew him.                          Meserve\n\nasserts    that     this     testimony        constitutes    hearsay     and     is\n\ninadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 802.                 The government\n\nargues,    however,       that    the   district   court     admitted    Craig’s\n\nstatement not for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather\n\nto explain why Detective Pomerleau drove by Meserve’s home that\n\nevening.      Meserve counters that the statement was nevertheless\n\ninadmissible because, if not hearsay, the fact that Detective\n\nPomerleau drove by Meserve’s home shortly after the robbery had\n\nno    tendency       to     prove       any     issue   in       the     case.\n\n              Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove\n\nthe   truth    of   the    matter    asserted.

Detective\n\nPomerleau did not discover any evidence or valuable information\n\nduring his drive-by and made no observations pertinent to the\n\ninvestigation; thus, the fact that he went on such a drive has\n\nno “tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or\n\nless probable than it would be without the evidence.”                     Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 401.      Detective Pomerleau’s           motivation for driving by\n\nMeserve’s    home     is    likewise     irrelevant.        In    light    of    the\n\ngovernment’s baldly pretextual basis for the introduction of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCraig’s out-of-court statement, this court is not prepared to\n\nsay   that    the     statement    is    admissible   non-hearsay.     The\n\ngovernment is thus reduced to its claim that the error is\n\nharmless -- a matter considered below.\n\n             B.       Exclusion of Cross-Examination Using Grand Jury\n                      Testimony\n\n             Meserve claims that the district court erred by not\n\nallowing     the    defense   to   cross-examine      Grant   concerning   a\n\ndiscrepancy between her trial testimony and her grand jury\n\ntestimony.        At trial, Grant testified that Craig came into the\n\nChez Paris on the night of the robbery and that Craig’s entrance\n\nprompted Meserve to mention that Craig was working at the store\n\nwhen he robbed it.       In contrast, although Grant testified before\n\nthe grand jury that after the robbery she went to two bars with\n\nMeserve, the Chez Paris and the Bob-In, she never stated that\n\nshe saw Craig at the Chez Paris.              Nor did she mention seeing\n\nCraig that night at the Chez Paris even though, in response to\n\na question as to whether Meserve had recognized any of the\n\nFerris Market’s employees, Grant testified that Meserve told her\n\nthat he recognized a girl named Amy because she was dating a\n\nfriend of theirs.\n\n             When the defense sought to question Grant about why she\n\nhad not mentioned Craig’s presence at the Chez Paris in her\n\ngrand jury testimony, the district court barred this line of\n\n                                        -9-\n\fquestioning because Grant was not specifically asked about the\n\nincident    before   the   grand   jury.       Meserve   argues   that    this\n\nrestriction on Grant’s cross-examination violated his rights\n\nunder the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.                   E.g.,\n\nDelaware v.

Before the\n\ngrand jury, Grant was not asked whether she remembered anyone\n\ncoming into the Chez Paris on the night of the crime nor whether\n\nshe saw any of the victims of the crime at any point.                    Although\n\nMeserve argues that questions about whether Meserve recognized\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fany of the workers at the Ferris Market and about Grant and\n\nMeserve’s activities after they went to the Chez Paris should\n\nhave prompted Grant to mention that she saw Craig at the Chez\n\nParis that night, such nuances are peripheral and not directly\n\ninconsistent.             Thus,      the    district          court    did    not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by refusing to allow Grant to be questioned about her\n\nprior     omission.                 The     right        to     confrontation         through\n\ncross-examination is not unlimited.                       A district court has “wide\n\nlatitude       .     .    .    to    impose       reasonable          limits    on    .     .    .\n\ncross-examination based on concerns about . . . interrogation\n\nthat is repetitive or only marginally relevant.”                               Van Arsdall,\n\n475 U.S. at 679.              The district court appropriately exercised its\n\nauthority under the circumstances of this case.\n\n               C.         Impeachment by Stale Conviction\n\n               Meserve         argues      that    the    district       court       erred      by\n\nallowing the government to use a conviction for theft that was\n\nover twenty years old to impeach Morissette.                                 The government\n\nraises three counter-arguments:                          First, as Meserve did not\n\ncontemporaneously object to the question, the issue was not\n\npreserved for appeal.               Second, because Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n609     does        not   render          such     impeachment         evidence       per       se\n\ninadmissible, the lack of an objection deprived the district\n\ncourt of the opportunity to make the appropriate rulings with\n\n\n                                                 -12-\n\frespect to its admissibility.               Third, even if error occurred, it\n\nwas harmless.\n\n                 Meserve     concedes        that    he     failed      to   make     a\n\ncontemporaneous          objection      at     the     time       of    Morissette’s\n\ncross-examination.

Thus, the “plainness” of the error cannot\n\nbe established on the current record.\n\n            And even if, by some stretch, this court were to\n\nconclude that the admission of a conviction over ten years old\n\nas impeachment evidence under the circumstances of this case\n\nconstituted plain error, Meserve cannot satisfy his burden of\n\nshowing    that   the   error     “seriously    affect[ed]   the   fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of [the] judicial proceeding[],”\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fJohnson, 520 U.S. at 469 (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 736)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

The government counters that\n\nMeserve failed to preserve these issues for review and that any\n\nerrors   that   may       have   occurred       were       harmless,   given    the\n\ncumulative weight of the evidence against Meserve.\n\n                     1.

Because of\n\nthe vehemence with which the government argues a position with\n\nno seeming support in the law, this court pauses to discuss the\n\nobligations placed on each of the parties to a trial by the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence.\n\n          It is a basic tenet of our law that in order to\n\npreserve an evidentiary issue for review, the party opposing the\n\nadmission of the evidence must make a timely objection.

Meserve’s       objection,\n\nalthough delayed, was sufficiently contemporaneous to comport\n\nwith the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n             The government attempts to place an additional onus on\n\nparties opposing the admission of such evidence, however, by\n\narguing that the defense was further obligated to move to strike\n\nKevin’s    answers     to    the   government’s       questions    in    order    to\n\npreserve      Meserve’s      right      to   review.      According       to     the\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fgovernment, once a question has been answered, even if that\n\nanswer was provided pursuant to a district court’s evidentiary\n\nruling, the proper procedural vehicle to preserve rights for\n\nappeal is the motion to strike.   The government was able to cite\n\nno authority for this proposition during oral argument and the\n\ncourt has found none.2\n\n           The rule governing objections to evidence states that\n\n“error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or\n\nexcludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is\n\naffected, and . . . [i]n case the ruling is one admitting\n\nevidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of\n\nrecord.”   Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1) (emphasis added).     Because\n\nRule 103 is written in the disjunctive, the right to review may\n\nbe preserved either by objecting or by moving to strike and\n\noffering specific grounds in support of that motion.    The rule\n\nis intended to ensure that the nature of an error was called to\n\nthe attention of the trial judge, so as to “alert him to the\n\nproper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take\n\n\n\n    2  The case thrice cited in the government’s brief, United\nStates v.

Far from placing an\nadditional obligation on parties to move to strike, this case\nmerely states that because the appellants neither objected to\nthe admission of the challenged testimony at trial nor moved to\nstrike the testimony, the court was foreclosed from considering\nthe issue on appeal absent plain error. Id. at 853 n.5.\n\n                              -23-\n\fproper corrective measures.”               Fed. R. Evid. 103(a) advisory\n\ncommittee’s note.        Thus, both the plain language and underlying\n\ngoals   of    Rule    103(a)    indicate     that   a   party   opposing   the\n\nadmission     of     evidence   may   do    so   through   either   a   timely\n\nobjection or motion to strike.3\n\n             Moreover, the position espoused by the government is\n\ncontrary to logic.          According to the government, even if a\n\nwitness’s answer was given pursuant to a district court’s order\n\noverruling an objection, the party opposing admission of the\n\nevidence must move to strike the witness’s answer to escape\n\nplain error review.         Modern trial practice is unreceptive to\n\nsuch procedural redundancies, and were this court to adopt the\n\ngovernment’s view, it would take several steps back from the\n\nstreamlining that the Judicial Conference, the Supreme Court,\n\nand the Congress attempted to accomplish through the enactment\n\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975.                  Because the law\n\nimposes no obligation on a party opposing the admission of\n\nevidence both to object and to move to strike, Meserve’s timely\n\nobjections were sufficient to preserve his rights for review.\n\n\n\n    3  If a party does not challenge the evidence in a timely\nmanner, however, an after-the-fact motion to strike usually\ncannot “repair the forfeiture that flows from the failure to\ninterpose a contemporaneous objection.” A.J.

According to the government, “[n]o answer to the\n\nchallenged question having been given, no evidence was admitted,\n\nand thus there is no error to correct.”               This position is\n\nwithout support in the law.\n\n            No court has ever held that review is forestalled if\n\na witness does not answer a question posed or answers that\n\nquestion with a response favorable to the objecting party.\n\nAlthough    the   government   cites    two   cases    to   support    this\n\nproposition, United States v.

Pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 609(a):\n\n                  For the purpose of       attacking   the\n           credibility of a witness,\n\n                  (1) evidence that a witness other than\n           an accused has been convicted of a crime\n           shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if\n           the  crime   was   punishable   by   .  .   .\n           imprisonment in excess of one year under the\n           law under which the witness was convicted,\n           and evidence that an accused has been\n           convicted of such a crime shall be admitted\n           if the court determines that the probative\n           value of admitting this evidence outweighs\n           its prejudicial effect to the accused; and\n\n                  (2) evidence that any witness has been\n           convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it\n           involved dishonesty or false statement,\n           regardless of the punishment.\n\nId.     Thus, the government could only inquire about Kevin’s\n\nconvictions for disorderly conduct and assault if the crimes\n\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fwere punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year\n\nor involved dishonesty or false statement.\n\n            Under Maine law, disorderly conduct is a Class E crime,\n\nMe.

Because the sentences for\n\nthese    crimes   do    not   exceed    one    year,      Meserve    argues    that\n\nevidence of these crimes is per se inadmissible under Rule\n\n609(a)(1).    In opposition, the government asserts that assault\n\nis not always a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for less\n\nthan one year in Maine; section 207(2) provides that when the\n\nperpetrator is at least eighteen years of age and the assault\n\nproduced bodily injury to a child under six years of age, the\n\ncrime is classified as a Class C crime, punishable by a prison\n\nterm of up to five years.         Id. § 207(2).\n\n            The record before this court does not resolve the\n\nquestion    whether     Kevin’s   assault      conviction      was    for    bodily\n\ninjury to a child less than six, an omission for which the\n\ngovernment    blames     Meserve:      “[I]t   is   Meserve’s       failure    [to]\n\ndevelop a record that leaves this court with inadequate facts to\n\nresolve the issue definitively.”              Through this simple sentence,\n\nthe     government     attempts   to     shift      the    burden    of     proving\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fadmissibility        from   the   proponent          of   evidence    to   the   party\n\nopposing the admission of the evidence.\n\n             It is a principle too simple to seem to need stating,\n\nhowever, that the government, as the party seeking to introduce\n\nevidence of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes under\n\nRule   609,    was    obligated        to    have     researched      Kevin’s    prior\n\noffenses and to have determined that they were admissible.\n\nE.g., 1 Wigmore, supra § 17.                  Upon Meserve’s challenge, the\n\ngovernment should have been prepared to produce to the district\n\ncourt concrete proof that Kevin had been convicted of a crime\n\npunishable by more than one year within the previous ten years.\n\nAdmittedly,     the    government       may        have   been   in   possession    of\n\nprecisely such proof, and merely failed to produce it because\n\nthe district court did not demand it upon Meserve’s objection.\n\nEven   so,    the    failure      of   the     district     court     to   press   the\n\ngovernment on this issue does not shift the burden to Meserve.\n\n             Nor do the convictions for disorderly conduct and\n\nassault introduced by the government against Kevin fall within\n\nRule 609(a)(2), as the legislative history of the rule makes\n\nclear:\n\n             [T]he   phrase    “dishonesty   and   false\n             statement” . . . means crimes such as\n             perjury or subornation of perjury, false\n             statement, criminal fraud, embezzlement, or\n             false pretense, or any other offense in the\n             nature of crimen falsi, the commission of\n\n                                            -30-\n\f            which involves some element of deceit,\n            untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on\n            the   accused's   propensity   to   testify\n            truthfully.\n\nH.R.

Thus, the government bore a further\nobligation, which it does not appear to have satisfied, to\nprovide notice to the defense of its intent to introduce\nevidence of the conviction and to show that this evidence was\nmore probative than prejudicial.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fFederal Rule of Evidence 608.     The government counters that it\nwas entitled\n\nto introduce evidence that Kevin had previously been involved in\n\nfights as impeachment by contradiction following Kevin’s denial\n\nthat he was a “tough guy.”\n\n          Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 608(a):\n\n          The credibility of a witness may be attacked\n          or supported by evidence in the form of\n          opinion or reputation, but subject to these\n          limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only\n          to    character    for    truthfulness    or\n          untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful\n          character is admissible only after the\n          character of the witness for truthfulness\n          has been attacked by opinion or reputation\n          evidence or otherwise.\n\nId.   The government’s questions about Kevin’s status as a “tough\n\nguy” and his reputation in the community for violence were\n\ncompletely    irrelevant   on   the     facts    here    to    this   jury’s\n\ncredibility   determination.      Even     if,   as     suggested     by   the\n\ngovernment at trial, people in the community were afraid of\n\nKevin because he was an “assaultive person,” this has no bearing\n\non Kevin’s credibility as a witness, given the issues in this\n\ncase.   No other theory of admissibility is offered.\n\n          As the government’s questions about Kevin being a\n\n“tough guy” were impermissible, they cannot serve as a launching\n\npad for the admission of additional evidence.                 Moreover, the\n\ngovernment’s questions about Kevin’s involvement in a couple of\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\ffights are impermissible in their own right.             Under Rule 608(b):\n\n\n\n            Specific instances of the conduct of a\n            witness . . . . may . . . in the discretion\n            of the court, if probative of truthfulness\n            or untruthfulness, be inquired into on\n            cross-examination of the witness . . .\n            concerning   the  witness’   character  for\n            truthfulness or untruthfulness . . . .\n\nId.   The specific instances of prior conduct about which the\n\ngovernment questioned Kevin bore no relation whatsoever to his\n\ncharacter    for    truthfulness      or   untruthfulness.      As    Meserve\n\ncorrectly    states,       the   government     wanted   to   suggest,      and\n\nsucceeded in suggesting, that Kevin was a man with a violent\n\ndisposition.\n\n            E.       Harmless Error?\n\n            Since we conclude that the district court erred in\n\nadmitting evidence against Meserve violative of Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence 608, 609, and 802, the government perforce is reduced\n\nto    arguing      that     these     errors,   both     individually       and\n\ncollectively, were “harmless.”             Fed.

The Hearsay Evidence\n\n            Detective Pomerleau’s statement that Craig identified\n\nMeserve as a possible suspect in the case was not itself central\n\nto the case, as it was less damaging than the properly admitted\n\ntestimony of other witnesses, including Craig, whose statements\n\ndirectly implicated Meserve in the robbery.                   At worst, the jury\n\nmay have credited the testimony of these witnesses somewhat more\n\nbecause     of    Detective      Pomerleau’s         repetition     of    Craig’s\n\nout-of-court statement.           The weight of the government’s case\n\nagainst Meserve was such, however, that Craig’s out-of-court\n\nstatement was but a small         contribution to the font of evidence.\n\n“[A]fter    pondering     all    that    happened     without     stripping      the\n\nerroneous action from the whole,” Mazza, 792 F.2d at 1216-17\n\n(quoting Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 765) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted),    we   conclude      that    it   is    highly     probable   that    the\n\nadmission of Craig’s out-of-court statement did not contribute\n\nto the jury’s verdict.\n\n                     2.   The Rule 608 and 609 Violations\n\n            Kevin,    however,         was     a    pivotal     figure    in     the\n\nconstruction of Meserve’s defense.                 Not only did Kevin provide\n\nMeserve with an alibi, he also offered testimony that impeached\n\nthe testimony of the government’s star witness, Grant.                          Even\n\nthough there were two additional alibi witnesses -- Overlook and\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fMorissette -- Kevin was the only witness who testified about\n\nGrant’s alleged coaching by the police.\n\n            Although certain impeachment evidence was elicited on\n\ndirect   examination,      such      as    Kevin’s    prior    convictions         for\n\nunlawful    sexual    conduct        and    Kevin    and    Meserve’s      familial\n\nrelationship, the government’s impeachment evidence far exceeded\n\nthat which had already entered the record.                      The government\n\nmanaged, in violation of the rules of evidence, to introduce\n\nevidence of two additional convictions, two prior bad acts for\n\nwhich no conviction resulted, and Kevin’s reputation in the\n\ncommunity    for     violence.            The    cumulative     weight      of     the\n\ngovernment’s impeachment evidence against Kevin was therefore\n\naugmented by the impermissible line of questioning.                       Moreover,\n\nas Meserve’s counsel aptly argued in both his brief and oral\n\nargument,    by    bringing     up    prior      offenses    that   the    defense,\n\ncorrectly    believing        to     be    inadmissible,       would      not     have\n\npreemptively placed before the jury, the government succeeded in\n\nmaking     Kevin    and,   by        association,      his     brother,         appear\n\nunforthcoming.      The impermissible line of questioning therefore\n\nenabled the government to suggest to the jury that Kevin was not\n\nentirely truthful about his criminal history when he testified\n\non direct examination and may have led the jury to conclude that\n\nKevin was an untrustworthy witness.                 This court is entitled to\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\fconclude   that       the   government    set    out    to    impeach   Kevin    by\n\nadmitting evidence of past crimes and a character for violence\n\nand that “the methods which were used [had] the effect which\n\nthey were obviously intended to have.”                 United States v.

In sum, the\n\nevidence illegitimately elicited by the government regarding\n\nKevin’s prior convictions and character for violence likely\n\nfigured    in     the       jury’s     credibility        determination.\n\n           The harmless error standard, however, requires not that\n\nthe error had an effect on the jury’s evaluation of a single\n\nwitness’s testimony, but rather that the error had an effect on\n\nthe case as a whole.         DeVasto, 658 F.2d at 863.            Thus, if this\n\ncourt can conclude that it is “highly probable” that the jury\n\nwould have convicted Meserve, even had the challenged evidence\n\nbeen excluded, then reversal is not warranted.\n\n           We    do    so   conclude     here.         Most   importantly,      the\n\ncumulative      weight      of   the     evidence       against    Meserve      was\n\nsubstantial, and “[u]nder such circumstances, it would be a\n\nwaste of judicial resources to require a new trial where the\n\nresult is likely to be the same.”                   Rose, 104 F.3d at 1414\n\n(quoting Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d at 543) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).        The government’s case included highly damaging\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\ftestimony by Meserve’s former girlfriend and accomplice, Grant,\n\nwho testified that Meserve planned the robbery, drove with her\n\nto the crime scene, fled the scene with her while discarding\n\npieces of evidence along the roadway, and spoke of the crime\n\nafterwards.       Moreover,       Grant,     although    the     government’s\n\nstrongest witness, was far from the only person to provide\n\nevidence implicating Meserve in the crime.               Specifically, the\n\ngovernment introduced testimony that Meserve had access to the\n\nweapon used in the crime, several witnesses described a man\n\nmeeting     Meserve’s    description,       and   the   weapon     was    found\n\nprecisely where Grant testified that Meserve discarded it.                   In\n\ncontrast, the defense case largely consisted of the testimony of\n\nthree   witnesses      with   a   strong    incentive    to    fabricate     on\n\nMeserve’s     behalf    --    his   mother,       his   brother,    and     his\n\nself-described “best friend.”              And, as discussed above, the\n\nevidence to which Meserve raises an objection was not the sole\n\npiece of impeachment evidence introduced against Kevin.                     The\n\njury also knew about Kevin’s familial relationship with Meserve\n\nand his recent convictions for sexual misconduct.                 Finally, in\n\nthe context of this case, the evidence improperly admitted to\n\nimpeach Kevin is unlikely to have made much of a difference.\n\nGrant, the government’s chief witness, was by her own admission\n\na participant in the crime and was guilty of several prior bad\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\facts    including    stealing      her     grandmother’s        credit   card   and\n\nreceiving welfare benefits illegitimately; John Nicholas, who\n\ntestified about Meserve’s access to the gun used during the\n\nrobbery, had previously been convicted of being a felon in\n\npossession of ammunition and had been served with a search\n\nwarrant to look for marijuana; Robert Vashon, who testified as\n\na rebuttal witness, had been convicted of marijuana trafficking\n\nand rape.       Despite these reasons to discredit the government’s\n\nwitnesses, however, the jury apparently believed their testimony\n\nover that of Meserve’s witnesses.                 Because it cannot be stated\n\n“with    fair    assurance    .    .   .   that    the   judgment    was   .    .    .\n\nsubstantially swayed by the error,” Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 765,\n\nthe government’s violations of Rules 608 and 609 were harmless\n\nand reversal is not warranted on this basis.\n\n                     3.   Cumulative Errors\n\n            Meserve asserts that the cumulative effect of the\n\nerrors to which counsel timely objected, which resulted in the\n\nadmission of evidence that bolstered the credibility of the\n\ngovernment’s      witnesses       while    demeaning      the    credibility        of\n\nMeserve’s witnesses, requires that a new trial be granted.

Among the factors considered in assessing\n\nthe cumulative effect of the errors are “the nature and number\n\nof   errors     committed;    their    interrelationship,           if   any,   and\n\ncombined effect; how the district court dealt with the errors as\n\nthey arose (including the efficacy -- or lack of efficacy -- of\n\nany remedial efforts); and the strength of the government’s\n\ncase.”    Id.

Kartman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"287056\"><a href=\"/opinion/287056/united-states-v-edwin-affron-kartman/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 894, 898 (9th Cir. 1969)).                     Thus our\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fcumulative error analysis focuses on “the underlying fairness of\n\nthe trial.”       Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 681.\n\n            Meserve’s appeal to the cumulative error doctrine is\n\nunavailing.       The errors committed during Meserve’s trial were\n\nindependent of each other.                   While the admission of Craig’s\n\nout-of-court identification of Meserve as a possible suspect\n\ninvolved    the      government’s          case    in    chief,     the    errors      that\n\noccurred     during         Kevin’s        cross-examination           involved        the\n\nimpeachment     of    but     one    of    Meserve’s      alibi      witnesses.         The\n\ncumulative effect of these errors therefore differs from a\n\nsituation    in      which,    for        example,      each   of    Meserve’s        alibi\n\nwitnesses was impeached by impermissible means.\n\n            Moreover, on the other side of the Sepulveda equation,\n\nthe   government’s      case        was    strong.       In    addition        to   Grant’s\n\ninculpatory testimony, several eye witnesses described a man\n\nfitting Meserve’s description, Meserve was linked to the gun\n\nused during the robbery, and the gun was found in the location\n\nwhere   Grant     stated      Meserve        had   thrown      it.        In    contrast,\n\nMeserve’s defense was weak, consisting of three alibi witnesses\n\nwith an incentive to lie -- Meserve’s mother, brother, and best\n\nfriend -- and speculations about other individuals who could\n\nhave committed the crime.                   Because of the strength of the\n\ngovernment’s case, the errors for which Meserve seeks reversal\n\n\n                                            -42-\n\f“do not come close to achieving the critical mass necessary to\n\ncast a shadow upon the integrity of the verdict.”        Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d at 1196.    In other words, it is highly unlikely, in light\n\nof the substantial evidence implicating Meserve in the crime,\n\nthat the errors committed here, even taken cumulatively, made an\n\nappreciable difference in the outcome of the trial.               E.g.,\n\nMejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274 n.4.      Although in an ideal world\n\nevery defendant would receive a trial free from error, “[t]he\n\nConstitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not\n\nto a mistake-free trial.”      Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1196 (citing\n\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 681; United States v. Polito, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511568\"><a href=\"/opinion/511568/united-states-v-john-d-polito/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (1st Cir. 1988)).     It would therefore be inappropriate\n\nfor this court to place undue emphasis on the flaws in Meserve’s\n\ntrial   and   “unnecessarily   intervene[]   in   a   process   that   --\n\nalthough imperfect -- adequately protected [Meserve’s] rights.”\n\nUnited States v. Glantz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482473\"><a href=\"/opinion/482473/united-states-v-ronald-h-glantz-and-anthony-j-bucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (1st Cir. 1987).            We\n\ndo, however, note that the errors that occurred here were easily\n\npreventable by government counsel.      None arose in the heat of an\n\nunexpected development at trial; each reflects a deliberate\n\nchoice at trial -- a choice which but slight reflection should\n\nhave indicated was inappropriate. Government counsel especially\n\nbear an individual responsibility to engage in such reflection.\n\nSee Berger v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102436\"><a href=\"/opinion/102436/berger-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (1935) (“The United\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fStates Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party\n\nto a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to\n\ngovern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern\n\nat all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution\n\nis not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be\n\ndone.”).\n\nIII.        Conclusion\n\n            Although errors occurred during the course of Meserve’s\n\ntrial,     these    errors,    considered   both     individually      and\n\ncumulatively,      were   harmless.   Accordingly,    the   judgment    of\n\nconviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -44-\n\f</pre>",
