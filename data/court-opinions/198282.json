This appeal requires us to revisit\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.  1346(b), 2671-\n2680, and, in particular, its discretionary function exception, 28\nU.S.C.  2680(a).  We conclude that the district court applied the\nexception impeccably and appropriately granted summary judgment on\nthat basis.\nThe facts, insofar as they pertain to the issues on\nappeal, are uncomplicated.  Upon departing the Hubbell Trading\nPost, a national historic site in Ganado, Arizona, through the so-\ncalled \"Northern Exit,\" plaintiff-appellant Nettie Shansky tripped\nover an antique wooden threshold and tumbled down a short flight of\nsteps.  She sustained serious personal injuries in the fall.\nThe Trading Post was originally built in the late 1800s. \nThe National Park Service acquired it in 1967 and rehabilitated it\nthree years later with a view toward preserving its authenticity. \nShansky maintains that, when the Park Service refurbished the\nTrading Post, it should have installed a handrail at the Northern\nExit.  She brought an FTCA suit against the United States on this\ntheory, and, although she did not amend her complaint, she later\nexpanded her thesis to include an allegation that the Park Service\nalso failed to post adequate warning signs at or near the Northern\nExit.\nThe FTCA is a limited waiver of the federal government's\nsovereign immunity.  Congress has prescribed a number of situations\nin which the waiver will not attach.  See 28 U.S.C.  2680.  One\nrelates to claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the\nfailure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on\nthe part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government,\nwhether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"  28 U.S.C.\n2680(a).  Invoking this discretionary function exception, the\ngovernment sought brevis disposition.  The district court obliged. \nShansky then prosecuted this appeal.  We review de novo the lower\ncourt's determination that the discretionary function exception\ncontrols.  See Irving v. United States,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir.\n1998) (en banc) [No. 96-2368, slip op. at 15].\nA familiar analytic framework governs the discretionary\nfunction inquiry.  An inquiring court first must identify the\nconduct that allegedly caused the harm.  See id. at     [slip op.\nat 15-16].  Here, Shansky spotlights the Park Service's\ndecisionmaking during the Trading Post's rehabilitation in 1970 as\nthe culpable conduct, claiming that the Park Service abjured\nobvious safety measures.  The  issue, then, is whether this conduct\nis of the nature and quality that Congress, in crafting the\ndiscretionary function exception, sought to shelter from tort\nliability.  That issue encompasses two questions:  Is the conduct\nitself discretionary?  If so, is the discretion susceptible to\npolicy-related judgments?  See United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S.\n315, 322-23 (1991);  Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536-\n37 (1988); Irving,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 15-16].\n             Is the Conduct Discretionary?\nShansky endeavors to end the inquiry at the initial stage\nby showing that the Park Service had no discretion because existing\npolicy mandated that it install handrails and warning signs when it\nrefurbished the premises.  She finds succor in a broadly worded\nexpression of a general policy goal contained in the Park Service's\noperating manual to the effect that \"[t]he saving of human life\nwill take precedence over all other management actions.\"  National\nPark Service, NPS-28: Cultural Resource Management Guidelines(Guidelines) 46 (July, 1994).  But this passage does not\nspecifically prescribe that any particular safety measure be\nemployed at any particular place or in any particular facility.  To\nthe contrary, it suggests that the Park Service and its\nfunctionaries will have to make discretionary judgments about how\nto apply concretely the aspirational goal embedded in the\nstatement.  Accord Tippett v. United States, 108 F.3d 1194, 1197\n(10th Cir. 1997).  Statements made at this level of generality do\nnot satisfy Gaubert's and Berkovitz's specific prescription\nrequirement.  Were the law otherwise, the discretionary function\nexception would be a dead letter.\nThe surrounding context in which the cited statement\nappears buttresses this conclusion.  Shansky plucks the statement\nfrom the Guidelines' description of park stewardship   but the\nparagraph in which the words appear goes on to note that, even\nthough the saving of human life is a priority, Park Service policy\n\"recognize[s] that public use of park resources sometimes involves\nelements of risk\" and also \"recognize[s] the need for management\nactions to limit risk to acceptable levels, consistent with\nacceptable levels of impact on cultural resources.\"  Guidelines at\n46.  Consequently, the Guidelines, read as a whole, reinforce the\nview that Park Service management has discretion to determine which\nrisks are \"acceptable,\" and thus to balance, at some level,\nconcerns for human safety against concerns for preserving the\noriginal qualities of a cultural resource.\nShansky next argues, in a related vein, that the Park\nService, at the expense of historic authenticity, took other steps\nto make the Trading Post safe (for example, it replaced uneven\nfloorboards during the reconstruction); and that, having opted for\nsafety in these respects, the Park Service was somehow obliged to\ndo more with the Northern Exit.  This argument lacks force. \nShansky's reference to other safety devices proves nothing, because\nthe Guidelines, which did not specifically require the Park Service\nto install handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit (or at\nany other comparable place, for that matter), gave the Park Service\ndiscretion to make precisely the kind of judgments that Shansky now\nassails (balancing competing considerations and opting for safety\nover authenticity in some applications, but not in others).\nThe only other evidence of a mandatory policy that\nShansky proffers is a Park Service official's response to a\nquestion posed at his deposition.  The questioner asked the\ndeponent whether he \"would agree that the National Park Service\npolicies and regulations required [the Park Service] to identify\ndangers to the public,\" and the deponent responded affirmatively. \nFrom this slender reed, Shansky tries to build an argument that the\nPark Service adopted a binding policy to install handrails and\nwarning signs at the Northern Exit.  Setting to one side the\nrampant ambiguities inherent in the question and answer, the\nargument fails because Shansky has shown merely a Park Service\nofficial's unsubstantiated recollection of an unidentified policy\nstatement.  Although a government official's testimony about the\nsubstance of a putative policy sometimes may assist a court's\nunderstanding of agency practice, see, e.g., Kelly v. United\nStates, 924 F.2d 355, 360-61 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that an\nagency official's testimony may be used to aid a court in\ndeciphering ambiguous regulations and guidelines), testimony that\npurports to describe written policies and regulations is no\nsubstitute for the original text.  See  Valdez v. United States, 56\nF.3d 1177, 1179-80 (9th Cir. 1995); cf. Irving,     F.3d at   \n[slip op. at 29] (explaining that if a witness' statements are\noffered to show an agency's policy, the witness must, at a minimum,\nreconcile his understanding with the agency's more formal\nexpressions of policy).\nFor these reasons, we find that the challenged conduct is\ndiscretionary.\n            Is the Discretion Policy-Driven?\nWe turn next to the second half of the Gaubert test.  On\nthis score, Shansky asseverates that the Park Service's actions,\neven if discretionary, were not policy-driven.  Because the law\npresumes that the exercise of official discretion implicates policy\njudgments, Shansky cannot prevail on this argument unless she\ndemonstrates that the decision to forgo handrails and warning signs\nwas not susceptible to policy analysis.  See Gaubert, 499 U.S. at\n325; Irving,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 31-32].\nShansky's effort to make the requisite showing emphasizes\nthe actual decisionmaking that went into the 1970 retrofitting of\nthe Trading Post.  She insists that nobody in the Park Service\nperceived that the Northern Exit posed a danger and, thus, no one\nthought about installing handrails or warning signs.  Shansky\nrenewed this emphasis at oral argument, repeatedly asserting that\nthe discretionary function defense should topple solely because\nPark Service officials \"failed to consider\" the safety issues of\nwhich she complains.\nAlthough Shansky marshals some evidence to support her\nclaim   the Park Service apparently did not explicitly consider the\nsafety vel non of the Northern Exit in 1970   her fact-based\nexegesis is beside the point.  The subjective intent of government\nofficials is irrelevant to the discretionary function analysis. \nSee Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325; Irving,     F.3d at     [slip op. at\n29].  It is therefore of no practical consequence that Park Service\nofficials failed to mull particular safety issues when they planned\nthe Trading Post's rehabilitation.  See Gotha v. United States, 115\nF.3d 176, 180 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"The test is not whether the\ngovernment actually considered each possible alternative in the\nuniverse of options, but whether the conduct was of the type\nassociated with the exercise of official discretion.\") (citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted); Kiehn v. United States, 984\nF.2d 1100, 1105 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that \"it is unnecessary\nfor government employees to make an actual 'conscious decision'\nregarding policy factors\" for it is \"irrelevant whether the alleged\nfailure . . . was a matter of 'deliberate choice,' or a mere\noversight\") (citations omitted); United States v. Richardson, 943\nF.2d 1107, 1111 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that the \"discretionary\nfunction exception may apply 'in the absence of a conscious\ndecision'\") (citation omitted).  In fine, an inquiring court need\nnot ask whether government actors decided the point explicitly or\nactually discussed it, for the inquiry hinges instead on whether\nsome plausible policy justification could have undergirded the\nchallenged conduct.  The critical question is whether the acts or\nomissions that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a\npolicy-driven analysis, not whether they were the end product of a\npolicy-driven analysis.  See Rosebush v. United States, 119 F.3d\n438, 444 (6th Cir. 1997).\nLet us be perfectly clear.  We do not suggest that any\nconceivable policy justification will suffice to prime the\ndiscretionary function pump.  Virtually any government action can\nbe traced back to a policy decision of some kind, but an attenuated\ntie is not enough to show that conduct is grounded in policy.  SeeCope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445, 448-49 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  Withal, the\ndetermination as to where one draws the line between a\njustification that is too far removed, or too ethereal, or both,\nand one that is not, is case-specific, and not subject to\nresolution by the application of mathematically precise formulae. \nIn particular, there is no principled basis for superimposing a\ngeneralized \"safety exception\" upon the discretionary function\ndefense.  A case-by-case approach is required.\nOf course, case-by-case development has led to some\ndisarray.  Compare George v. United States, 735 F. Supp. 1524,\n1533-34 (M.D. Ala. 1990) (holding that a government agency's\nfailure to warn about submerged alligators has no policy basis)\nwith Tippett, 108 F.3d at 1197-99 (holding that a failure to warn\nor otherwise abate the dangers associated with a charging moose is\ngrounded in policy); compare also Cope, 45 F.3d at 451-52\n(concluding that the discretionary function defense did not vitiate\nan alleged failure to warn about hazardous road conditions) withRich v. United States, 119 F.3d 447, 451-52 (6th Cir. 1997)\n(concluding that the discretionary function defense trumped an\nalleged failure to warn about hazardous road conditions), cert.denied, 118 S. Ct. 1364 (1998).  These pererrations cause us to\ndespair of reconciling all the cases.  Be that as it may, the\ndecisional law yields several unifying principles that inform our\nanalysis and shed sufficient light to remove this case from the\ngray area that suffuses this corner of the law.\nHere, the government's ultimate policy justification is\nthat forgoing handrails and warning signs at the Northern Exit was\nthe product of a broader judgment call that favored aesthetics over\nsafety.  Aesthetic considerations, including decisions to preserve\nthe historical accuracy of national landmarks, constitute\nlegitimate policy concerns.  See Chantal v. United States, 104 F.3d\n207, 212-13 (8th Cir. 1997); Kiehn, 984 F.2d at 1104-05.  Indeed,\nShansky does not seriously contest the legitimacy of aesthetic\nconsiderations as an abstract matter.  Instead, her main theme  \nwith a few variations, as we shall see   is that when safety\nbecomes an issue, all else must yield.  We cannot embrace so\nsweeping a proposition.  See Irving,     F.3d at     n.13 [slip op.\nat 34 n.13] (warning courts to hesitate before imposing a principle\nof zero tolerance for any kind of risk, absent an express\ncongressional or administrative command).\nCongress instructed the Park Service to endeavor \"to\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects\" of the\nproperty in its charge \"and to provide for the enjoyment of the\nsame in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired\nfor the enjoyment of future generations.\"  16 U.S.C.  1.  At the\nvery least, this means that the Park Service may balance aesthetic\nconcerns with those of visitor safety in reaching planning\ndecisions, and that safety concerns will not automatically eclipse\nall other policy considerations.  See Chantal, 104 F.3d at 212;\nKiehn, 984 F.2d at 1104.  There is nothing anomalous about this\nsort of balancing.  We live in a world of incommensurable, often\nconflicting values.  Some might prefer to sacrifice history to\nprevent even infinitesimal risks, whereas others might accept some\nhazards in order to preserve historical artifacts in a pristine\nstate.  It would be a much more convenient world if we had a single\nmetric with which to measure, and thereby prioritize, all values  \nbut as long as that luxury eludes us, we must rely upon\npolicymakers to reconcile the ensuing conflicts.\nIn this instance, the statutory scheme empowers the Park\nService to balance incommensurable values such as safety and\naesthetics, and the Judicial Branch is ill-equipped to rework that\nbalance.  See United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio\nGrandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797, 814 (1984); Chantal, 104\nF.3d at 212.  We think it follows that inquiries into whether a\ndiscretionary act is policy-driven cannot be short-circuited simply\nby raising the specter of a general safety exception.\nIn a more refined version of the same argument, Shansky\npoints to the Park Service's installation of sprinklers, an alarm\nsystem, fire extinguishers, and the like in the reconstructed\nTrading Post and posits that, once the Park Service decided to\neffectuate some modern safety measures, it became obliged to take\nall feasible safety measures.  To support this thesis, Shansky\nrelies primarily on the discussion of a \"failure to warn\" claim in\nCope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  We believe that\nShansky loads more on Cope than Cope can bear.\nCope involved, inter alia, claims asserting negligence in\nthe construction, maintenance, and installation of warnings\nrelating to Beach Drive, a road administered by the Park Service. \nCope, an accident victim, claimed, among other things, that the\nPark Service's failure to install proper warnings at important\npoints along the road caused his misfortune.  Despite the Park\nService's protests, the record showed that it had treated Beach\nDrive as a commuter road, not a scenic drive; that it had installed\nnumerous traffic devices and signs at frequent intervals along the\nroad (including two \"slippery when wet\" signs in the immediate area\nin which the accident occurred); and that it had erected the signs\nin accordance with the manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices\n(the Manual).  See id. at 446-47, 451-52.  These facts justified a\nfinding that, with respect to traffic warning devices on Beach\nDrive, the Park Service already had made a specific policy decision\nto favor safety over aesthetics.  See id. at 452 (concluding that\nthe Park Service had \"chosen to manage the road in a manner more\namenable to commuting through nature than communing with it\"). \nWithin the context of that priority-setting policy decision, the\nonly discretion that the Park Service exercised in posting signs\nand devices was the discretion provided for in the Manual.  See id.at 451.  Although that discretion involved safety assessments\nregarding, for example, what types of traffic safety devices were\nneeded and where they should be placed, it did not involve the\nexercise of policy-based discretion.  See id. at 451-52.\nThis holding falls neatly into a line of cases involving\nplaintiffs who challenge official judgments that implicate\ntechnical safety assessments conducted pursuant to prior policy\nchoices.  See, e.g., Ayala v. United States, 980 F.2d 1342, 1348-49\n(10th Cir. 1992); Andrulonis v. United States, 952 F.2d 652, 655\n(2d Cir. 1991).  Such decisions come within a category of objective\nprofessional judgments that, without more, are not readily amenable\nto policy analysis.  See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 545 (indicating\nthat discretion involving application of \"objective scientific\nstandards\" is not policy-based discretion); Kennewick Irrigation\nDist. v. United States, 880 F.2d 1018, 1030 (9th Cir. 1989)\n(similar).  Thus, to determine whether an action taken in such\ncircumstances is grounded in policy-based discretion, the operative\ndistinction is the one between a judgment that embodies a\nprofessional assessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of settled\npriorities and a fully discretionary judgment that balances\nincommensurable values in order to establish those priorities.\nAgainst this backdrop, Cope is readily distinguishable. \nIn this case, unlike in Cope, no directive bound the designers of\nthe Trading Post rehabilitation to a pre-determined safety policy\nthat contained established priorities.  Moreover, unlike Cope, this\ncase does not involve technical safety assessments.  Rather,\nShansky challenges the initial planning decisions made during the\nrefurbishment of the Trading Post in 1970   and unlike in Cope,\nthose decisions, whether or not actually made with policy\nconsiderations in mind, were susceptible to policy analysis. \nIndeed, they required the unrestrained balancing of incommensurable\nvalues   including safety, aesthetics, and allocation of resources\ntypically associated with policy judgments.\nThe short of it is that a commitment to safety in one\narea does not oblige an agency to strike the balance in favor of\nsafety in every other area.  Here, for example, the Park Service\nlegitimately could conclude that whereas sprinklers and alarm\nsystems were highly desirable regardless of aesthetic impact (given\nthe dire consequences that might attend their absence and their\nrelative inconspicuousness), the aesthetic cost of handrails and\nwarning signs outweighed the predictable safety benefits.  Thus,\nthe installation of fire safety devices does not necessarily compel\nthe endorsement of handrails or warning signs.  We agree with the\nTenth Circuit that \"[a] decision that is a component of an overall\npolicy decision protected by the discretionary function exception\nalso is protected by this exception.\"  Johnson v. United States,\n949 F.2d 332, 338 (10th Cir. 1991) (quoting Zumwalt v. United\nStates, 928 F.2d 951, 955 (10th Cir. 1991)).  As long as the\neschewal of handrails and warning signs was a component of the\ninitial overall policy decision   and everything in this case\nsuggests that it was   the discretionary function exception\nprotects the Park Service's conduct.\nThe situation might be different, of course, had the Park\nService committed itself to installing handrails and warning signs\nthroughout the Trading Post, and then neglected the Northern Exit. \nIn such a setting, one might argue that the Park Service's\ndiscretion was cabined by a prior policy judgment.  See, e.g.,\nCope, 45 F.3d at 452.  But Shansky makes no such argument.  She\ncontends only that the existence of some safety devices\nnecessitates the installation of all kinds of safety precautions  \nand that contention clearly goes too far.\nFor similar reasons, we reject Shansky's argument that\nthe Park Service's installation of a handrail at the Northern Exit\nsubsequent to her mishap proves that the decision to forgo one in\n1970 was not policy-based.  For purposes of discretionary function\nanalysis, there is no distinction between an initial balancing of\npolicy factors and a subsequent balancing of such factors, yielding\na new discretionary judgment, as long as the latter can be\nconsidered to be of the same nature as, or a component of, the\nformer.  Given the facts of this case, the only thing that the\nlater action evinces is that the Park Service made a subsequent\npolicy decision to elevate safety over aesthetics.  An agency that\nhas discretion to make policy choices can change its view as to the\nproper balance of relevant concerns as time passes and experience\naccrues.\nFinally, Shansky suggests that the Park Service's conduct\ndoes not fall within the discretionary function exception because\nthere is no link between the aesthetic concerns supporting a\ndecision not to install a handrail and the safety considerations\nthat militate the other way.  It is true that, in a rare case, the\ngovernment's invocation of a policy justification may be so far-\nfetched as to defy any plausible nexus between the challenged\nconduct and the asserted justification.  See, e.g., Duke v.\nDepartment of Agric., 131 F.3d 1407, 1412 (10th Cir. 1997)\n(concluding that the government failed to explain or demonstrate\nhow neglecting to warn campers about the dangers of rolling\nboulders at a popular campsite   whether by warning signs or in\ntourist literature   could have been a policy decision).  Withal,\nsuch cases invariably involve extreme circumstances, and the\nTrading Post renovations fall comfortably outside this niche.  The\nevidence is undisputed that the Park Service desired to maintain a\nquantum of historical accuracy at this much-frequented site; that\nthe Trading Post historically had no handrails or warning signs at\nthe Northern Exit; and that no prior injuries had been reported. \nAlthough the condition of the Northern Exit may have been dangerous\nto a degree, it was not fraught with the same potential peril as,\nfor example, the camp ground in Duke, where a boulder smashed into\na camper's tent, causing severe brain damage to a six-year old boy. \nIn Duke, recognizing a nexus between the government's inaction and\nits asserted policy justifications was deemed untenable.  See id. \nUnder the far different circumstances of this case, however,\nrecognizing a nexus between the Park Service's conduct and its\nasserted policy justification is not unreasonable.\nWe need go no further.  We are fully persuaded that the\n1970 decision not to place handrails or warning signs at the\nNorthern Exit is   and was   susceptible to policy analysis.  No\nmore is exigible to satisfy the objective inquiry that Gaubertdemands.  Consequently, we are in complete accord with the Eighth\nCircuit, which, responding to an analogous claim under hauntingly\nsimilar circumstances, concluded that the discretionary function\ndefense protected the Park Service's decision to construct a\nstairwell in the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, without a\nhandrail or warning sign.  See Chantal, 104 F.3d at 210-13.\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Congress has prescribed a number of situations in which the waiver will not attach.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680.  One relates to claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a).  Invoking this discretionary function exception, the government sought brevis disposition.  The district court obliged.  Shansky then prosecuted this appeal.  We review de novo the lower court's determination that the discretionary function exception controls.  See Irving v. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 161 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A familiar analytic framework governs the discretionary function inquiry.  An inquiring court first must identify the conduct that allegedly caused the harm.  See id. at 161-62.  Here, Shansky spotlights the Park Service's decisionmaking during the Trading Post's rehabilitation in 1970 as the culpable conduct, claiming that the Park Service abjured obvious safety measures.  The issue, then, is whether this conduct is of the nature and quality that Congress, in crafting the discretionary function exception, sought to shelter from tort liability.  That issue encompasses two questions:  Is the conduct itself discretionary?   If so, is the discretion susceptible to policy-related judgments?   See United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315, 322-23, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991);  Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 536-37, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988);  Irving, 162 F.3d at 161-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Is the Conduct Discretionary?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shansky endeavors to end the inquiry at the initial stage by showing that the Park Service had no discretion because existing policy mandated that it install handrails and warning signs when it refurbished the premises.  She finds succor in a broadly worded expression of a general policy goal contained in the Park Service's operating manual to the effect that \"[t]he saving of human life will take precedence over all other management actions.\"   National Park Service, NPS-28:  Cultural Resource Management Guidelines (Guidelines) 46 (July, 1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  But this passage does not specifically prescribe that any particular safety measure be employed at any particular place or in any particular facility.  To the contrary, it suggests that the Park Service and its functionaries will have to make discretionary judgments about how to apply concretely the aspirational goal embedded in the statement.  Accord Tippett v. United States, 108 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir.1997).  Statements made at this level of generality do not satisfy Gaubert 's and Berkovitz 's specific prescription requirement.  Were the law otherwise, the discretionary function exception would be a dead letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The surrounding context in which the cited statement appears buttresses this conclusion.  Shansky plucks the statement from the Guidelines' description of park stewardship--but the paragraph in which the words appear goes on to note that, even though the saving of human life is a priority, Park Service policy \"recognize[s] that public use of park resources sometimes involves elements of risk\" and also \"recognize[s] the need for management actions to limit risk to acceptable levels, consistent with acceptable levels of impact on cultural resources.\"   Guidelines at 46.  Consequently, the Guidelines, read as a whole, reinforce the view that Park Service management has discretion to determine which risks are \"acceptable,\" and thus to balance, at some level, concerns for human safety against concerns for preserving the original qualities of a cultural resource.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shansky next argues, in a related vein, that the Park Service, at the expense of historic authenticity, took other steps to make the Trading Post safe (for example, it replaced uneven floorboards during the reconstruction);  and that, having opted for safety in these respects, the Park Service was somehow obliged to do more with the Northern Exit.  This argument lacks force.  Shansky's reference to other safety devices proves nothing, because the Guidelines, which did not specifically require the Park Service to install handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit (or at any other comparable place, for that matter), gave the Park Service discretion to make precisely the kind of judgments that Shansky now assails (balancing competing considerations and opting for safety over authenticity in some applications, but not in others).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other evidence of a mandatory policy that Shansky proffers is a Park Service official's response to a question posed at his deposition.  The questioner asked the deponent whether he \"would agree that the National Park Service policies and regulations required [the Park Service] to identify dangers to the public,\" and the deponent responded affirmatively.  From this slender reed, Shansky tries to build an argument that the Park Service adopted a binding policy to install handrails and warning signs at the Northern Exit.  Setting to one side the rampant ambiguities inherent in the question and answer, the argument fails because Shansky has shown merely a Park Service official's unsubstantiated recollection of an unidentified policy statement.  Although a government official's testimony about the substance of a putative policy sometimes may assist a court's understanding of agency practice, see, e.g., Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 360-61 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that an agency official's testimony may be used to aid a court in deciphering ambiguous regulations and guidelines), testimony that purports to describe written policies and regulations is no substitute for the original text.  See Valdez v. United States, 56 F.3d 1177, 1179-80 (9th Cir.1995);  cf.  Irving, 162 F.3d at 166 (explaining that if a witness' statements are offered to show an agency's policy, the witness must, at a minimum, reconcile his understanding with the agency's more formal expressions of policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that the challenged conduct is discretionary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Is the Discretion Policy-Driven?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the second half of the Gaubert test.  On this score, Shansky asseverates that the Park Service's actions, even if discretionary, were not policy-driven.  Because the law presumes that the exercise of official discretion implicates policy judgments, Shansky cannot prevail on this argument unless she demonstrates that the decision to forgo handrails and warning signs was not susceptible to policy analysis.  See Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267;  Irving, 162 F.3d at 167.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shansky's effort to make the requisite showing emphasizes the actual decisionmaking that went into the 1970 retrofitting of the Trading Post.  She insists that nobody in the Park Service perceived that the Northern Exit posed a danger and, thus, no one thought about installing handrails or warning signs.  Shansky renewed this emphasis at oral argument, repeatedly asserting that the discretionary function defense should topple solely because Park Service officials \"failed to consider\" the safety issues of which she complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Shansky marshals some evidence to support her claim--the Park Service apparently did not explicitly consider the safety vel non of the Northern Exit in 1970--her fact-based exegesis is beside the point.  The subjective intent of government officials is irrelevant to the discretionary function analysis.  See Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267;  Irving, 162 F.3d at 166.   It is therefore of no practical consequence that Park Service officials failed to mull particular safety issues when they planned the Trading Post's rehabilitation.  See Gotha v. United States, 115 F.3d 176, 180 (3d Cir.1997) (\"The test is not whether the government actually considered each possible alternative in the universe of options, but whether the conduct was of the type associated with the exercise of official discretion.\")  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);  Kiehn v. United States, 984 F.2d 1100, 1105 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that \"it is unnecessary for government employees to make an actual 'conscious decision' regarding policy factors\" for it is \"irrelevant whether the alleged failure ... was a matter of 'deliberate choice,' or a mere oversight\") (citations omitted);  Richardson v. United States, 943 F.2d 1107, 1111 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the \"discretionary function exception may apply 'in the absence of a conscious decision' \") (citation omitted).  In fine, an inquiring court need not ask whether government actors decided the point explicitly or actually discussed it, for the inquiry hinges instead on whether some plausible policy justification could have undergirded the challenged conduct.  The critical question is whether the acts or omissions that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a policy-driven analysis, not whether they were the end product of a policy-driven analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Rosebush v. United States, 119 F.3d 438, 444 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear.  We do not suggest that any conceivable policy justification will suffice to prime the discretionary function pump.  Virtually any government action can be traced back to a policy decision of some kind, but an attenuated tie is not enough to show that conduct is grounded in policy.  See Cope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445, 448-49 (D.C.Cir.1995).  Withal, the determination as to where one draws the line between a justification that is too far removed, or too ethereal, or both, and one that is not, is case-specific, and not subject to resolution by the application of mathematically precise formulae.  In particular, there is no principled basis for superimposing a generalized \"safety exception\" upon the discretionary function defense.  A case-by-case approach is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, case-by-case development has led to some disarray.  Compare George v. United States, 735 F.Supp. 1524, 1533-34 (M.D.Ala.1990) (holding that a government agency's failure to warn about submerged alligators has no policy basis) with Tippett, 108 F.3d at 1197-99 (holding that a failure to warn or otherwise abate the dangers associated with a charging moose is grounded in policy);  compare also Cope, 45 F.3d at 451-52 (concluding that the discretionary function defense did not vitiate an alleged failure to warn about hazardous road conditions) with Rich v. United States, 119 F.3d 447, 451-52 (6th Cir.1997) (concluding that the discretionary function defense trumped an alleged failure to warn about hazardous road conditions), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1364, 140 L.Ed.2d 513 (1998).  These pererrations cause us to despair of reconciling all the cases.  Be that as it may, the decisional law yields several unifying principles that inform our analysis and shed sufficient light to remove this case from the gray area that suffuses this corner of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government's ultimate policy justification is that forgoing handrails and warning signs at the Northern Exit was the product of a broader judgment call that favored aesthetics over safety.  Aesthetic considerations, including decisions to preserve the historical accuracy of national landmarks, constitute legitimate policy concerns.  See Chantal v. United States, 104 F.3d 207, 212-13 (8th Cir.1997);  Kiehn, 984 F.2d at 1104-05.   Indeed, Shansky does not seriously contest the legitimacy of aesthetic considerations as an abstract matter.  Instead, her main theme--with a few variations, as we shall see--is that when safety becomes an issue, all else must yield.  We cannot embrace so sweeping a proposition.  See Irving, 162 F.3d at 168 n. 13 (warning courts to hesitate before imposing a principle of zero tolerance for any kind of risk, absent an express congressional or administrative command).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress instructed the Park Service to endeavor \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects\" of the property in its charge \"and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"  16 U.S.C. &#167; 1.  At the very least, this means that the Park Service may balance aesthetic concerns with those of visitor safety in reaching planning decisions, and that safety concerns will not automatically eclipse all other policy considerations.  See Chantal, 104 F.3d at 212;  Kiehn, 984 F.2d at 1104.   There is nothing anomalous about this sort of balancing.  We live in a world of incommensurable, often conflicting values.  Some might prefer to sacrifice history to prevent even infinitesimal risks, whereas others might accept some hazards in order to preserve historical artifacts in a pristine state.  It would be a much more convenient world if we had a single metric with which to measure, and thereby prioritize, all values--but as long as that luxury eludes us, we must rely upon policymakers to reconcile the ensuing conflicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the statutory scheme empowers the Park Service to balance incommensurable values such as safety and aesthetics, and the Judicial Branch is ill-equipped to rework that balance.  See United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S. 797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984);  Chantal, 104 F.3d at 212.   We think it follows that inquiries into whether a discretionary act is policy-driven cannot be short-circuited simply by raising the specter of a general safety exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a more refined version of the same argument, Shansky points to the Park Service's installation of sprinklers, an alarm system, fire extinguishers, and the like in the reconstructed Trading Post and posits that, once the Park Service decided to effectuate some modern safety measures, it became obliged to take all feasible safety measures.  To support this thesis, Shansky relies primarily on the discussion of a \"failure to warn\" claim in Cope v. Scott, 45 F.3d 445 (D.C.Cir.1995).  We believe that Shansky loads more on Cope than Cope can bear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cope involved, inter alia, claims asserting negligence in the construction, maintenance, and installation of warnings relating to Beach Drive, a road administered by the Park Service.  Cope, an accident victim, claimed, among other things, that the Park Service's failure to install proper warnings at important points along the road caused his misfortune.  Despite the Park Service's protests, the record showed that it had treated Beach Drive as a commuter road, not a scenic drive;  that it had installed numerous traffic devices and signs at frequent intervals along the road (including two \"slippery when wet\" signs in the immediate area in which the accident occurred);  and that it had erected the signs in accordance with the manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (the Manual).  See id. at 446-47, 451-52.   These facts justified a finding that, with respect to traffic warning devices on Beach Drive, the Park Service already had made a specific policy decision to favor safety over aesthetics.  See id. at 452 (concluding that the Park Service had \"chosen to manage the road in a manner more amenable to commuting through nature than communing with it\").  Within the context of that priority-setting policy decision, the only discretion that the Park Service exercised in posting signs and devices was the discretion provided for in the Manual.  See id. at 451.   Although that discretion involved safety assessments regarding, for example, what types of traffic safety devices were needed and where they should be placed, it did not involve the exercise of policy-based discretion.  See id. at 451-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding falls neatly into a line of cases involving plaintiffs who challenge official judgments that implicate technical safety assessments conducted pursuant to prior policy choices.  See, e.g., Ayala v. United States, 980 F.2d 1342, 1348-49 (10th Cir.1992);  Andrulonis v. United States, 952 F.2d 652, 655 (2d Cir.1991).  Such decisions come within a category of objective professional judgments that, without more, are not readily amenable to policy analysis.  See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 545, 108 S.Ct. 1954 (indicating that discretion involving application of \"objective scientific standards\" is not policy-based discretion);  Kennewick Irrigation Dist. v. United States, 880 F.2d 1018, 1030 (9th Cir.1989) (similar).  Thus, to determine whether an action taken in such circumstances is grounded in policy-based discretion, the operative distinction is the one between a judgment that embodies a professional assessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of settled priorities and a fully discretionary judgment that balances incommensurable values in order to establish those priorities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, Cope is readily distinguishable.  In this case, unlike in Cope, no directive bound the designers of the Trading Post rehabilitation to a pre-determined safety policy that contained established priorities.  Moreover, unlike Cope, this case does not involve technical safety assessments.  Rather, Shansky challenges the initial planning decisions made during the refurbishment of the Trading Post in 1970--and unlike in Cope, those decisions, whether or not actually made with policy considerations in mind, were susceptible to policy analysis.  Indeed, they required the unrestrained balancing of incommensurable values--including safety, aesthetics, and allocation of resources--typically associated with policy judgments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a commitment to safety in one area does not oblige an agency to strike the balance in favor of safety in every other area.  Here, for example, the Park Service legitimately could conclude that whereas sprinklers and alarm systems were highly desirable regardless of aesthetic impact (given the dire consequences that might attend their absence and their relative inconspicuousness), the aesthetic cost of handrails and warning signs outweighed the predictable safety benefits.  Thus, the installation of fire safety devices does not necessarily compel the endorsement of handrails or warning signs.  We agree with the Tenth Circuit that \"[a] decision that is a component of an overall policy decision protected by the discretionary function exception also is protected by this exception.\"  Johnson v. United States, 949 F.2d 332, 338 (10th Cir.1991) (quoting Zumwalt v. United States, 928 F.2d 951, 955 (10th Cir.1991)).  As long as the eschewal of handrails and warning signs was a component of the initial overall policy decision--and everything in this case suggests that it was--the discretionary function exception protects the Park Service's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation might be different, of course, had the Park Service committed itself to installing handrails and warning signs throughout the Trading Post, and then neglected the Northern Exit.  In such a setting, one might argue that the Park Service's discretion was cabined by a prior policy judgment.  See, e.g., Cope, 45 F.3d at 452.   But Shansky makes no such argument.  She contends only that the existence of some safety devices necessitates the installation of all kinds of safety precautions--and that contention clearly goes too far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, we reject Shansky's argument that the Park Service's installation of a handrail at the Northern Exit subsequent to her mishap proves that the decision to forgo one in 1970 was not policy-based.  For purposes of discretionary function analysis, there is no distinction between an initial balancing of policy factors and a subsequent balancing of such factors, yielding a new discretionary judgment, as long as the latter can be considered to be of the same nature as, or a component of, the former.  Given the facts of this case, the only thing that the later action evinces is that the Park Service made a subsequent policy decision to elevate safety over aesthetics.  An agency that has discretion to make policy choices can change its view as to the proper balance of relevant concerns as time passes and experience accrues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Shansky suggests that the Park Service's conduct does not fall within the discretionary function exception because there is no link between the aesthetic concerns supporting a decision not to install a handrail and the safety considerations that militate the other way.  It is true that, in a rare case, the government's invocation of a policy justification may be so far-fetched as to defy any plausible nexus between the challenged conduct and the asserted justification.  See, e.g., Duke v. Department of Agric., 131 F.3d 1407, 1412 (10th Cir.1997) (concluding that the government failed to explain or demonstrate how neglecting to warn campers about the dangers of rolling boulders at a popular campsite--whether by warning signs or in tourist literature--could have been a policy decision).  Withal, such cases invariably involve extreme circumstances, and the Trading Post renovations fall comfortably outside this niche.  The evidence is undisputed that the Park Service desired to maintain a quantum of historical accuracy at this much-frequented site;  that the Trading Post historically had no handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit;  and that no prior injuries had been reported.  Although the condition of the Northern Exit may have been dangerous to a degree, it was not fraught with the same potential peril as, for example, the camp ground in Duke, where a boulder smashed into a camper's tent, causing severe brain damage to a six-year old boy.  In Duke, recognizing a nexus between the government's inaction and its asserted policy justifications was deemed untenable.  See id.   Under the far different circumstances of this case, however, recognizing a nexus between the Park Service's conduct and its asserted policy justification is not unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We are fully persuaded that the 1970 decision not to place handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit is--and was--susceptible to policy analysis.  No more is exigible to satisfy the objective inquiry that Gaubert demands.  Consequently, we are in complete accord with the Eighth Circuit, which, responding to an analogous claim under hauntingly similar circumstances, concluded that the discretionary function defense protected the Park Service's decision to construct a stairwell in the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, without a handrail or warning sign.  See Chantal, 104 F.3d at 210-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

The workers took the wall apart stone by stone, marking each stone's place and later restoring the stones in the same general location.  Floors, doors, and windows were reconstructed with similar attention to historical detail</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Evidence in the record shows that employees of a nonprofit organization that manages the Trading Post's commercial activities did affix a hand-lettered warning sign near the Northern Exit some time after the rehabilitation.

The distinction is perhaps illustrated most effectively by contrasting ARA Leisure 's separate holdings.  The court concluded that the Park Service's initial decision to design and construct a park road without guardrails was protected by the discretionary function exception (principally on the ground that Park Service policies required roads to be \"esthetically pleasing\"), yet held that failure to maintain a certain stretch of the road in a safe condition was not grounded in policy (and, therefore, not protected).  See id. at 195.   In a particularly revealing passage, the court explained that \"where the challenged governmental activity involves safety considerations under an established policy rather than the balancing of competing policy considerations, the rationale for the exception falls away and the United States will be responsible for the negligence of its employees.\"  Id. (quoting Aslakson v. United States, 790 F.2d 688, 693 (8th Cir.1986)).  The District of Columbia Circuit drew essentially the same distinction in upholding Cope's \"failure to warn\" claim, but foreclosing his \"failure to make the road surface skid-resistant\" claim.

We conclude that the district court applied the exception impeccably and appropriately granted summary judgment on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, insofar as they pertain to the issues on appeal, are uncomplicated.  Upon departing the Hubbell Trading Post, a national historic site in Ganado, Arizona, through the so-called \"Northern Exit,\" plaintiff-appellant Nettie Shansky tripped over an antique wooden threshold and tumbled down a short flight of steps.  She sustained serious personal injuries in the fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trading Post was originally built in the late 1800s.  The National Park Service acquired it in 1967 and rehabilitated it three years later with a view toward preserving its authenticity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Shansky maintains that, when the Park Service refurbished the Trading Post, it should have installed a handrail at the Northern Exit.  She brought an FTCA suit against the United States on this theory, and, although she did not amend her complaint, she later expanded her thesis to include an allegation that the Park Service also failed to post adequate warning signs at or near the Northern Exit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTCA is a limited waiver of the federal government's sovereign immunity.  Congress has prescribed a number of situations in which the waiver will not attach.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680.  One relates to claims \"based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(a).  Invoking this discretionary function exception, the government sought brevis disposition.  The district court obliged.  Shansky then prosecuted this appeal.  We review de novo the lower court's determination that the discretionary function exception controls.  See Irving v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759695\"><a href=\"/opinion/759695/gail-merchant-irving-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 161 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A familiar analytic framework governs the discretionary function inquiry.  An inquiring court first must identify the conduct that allegedly caused the harm.  See id. at 161-62.  Here, Shansky spotlights the Park Service's decisionmaking during the Trading Post's rehabilitation in 1970 as the culpable conduct, claiming that the Park Service abjured obvious safety measures.  The issue, then, is whether this conduct is of the nature and quality that Congress, in crafting the discretionary function exception, sought to shelter from tort liability.  That issue encompasses two questions:  Is the conduct itself discretionary?   If so, is the discretion susceptible to policy-related judgments?   See United States v.

She finds succor in a broadly worded expression of a general policy goal contained in the Park Service's operating manual to the effect that \"[t]he saving of human life will take precedence over all other management actions.\"   National Park Service, NPS-28:  Cultural Resource Management Guidelines (Guidelines) 46 (July, 1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  But this passage does not specifically prescribe that any particular safety measure be employed at any particular place or in any particular facility.  To the contrary, it suggests that the Park Service and its functionaries will have to make discretionary judgments about how to apply concretely the aspirational goal embedded in the statement.  Accord Tippett v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737505\"><a href=\"/opinion/737505/frank-tippett-and-judy-rand-v-united-states-of-america-and-robert-lowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1197 (10th Cir.1997).  Statements made at this level of generality do not satisfy Gaubert 's and Berkovitz 's specific prescription requirement.  Were the law otherwise, the discretionary function exception would be a dead letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The surrounding context in which the cited statement appears buttresses this conclusion.  Shansky plucks the statement from the Guidelines' description of park stewardship--but the paragraph in which the words appear goes on to note that, even though the saving of human life is a priority, Park Service policy \"recognize[s] that public use of park resources sometimes involves elements of risk\" and also \"recognize[s] the need for management actions to limit risk to acceptable levels, consistent with acceptable levels of impact on cultural resources.\"   Guidelines at 46.  Consequently, the Guidelines, read as a whole, reinforce the view that Park Service management has discretion to determine which risks are \"acceptable,\" and thus to balance, at some level, concerns for human safety against concerns for preserving the original qualities of a cultural resource.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shansky next argues, in a related vein, that the Park Service, at the expense of historic authenticity, took other steps to make the Trading Post safe (for example, it replaced uneven floorboards during the reconstruction);  and that, having opted for safety in these respects, the Park Service was somehow obliged to do more with the Northern Exit.  This argument lacks force.  Shansky's reference to other safety devices proves nothing, because the Guidelines, which did not specifically require the Park Service to install handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit (or at any other comparable place, for that matter), gave the Park Service discretion to make precisely the kind of judgments that Shansky now assails (balancing competing considerations and opting for safety over authenticity in some applications, but not in others).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other evidence of a mandatory policy that Shansky proffers is a Park Service official's response to a question posed at his deposition.  The questioner asked the deponent whether he \"would agree that the National Park Service policies and regulations required [the Park Service] to identify dangers to the public,\" and the deponent responded affirmatively.  From this slender reed, Shansky tries to build an argument that the Park Service adopted a binding policy to install handrails and warning signs at the Northern Exit.  Setting to one side the rampant ambiguities inherent in the question and answer, the argument fails because Shansky has shown merely a Park Service official's unsubstantiated recollection of an unidentified policy statement.  Although a government official's testimony about the substance of a putative policy sometimes may assist a court's understanding of agency practice, see, e.g., Kelly v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555046\"><a href=\"/opinion/555046/john-l-kelly-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 360-61 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that an agency official's testimony may be used to aid a court in deciphering ambiguous regulations and guidelines), testimony that purports to describe written policies and regulations is no substitute for the original text.  See Valdez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697364\"><a href=\"/opinion/697364/felix-valdez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, 1179-80 (9th Cir.1995);  cf.  Irving, 162 F.3d at 166 (explaining that if a witness' statements are offered to show an agency's policy, the witness must, at a minimum, reconcile his understanding with the agency's more formal expressions of policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we find that the challenged conduct is discretionary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Is the Discretion Policy-Driven?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the second half of the Gaubert test.  On this score, Shansky asseverates that the Park Service's actions, even if discretionary, were not policy-driven.  Because the law presumes that the exercise of official discretion implicates policy judgments, Shansky cannot prevail on this argument unless she demonstrates that the decision to forgo handrails and warning signs was not susceptible to policy analysis.  See Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>;  Irving, 162 F.3d at 167.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shansky's effort to make the requisite showing emphasizes the actual decisionmaking that went into the 1970 retrofitting of the Trading Post.  She insists that nobody in the Park Service perceived that the Northern Exit posed a danger and, thus, no one thought about installing handrails or warning signs.  Shansky renewed this emphasis at oral argument, repeatedly asserting that the discretionary function defense should topple solely because Park Service officials \"failed to consider\" the safety issues of which she complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Shansky marshals some evidence to support her claim--the Park Service apparently did not explicitly consider the safety vel non of the Northern Exit in 1970--her fact-based exegesis is beside the point.  The subjective intent of government officials is irrelevant to the discretionary function analysis.  See Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112567\"><a href=\"/opinion/112567/united-states-v-gaubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>;  Irving, 162 F.3d at 166.   It is therefore of no practical consequence that Park Service officials failed to mull particular safety issues when they planned the Trading Post's rehabilitation.  See Gotha v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741746\"><a href=\"/opinion/741746/sheila-gotha-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 180 (3d Cir.1997) (\"The test is not whether the government actually considered each possible alternative in the universe of options, but whether the conduct was of the type associated with the exercise of official discretion.\")  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);  Kiehn v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599221\"><a href=\"/opinion/599221/david-kiehn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span>, 1105 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that \"it is unnecessary for government employees to make an actual 'conscious decision' regarding policy factors\" for it is \"irrelevant whether the alleged failure ... was a matter of 'deliberate choice,' or a mere oversight\") (citations omitted);  Richardson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567736\"><a href=\"/opinion/567736/kenneth-richardson-norman-j-trapp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></a></span>, 1111 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the \"discretionary function exception may apply 'in the absence of a conscious decision' \") (citation omitted).  In fine, an inquiring court need not ask whether government actors decided the point explicitly or actually discussed it, for the inquiry hinges instead on whether some plausible policy justification could have undergirded the challenged conduct.  The critical question is whether the acts or omissions that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a policy-driven analysis, not whether they were the end product of a policy-driven analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Rosebush v.

We do not suggest that any conceivable policy justification will suffice to prime the discretionary function pump.  Virtually any government action can be traced back to a policy decision of some kind, but an attenuated tie is not enough to show that conduct is grounded in policy.  See Cope v. Scott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687247\"><a href=\"/opinion/687247/john-r-cope-v-roland-g-scott-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span>, 448-49 (D.C.Cir.1995).  Withal, the determination as to where one draws the line between a justification that is too far removed, or too ethereal, or both, and one that is not, is case-specific, and not subject to resolution by the application of mathematically precise formulae.  In particular, there is no principled basis for superimposing a generalized \"safety exception\" upon the discretionary function defense.  A case-by-case approach is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, case-by-case development has led to some disarray.

Be that as it may, the decisional law yields several unifying principles that inform our analysis and shed sufficient light to remove this case from the gray area that suffuses this corner of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government's ultimate policy justification is that forgoing handrails and warning signs at the Northern Exit was the product of a broader judgment call that favored aesthetics over safety.  Aesthetic considerations, including decisions to preserve the historical accuracy of national landmarks, constitute legitimate policy concerns.  See Chantal v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732506\"><a href=\"/opinion/732506/roger-r-chantal-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 212-13 (8th Cir.1997);  Kiehn, 984 F.2d at 1104-05.   Indeed, Shansky does not seriously contest the legitimacy of aesthetic considerations as an abstract matter.  Instead, her main theme--with a few variations, as we shall see--is that when safety becomes an issue, all else must yield.  We cannot embrace so sweeping a proposition.  See Irving, 162 F.3d at 168 n. 13 (warning courts to hesitate before imposing a principle of zero tolerance for any kind of risk, absent an express congressional or administrative command).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress instructed the Park Service to endeavor \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects\" of the property in its charge \"and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"  16 U.S.C. &#167; 1.  At the very least, this means that the Park Service may balance aesthetic concerns with those of visitor safety in reaching planning decisions, and that safety concerns will not automatically eclipse all other policy considerations.  See Chantal, 104 F.3d at 212;  Kiehn, 984 F.2d at 1104.   There is nothing anomalous about this sort of balancing.  We live in a world of incommensurable, often conflicting values.  Some might prefer to sacrifice history to prevent even infinitesimal risks, whereas others might accept some hazards in order to preserve historical artifacts in a pristine state.  It would be a much more convenient world if we had a single metric with which to measure, and thereby prioritize, all values--but as long as that luxury eludes us, we must rely upon policymakers to reconcile the ensuing conflicts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the statutory scheme empowers the Park Service to balance incommensurable values such as safety and aesthetics, and the Judicial Branch is ill-equipped to rework that balance.

We think it follows that inquiries into whether a discretionary act is policy-driven cannot be short-circuited simply by raising the specter of a general safety exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a more refined version of the same argument, Shansky points to the Park Service's installation of sprinklers, an alarm system, fire extinguishers, and the like in the reconstructed Trading Post and posits that, once the Park Service decided to effectuate some modern safety measures, it became obliged to take all feasible safety measures.  To support this thesis, Shansky relies primarily on the discussion of a \"failure to warn\" claim in Cope v. Scott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687247\"><a href=\"/opinion/687247/john-r-cope-v-roland-g-scott-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1995).  We believe that Shansky loads more on Cope than Cope can bear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cope involved, inter alia, claims asserting negligence in the construction, maintenance, and installation of warnings relating to Beach Drive, a road administered by the Park Service.  Cope, an accident victim, claimed, among other things, that the Park Service's failure to install proper warnings at important points along the road caused his misfortune.  Despite the Park Service's protests, the record showed that it had treated Beach Drive as a commuter road, not a scenic drive;  that it had installed numerous traffic devices and signs at frequent intervals along the road (including two \"slippery when wet\" signs in the immediate area in which the accident occurred);  and that it had erected the signs in accordance with the manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (the Manual).  See id. at 446-47, 451-52.   These facts justified a finding that, with respect to traffic warning devices on Beach Drive, the Park Service already had made a specific policy decision to favor safety over aesthetics.  See id. at 452 (concluding that the Park Service had \"chosen to manage the road in a manner more amenable to commuting through nature than communing with it\").  Within the context of that priority-setting policy decision, the only discretion that the Park Service exercised in posting signs and devices was the discretion provided for in the Manual.  See id. at 451.   Although that discretion involved safety assessments regarding, for example, what types of traffic safety devices were needed and where they should be placed, it did not involve the exercise of policy-based discretion.  See id. at 451-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding falls neatly into a line of cases involving plaintiffs who challenge official judgments that implicate technical safety assessments conducted pursuant to prior policy choices.  See, e.g., Ayala v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596204\"><a href=\"/opinion/596204/patsy-ayala-and-donna-m-ayala-v-the-united-states-of-america-patsy/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span>, 1348-49 (10th Cir.1992);  Andrulonis v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574893\"><a href=\"/opinion/574893/joanna-andrulonis-individually-and-as-conservator-of-the-property-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 655 (2d Cir.1991).  Such decisions come within a category of objective professional judgments that, without more, are not readily amenable to policy analysis.  See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 545, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112093\"><a href=\"/opinion/112093/berkovitz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1954</span></a></span> (indicating that discretion involving application of \"objective scientific standards\" is not policy-based discretion);  Kennewick Irrigation Dist. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526796\"><a href=\"/opinion/526796/kennewick-irrigation-district-v-united-states-of-america-kennewick/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>, 1030 (9th Cir.1989) (similar).  Thus, to determine whether an action taken in such circumstances is grounded in policy-based discretion, the operative distinction is the one between a judgment that embodies a professional assessment undertaken pursuant to a policy of settled priorities and a fully discretionary judgment that balances incommensurable values in order to establish those priorities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, Cope is readily distinguishable.  In this case, unlike in Cope, no directive bound the designers of the Trading Post rehabilitation to a pre-determined safety policy that contained established priorities.  Moreover, unlike Cope, this case does not involve technical safety assessments.  Rather, Shansky challenges the initial planning decisions made during the refurbishment of the Trading Post in 1970--and unlike in Cope, those decisions, whether or not actually made with policy considerations in mind, were susceptible to policy analysis.  Indeed, they required the unrestrained balancing of incommensurable values--including safety, aesthetics, and allocation of resources--typically associated with policy judgments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a commitment to safety in one area does not oblige an agency to strike the balance in favor of safety in every other area.  Here, for example, the Park Service legitimately could conclude that whereas sprinklers and alarm systems were highly desirable regardless of aesthetic impact (given the dire consequences that might attend their absence and their relative inconspicuousness), the aesthetic cost of handrails and warning signs outweighed the predictable safety benefits.  Thus, the installation of fire safety devices does not necessarily compel the endorsement of handrails or warning signs.  We agree with the Tenth Circuit that \"[a] decision that is a component of an overall policy decision protected by the discretionary function exception also is protected by this exception.\"  Johnson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572228\"><a href=\"/opinion/572228/hugh-b-johnson-jr-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 338 (10th Cir.1991) (quoting Zumwalt v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557857\"><a href=\"/opinion/557857/glen-e-zumwalt-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">951</span></a></span>, 955 (10th Cir.1991)).  As long as the eschewal of handrails and warning signs was a component of the initial overall policy decision--and everything in this case suggests that it was--the discretionary function exception protects the Park Service's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation might be different, of course, had the Park Service committed itself to installing handrails and warning signs throughout the Trading Post, and then neglected the Northern Exit.  In such a setting, one might argue that the Park Service's discretion was cabined by a prior policy judgment.  See, e.g., Cope, 45 F.3d at 452.   But Shansky makes no such argument.  She contends only that the existence of some safety devices necessitates the installation of all kinds of safety precautions--and that contention clearly goes too far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, we reject Shansky's argument that the Park Service's installation of a handrail at the Northern Exit subsequent to her mishap proves that the decision to forgo one in 1970 was not policy-based.  For purposes of discretionary function analysis, there is no distinction between an initial balancing of policy factors and a subsequent balancing of such factors, yielding a new discretionary judgment, as long as the latter can be considered to be of the same nature as, or a component of, the former.  Given the facts of this case, the only thing that the later action evinces is that the Park Service made a subsequent policy decision to elevate safety over aesthetics.  An agency that has discretion to make policy choices can change its view as to the proper balance of relevant concerns as time passes and experience accrues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Shansky suggests that the Park Service's conduct does not fall within the discretionary function exception because there is no link between the aesthetic concerns supporting a decision not to install a handrail and the safety considerations that militate the other way.  It is true that, in a rare case, the government's invocation of a policy justification may be so far-fetched as to defy any plausible nexus between the challenged conduct and the asserted justification.  See, e.g., Duke v. Department of Agric., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749432\"><a href=\"/opinion/749432/joel-ray-duke-by-his-father-and-next-friend-danny-duke-danny-duke-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1407</span></a></span>, 1412 (10th Cir.1997) (concluding that the government failed to explain or demonstrate how neglecting to warn campers about the dangers of rolling boulders at a popular campsite--whether by warning signs or in tourist literature--could have been a policy decision).  Withal, such cases invariably involve extreme circumstances, and the Trading Post renovations fall comfortably outside this niche.  The evidence is undisputed that the Park Service desired to maintain a quantum of historical accuracy at this much-frequented site;  that the Trading Post historically had no handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit;  and that no prior injuries had been reported.  Although the condition of the Northern Exit may have been dangerous to a degree, it was not fraught with the same potential peril as, for example, the camp ground in Duke, where a boulder smashed into a camper's tent, causing severe brain damage to a six-year old boy.  In Duke, recognizing a nexus between the government's inaction and its asserted policy justifications was deemed untenable.  See id.   Under the far different circumstances of this case, however, recognizing a nexus between the Park Service's conduct and its asserted policy justification is not unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  We are fully persuaded that the 1970 decision not to place handrails or warning signs at the Northern Exit is--and was--susceptible to policy analysis.  No more is exigible to satisfy the objective inquiry that Gaubert demands.  Consequently, we are in complete accord with the Eighth Circuit, which, responding to an analogous claim under hauntingly similar circumstances, concluded that the discretionary function defense protected the Park Service's decision to construct a stairwell in the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, without a handrail or warning sign.  See Chantal, 104 F.3d at 210-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

The uncontroverted evidence shows that one of the Park Service's primary objectives during this reconstruction was to rebuild the wall with as much historical accuracy as possible.  To this end, the Park Service engaged Navajo tribesmen to perform the repairs.  The workers took the wall apart stone by stone, marking each stone's place and later restoring the stones in the same general location.  Floors, doors, and windows were reconstructed with similar attention to historical detail</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Evidence in the record shows that employees of a nonprofit organization that manages the Trading Post's commercial activities did affix a hand-lettered warning sign near the Northern Exit some time after the rehabilitation.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543180\"><a href=\"/opinion/543180/kendra-summers-a-minor-and-frederick-j-summers-guardian-ad-litem-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1990), and ARA Leisure Serv. v.

The distinction is perhaps illustrated most effectively by contrasting ARA Leisure 's separate holdings.  The court concluded that the Park Service's initial decision to design and construct a park road without guardrails was protected by the discretionary function exception (principally on the ground that Park Service policies required roads to be \"esthetically pleasing\"), yet held that failure to maintain a certain stretch of the road in a safe condition was not grounded in policy (and, therefore, not protected).  See id. at 195.   In a particularly revealing passage, the court explained that \"where the challenged governmental activity involves safety considerations under an established policy rather than the balancing of competing policy considerations, the rationale for the exception falls away and the United States will be responsible for the negligence of its employees.\"  Id. (quoting Aslakson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469879\"><a href=\"/opinion/469879/paul-aslakson-individually-and-on-behalf-of-his-wife-mavis-aslakson-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span>, 693 (8th Cir.1986)).  The District of Columbia Circuit drew essentially the same distinction in upholding Cope's \"failure to warn\" claim, but foreclosing his \"failure to make the road surface skid-resistant\" claim.  See Cope, 45 F.3d at 450-51</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We do not suggest resurrection of the moribund planning/operation distinction that the Supreme Court previously laid to rest.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>.   Instead, our focus rests primarily on the nature of the Park Service's decisions--as opposed to who was making them--and on the factors that the decisionmakers legitimately could consider when making judgments about which safety devices, if any, should be installed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
