Leibensperger, with whom Christa Von Der Luftand Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish were on brief, for appellee. \r\n                                       \r\n\n                      March 17, 1998\r\n                                      \r\n\n    LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  This case involves the\r\nintersection of the ADEA statute of limitations and the special\r\ntolling rules which may apply when the plaintiffs are within a\r\nclass alleged but not certified in earlier ADEA actions.  The\r\nplaintiffs are eleven people, all over 40 years old, who lost\r\ntheir management level jobs at The Ground Round.  In all,\r\nmembers of this group, represented by the same counsel, have\r\nfiled four different actions accusing Ground Round of age\r\ndiscrimination.  If this, the fourth action, is untimely, then\r\nthe district court correctly entered summary judgment.  \r\n    This action is untimely if the plaintiffs' otherwise\r\nconcededly untimely claims are not saved by the fact that there\r\nwere two prior lawsuits with class action allegations, and\r\nplaintiffs were within the classes alleged.  We hold that this\r\nstacking of two class actions does not save the plaintiffs'\r\nclaims.  We affirm.\r\n                            I.\r\n                                  This is the fourth lawsuit by former Ground Round\r\nemployees alleging class-wide age discrimination by Ground\r\nRound.  Each action described the same set of events   and\r\nasserted essentially the same class.  The first such action,\r\nDionne v. Ground Round, was filed in Massachusetts state court\r\nand removed by Ground Round to federal court based on\r\nplaintiffs' ADEA claims.  The Dionne plaintiffs sought class\r\ncertification, which the district court denied on July 6, 1994. \r\nThe Dionne plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their ADEA\r\nclaims and successfully moved to remand the case to state\r\ncourt.\r\n    The second action, Halligan v. Ground Round, was filed in\r\nfederal district court on November 22, 1993.  As of the time\r\nthe complaint in this case was filed, the Halligan plaintiffs\r\nstill had not moved for class certification.    On December 21,\r\n1995, after the complaint in this case was filed, the Halliganplaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their ADEA claims and the\r\naction was dismissed.\r\n    After the district court denied class certification in\r\nDionne, but before remand to state court, several members of\r\nthe putative class sought to intervene in that action.  The\r\ndistrict court denied their motion, at which point the would-be\r\nintervenors filed the third related lawsuit, Winspear v. Ground\r\nRound, in state court alleging only state-law causes of action. \r\nSeven of the plaintiffs in the Winspear action are plaintiffs\r\nhere.  The Massachusetts Superior Court granted Ground Round's\r\nmotion for summary judgment in Winspear without reaching the\r\nmerits.  \r\n   Plaintiffs here filed this action against Ground Round on\r\nOctober 6, 1995, alleging that Ground Round instituted a\r\ncompany-wide policy of dismissing older management workers and\r\nreplacing them with younger workers, in violation of the ADEA. \r\nPlaintiffs claimed to represent a class of similarly situated\r\nformer Ground Round employees.   \r\n    The plaintiffs here claim to represent the class of \"all\r\npast, present and future managerial employees of Ground Round,\r\nwho have been or may be terminated from their employment on the\r\nbasis of age,\" not including those who left Ground Round's\r\nemploy before January 1, 1990.  The Dionne, Halligan, and\r\nWinspear complaints defined the putative class in a nearly\r\nidentical manner.\r\n    Ground Round moved for summary judgment on several\r\ngrounds.  First, relying on the Massachusetts Superior Court's\r\ndismissal of the Winspear action to which seven of the present\r\nplaintiffs were parties, Ground Round argued that the claims of\r\nthose seven plaintiffs   were barred by the doctrine of res\r\njudicata.  The district court rejected this argument based on\r\nits conclusion that the Winspear action was dismissed for\r\nprocedural reasons, and not on its merits.  \r\n    Defendant's second argument for summary judgment was that\r\nthe claims of seven plaintiffs   were barred because those\r\nplaintiffs failed to file administrative charges with the EEOC\r\nwithin 300 days of their discharge from employment, as required\r\nby the ADEA.    The seven plaintiffs admit that they did not\r\nfile administrative charges within the requisite time period,\r\nbut argue that their claims are nevertheless saved by the\r\n\"single-filing rule\" adopted by the majority of circuits, but\r\nnot yet addressed by this circuit.  That rule, also referred to\r\nas \"piggybacking,\" permits plaintiffs who have failed to file\r\nadministrative charges, or who have filed untimely charges, to\r\n\"piggyback\" on the timely-filed charges of other plaintiffs,\r\nprovided the timely-filed charge gives the EEOC and the\r\nemployer adequate notice of allegations of class-wide\r\ndiscrimination.  See Grayson v. K Mart Corp., 79 F.3d 1086,\r\n1101-02 (11th Cir. 1996); Howlett v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 49\r\nF.3d 189, 194 (6th Cir. 1995); Anson v. University of Tex.\r\nHealth Science Ctr., 962 F.2d 539, 541-42 (5th Cir. 1992);\r\nTolliver v. Xerox Corp., 918 F.2d 1052, 1057-59 (2nd Cir.\r\n1990); Kloos v. Carter-Day Co., 799 F.2d 397, 400-401 (8th Cir.\r\n1986).   \r\n    Defendant also argued that even if the single-filing rule\r\nwere adopted, plaintiffs' claims would still be barred because\r\nthe timely-filed administrative charges on which plaintiffs\r\nrely provided inadequate notice of class-wide allegations.   \r\nSee Kloos, 799 F.2d at 400 (\"To be faithful to the purposes of\r\nthe filing requirement, an administrative charge must allege\r\nclass-wide age discrimination or claim to represent a class in\r\norder to serve as the basis for an ADEA class action . . . .\"). \r\nThe district court found that this circuit would adopt the\r\nmajority rule, but accepted defendant's argument that the\r\nsingle-filing rule offered plaintiffs no refuge here because\r\nthe underlying charges contained no allegations of class-wide\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n    Defendant's final argument for summary judgment was that\r\nthe claims of all of the plaintiffs were time-barred for\r\nfailure to file their complaint within 90 days of receiving\r\nnotice from the EEOC of termination of its proceedings, as\r\nrequired by the ADEA.    The EEOC proceedings on plaintiffs'\r\ncharges terminated at various dates between July 21, 1993, and\r\nJanuary 4, 1995.  This action was filed on October 6, 1995,\r\nlong after the 90-day period had expired for all plaintiffs.  \r\n    Plaintiffs concede they all missed the 90-day deadline\r\nfor filing their complaint, but seek shelter in the statute of\r\nlimitations tolling rule announced in American Pipe &amp; Const.\r\nCo. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538 (1974), and reiterated in Crown, Cork\r\n&amp; Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345 (1983).  Those cases held\r\nthat \"the commencement of a class action suspends the\r\napplicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of\r\nthe class who would have been parties had the suit been\r\npermitted to continue as a class action.\"  American Pipe, 414\r\nU.S. at 554.  Plaintiffs argue that the filing of the\r\nDionne and Halligan actions suspended the running of the\r\nstatute of limitations for plaintiffs, who would have been\r\nmembers of the Dionne and Halligan classes had class\r\ncertification been granted in those cases.  The district court\r\naccepted the application of the American Pipe tolling rule, but\r\nrejected plaintiffs' argument that the rule saved their claims\r\nin this case.\r\n    Assuming arguendo that the American Pipe and Crown, Corktolling rules apply to ADEA actions, we nevertheless find that\r\nplaintiffs' claims are time-barred.  We do not reach the merits\r\nof the res judicata or single-filing rule arguments.\r\n                           II.\r\n                                    In American Pipe the Supreme Court balanced the policies\r\nserved by the class action rule, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, and the\r\npolicies served by the statute of limitations.  The case arose\r\nunder the Sherman Antitrust Act, and was brought as a putative\r\nclass action.  After the district court denied class\r\ncertification, several would-be class members moved to\r\nintervene.  Although the applicable statute of limitations had\r\nrun as to the intervenors, the Supreme Court held that their\r\nclaims were not time-barred because the filing of the putative\r\nclass action tolled the statute of limitations as to all\r\nalleged class members until the district court denied\r\ncertification, \"at least where class action status has been\r\ndenied solely because of failure to demonstrate that the class\r\nis so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" \r\nId. at 552-53 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n    In Crown, Cork, a Title VII case, the Court reaffirmed\r\nthe American Pipe tolling rule and extended it to apply not\r\nonly to plaintiffs who seek to intervene in the pending action,\r\nbut also to would-be class members who file actions of their\r\nown.  See id. at 349-50.  The Court also did not limit its\r\nholding to instances when the class certification was denied\r\nsolely on numerosity grounds.\r\n    A logical initial question is whether the Crown, Corkrule for Title VII cases also applies to ADEA cases.  Defendant\r\nargues that these tolling rules do not apply to ADEA\r\nplaintiffs.  This argument is grounded in the fact that both\r\nAmerican Pipe (a Sherman Act case) and Crown, Cork (a Title VII\r\ncase) arose in the context of class actions brought under Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 23.  Rule 23 provides that all members of a class\r\nare included in the action and are bound by the judgment unless\r\nthey \"opt out\" of the action by affirmatively requesting\r\nexclusion.  The ADEA, in contrast, adopts the enforcement\r\nprocedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act, see 29 U.S.C. \r\n201-219, which provides for an \"opt in\" procedure for class\r\nactions, requiring individuals to affirmatively file consent to\r\nthe action in order to be a member of the class.  See 29 U.S.C.\r\n 216(b), 626(b).  Defendant contends that the difference\r\nbetween these two procedures results from different policy\r\nconsiderations, and that the rationale behind the American Pipeand Crown, Cork tolling rules does not apply in the context of\r\n\"opt in\" class actions.  \r\n    The courts of appeals that have addressed this issue have\r\nsplit on the outcome.  Compare Sperling v. Hoffman-La Roche,\r\nInc., 24 F.3d 463, 471-72 (3rd Cir. 1994) (opt-in plaintiff may\r\njoin ADEA action after limitations period for that individual\r\nplaintiff has run if the representative plaintiffs' actions are\r\ntimely) with Grayson, 79 F.3d at 1106 (opt-in ADEA plaintiffs\r\nmust meet the statute of limitations and may not rely on filing\r\nof class action complaint) and O'Connell v. Champion Int'l\r\nCorp., 812 F.2d 393, 394 (8th Cir. 1987) (same).  We consider\r\nthis an issue of some complexity, and we do not reach or\r\nresolve it here.  Even assuming that the American Pipe and\r\nCrown, Cork tolling rules do apply to ADEA actions, we find\r\nthat the rules do not save plaintiffs' claims.  This is because\r\nplaintiffs' claims depend on the \"stacking\" of two sequential\r\nclass actions to keep their claims from being untimely.  We do\r\nnot believe the tolling rules were meant to permit the stacking\r\nof class actions.\r\n    In Crown, Cork, the Court stated that \"[o]nce the statute\r\nof limitations has been tolled, it remains tolled for all\r\nmembers of the putative class until class certification is\r\ndenied,\" at which point \"class members may choose to file their\r\nown suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.\" \r\n462 U.S. at 354.  In this case, the first class action relevant\r\nis the Dionne action.  The Dionne action was filed as a\r\nputative class action on April 20, 1993, and the district court\r\ndenied class certification on July 6, 1994.  Plaintiffs here\r\nwere within the class sought in Dionne.  Applying American Pipeand Crown, Cork would toll the running of the 90-day\r\nlimitations period for each plaintiff from April 20, 1993,\r\nuntil July 6, 1994.  At that point, each plaintiff would have\r\nhad at most 90 days to move to intervene in that action or to\r\nfile an individual action.  But plaintiffs did not do that. \r\nThe complaint in this action was filed on October 6, 1995, more\r\nthan 90 days after the denial of class certification in Dionne.\r\n    Plaintiffs argue that they are saved by the filing of the\r\nHalligan putative class action.  Halligan was filed in November\r\nof 1993, after Dionne was filed but before the court had denied\r\nclass certification in Dionne.  Halligan remained pending as an\r\nasserted but not certified class action, plaintiffs not yet\r\nhaving moved for class certification, on the day the instant\r\naction was filed.  Plaintiffs claim that because \"at all\r\nrelevant times there was at least one class-action suit pending\r\nagainst Ground Round, and each of the plaintiffs was a member\r\nof the defined classes in those cases[, t]hose actions tolled\r\nthe statute of limitations.\"  We disagree.\r\n    The Halligan complaint alleged the same class and the\r\nsame claims as did the Dionne complaint.  In fact, the named\r\nplaintiff, David Halligan, was active in the effort to attain\r\nclass certification in the Dionne action.  Halligan submitted\r\nan affidavit in support of the Dionne motion to certify a\r\nclass, in which he alleged age discrimination by Ground Round. \r\n  The policies -- respect for Rule 23 and considerations of\r\njudicial economy -- which animated the Crown, Cork and American\r\nPipe tolling rules dictate that the tolling rules, if adopted\r\nat all in ADEA cases, not permit plaintiffs to stretch out\r\nlimitations periods by bringing successive class actions.\r\n    Plaintiffs may not stack one class action on top of\r\nanother and continue to toll the statute of limitations\r\nindefinitely.  Permitting such tactics would allow lawyers to\r\nfile successive putative class actions with the hope of\r\nattracting more potential plaintiffs and perpetually tolling\r\nthe statute of limitations as to all such potential litigants,\r\nregardless of how many times a court declines to certify the\r\nclass.  This simply cannot be what the American Pipe rule was\r\nintended to allow, and we decline to embrace such an extension\r\nof that rule.  At least one of our sister circuits agrees.  SeeSalazar-Calderon v. Presidio Valley Farmers Ass'n, 765 F.2d\r\n1334, 1351 (5th Cir. 1985) (\"Plaintiffs have no authority for\r\ntheir contention that putative class members may piggyback one\r\nclass action onto another and thus toll the statute of\r\nlimitations indefinitely, nor have we found any.\").  On closely\r\nrelated issues, each court of appeals to address the question\r\nhas reasoned similarly and rejected efforts by late plaintiffs\r\nto resuscitate their claims through stacking of subsequent\r\nclass actions.  See Andrews v. Orr, 851 F.2d 146, 149 (6th Cir.\r\n1988) (class action tolls statute of limitations only for\r\nsubsequent individual actions, not for subsequent class action\r\nalleging similar class and similar claims); Robbin v. Fluor\r\nCorp., 835 F.2d 213, 214 (9th Cir. 1987) (same); Korwek v.\r\nHunt, 827 F.2d 874, 879 (2d Cir. 1987) (same).  \r\n    The dangers which Justice Blackmun warned against in his\r\nconcurring opinion in American Pipe are vividly demonstrated by\r\nplaintiffs' theory.  Justice Blackmun wrote separately to\r\nstress that the Court's decision \"must not be regarded as\r\nencouragement to lawyers in a case of this kind to frame their\r\npleadings as a class action, intentionally, to attract and save\r\nmembers of the purported class who have slept on their rights.\"\r\n414 U.S. at 561 (Blackmun, J. concurring).  This point was\r\nemphasized by Justice O'Connor in her Crown, Cork concurrence,\r\nin which she stated that \"[t]he tolling rule of American Pipeis a generous one, inviting abuse.\"  462 U.S. at 354 (O'Connor,\r\nJ., concurring).  Rational policy considerations led the\r\nCongress to impose a statute of limitations on the bringing of\r\nADEA actions.  After class certification has been denied in an\r\naction, potential individual plaintiffs cannot extend that\r\nlimitations period by relying on successive class actions which\r\nallege the same class and the same claims.  Plaintiffs' claims\r\nare therefore time-barred, and the district court properly\r\nentered summary judgment in Ground Round's favor.\r\n    Affirmed.  Costs to defendant.\r\n",

See Grayson v. K Mart Corp., 79 F.3d 1086, 1101-02 (11th Cir.1996);  Howlett v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 49 F.3d 189, 194 (6th Cir.1995);  Anson v. University of Tex.

The district court found that this circuit would adopt the majority rule, but accepted defendant's argument that the single-filing rule offered plaintiffs no refuge here because the underlying charges contained no allegations of class-wide discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's final argument for summary judgment was that the claims of all of the plaintiffs were time-barred for failure to file their complaint within 90 days of receiving notice from the EEOC of termination of its proceedings, as required by the ADEA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The EEOC proceedings on plaintiffs' charges terminated at various dates between July 21, 1993, and January 4, 1995.  This action was filed on October 6, 1995, long after the 90-day period had expired for all plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs concede they all missed the 90-day deadline for filing their complaint, but seek shelter in the statute of limitations tolling rule announced in American Pipe &amp; Const. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974), and reiterated in Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628 (1983).  Those cases held that \"the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\"  American Pipe, 414 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. at 766.   Plaintiffs argue that the filing of the Dionne and Halligan actions suspended the running of the statute of limitations for plaintiffs, who would have been members of the Dionne and Halligan classes had class certification been granted in those cases.  The district court accepted the application of the American Pipe tolling rule, but rejected plaintiffs' argument that the rule saved their claims in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that the American Pipe and Crown, Cork tolling rules apply to ADEA actions, we nevertheless find that plaintiffs' claims are time-barred.  We do not reach the merits of the res judicata or single-filing rule arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In American Pipe the Supreme Court balanced the policies served by the class action rule, Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, and the policies served by the statute of limitations.  The case arose under the Sherman Antitrust Act, and was brought as a putative class action.  After the district court denied class certification, several would-be class members moved to intervene.  Although the applicable statute of limitations had run as to the intervenors, the Supreme Court held that their claims were not time-barred because the filing of the putative class action tolled the statute of limitations as to all alleged class members until the district court denied certification, \"at least where class action status has been denied solely because of failure to demonstrate that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\"  Id. at 552-53, 94 S.Ct. at 766 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Crown, Cork, a Title VII case, the Court reaffirmed the American Pipe tolling rule and extended it to apply not only to plaintiffs who seek to intervene in the pending action, but also to would-be class members who file actions of their own.  See id. at 349-50, 103 S.Ct. at 2395-96.   The Court also did not limit its holding to instances when the class certification was denied solely on numerosity grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A logical initial question is whether the Crown, Cork rule for Title VII cases also applies to ADEA cases.  Defendant argues that these tolling rules do not apply to ADEA plaintiffs.  This argument is grounded in the fact that both American Pipe (a Sherman Act case) and Crown, Cork (a Title VII case) arose in the context of class actions brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.  Rule 23 provides that all members of a class are included in the action and are bound by the judgment unless they \"opt out\" of the action by affirmatively requesting exclusion.  The ADEA, in contrast, adopts the enforcement procedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act, see 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 201-219, which provides for an \"opt in\" procedure for class actions, requiring individuals to affirmatively file consent to the action in order to be a member of the class.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 216(b), 626(b).  Defendant contends that the difference between these two procedures results from different policy considerations, and that the rationale behind the American Pipe and Crown, Cork tolling rules does not apply in the context of \"opt in\" class actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts of appeals that have addressed this issue have split on the outcome.  Compare Sperling v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., 24 F.3d 463, 471-72 (3rd Cir.1994) (opt-in plaintiff may join ADEA action after limitations period for that individual plaintiff has run if the representative plaintiffs' actions are timely) with Grayson, 79 F.3d at 1106 (opt-in ADEA plaintiffs must meet the statute of limitations and may not rely on filing of class action complaint) and O'Connell v. Champion Int'l Corp., 812 F.2d 393, 394 (8th Cir.1987) (same).  We consider this an issue of some complexity, and we do not reach or resolve it here.  Even assuming that the American Pipe and Crown, Cork tolling rules do apply to ADEA actions, we find that the rules do not save plaintiffs' claims.  This is because plaintiffs' claims depend on the \"stacking\" of two sequential class actions to keep their claims from being untimely.  We do not believe the tolling rules were meant to permit the stacking of class actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Crown, Cork, the Court stated that \"[o]nce the statute of limitations has been tolled, it remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied,\" at which point \"class members may choose to file their own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.\"  462 U.S. at 354, 103 S.Ct. at 2398.   In this case, the first class action relevant is the Dionne action.  The Dionne action was filed as a putative class action on April 20, 1993, and the district court denied class certification on July 6, 1994.  Plaintiffs here were within the class sought in Dionne.   Applying American Pipe and Crown, Cork would toll the running of the 90-day limitations period for each plaintiff from April 20, 1993, until July 6, 1994.  At that point, each plaintiff would have had at most 90 days to move to intervene in that action or to file an individual action.  But plaintiffs did not do that.  The complaint in this action was filed on October 6, 1995, more than 90 days after the denial of class certification in Dionne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that they are saved by the filing of the Halligan putative class action.  Halligan was filed in November of 1993, after Dionne was filed but before the court had denied class certification in Dionne.  Halligan remained pending as an asserted but not certified class action, plaintiffs not yet having moved for class certification, on the day the instant action was filed.  Plaintiffs claim that because \"at all relevant times there was at least one class-action suit pending against Ground Round, and each of the plaintiffs was a member of the defined classes in those cases[, t]hose actions tolled the statute of limitations.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Halligan complaint alleged the same class and the same claims as did the Dionne complaint.  In fact, the named plaintiff, David Halligan, was active in the effort to attain class certification in the Dionne action.  Halligan submitted an affidavit in support of the Dionne motion to certify a class, in which he alleged age discrimination by Ground Round.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policies--respect for Rule 23 and considerations of judicial economy--which animated the Crown, Cork and American Pipe tolling rules dictate that the tolling rules, if adopted at all in ADEA cases, not permit plaintiffs to stretch out limitations periods by bringing successive class actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs may not stack one class action on top of another and continue to toll the statute of limitations indefinitely.  Permitting such tactics would allow lawyers to file successive putative class actions with the hope of attracting more potential plaintiffs and perpetually tolling the statute of limitations as to all such potential litigants, regardless of how many times a court declines to certify the class.  This simply cannot be what the American Pipe rule was intended to allow, and we decline to embrace such an extension of that rule.  At least one of our sister circuits agrees.  See Salazar-Calderon v. Presidio Valley Farmers Ass'n, 765 F.2d 1334, 1351 (5th Cir.1985) (\"Plaintiffs have no authority for their contention that putative class members may piggyback one class action onto another and thus toll the statute of limitations indefinitely, nor have we found any.\").  On closely related issues, each court of appeals to address the question has reasoned similarly and rejected efforts by late plaintiffs to resuscitate their claims through stacking of subsequent class actions.  See Andrews v. Orr, 851 F.2d 146, 149 (6th Cir.1988) (class action tolls statute of limitations only for subsequent individual actions, not for subsequent class action alleging similar class and similar claims);  Robbin v. Fluor Corp., 835 F.2d 213, 214 (9th Cir.1987) (same);  Korwek v. Hunt, 827 F.2d 874, 879 (2d Cir.1987) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dangers which Justice Blackmun warned against in his concurring opinion in American Pipe are vividly demonstrated by plaintiffs' theory.  Justice Blackmun wrote separately to stress that the Court's decision \"must not be regarded as encouragement to lawyers in a case of this kind to frame their pleadings as a class action, intentionally, to attract and save members of the purported class who have slept on their rights.\"  414 U.S. at 561, 94 S.Ct. at 770 (Blackmun, J. concurring).  This point was emphasized by Justice O'Connor in her Crown, Cork concurrence, in which she stated that \"[t]he tolling rule of American Pipe is a generous one, inviting abuse.\"  462 U.S. at 354, 103 S.Ct. at 2398 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Rational policy considerations led the Congress to impose a statute of limitations on the bringing of ADEA actions.  After class certification has been denied in an action, potential individual plaintiffs cannot extend that limitations period by relying on successive class actions which allege the same class and the same claims.  Plaintiffs' claims are therefore time-barred, and the district court properly entered summary judgment in Ground Round's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

It entered summary judgment against all but one of the named plaintiffs (the claim of Charles O'Neil remains pending in the district court) before plaintiffs moved for class certification.  However, the district court denied class certification in Dionne, which alleged a class and claims identical to the ones alleged here.  The court's primary reason for refusing to certify a class was that the Dionne plaintiffs had not shown that the ADEA requirement that all class members be \"similarly situated\" was met.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b) (\"An action to recover the liability prescribed ... may be maintained against any employer ... by any one or more of the employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.\").  The court stated that \"[t]he fifteen nominees in this action worked in different states, for various supervisors, at different job levels, in different divisions and departments, were terminated for purportedly different reasons, and in several cases are pursuing individual remedies against Ground Round.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs Chapman, Connelly, Coutu, Howell, Jorgensen, Seeney, and Winspear were plaintiffs in the Winspear action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs Basch, Chapman, Connelly, Eisenberg, Ezzell, Kurtz, and Seeney</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> A person seeking to file a civil action under the ADEA must first file an administrative charge alleging unlawful discrimination with the EEOC.

The Tolliver court also noted that the single-filing rule is equally applicable to situations in which the \"piggybacking\" plaintiff joins a previously existing lawsuit and to situations in which that plaintiff files a separate lawsuit.  See id.

William Hayden, a Dionne named plaintiff, filed administrative charges with the EEOC on January 8, 1993.  This was within the 300 day filing period for each of the plaintiffs in the current action.  Hayden's counsel filled out a standard EEOC charge form, alleging only individual discrimination.  Counsel sent a letter along with the charge, addressed to the EEOC area director, which stated:</p>\n        <p>This office represents Mr. William Hayden and others in a claim against their former employer, The Ground Round, Inc., for age discrimination....</p>\n        <p>We expect to be filing a class action suit in federal court on behalf of Mr. Hayden and others similarly situated....

Ground Round, was filed in Massachusetts state court and removed by Ground Round to federal court based on plaintiffs' ADEA claims.  The Dionne plaintiffs sought class certification, which the district court denied on July 6, 1994.

That rule, also referred to as \"piggybacking,\" permits plaintiffs who have failed to file administrative charges, or who have filed untimely charges, to \"piggyback\" on the timely-filed charges of other plaintiffs, provided the timely-filed charge gives the EEOC and the employer adequate notice of allegations of class-wide discrimination.

Those cases held that \"the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\"  American Pipe, 414 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. at 766.   Plaintiffs argue that the filing of the Dionne and Halligan actions suspended the running of the statute of limitations for plaintiffs, who would have been members of the Dionne and Halligan classes had class certification been granted in those cases.  The district court accepted the application of the American Pipe tolling rule, but rejected plaintiffs' argument that the rule saved their claims in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that the American Pipe and Crown, Cork tolling rules apply to ADEA actions, we nevertheless find that plaintiffs' claims are time-barred.  We do not reach the merits of the res judicata or single-filing rule arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In American Pipe the Supreme Court balanced the policies served by the class action rule, Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, and the policies served by the statute of limitations.  The case arose under the Sherman Antitrust Act, and was brought as a putative class action.  After the district court denied class certification, several would-be class members moved to intervene.  Although the applicable statute of limitations had run as to the intervenors, the Supreme Court held that their claims were not time-barred because the filing of the putative class action tolled the statute of limitations as to all alleged class members until the district court denied certification, \"at least where class action status has been denied solely because of failure to demonstrate that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\"  Id. at 552-53, 94 S.Ct. at 766 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Crown, Cork, a Title VII case, the Court reaffirmed the American Pipe tolling rule and extended it to apply not only to plaintiffs who seek to intervene in the pending action, but also to would-be class members who file actions of their own.  See id. at 349-50, 103 S.Ct. at 2395-96.   The Court also did not limit its holding to instances when the class certification was denied solely on numerosity grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A logical initial question is whether the Crown, Cork rule for Title VII cases also applies to ADEA cases.  Defendant argues that these tolling rules do not apply to ADEA plaintiffs.  This argument is grounded in the fact that both American Pipe (a Sherman Act case) and Crown, Cork (a Title VII case) arose in the context of class actions brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.  Rule 23 provides that all members of a class are included in the action and are bound by the judgment unless they \"opt out\" of the action by affirmatively requesting exclusion.  The ADEA, in contrast, adopts the enforcement procedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act, see 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 201-219, which provides for an \"opt in\" procedure for class actions, requiring individuals to affirmatively file consent to the action in order to be a member of the class.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 216(b), 626(b).  Defendant contends that the difference between these two procedures results from different policy considerations, and that the rationale behind the American Pipe and Crown, Cork tolling rules does not apply in the context of \"opt in\" class actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts of appeals that have addressed this issue have split on the outcome.  Compare Sperling v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670501\"><a href=\"/opinion/670501/richard-sperling-frederick-hemsley-and-joseph-zelauskas-individually-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 471-72 (3rd Cir.1994) (opt-in plaintiff may join ADEA action after limitations period for that individual plaintiff has run if the representative plaintiffs' actions are timely) with Grayson, 79 F.3d at 1106 (opt-in ADEA plaintiffs must meet the statute of limitations and may not rely on filing of class action complaint) and O'Connell v.

We consider this an issue of some complexity, and we do not reach or resolve it here.  Even assuming that the American Pipe and Crown, Cork tolling rules do apply to ADEA actions, we find that the rules do not save plaintiffs' claims.  This is because plaintiffs' claims depend on the \"stacking\" of two sequential class actions to keep their claims from being untimely.  We do not believe the tolling rules were meant to permit the stacking of class actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Crown, Cork, the Court stated that \"[o]nce the statute of limitations has been tolled, it remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class certification is denied,\" at which point \"class members may choose to file their own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.\"  462 U.S. at 354, 103 S.Ct. at 2398.   In this case, the first class action relevant is the Dionne action.  The Dionne action was filed as a putative class action on April 20, 1993, and the district court denied class certification on July 6, 1994.  Plaintiffs here were within the class sought in Dionne.   Applying American Pipe and Crown, Cork would toll the running of the 90-day limitations period for each plaintiff from April 20, 1993, until July 6, 1994.  At that point, each plaintiff would have had at most 90 days to move to intervene in that action or to file an individual action.  But plaintiffs did not do that.  The complaint in this action was filed on October 6, 1995, more than 90 days after the denial of class certification in Dionne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that they are saved by the filing of the Halligan putative class action.  Halligan was filed in November of 1993, after Dionne was filed but before the court had denied class certification in Dionne.  Halligan remained pending as an asserted but not certified class action, plaintiffs not yet having moved for class certification, on the day the instant action was filed.  Plaintiffs claim that because \"at all relevant times there was at least one class-action suit pending against Ground Round, and each of the plaintiffs was a member of the defined classes in those cases[, t]hose actions tolled the statute of limitations.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Halligan complaint alleged the same class and the same claims as did the Dionne complaint.  In fact, the named plaintiff, David Halligan, was active in the effort to attain class certification in the Dionne action.  Halligan submitted an affidavit in support of the Dionne motion to certify a class, in which he alleged age discrimination by Ground Round.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policies--respect for Rule 23 and considerations of judicial economy--which animated the Crown, Cork and American Pipe tolling rules dictate that the tolling rules, if adopted at all in ADEA cases, not permit plaintiffs to stretch out limitations periods by bringing successive class actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs may not stack one class action on top of another and continue to toll the statute of limitations indefinitely.  Permitting such tactics would allow lawyers to file successive putative class actions with the hope of attracting more potential plaintiffs and perpetually tolling the statute of limitations as to all such potential litigants, regardless of how many times a court declines to certify the class.  This simply cannot be what the American Pipe rule was intended to allow, and we decline to embrace such an extension of that rule.  At least one of our sister circuits agrees.  See Salazar-Calderon v. Presidio Valley Farmers Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454512\"><a href=\"/opinion/454512/amado-salazar-calderon-cross-appellees-v-presidio-valley-farmers/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1334</span></a></span>, 1351 (5th Cir.1985) (\"Plaintiffs have no authority for their contention that putative class members may piggyback one class action onto another and thus toll the statute of limitations indefinitely, nor have we found any.\").  On closely related issues, each court of appeals to address the question has reasoned similarly and rejected efforts by late plaintiffs to resuscitate their claims through stacking of subsequent class actions.

Justice Blackmun wrote separately to stress that the Court's decision \"must not be regarded as encouragement to lawyers in a case of this kind to frame their pleadings as a class action, intentionally, to attract and save members of the purported class who have slept on their rights.\"  414 U.S. at 561, 94 S.Ct. at 770 (Blackmun, J. concurring).  This point was emphasized by Justice O'Connor in her Crown, Cork concurrence, in which she stated that \"[t]he tolling rule of American Pipe is a generous one, inviting abuse.\"  462 U.S. at 354, 103 S.Ct. at 2398 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Rational policy considerations led the Congress to impose a statute of limitations on the bringing of ADEA actions.  After class certification has been denied in an action, potential individual plaintiffs cannot extend that limitations period by relying on successive class actions which allege the same class and the same claims.  Plaintiffs' claims are therefore time-barred, and the district court properly entered summary judgment in Ground Round's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

However, the district court denied class certification in Dionne, which alleged a class and claims identical to the ones alleged here.  The court's primary reason for refusing to certify a class was that the Dionne plaintiffs had not shown that the ADEA requirement that all class members be \"similarly situated\" was met.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b) (\"An action to recover the liability prescribed ... may be maintained against any employer ... by any one or more of the employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.\").

The Tolliver court also noted that the single-filing rule is equally applicable to situations in which the \"piggybacking\" plaintiff joins a previously existing lawsuit and to situations in which that plaintiff files a separate lawsuit.  See id.

William Hayden, a Dionne named plaintiff, filed administrative charges with the EEOC on January 8, 1993.  This was within the 300 day filing period for each of the plaintiffs in the current action.  Hayden's counsel filled out a standard EEOC charge form, alleging only individual discrimination.  Counsel sent a letter along with the charge, addressed to the EEOC area director, which stated:</p>\n        <p>This office represents Mr. William Hayden and others in a claim against their former employer, The Ground Round, Inc., for age discrimination....</p>\n        <p>We expect to be filing a class action suit in federal court on behalf of Mr. Hayden and others similarly situated....

Plaintiffs argue that the letters alone would have sufficed as administrative charges under the ADEA, and they therefore should suffice to serve as proper notice of allegations of class-wide discrimination.  There is nothing in the record as to whether Ground Round ever received copies of those letters while the matter was before the EEOC.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e) provides:</p>\n        <p>If a charge filed with the Commission under this chapter is dismissed or the proceedings of the Commission are otherwise terminated by the Commission, the Commission shall notify the person aggrieved.
