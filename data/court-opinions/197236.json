This case involves a claim of\r\ndisability-based discrimination brought by an asymptomatic HIV-\r\npositive individual, Sidney Abbott, against Randon Bragdon, a\r\ndentist who refused to fill Ms. Abbott's cavity in his office.  The\r\ndistrict court found Ms. Abbott's case compelling and granted\r\nsummary judgment in her favor.  See Abbott v. Bragdon, 912 F. Supp.\r\n580 (D. Me. 1995) (Abbott I).  We affirmed, albeit on somewhat\r\ndifferent reasoning.  See Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d 934 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (Abbott II).  The Supreme Court affirmed our decision in\r\nsubstantial part, but remanded with instructions that we reexamine\r\nseveral pieces of evidence.  See Bragdon v. Abbott, 118 S. Ct. 2196\r\n(1998) (Abbott III).  We ordered supplemental briefing, entertained\r\na new round of oral argument, and now reaffirm the district court's\r\nentry of summary judgment.\r\n                           I\r\nWe limned the pertinent facts in our earlier opinion, seeAbbott II, 107 F.3d at 937-38, and it would be pleonastic to\r\nrehearse them here.  To lend context, it suffices to remind the\r\nreader that Ms. Abbott, who was infected with the Human\r\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV), went to Dr. Bragdon's Bangor, Maine\r\noffice for a dental appointment in September 1994; that she was\r\nthen in the asymptomatic phase of the disease and so informed the\r\ndentist; and that, after Dr. Bragdon discovered a cavity, he\r\nrefused to fill it in his office.  Ms. Abbott sued, claiming\r\nviolations of the Americans With Disabilities Act (the ADA), 42\r\nU.S.C.  12182 (1994), and the Maine Human Rights Act, 5 Me. Rev.\r\nStat. Ann. tit. 5,  4592 (West Supp. 1998).\r\nThe earlier phases of this litigation established that\r\nasymptomatic HIV constitutes a disability under the ADA.  SeeAbbott III, 118 S. Ct. at 2207 (aff'g Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 942). \r\nThe sole remaining question is whether performance of the cavity-\r\nfilling procedure posed a \"direct threat\" to others and thereby\r\ncame within an exception to the ADA's broad prohibition against\r\ndiscrimination.  See Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 943; see also 42 U.S.C.\r\n12182(b)(3) (stating the exception and defining a direct threat\r\nunder the ADA as \"a significant risk to the health or safety of\r\nothers that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies,\r\npractices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or\r\nservices\").\r\nIn the earlier appeal, our rejection of Dr. Bragdon's\r\ndirect threat defense relied in part on our reading of (i) the 1993\r\nDentistry Guidelines (the Guidelines) formulated by the Centers for\r\nDisease Control (CDC), and (ii) the Policy on AIDS, HIV Infection\r\nand the Practice of Dentistry (the Policy) propounded by the\r\nAmerican Dental Association (the Association).  See Abbott II, 107\r\nF.3d at 945-46.  Each of these documents indicated to us that the\r\nuse of so-called \"universal precautions\" would render the risk of\r\nperforming the cavity-filling procedure in a dental office\r\ninsignificant.  See id.  We also noted the absence of a trialworthy\r\nshowing by Dr. Bragdon as to any direct threat.  See id. at 946-48. \r\nThe Supreme Court remanded to permit a reevaluation of the evidence\r\non this issue, and, in particular, a reexamination of the\r\nGuidelines and the Policy.  See Abbott III, 118 S. Ct. at 2211-13. \r\nIn doing so, the Court took pains to explain that its disposition\r\ndid not debar us from again reaching the same result.  See id. at\r\n2213.\r\n                           II\r\nIn compliance with the Court's directive, we have\r\nreexamined the evidence to determine whether summary judgment was\r\nwarranted.  In order to reverse our course, we would have to find,\r\ncontrary to our original intuition, either that (i) Ms. Abbott did\r\nnot merit judgment as a matter of law even in the absence of\r\ndisputed facts, or (ii) that Dr. Bragdon had submitted sufficient\r\nevidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to his\r\ndirect threat defense.  In our reexamination, we apply conventional\r\nsummary judgment jurisprudence, drawing all reasonable factual\r\ninferences in favor of Dr. Bragdon (as the party opposing brevisdisposition).  See Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 938 (citing Smith v. F.W.\r\nMorse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 428 (1st Cir. 1996)).  Despite the\r\nleniency of this approach, we do not indulge \"conclusory\r\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" \r\nMedina-Muoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).\r\n               A.  Ms. Abbott's Evidence.\r\nThe Supreme Court raised questions regarding whether the\r\nGuidelines, which state that use of the universal precautions\r\ntherein described \"should reduce the risk of disease transmission\r\nin the dental environment,\" necessarily imply that the reduction of\r\nrisk would be to a level below that required to show direct threat. \r\nAbbott III, 118 S. Ct. at 2211 (quoting Guidelines).  We have\r\nreconsidered this point.\r\nThe CDC did not write the 1993 Guidelines in a vacuum,\r\nbut, rather, updated earlier versions issued in 1986 and 1987,\r\nrespectively.  The 1986 text calls the universal precautions\r\n\"effective for preventing hepatitis B, acquired immunodeficiency\r\nsyndrome, and other infectious diseases caused by bloodborne\r\nviruses.\"  The 1987 edition explains that use of the universal\r\nprecautions eliminates the need for additional precautions that the\r\nCDC formerly had advocated for handling blood and other bodily\r\nfluids known or suspected to be infected with bloodborne pathogens. \r\nNeither the parties nor any of the amici have suggested that the\r\n1993 rewrite was intended to retreat from these earlier risk\r\nassessments, and we find no support for such a position in the\r\nGuidelines' text.  Thus, we have again determined that the\r\nGuidelines are competent evidence that public health authorities\r\nconsidered treatment of the kind that Ms. Abbott required to be\r\nsafe, if undertaken using universal precautions.\r\nSecond, the Court questioned the appropriate weight to\r\naccord the Policy, expressing concern that the Policy might be\r\nbased in whole or in part on the Association's view of dentists'\r\nethical obligations, rather than on a pure scientific assessment. \r\nSee Abbott III, 118 S. Ct. at 2211-12.  The supplemental briefing\r\nthat we requested yielded a cornucopia of information regarding the\r\nprocess by which the Policy was assembled.  We briefly recount the\r\nundisputed facts.\r\nThe Association formulates scientific and ethical\r\npolicies by separate procedures, drawing on different member groups\r\nand different staff complements.  The Association's Council on\r\nScientific Affairs, comprised of 17 dentists (most of whom hold\r\nadvanced dentistry degrees), together with a staff of over 20\r\nprofessional experts and consultants, drafted the Policy at issue\r\nhere.  By contrast, ethical policies are drafted by the Council on\r\nEthics, a wholly separate body.  Although the Association's House\r\nof Delegates must approve policies drafted by either council, we\r\nthink that the origins of the Policy satisfy any doubts regarding\r\nits scientific foundation.\r\nFor these reasons, we are confident that we appropriately\r\nrelied on the Guidelines and the Policy.  Moreover, as the Supreme\r\nCourt acknowledged, see id. at 2212, these two pieces of evidence\r\nrepresent only a fraction of the proof advanced to support Ms.\r\nAbbott's motion.  For example, she proffered the opinions of\r\nseveral prominent experts to the effect that, in 1994, the cavity-\r\nfilling procedure could have been performed safely in a private\r\ndental office, as well as proof that no public health authority\r\ntheretofore had issued warnings to health care providers\r\ndisfavoring this type of treatment for asymptomatic HIV-positive\r\npatients.  These materials, in and of themselves, likely suffice to\r\nprove Ms. Abbott's point.  Thus, we again conclude, after due\r\nreevaluation, that Ms. Abbott served a properly documented motion\r\nfor summary judgment.\r\n              B.  Dr. Bragdon's Evidence.\r\nWe next reconsider whether Dr. Bragdon offered sufficient\r\nproof of direct threat to create a genuine issue of material fact\r\nand thus avoid the entry of summary judgment.  In Abbott II, we\r\ncanvassed eight items of evidence adduced by Dr. Bragdon in an\r\neffort to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact.  See Abbott\r\nII, 107 F.3d at 946-48.  The Supreme Court suggested that one such\r\npiece of evidence   the seven cases that the CDC considered\r\n\"possible\" HIV patient-to-dental worker transmissions   should be\r\nreexamined.  See Abbott III, 118 S. Ct. at 2212.\r\nThe Court's concern revolved around how the word\r\n\"possible\" was understood in this context at the relevant time.  To\r\nframe the issue, the Court noted that the CDC marks an HIV case as\r\na \"possible\" occupational transmission if a stricken worker, who\r\nhad no other demonstrated opportunity for infection, simply failed\r\nto present himself for testing after being exposed to the virus at\r\nwork.  See id.  The Court speculated that if this definition of\r\n\"possible\" was not available in September 1994, the existence of\r\nseven \"possible\" cases \"might have provided some, albeit not\r\nnecessarily sufficient, support for [Dr. Bragdon's] position.\"  Id. \r\nIn other words, if a dentist knew of seven \"possible\" occupational\r\ntransmissions to dental workers without understanding that\r\n\"possible\" meant no more than that the CDC could not determine\r\nwhether workers were infected occupationally, he might reasonably\r\nregard the risk of treating an HIV-infected patient to be\r\nsignificant.\r\nUpon reexamination of the record, we find that the CDC's\r\ndefinition of the word \"possible,\" as used here, had been made\r\npublic during the relevant period.  The record contains two\r\nscientific articles published before Ms. Abbott entered Dr.\r\nBragdon's office which explained this definition.  See Louise J. \r\nShort &amp; David M. Bell, Risk of Occupational Infection With Blood-\r\nBorne Pathogens in Operating and Delivery Room Settings, 21 Am. J.\r\nInfection Control 343, 345 (1993); John A. Molinari, HIV, Health\r\nCare Workers and Patients:  How to Ensure Safety in the Dental\r\nOffice, 124 J. Am. Dental Ass'n 51, 51-52 (1993).  Since an\r\nobjective standard pertains here, see Abbott III, 118 S. Ct. at\r\n2211; Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 944, the existence of the list of\r\nseven \"possible\" cases does not create a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to direct threat.\r\nIn his supplemental briefing and oral argument, Dr.\r\nBragdon has drawn our attention again to the CDC's report of 42\r\ndocumented cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health-care\r\nworkers (none of whom were dental workers).  He repeats his\r\nargument that, because dental workers are subject to dangers\r\nsimilar to those faced by other health-care workers, these cases\r\ncan be extrapolated to create an issue of fact as to the degree of\r\nrisk to dental workers in September 1994.  We previously held that\r\nthis evidence was insufficient without a documented showing that\r\nthe risks to dentists and other health-care workers are comparable,\r\nsee Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 947, and the appellant offers us no\r\ncogent reason to change our view.  The Supreme Court did not\r\nquestion our position on this front, and Dr. Bragdon points to no\r\nrecord support that we previously might have overlooked.\r\nOur assessment of Dr. Bragdon's, and his amici's, other\r\nreprised arguments similarly remains unchanged.  Each piece of\r\nevidence to which they direct us is still \"too speculative or too\r\ntangential (or, in some instances, both) to create a genuine issue\r\nof material fact.\"  Id. at 948.\r\n                          III\r\nWe need go no further.  Upon reflection, we again find\r\nthat Dr. Bragdon did not submit evidence to the district court\r\ndemonstrating a genuine issue of material fact on the direct threat\r\nissue.  Absent such a showing, the district court appropriately\r\nentered summary judgment in favor of Ms. Abbott.  In espousing that\r\nview, we emphasize the case-specific nature of our determination. \r\nOur disposition is confined to the facts of record here (as they\r\nwere presented in the nisi prius court).  The state of scientific\r\nknowledge concerning this disease is evolving, and we caution\r\nfuture courts to consider carefully whether future litigants have\r\nbeen able, through scientific advances, more complete research, or\r\nspecial circumstances, to present facts and arguments warranting a\r\ndifferent decision.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

The Association's Council on\r\nScientific Affairs, comprised of 17 dentists (most of whom hold\r\nadvanced dentistry degrees), together with a staff of over 20\r\nprofessional experts and consultants, drafted the Policy at issue\r\nhere.  By contrast, ethical policies are drafted by the Council on\r\nEthics, a wholly separate body.  Although the Association's House\r\nof Delegates must approve policies drafted by either council, we\r\nthink that the origins of the Policy satisfy any doubts regarding\r\nits scientific foundation.\r\nFor these reasons, we are confident that we appropriately\r\nrelied on the Guidelines and the Policy.  Moreover, as the Supreme\r\nCourt acknowledged, see id. at 2212, these two pieces of evidence\r\nrepresent only a fraction of the proof advanced to support Ms.\r\nAbbott's motion.  For example, she proffered the opinions of\r\nseveral prominent experts to the effect that, in 1994, the cavity-\r\nfilling procedure could have been performed safely in a private\r\ndental office, as well as proof that no public health authority\r\ntheretofore had issued warnings to health care providers\r\ndisfavoring this type of treatment for asymptomatic HIV-positive\r\npatients.  These materials, in and of themselves, likely suffice to\r\nprove Ms. Abbott's point.  Thus, we again conclude, after due\r\nreevaluation, that Ms. Abbott served a properly documented motion\r\nfor summary judgment.\r\n              B.  Dr. Bragdon's Evidence.\r\nWe next reconsider whether Dr. Bragdon offered sufficient\r\nproof of direct threat to create a genuine issue of material fact\r\nand thus avoid the entry of summary judgment.  In Abbott II, we\r\ncanvassed eight items of evidence adduced by Dr. Bragdon in an\r\neffort to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact.  See Abbott\r\nII, 107 F.3d at 946-48.  The Supreme Court suggested that one such\r\npiece of evidence   the seven cases that the CDC considered\r\n\"possible\" HIV patient-to-dental worker transmissions   should be\r\nreexamined.  See Abbott III, 118 S. Ct. at 2212.\r\nThe Court's concern revolved around how the word\r\n\"possible\" was understood in this context at the relevant time.  To\r\nframe the issue, the Court noted that the CDC marks an HIV case as\r\na \"possible\" occupational transmission if a stricken worker, who\r\nhad no other demonstrated opportunity for infection, simply failed\r\nto present himself for testing after being exposed to the virus at\r\nwork.  See id.  The Court speculated that if this definition of\r\n\"possible\" was not available in September 1994, the existence of\r\nseven \"possible\" cases \"might have provided some, albeit not\r\nnecessarily sufficient, support for [Dr. Bragdon's] position.\"  Id. \r\nIn other words, if a dentist knew of seven \"possible\" occupational\r\ntransmissions to dental workers without understanding that\r\n\"possible\" meant no more than that the CDC could not determine\r\nwhether workers were infected occupationally, he might reasonably\r\nregard the risk of treating an HIV-infected patient to be\r\nsignificant.\r\nUpon reexamination of the record, we find that the CDC's\r\ndefinition of the word \"possible,\" as used here, had been made\r\npublic during the relevant period.  The record contains two\r\nscientific articles published before Ms. Abbott entered Dr.\r\nBragdon's office which explained this definition.  See Louise J. \r\nShort &amp; David M. Bell, Risk of Occupational Infection With Blood-\r\nBorne Pathogens in Operating and Delivery Room Settings, 21 Am. J.\r\nInfection Control 343, 345 (1993); John A. Molinari, HIV, Health\r\nCare Workers and Patients:  How to Ensure Safety in the Dental\r\nOffice, 124 J. Am. Dental Ass'n 51, 51-52 (1993).  Since an\r\nobjective standard pertains here, see Abbott III, 118 S. Ct. at\r\n2211; Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 944, the existence of the list of\r\nseven \"possible\" cases does not create a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to direct threat.\r\nIn his supplemental briefing and oral argument, Dr.\r\nBragdon has drawn our attention again to the CDC's report of 42\r\ndocumented cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health-care\r\nworkers (none of whom were dental workers).  He repeats his\r\nargument that, because dental workers are subject to dangers\r\nsimilar to those faced by other health-care workers, these cases\r\ncan be extrapolated to create an issue of fact as to the degree of\r\nrisk to dental workers in September 1994.  We previously held that\r\nthis evidence was insufficient without a documented showing that\r\nthe risks to dentists and other health-care workers are comparable,\r\nsee Abbott II, 107 F.3d at 947, and the appellant offers us no\r\ncogent reason to change our view.  The Supreme Court did not\r\nquestion our position on this front, and Dr. Bragdon points to no\r\nrecord support that we previously might have overlooked.\r\nOur assessment of Dr. Bragdon's, and his amici's, other\r\nreprised arguments similarly remains unchanged.  Each piece of\r\nevidence to which they direct us is still \"too speculative or too\r\ntangential (or, in some instances, both) to create a genuine issue\r\nof material fact.\"  Id. at 948.\r\n                          III\r\nWe need go no further.  Upon reflection, we again find\r\nthat Dr. Bragdon did not submit evidence to the district court\r\ndemonstrating a genuine issue of material fact on the direct threat\r\nissue.  Absent such a showing, the district court appropriately\r\nentered summary judgment in favor of Ms. Abbott.  In espousing that\r\nview, we emphasize the case-specific nature of our determination. \r\nOur disposition is confined to the facts of record here (as they\r\nwere presented in the nisi prius court).  The state of scientific\r\nknowledge concerning this disease is evolving, and we caution\r\nfuture courts to consider carefully whether future litigants have\r\nbeen able, through scientific advances, more complete research, or\r\nspecial circumstances, to present facts and arguments warranting a\r\ndifferent decision.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
