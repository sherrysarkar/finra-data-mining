We affirm.\r\n\n          On December  28, 1990,  Morales, her  husband, Jos   F.\r\n\nRodr guez (\"Rodr guez\"),  and their conjugal  partnership filed a\r\n\ncomplaint in the District Court of Puerto Rico against Rodr guez'\r\n\nformer employer, Prudential, seeking  redress in connection  with\r\n\nthe  brokerage firm's  February 1990 closing  of its  Puerto Rico\r\n\nsubsidiary and  its termination  of Rodr guez'  employment.   The\r\n\nplaintiffs  asserted  seven  causes  of  action  arising  out  of\r\n\nPrudential's  alleged  wrongful  termination  of its  contractual\r\n\nrelationship with Rodr guez.   Six of the seven  causes of action\r\n\nwere brought on behalf of Rodr guez and the conjugal partnership.\r\n\nThe remaining  cause of  action sought  compensation on  Morales'\r\n\nbehalf for damages she suffered as a  result of the direct injury\r\n\nto her husband by Prudential.\r\n\n          The  district court ordered the parties to proceed with\r\n\narbitration  of  all  claims pertaining  to  Rodr guez  before an\r\n\narbitration panel of  the New York Stock Exchange  (\"NYSE\").  The\r\n\ndistrict  court stayed  the claims  of Morales  and  the conjugal\r\n\npartnership  pending the outcome  of the arbitration.   Rodr guez\r\n\nand the conjugal  partnership arbitrated their claims  before the\r\n\nNYSE, and the arbitration panel awarded him $1,014,250 plus costs\r\n\nand attorney's fees  in full and final settlement  of all claims.\r\n\nThereafter, Prudential's petitioned the district court  to vacate\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthe award, but  the court entered judgment for  Rodr guez and the\r\n\nother claimants.   See Rodr guez v. Prudential-Bache  Sec., Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n882 F. Supp. 1202 (D.P.R. 1995).  On appeal, this  court affirmed\r\n\nthe district court's judgment.  See Rodr guez v. Prudential-Bache\r                                                                           \r\n\nSec., Inc., 72  F.3d 234 (1st Cir.  1995).  Prudential then  paid\r                    \r\n\nRodr guez his arbitration award.\r\n\n          In  her subsequent motion for partial summary judgment,\r\n\nMorales argued  that since the  arbitrators rendered an  award in\r\n\nfavor  of Rodr guez,  and  since  her claims  were  based on  his\r\n\nwrongful termination,  the arbitration panel adjudicated  all the\r\n\nfacts  necessary to  find  Prudential liable  to  Morales on  her\r\n\nclaims.   Thus, according to  appellant, the only issue remaining\r\n\nwas the  extent of  damages and  the corresponding  compensation.\r\n\nThe district  court  dismissed  Morales'  complaint  and  granted\r\n\nPrudential's cross motion for summary judgment.  Morales appeals.\r\n\n          We  find  the  district court's  well-reasoned  opinion\r\n\npersuasive, and  we affirm  on the grounds  stated therein.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodr guez  v.  Prudential-Bache Sec.,  Inc., No.  90-2659 (D.P.R.\r                                                     \r\n\nJanuary  23, 1997).   We  write only  to emphasize  that Morales'\r\n\nclaims arose directly from Prudential's termination of Rodr guez'\r\n\nemployment in  violation of  Law 80,  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  29,  \r\n\n185a, et seq., which provides an exclusive remedy for an employee\r                                                    \r\n\nwho  has been  discharged without  just cause.   As  the district\r\n\ncourt noted, \"[h]er claims are directly derived, and inextricably\r\n\nintertwined with the  employment dispute  between Prudential  and\r\n\nher husband,   Jos   Rodr guez.\"   Consequently, her  attempts to\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nassert an  independent cause of  action for damages  under Puerto\r\n\nRico's  general tort  statute, Art.  1802  of the  Civil Code  of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   5141, are unavailing.\r\n\n          Morales might have had a  viable cause of action if she\r\n\nalleged  tortious acts by Prudential independent of her husband's\r\n\ndismissal.  In Pujol v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 829 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1201 (1st  Cir. 1987),  a husband and  wife, individually  and as\r\n\nrepresentatives  of   their  conjugal  partnership,   appealed  a\r\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of their  motion  for  partial summary\r\n\njudgment  against  an   employer.    This  court   held  that  an\r\n\narbitration award under  the husband's employment contract  stood\r\n\nas  res  judicata  with  respect  to  the  husband  and  conjugal\r\n\npartnership's claims, which were already arbitrated or could have\r\n\nbeen raised at the arbitration proceeding.  See id. at 1206-08.\r                                                            \r\n\n          However, the Pujol court  allowed the wife \"to  sue for\r                                      \r\n\ndirect injury to  her property and herself.\"   829 F.2d at  1209.\r\n\nThis court observed that \"[i]f [the wife] can prove that personal\r\n\npapers, documents and property belonging to her, as distinct from\r                                                                           \r\n\nher husband  or the conjugal  partnership, were subjected  to the\r                                                   \r\n\ntreatment alleged, then she  has stated a cause of  action.\"  Id.\r                                                                          \r\n\nat  1208 (emphasis  added).    In the  instant  case, any  injury\r\n\nalleged  by Morales resulted from Prudential's conduct toward her\r\n\nhusband rather than from any acts committed directly against her.\r\n\nUltimately,  Morales has failed to assert any independent factual\r\n\nbasis  for recovery  distinct from  her  husband or  the conjugal\r\n\npartnership.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          Costs to be assessed against appellant.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  \r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n",

We  write only  to emphasize  that Morales'\r\n\nclaims arose directly from Prudential's termination of Rodr guez'\r\n\nemployment in  violation of  Law 80,  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  29,  \r\n\n185a, et seq., which provides an exclusive remedy for an employee\r                                                    \r\n\nwho  has been  discharged without  just cause.   As  the district\r\n\ncourt noted, \"[h]er claims are directly derived, and inextricably\r\n\nintertwined with the  employment dispute  between Prudential  and\r\n\nher husband,   Jos   Rodr guez.\"   Consequently, her  attempts to\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nassert an  independent cause of  action for damages  under Puerto\r\n\nRico's  general tort  statute, Art.  1802  of the  Civil Code  of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   5141, are unavailing.\r\n\n          Morales might have had a  viable cause of action if she\r\n\nalleged  tortious acts by Prudential independent of her husband's\r\n\ndismissal.  In Pujol v.

This  court   held  that  an\r\n\narbitration award under  the husband's employment contract  stood\r\n\nas  res  judicata  with  respect  to  the  husband  and  conjugal\r\n\npartnership's claims, which were already arbitrated or could have\r\n\nbeen raised at the arbitration proceeding.  See id. at 1206-08.\r                                                            \r\n\n          However, the Pujol court  allowed the wife \"to  sue for\r                                      \r\n\ndirect injury to  her property and herself.\"   829 F.2d at  1209.\r\n\nThis court observed that \"[i]f [the wife] can prove that personal\r\n\npapers, documents and property belonging to her, as distinct from\r                                                                           \r\n\nher husband  or the conjugal  partnership, were subjected  to the\r                                                   \r\n\ntreatment alleged, then she  has stated a cause of  action.\"  Id.\r                                                                          \r\n\nat  1208 (emphasis  added).    In the  instant  case, any  injury\r\n\nalleged  by Morales resulted from Prudential's conduct toward her\r\n\nhusband rather than from any acts committed directly against her.\r\n\nUltimately,  Morales has failed to assert any independent factual\r\n\nbasis  for recovery  distinct from  her  husband or  the conjugal\r\n\npartnership.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          Costs to be assessed against appellant.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  \r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n</pre>",
