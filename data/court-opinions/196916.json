At the disposition hearing, the district court departed\r\n\nupward from the guideline sentencing  range to impose a  sentence\r\n\nof life  imprisonment.1  Carrion-Cruz assigns error to the upward\r\n\ndeparture.\r\n\n          We  have  carefully  examined  the  transcript  of  the\r\n\ndisposition hearing,  the presentence  investigation report,  and\r\n\nthe  briefs.  Since we are persuaded that the assignment of error\r\n\nlacks merit, we  summarily affirm.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.  We add\r                                                 \r\n\nonly four brief comments.\r\n\n          First:   U.S.S.G.   5K2.0 allows  sentencing courts  to\r                         \r\n\ndepart from the guideline sentencing range in a given case if the\r\n\ncourt finds aggravating  or mitigating circumstances  that render\r\n\nthe case atypical  and take it out  of the \"heartland\"  for which\r\n\nthe  applicable guideline  was designed.    See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nQuinones,  26 F.3d  213, 216  (1st Cir.  1994); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRivera, 994 F.2d 942, 946 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v.

Here,  the  multiple killings  for which  the\r\n\ndefendant was responsible      murdering four individuals (two of\r\n\nwhom  were good samaritans  who had stopped  to offer assistance)\r\n\nwithin an  abbreviated time frame      transport  the defendant's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In effect, the  court raised the defendant's  offense level\r\nby three levels (from 40 to 43).  Even for a first-time offender,\r\nOffense Level 43  commands a sentence of life  imprisonment.  See\r                                                                           \r\nU.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nactivities well  outside the mine-run  of carjacking cases.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.  5K2.1 (encouraging courts  to consider upward departure\r\n\nfrom the otherwise  applicable guideline sentencing range  if the\r\n\nrelevant offense conduct results in multiple deaths).\r\n\n          Second:   The defendant points to his youth and limited\r                          \r\n\nintellect as mitigating  factors.  But his counsel  made much the\r\n\nsame  argument  below,   and  the  district   judge  specifically\r\n\ncommented upon  these factors in  passing sentence and  took full\r\n\naccount of them.   Given the sentencing court's  special coign of\r\n\nvantage,  see Diaz-Villafane,  874 F.2d  at 49,  we cannot  brush\r                                      \r\n\naside  that  court's  considered judgment  on  so  interstitial a\r\n\nmatter.\r\n\n          Third:  The defendant's challenge to the reasonableness\r                         \r\n\nof the upward departure is  unavailing.  Offense Level 40 permits\r\n\nsentences of up to 365 months for first offenders.  The magnitude\r\n\nof the ensuing  departure     to  a life sentence (Offense  Level\r\n\n43)     is reasonable, considering the sordid facts of the  case.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Quinones, 26 F.3d  at 218 (explaining that  \"unusually\r                             \r\n\nbrutal, cruel, and degrading treatment\" of victims \"is emblematic\r\n\nof the  very sort  of sociopathic behavior\"  that will  sustain a\r\n\nsubstantial  upward departure).   The  departure  here meets  any\r\n\nconceivable  test  of   reasonableness.    See,  id.   at  219-20\r                                                              \r\n\n(upholding 60% increase as  reasonable); Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 52  (upholding departure  that more  than doubled  defendant's\r\n\nsentence as reasonable). \r\n\n          Fourth:  Relatedly, the Supreme Court's  recent opinion\r                          \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nin Koon  v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4512 (U.S. June 13, 1996),\r                                   \r\n\nmakes it  clear that we  must respect a district  court's special\r\n\ncompetence in sentencing  matters, see id. at 4516-17, and uphold\r                                                    \r\n\na departure sentence unless the court has  abused its discretion,\r\n\nsee id.  at 4517.   In light of  the stark  facts of this  brutal\r                 \r\n\ncrime, a convincing  case of discretion  abused simply cannot  be\r\n\nmustered.\r\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.2    The  Supreme  Court  has\r\n\ninstructed us that \"it  is not the role of an  appellate court to\r\n\nsubstitute its  judgment for that  of the sentencing court  as to\r\n\nthe  appropriateness  of  a particular  sentence.\"    Williams v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States, 503  U.S. 193, 205  (1992) (citation and  internal\r                       \r\n\nquotation marks omitted).  In  essence, the defendant invites  us\r\n\nto contravene that precept.  On these facts, we have no reason to\r\n\ntake so precipitous a step.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Because  the upward  departure is  fully  justified by  the\r\nincidence of multiple deaths, we  need not address the sentencing\r\ncourt's alternative justifications for the sentence.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n",

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span> (1989).  Here, the multiple killings for which the defendant was responsible--murdering four individuals (two of whom were good samaritans who had stopped to offer assistance) within an abbreviated time frame--transport the defendant's activities well outside the mine-run of carjacking cases.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.1 (encouraging courts to consider upward departure from the otherwise applicable guideline sentencing range if the relevant offense conduct results in multiple deaths).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  The defendant points to his youth and limited intellect as mitigating factors.  But his counsel made much the same argument below, and the district judge specifically commented upon these factors in passing sentence and took full account of them.  Given the sentencing court's special coign of vantage, see Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49, we cannot brush aside that court's considered judgment on so interstitial a matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  The defendant's challenge to the reasonableness of the upward departure is unavailing.  Offense Level 40 permits sentences of up to 365 months for first offenders.  The magnitude of the ensuing departure--to a life sentence (Offense Level 43)--is reasonable, considering the sordid facts of the case.  See, e.g., Quinones, 26 F.3d at 218 (explaining that \"unusually brutal, cruel, and degrading treatment\" of victims \"is emblematic of the very sort of sociopathic behavior\" that will sustain a substantial upward departure).  The departure here meets any conceivable test of reasonableness.  See, id. at 219-20 (upholding 60% increase as reasonable);   Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 52 (upholding departure that more than doubled defendant's sentence as reasonable).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  Relatedly, the Supreme Court's recent opinion in  Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996), makes it clear that we must respect a district court's special competence in sentencing matters, see id. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2044-48, and uphold a departure sentence unless the court has abused its discretion, see id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-48.   In light of the stark facts of this brutal crime, a convincing case of discretion abused simply cannot be mustered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Supreme Court has instructed us that \"it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.\"   Williams v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 205, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span> (1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In essence, the defendant invites us to contravene that precept.  On these facts, we have no reason to take so precipitous a step.

Even for a first-time offender, Offense Level 43 commands a sentence of life imprisonment.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because the upward departure is fully justified by the incidence of multiple deaths, we need not address the sentencing court's alternative justifications for the sentence</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
