Donald Sullivan appeals from the\n\njudgment of the district court granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor   of    his   employer,    Raytheon,    on   claims   of     employment\n\ndiscrimination and violations of the Employee Retired Income\n\nSecurity     Act    (ERISA).       Sullivan     alleges     that       Raytheon\n\ndiscriminated against him on the basis of disability and age in\n\nrefusing to reinstate him to his position at Raytheon.                 Sullivan\n\nalso argues that Raytheon's failure to reinstate him constituted\n\ndiscriminatory      retaliation     for     Sullivan's    application       for\n\nworkers' compensation benefits and his filing a charge with the\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD).                      In\n\naddition,     Sullivan   asserts     that     Raytheon    and    the     claims\n\nadministrator of Raytheon's long term disability benefits plan,\n\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), wrongly denied\n\nhis application for disability benefits and violated ERISA in\n\nnot furnishing him documents about Raytheon's disability plan.\n\nFinding no error in the determinations of the district court, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n             Sullivan began his employment as a security guard with\n\nRaytheon in 1965.        Between 1971 and 1990, he suffered seven\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\findustrial accidents that caused injuries to his neck, lower\n\nback, and legs.       Sullivan sought medical treatment for some of\n\nthese injuries and occasionally missed work.                  Shortly after\n\nSullivan's seventh accident in 1990, his absenteeism from work\n\nincreased.    After giving him a written warning in June 1990 and\n\nimposing a suspension for abuse of Raytheon's sick leave policy\n\nin September 1991, Raytheon terminated Sullivan's employment on\n\nMarch 31, 1992.\n\n            Sullivan filed a grievance pursuant to the collective\n\nbargaining    agreement      between     Raytheon    and    his    union,    the\n\nRaytheon     Guards    Association      (the    Union),     challenging      his\n\ntermination.       After a hearing on August 10, 1995, the arbitrator\n\nfound that Sullivan had been terminated without just cause.\n\nHowever,    noting    that   \"on   a   current    and    prospective   basis,\n\n[Sullivan] is not able to work,\" the arbitrator ordered Sullivan\n\nreinstated retroactive to March 31, 1992 on \"inactive employment\n\nstatus\" so that Sullivan could apply for disability benefits\n\nunder Raytheon's long term disability plan (the LTD plan).\n\nShortly    after    the   arbitrator's       decision,   Sullivan    wrote    to\n\nRaytheon     and     requested     information      about    the    long-term\n\ndisability plan so that he could apply for benefits.\n\n            Under Raytheon's LTD plan, benefits are payable for\n\ntwenty-four months for an employee who is \"fully disabled\"; they\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fare   payable   indefinitely     for      an    employee     who     is    \"totally\n\ndisabled.\"      In   statements      provided        to    plan    participants,\n\nemployees are informed that they are fully disabled if \"because\n\nof a sickness or an injury you cannot do your job.\"                     An employee\n\nis totally disabled if \"because of sickness or injury: (a) you\n\ncan not do your job; and (b) you can not do any other job for\n\nwhich you are fit by your education, your training, or your\n\nexperience.\"\n\n          Sullivan     submitted       an      application        for     long-term\n\ndisability benefits in November 1995.                     MetLife, the claims\n\nadministrator      responsible      for     determining      a     participant's\n\neligibility under the plan, denied his claim in March 1996.\n\nMetlife   stated     that   there    was       \"inadequate        evidence    of   a\n\ndisabling condition that would prevent him from performing his\n\noccupation as a Guard from April 1, 1992 through the present.\"\n\nIn addition, MetLife concluded that Sullivan's application for\n\nbenefits was untimely.      Sullivan appealed the denial of benefits\n\nto MetLife.\n\n          Sullivan     also    applied         for   workers'       compensation\n\nbenefits.1    On August 4, 1994, an administrative law judge for\n\n\n      1\n      It is not clear from the record when Sullivan applied for\nworkers' compensation.     Because the decision awarding him\nbenefits states that Sullivan's claim was conferenced on July\n18, 1994, we assume that his application was dated prior to that\ntime.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) found\n\nthat Sullivan was partially disabled as of March 22, 1992, and\n\ntotally disabled as of October 12, 1994.       Sullivan received\n\nworkers' compensation benefits until 1998, when he exhausted his\n\nentitlement to them.\n\n         Sullivan requested reinstatement to Raytheon by letter\n\ndated June 18, 1996.   In that letter, he stated that either he\n\nwas totally disabled, in which case he should receive long-term\n\ndisability benefits, or he was not disabled, in which case he\n\nsought reinstatement to a position with or without reasonable\n\naccommodation.   By letter dated July 10, 1996, Raytheon advised\n\nSullivan that it would not consider reinstating him until after\n\nMetLife considered Sullivan's appeal from its denial of his\n\nclaim for benefits.    Sullivan filed a charge of discrimination\n\nwith the MCAD on October 9, 1996.\n\n         On October 17, 1997, MetLife determined that Sullivan\n\nwas fully disabled for the first twenty-four months of his\n\ndisability through April 30, 1994 because he was not capable of\n\nperforming his job as a security guard, and thus entitled to\n\nbenefits during that time.2   In this respect, MetLife's decision\n\n\n    2 Although MetLife stated in its letter of October 1997 that\nit was \"reinstating\" Sullivan's claim to benefits through April\n30, 1994 because he was fully disabled, he did not actually\nreceive any benefits under the plan because his social security\nbenefits and workers' compensation benefits reduced his benefits\n\n                               -5-\n\fof October 1997 differed from its denial of benefits in March\n\n1996.   However, MetLife affirmed its previous determination that\n\nSullivan was not totally disabled because he was not disabled\n\nfrom all occupations for which he was fit by his training or\n\nexperience.         Accordingly,   MetLife    terminated     his     benefits.\n\nSullivan's appeal of that determination to MetLife was denied.\n\n              Sullivan filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court on\n\nNovember      3,   1998.   His   three-count     complaint    included       the\n\nfollowing claims: (1) that Raytheon discriminated against him on\n\nthe basis of disability and age and engaged in discriminatory\n\nretaliation in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B; (2) that\n\nRaytheon      retaliated    against     him    for   filing      a    worker's\n\ncompensation claim in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, ยง\n\n75B;    and   (3)   that   Raytheon   violated    his   rights       under   the\n\nEmployees Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1140.    Raytheon removed the case to federal district court.\n\n              In October 1999, the district court granted Raytheon's\n\nmotion to dismiss the retaliation claims in count one and two.\n\nBecause the parties submitted evidence outside the pleadings in\n\narguing this motion, we treat the district court's ruling as one\n\non summary judgment.       See Davis v. Lucent Tech., Inc., 251 F.3d\n\n227, 231 (1st Cir. 2001).          The district court granted summary\n\n\nunder the plan to zero.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fjudgment in favor of Raytheon on the remaining counts in October\n\n2000.   Sullivan appeals these rulings.\n\n                        II. Claims of Discrimination\n\n            Sullivan         argues     that       the   district      court    erred   in\n\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on his claims of\n\ndisability and age discrimination and retaliation.                             We review\n\nthe district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, viewing\n\nthe   record     in    the    light         most    favorable    to    Sullivan.        See\n\nSantiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46,\n\n52 (1st Cir. 2000).            \"Summary judgment is appropriate only if\n\n'there is no genuine issue as to any material fact' and 'the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\" Id.\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)).\n\nA. Disability Discrimination\n\n            To    establish         a       prima     facie     case    of     disability\n\ndiscrimination under chapter 151B of Massachusetts law, Sullivan\n\nmust demonstrate that he is a \"qualified handicapped person.\"\n\nSee August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., 981 F.2d 576, 580 (1st\n\nCir. 1992); Labonte v. Hutchins & Wheeler, 678 N.E.2d 853, 859\n\n(Mass. 1997).         Chapter 151B defines this term as \"a handicapped\n\nperson who is capable of performing the essential functions of\n\na particular job, or who would be capable of performing the\n\nessential      functions       of       a    particular       job      with    reasonable\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\faccommodation to his handicap.\"                 Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, ยง\n\n1(16).   Thus, Sullivan must demonstrate that he is capable of\n\nperforming,    with      or    without    reasonable        accommodation,       the\n\nessential    functions        of   the   position      of   security     guard    at\n\nRaytheon.\n\n            As the district court noted in its written memorandum\n\nand order, Sullivan has \"continually and consistently claimed\n\nthat he was totally disabled.\"               In a 1994 deposition, Sullivan\n\nstated that he believed he was totally disabled from March 1992\n\n(when Raytheon terminated his employment) to the present time.\n\nIn another deposition six years later, Sullivan stated that his\n\ncondition    had    stayed     the    same     or   worsened     since   his   1994\n\ndeposition.    Sullivan also represented that he was disabled in\n\napplications       for   social      security       disability    insurance      and\n\nworkers' compensation benefits.                Additionally, he stated on his\n\ntax returns for the years 1995 through 1998 that his occupation\n\nwas \"disabled.\"\n\n            These claims of disability do not necessarily preclude\n\nSullivan's ability to argue now that he is capable of performing\n\nhis job with reasonable accommodation.                See Cleveland v. Policy\n\nMgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 797 (1999) (holding that pursuit\n\nof benefits under Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)\n\n\"does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fclaim\").      However, to defeat Raytheon's motion for summary\n\njudgment, Sullivan must explain why the representations of total\n\ndisability he has made in the past are consistent with his\n\ncurrent claim that he could perform the essential functions of\n\na security guard at Raytheon with reasonable accommodation.                 See\n\nid.   at   798   (\"To   survive   a     defendant's    motion     for   summary\n\njudgment, [the plaintiff] must explain why that SSDI contention\n\nis consistent with her ADA claim that she could 'perform the\n\nessential     functions'    of    her    previous     job,   at   least   with\n\n'reasonable accommodation.'\"). Sullivan has offered no evidence\n\nto explain this discrepancy.             Accordingly, Sullivan has not\n\ndemonstrated that he is a \"qualified handicapped person\" for\n\npurposes of chapter 151B, and summary judgment in favor of\n\nRaytheon was proper.        See August, 981 F.2d at 584 (\"Having\n\nconceded that he was totally disabled at all relevant times,\n\n[the plaintiff] cannot now establish that he was a 'qualified\n\nhandicapped person' and thus cannot make the prima facie case\n\nrequired to prevail on his claim under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B,\n\nยง 4(16).\").      Compare D'Aprile v. Fleet Servs. Corp., 92 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting the reasoning of August where the\n\nplaintiff \"never claimed to have been totally disabled during\n\nthe time she requested her accommodation, and demonstrated her\n\nability to work with the accommodation she requested\").\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f          Sullivan also contends that the district court erred\n\nin granting summary judgment because Raytheon did not engage in\n\n\"an   interactive    process\"    with    Sullivan   to   determine   an\n\nappropriate accommodation that would allow him to return to his\n\nposition as a security guard.     As Raytheon points out, the ADA's\n\ninterpretive regulations \"may require an employer 'to initiate\n\nan informal, interactive process' with the individual seeking\n\naccommodation.\"     Soto-Ocasio v. Federal Express Corp., 150 F.3d\n\n14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting 29 C.F.R. ยง 1630.2(o)(3)).\n\nHowever, there is no such requirement under Massachusetts law in\n\nchapter 151B.    Moreover, even if Raytheon were required to have\n\nengaged Sullivan in such an interactive process, we found in\n\nSoto-Ocasio that an interactive process is not necessary where,\n\nas here, no reasonable trier of fact could have found that the\n\nemployee was capable of performing the job, with or without\n\nreasonable      accommodation,     for    which     he   was   seeking\n\nreinstatement.      See id.     Because Sullivan has presented no\n\nevidence to indicate that he was capable of returning to work as\n\na security guard, even with a reasonable accommodation, Raytheon\n\nwas not required to engage with him in an interactive process.\n\nB. Age Discrimination\n\n          Sullivan also appeals the district court's entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Raytheon on his claim of age\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fdiscrimination   under    Mass.   Gen.   Laws   ch.   151B,   ยง   4(1B). 3\n\nSullivan alleged in his complaint that he was more than forty\n\nyears old at the time Raytheon refused to reinstate him and that\n\nRaytheon \"hired younger persons to fill positions for which\n\nSullivan was qualified to fill.\"         To establish a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination under this statute, Sullivan must prove\n\n\"by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was a member of\n\nthe protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position in\n\nquestion; (3) he was denied the position; and (4) his employer\n\nsought to fill the position by hiring a younger individual with\n\nqualifications similar to those of the plaintiff.\"            Lehman v.\n\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 74 F.3d 323, 327-28 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(footnote omitted).      As we have explained in our discussion of\n\nhis claim for disability discrimination, Sullivan failed to show\n\nthat he was qualified for the position he sought at Raytheon.\n\nAccordingly, he cannot establish a prima facie case of age\n\ndiscrimination, and the district court properly entered judgment\n\nin favor of Raytheon.\n\n\n\n    3 Chapter 151B, ยง 4(1B) provides that it is unlawful \"[f]or\nan employer in the private sector, by himself or his agent,\nbecause of the age of any individual, to refuse to hire or\nemploy or to bar or to discharge from employment such\nindividual, or to discriminate against such individual in\ncompensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of\nemployment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational\nqualification.\"\n\n                                  -11-\n\fC. Discriminatory Retaliation\n\n           1. Retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination\n\n           Sullivan further claims that Raytheon violated his\n\nrights under chapter 151B, ยง 4(4)4 by engaging in retaliatory\n\ndiscrimination in not reinstating him after he filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination with the MCAD.          To establish a prima facie case\n\nfor retaliation, Sullivan had to show that: (1) he engaged in\n\nconduct protected under Massachusetts or federal law; (2) he\n\n\"suffered an adverse employment action\"; and (3) \"a causal\n\nconnection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse\n\naction.\"   McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty\n\nto Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 309 (1st Cir. 1998).                 Sullivan's claim\n\nfalters    on    the   third   prong   of   this        test.     He     has    not\n\ndemonstrated a causal connection between his protected conduct\n\n- filing a charge of discrimination with the Massachusetts\n\nCommission      Against   Discrimination      in    October       1996     -    and\n\nRaytheon's      refusal   to   reinstate    him    to    his    position       as   a\n\nsecurity guard in July 1996.           Indeed, Sullivan concedes this\n\nchronology in the facts section of his brief when he states:\n\n\"When Sullivan was not given disability benefits, and was not\n\nreinstated to a suitable position at Raytheon, he filed a Charge\n\n\n    4 Chapter 151, ยง 4(4) makes it illegal for an employer \"to\ndischarge, expel or otherwise discriminate against any person\nbecause he has . . . filed a complaint.\"\n\n                                    -12-\n\fof Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission against\n\nDiscrimination   on    October    9,   1996.\"   Because   Sullivan's\n\nprotected action - filing a charge of discrimination - occurred\n\nafter the adverse employment action, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on the\n\nretaliation claim.\n\n         2. Retaliation for filing for workers' compensation\n\n         Sullivan also claims that the district court should not\n\nhave dismissed his claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, ยง 75B.5\n\nSection 75B \"bars discrimination against qualified handicapped\n\nworkers exercising their rights under the workers' compensation\n\nlaw, which includes procedures for filing claims for injuries,\n\nreceiving payments, and determining re-employment.\"       Fant v. New\n\nEngland Power Serv. Co., 239 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2001).         The\n\ndistrict court found that this state law claim was preempted\n\nunder section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA),\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 185.6     We agree.\n\n\n\n    5  Chapter 152, ยง 75B provides in pertinent part: \"No\nemployer or duly authorized agent of an employer shall\ndischarge, refuse to hire or in any other manner discriminate\nagainst an employee because the employee has exercised a right\nafforded by this chapter.\" Mass.

Fant, 239 F.3d at 14.              See also Magerer, 912 F.2d at\n\n529 (\"[S]uch claims [under section 75B] are, by the express\n\nterms of the statute, subject to the terms of any applicable\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\").                  The statute provides: \"In\n\nthe    event    that       any    right    set    forth   in    this    section       is\n\ninconsistent with an applicable collective bargaining agreement,\n\nsuch agreement shall prevail.\"                    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, ยง\n\n75B(3).       We have said that this language\n\n              makes clear that to the extent that the\n              collective bargaining agreement provides\n              standards to govern the conduct underlying\n              plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim, the\n              claim will be governed by the standards of\n              the agreement, rather than by the standards\n              of ch. 152 ยง 75B.      And to that extent,\n              claims under section 75B will require\n              interpretation   of   the   agreement   and,\n              therefore, will be preempted by Section 301.\n\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\fMagerer, 912 F.2d at 529.        We need not find explicitly that the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement at issue here is inconsistent\n\nwith section 75B to find Sullivan's claim under that statute\n\npreempted.     See Fant, 239 F.3d at 16.     In similar circumstances,\n\nwe have found claims under section 75B preempted \"not because\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the\n\nstate claims asserted, but because it may be so and requires\n\ninterpretation.\"      Martin v. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc., 105 F.3d\n\n40, 44 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Fant, 239 F.3d at 16 (finding\n\nretaliation claim brought under section 75B preempted by the\n\nLMRA).\n\n             Here,   the   collective   bargaining      agreement   between\n\nRaytheon and the Union contained a management rights clause\n\nproviding that \"the management and control of the Company's\n\nbusiness and operations, working force and plant, as well as the\n\ndirection, supervision and assignment of duties of the Guards,\n\nis vested exclusively in the management of the Company.\"               This\n\nbroad grant of supervisory discretion to Raytheon could conflict\n\nwith   the    provisions    of   section   75B   that    place   limits   on\n\nRaytheon's ability to refuse to reinstate employees after they\n\nhave filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits.              Because\n\nwe would have to interpret the agreement to determine whether\n\nthis clause conflicts with section 75B, Sullivan's claim is\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fpreempted.       See Martin, 105 F.3d at 43-44 (finding claim under\n\nchapter 75B preempted because of a potential conflict with the\n\nmanagement       rights     clause       of     the        collective      bargaining\n\nagreement); Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530 (finding that management\n\nrights       clause    \"could    be    construed          to   govern   the     conduct\n\nunderlying        plaintiff's          retaliatory             discharge       claim\").\n\nTherefore,       the    district        court        correctly     concluded       that\n\nSullivan's section 75B claim was preempted by ยง 301 of the LMRA.\n\n              We have recognized that this outcome - finding a claim\n\nunder chapter 75B preempted because of a potential conflict with\n\nthe     management      rights    clause        in    a    collective      bargaining\n\nagreement - seems \"faintly troubling.\"                     Martin, 105 F.3d at 44.\n\nHowever, the union may bargain to avoid this outcome in the\n\nfuture:\n\n              If all else fails, the union is free to\n              negotiate language that eliminates this\n              issue the next time it renews its labor\n              agreement. . . . All that it would take to\n              prevent preemption is an explicit provision\n              stating that nothing in the agreement is\n              intended   to   create  management   rights\n              inconsistent with any workers' rights under\n              sections 75A and 75B.\n\nId.     Moreover, even if we found that Sullivan's claim under\n\nchapter 75B was not preempted, no rational factfinder could\n\ninfer    a    discriminatory          animus    on    Raytheon's        part    because\n\nRaytheon refused to reinstate him more than two years after\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fSullivan filed for workers' compensation.           See Mesnick v. Gen.\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding that\n\nperiod   of   nine    months   \"suggests    the   absence   of   a   causal\n\nconnection between the statutorily protected conduct and the\n\nadverse employment action\").\n\n                      III. Termination of Benefits\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof Raytheon, MetLife, and the Trust with respect to Sullivan's\n\nclaim that MetLife's termination of his disability benefits was\n\narbitrary and capricious.          The parties agree that MetLife had\n\ndiscretion to determine Sullivan's eligibility for benefits.\n\nWhere a benefits plan grants discretionary authority to the plan\n\nadministrator,       we   review   the   administrator's    decisions    to\n\ndetermine whether they are arbitrary and capricious.             See Pari-\n\nFasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415,\n\n418 (1st Cir. 2000); Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     \"This standard means that [the administrator's]\n\ndecision will be upheld if it was within [the administrator's]\n\nauthority, reasoned, and 'supported by substantial evidence in\n\nthe record.'\" Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181,\n\n184 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc.\n\nv. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997)).                Substantial\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fevidence exists if it is \"reasonably sufficient to support a\n\nconclusion.\"        Id.\n\n              There is evidence in the record that is reasonably\n\nsufficient to support MetLife's conclusion that Sullivan was not\n\ndisabled from all occupations for which he was fit to perform by\n\nhis training and experience.              Network Medical Review completed\n\na review of Sullivan's claim file in September 1996.                    Based on\n\nSullivan's copious medical records, NMR concluded: \"The medical\n\nevidence,      both   subjective        and     objective,   would     support    a\n\nsedentary work environment for Mr. Sullivan. . . . [A] sedentary\n\nwork       environment    would    not    significantly      exacerbate        this\n\nclaimant's discomfort or pain, and would not cause further\n\nworsening of his medical conditions.\"                  MetLife asked NMR to\n\nreview      Sullivan's    file    again    after    providing    NMR    with    two\n\nadditional medical reports7 of his capabilities.                 In its second\n\nreport      dated   October      23,    1996,    NMR   stated:   \"Our    initial\n\nassessment concluded that Mr. Sullivan's physical restrictions\n\nprevented him from performing his own occupation, but not from\n\nperforming any occupation.             The new information does not provide\n\nevidence that would alter this conclusion.\"\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       MetLife provided NMR with the reports of Dr. Maureen\nNorman and Dr. George Hazel for this second review. We discuss\nboth of these reports below.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f          The evaluation of Sullivan's own physician reflects a\n\nsimilar assessment of his capabilities.        In January 1996, Dr.\n\nMaureen Norman completed an evaluation of his condition at\n\nMetLife's request.   While Dr. Norman indicated on her report\n\nform that Sullivan was disabled from his own occupation as a\n\nsecurity guard, she also indicated that she could not determine\n\nwhether he was totally disabled from any occupation.      Dr. Norman\n\nalso reported that Sullivan was a candidate for \"vocational\n\nrehabilitation (retraining for a different occupation)\" and\n\nphysical rehabilitation.\n\n          In trying to prove that he is totally disabled within\n\nthe meaning of the LTD plan, Sullivan relies on the medical\n\nopinion of Dr. George Hazel, a physician asked to evaluate him\n\nin October, 1994 for the DIA in connection with his claim for\n\nworkers' compensation.     In that report, Dr. Hazel stated that\n\n\"at the present time [Sullivan] is medically disabled and that\n\nthe disability is permanent and the level of activity [of] the\n\npatient is significantly restricted.\"        However, Dr. Hazel also\n\nnoted   that   Sullivan    had   \"numerous    unassociated   somatic\n\ncomplaints which makes evaluation difficult.\"       For this reason,\n\nNMR declined to find, based on Dr. Hazel's evaluation, that\n\nSullivan was totally disabled under the LTD plan.       In reviewing\n\nDr. Hazel's report, NMR also noted that some of the symptoms\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fdescribed by Dr. Hazel were dependent on subjective factors such\n\nas Sullivan's willingness to cooperate with the exam.\n\n           Based    on    this   evidence,    we    cannot    conclude     that\n\nMetLife's decision to terminate Sullivan's disability benefits\n\nwas arbitrary and capricious.              The reports from NMR, while\n\nacknowledging      that   Sullivan's       work    environment    should     be\n\nstructured to avoid aggravating his disability, indicate that\n\nSullivan is capable of working in some occupation for which he\n\nis trained.     See Doyle, 144 F.3d at 186 (affirming denial of\n\nlong-term benefits where the evidence indicated the plaintiff\n\n\"was not 'totally disabled from any occupation' because he\n\nretained a 'sedentary' work capacity and a potential for further\n\nrehabilitation\").         Moreover,    the   report    most    favorable     to\n\nSullivan's claim of total disability, Dr. Hazel's assessment,\n\nevaluated his capacity in the context of his claim for workers'\n\ncompensation benefits and did not consider whether Sullivan was\n\ntotally disabled from every occupation for which he was fit by\n\ntraining   or   experience. 8      Therefore,      MetLife's     decision    to\n\n\n\n\n    8 Putting the shortcomings of Dr. Hazel's evaluation aside,\nhis conclusion that Sullivan's disability is permanent does not\ncompel a finding that MetLife's termination of Sullivan's\nbenefits was arbitrary and capricious.        As we have said,\nsufficiency of the evidence to support MetLife's determination\n\"does not disappear merely by reason of contradictory evidence.\"\nDoyle, 144 F.3d at 184.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fterminate Sullivan's disability benefits under the LTD plan was\n\nnot arbitrary and capricious.\n\n        IV. Penalties for Failure to Provide Plan Documents\n\n           Finally, Sullivan appeals the district court's decision\n\nnot to impose penalties against MetLife pursuant to 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1132(c)(1)9 for failing to provide documents about the long term\n\ndisability   plan.    The   district    court   noted   that   there   was\n\ndisputed evidence about whether Sullivan did or did not receive\n\nthe documents, but found that \"whether or not he had the plan\n\ndocuments, Sullivan exercised his rights under the plan and\n\nprovided the type of [medical] information that was required for\n\na decision to be made.\"     Because MetLife \"carefully analyzed the\n\nmedical evidence and relied on it,\" the district court concluded\n\nthat Sullivan had not been prejudiced even if Raytheon had not\n\nfurnished the documents he requested.           We review the court's\n\ndetermination for abuse of discretion.          See Rodriguez-Abreu v.\n\nChase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 588 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n    9  29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(c)(1) provides in pertinent part: \"Any\nadministrator . . . who fails or refuses to comply with a\nrequest for any information which such administrator is required\nby this subchapter to furnish to a participant or beneficiary .\n. . may in the court's discretion be personally liable to such\nparticipant or beneficiary in the amount of up to $100 a day\nfrom the date of such failure or refusal, and the court may in\nits discretion order such other relief as it deems proper.\"\n\n                                 -21-\n\f          As the district court found, Sullivan has offered no\n\nevidence that MetLife acted in bad faith in not providing him\n\nwith the documents in a more timely fashion.              Additionally,\n\nSullivan has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by any\n\ndelay in receiving the documents.         We agree with Sullivan that\n\nshowings of bad faith and prejudice are not necessary for a\n\ncourt to award penalties under ยง 1132(c)(1).            See id. at 588\n\n(\"[P]rejudice and bad faith are not prerequisites for imposition\n\nof penalties.\").     However, the district court did not require\n\nSullivan to prove that Raytheon acted in bad faith or that he\n\nwas prejudiced.     Instead, the court appropriately cited the\n\nabsence of those factors among the reasons for its decision not\n\nto award penalties. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion\n\nin the district court's ruling.          See id. at 588-89 (finding no\n\nabuse of discretion where the district court considered the\n\nabsence   of   prejudice   and   bad   faith   in   declining   to   award\n\npenalties).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f",

Sullivan alleges that Raytheon discriminated against him on the basis of disability and age in refusing to reinstate him to his position at Raytheon. Sullivan also argues that Raytheon's failure to reinstate him constituted discriminatory retaliation for Sullivan's application for workers' compensation benefits and his filing a charge with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). In addition, Sullivan asserts that Raytheon and the claims administrator of Raytheon's long term disability benefits plan, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), wrongly denied his application for disability benefits and violated ERISA in not furnishing him documents about Raytheon's disability plan. Finding no error in the determinations of the district court, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan began his employment as a security guard with Raytheon in 1965. Between 1971 and 1990, he suffered seven industrial accidents that caused injuries to his neck, lower back, and legs. Sullivan sought medical treatment for some of these injuries and occasionally missed work. Shortly after Sullivan's seventh accident in 1990, his absenteeism from work increased. After giving him a written warning in June 1990 and imposing a suspension for abuse of Raytheon's sick leave policy in September 1991, Raytheon terminated Sullivan's employment on March 31, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between Raytheon and his union, the Raytheon Guards Association (the Union), challenging his termination. After a hearing on August 10, 1995, the arbitrator found that Sullivan had been terminated without just cause. However, noting that \"on a current and prospective basis, [Sullivan] is not able to work,\" the arbitrator ordered Sullivan reinstated retroactive to March 31, 1992 on \"inactive employment status\" so that Sullivan could apply for disability benefits under Raytheon's long term disability plan (the LTD plan). Shortly after the arbitrator's decision, Sullivan wrote to Raytheon and requested information about the long-term disability plan so that he could apply for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Raytheon's LTD plan, benefits are payable for twenty-four months for an employee who is \"fully disabled\"; they are payable indefinitely for an employee who is \"totally disabled.\" In statements provided to plan participants, employees are informed that they are fully disabled if \"because of a sickness or an injury you cannot do your job.\" An employee is totally disabled if \"because of sickness or injury: (a) you can not do your job; and (b) you can not do any other job for which you are fit by your education, your training, or your experience.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan submitted an application for long-term disability benefits in November 1995. MetLife, the claims administrator responsible for determining a participant's eligibility under the plan, denied his claim in March 1996. Metlife stated that there was \"inadequate evidence of a disabling condition that would prevent him from performing his occupation as a Guard from April 1, 1992 through the present.\" In addition, MetLife concluded that Sullivan's application for benefits was untimely. Sullivan appealed the denial of benefits to MetLife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also applied for workers' compensation benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On August 4, 1994, an administrative law judge for the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) found that Sullivan was partially disabled as of March 22, 1992, and totally disabled as of October 12, 1994. Sullivan received workers' compensation benefits until 1998, when he exhausted his entitlement to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan requested reinstatement to Raytheon by letter dated June 18, 1996. In that letter, he stated that either he was totally disabled, in which case he should receive long-term disability benefits, or he was not disabled, in which case he sought reinstatement to a position with or without reasonable accommodation. By letter dated July 10, 1996, Raytheon advised Sullivan that it would not consider reinstating him until after MetLife considered Sullivan's appeal from its denial of his claim for benefits. Sullivan filed a charge of discrimination with the MCAD on October 9, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1997, MetLife determined that Sullivan was fully disabled for the first twenty-four months of his disability through April 30, 1994 because he was not capable of performing his job as a security guard, and thus entitled to benefits during that time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In this respect, MetLife's decision of October 1997 differed from its denial of benefits in March 1996. However, MetLife affirmed its previous determination that Sullivan was not totally disabled because he was not disabled from all occupations for which he was fit by his training or experience. Accordingly, MetLife terminated his benefits. Sullivan's appeal of that determination to MetLife was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court on November 3, 1998. His three-count complaint included the following claims: (1) that Raytheon discriminated against him on the basis of disability and age and engaged in discriminatory retaliation in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B; (2) that Raytheon retaliated against him for filing a worker's compensation claim in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B; and (3) that Raytheon violated his rights under the Employees Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140. Raytheon removed the case to federal district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1999, the district court granted Raytheon's motion to dismiss the retaliation claims in count one and two. Because the parties submitted evidence outside the pleadings in arguing this motion, we treat the district court's ruling as one on summary judgment. See Davis v. Lucent Tech., Inc., 251 F.3d 227, 231 (1st Cir. 2001). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on the remaining counts in October 2000. Sullivan appeals these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Claims of Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on his claims of disability and age discrimination and retaliation. We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, viewing the record in the light most favorable to Sullivan. See Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2000). \"Summary judgment is appropriate only if 'there is no genuine issue as to any material fact' and 'the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\" Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Disability Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under chapter 151B of Massachusetts law, Sullivan must demonstrate that he is a \"qualified handicapped person.\" See August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., 981 F.2d 576, 580 (1st Cir. 1992); Labonte v. Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, 678 N.E.2d 853, 859 (Mass. 1997). Chapter 151B defines this term as \"a handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 1(16). Thus, Sullivan must demonstrate that he is capable of performing, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of the position of security guard at Raytheon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted in its written memorandum and order, Sullivan has \"continually and consistently claimed that he was totally disabled.\" In a 1994 deposition, Sullivan stated that he believed he was totally disabled from March 1992 (when Raytheon terminated his employment) to the present time. In another deposition six years later, Sullivan stated that his condition had stayed the same or worsened since his 1994 deposition. Sullivan also represented that he was disabled in applications for social security disability insurance and workers' compensation benefits. Additionally, he stated on his tax returns for the years 1995 through 1998 that his occupation was \"disabled.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These claims of disability do not necessarily preclude Sullivan's ability to argue now that he is capable of performing his job with reasonable accommodation. See Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 797 (1999) (holding that pursuit of benefits under Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) \"does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim\"). However, to defeat Raytheon's motion for summary judgment, Sullivan must explain why the representations of total disability he has made in the past are consistent with his current claim that he could perform the essential functions of a security guard at Raytheon with reasonable accommodation. See id. at 798 (\"To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment, [the plaintiff] must explain why that SSDI contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she could 'perform the essential functions' of her previous job, at least with 'reasonable accommodation.'\"). Sullivan has offered no evidence to explain this discrepancy. Accordingly, Sullivan has not demonstrated that he is a \"qualified handicapped person\" for purposes of chapter 151B, and summary judgment in favor of Raytheon was proper. See August, 981 F.2d at 584 (\"Having conceded that he was totally disabled at all relevant times, [the plaintiff] cannot now establish that he was a 'qualified handicapped person' and thus cannot make the prima facie case required to prevail on his claim under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B, &#167; 4(16).\"). Compare D'Aprile v. Fleet Servs. Corp., 92 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting the reasoning of August where the plaintiff \"never claimed to have been totally disabled during the time she requested her accommodation, and demonstrated her ability to work with the accommodation she requested\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because Raytheon did not engage in \"an interactive process\" with Sullivan to determine an appropriate accommodation that would allow him to return to his position as a security guard. As Raytheon points out, the ADA's interpretive regulations \"may require an employer 'to initiate an informal, interactive process' with the individual seeking accommodation.\" Soto-Ocasio v. Federal Express Corp., 150 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(o)(3)). However, there is no such requirement under Massachusetts law in chapter 151B. Moreover, even if Raytheon were required to have engaged Sullivan in such an interactive process, we found in Soto-Ocasio that an interactive process is not necessary where, as here, no reasonable trier of fact could have found that the employee was capable of performing the job, with or without reasonable accommodation, for which he was seeking reinstatement. See id. Because Sullivan has presented no evidence to indicate that he was capable of returning to work as a security guard, even with a reasonable accommodation, Raytheon was not required to engage with him in an interactive process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Age Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also appeals the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on his claim of age discrimination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Sullivan alleged in his complaint that he was more than forty years old at the time Raytheon refused to reinstate him and that Raytheon \"hired younger persons to fill positions for which Sullivan was qualified to fill.\" To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under this statute, Sullivan must prove \"by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was a member of the protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position in question; (3) he was denied the position; and (4) his employer sought to fill the position by hiring a younger individual with qualifications similar to those of the plaintiff.\" Lehman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 74 F.3d 323, 327-28 (1st Cir. 1996) (footnote omitted). As we have explained in our discussion of his claim for disability discrimination, Sullivan failed to show that he was qualified for the position he sought at Raytheon. Accordingly, he cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, and the district court properly entered judgment in favor of Raytheon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Discriminatory Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan further claims that Raytheon violated his rights under chapter 151B, &#167; 4(4)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> by engaging in retaliatory discrimination in not reinstating him after he filed a charge of discrimination with the MCAD. To establish a prima facie case for retaliation, Sullivan had to show that: (1) he engaged in conduct protected under Massachusetts or federal law; (2) he \"suffered an adverse employment action\"; and (3) \"a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\" McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 140 F.3d 288, 309 (1st Cir. 1998). Sullivan's claim falters on the third prong of this test. He has not demonstrated a causal connection between his protected conduct - filing a charge of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in October 1996--and Raytheon's refusal to reinstate him to his position as a security guard in July 1996. Indeed, Sullivan concedes this chronology in the facts section of his brief when he states: \"When Sullivan was not given disability benefits, and was not reinstated to a suitable position at Raytheon, he filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission against Discrimination on October 9, 1996.\" Because Sullivan's protected action - filing a charge of discrimination - occurred after the adverse employment action, we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on the retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Retaliation for filing for workers' compensation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also claims that the district court should not have dismissed his claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Section 75B \"bars discrimination against qualified handicapped workers exercising their rights under the workers' compensation law, which includes procedures for filing claims for injuries, receiving payments, and determining re-employment.\" Fant v. New England Power Serv. Co., 239 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2001). The district court found that this state law claim was preempted under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Section 301 [of the LMRA] completely preempts a state law claim, 'if the resolution of [the] state-law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement.'\" Magerer v. John Sexton &amp; Co., 912 F.2d 525, 528 (1st Cir. 1990) (alteration in original) (quoting Lingle v. Norge Division of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399, 405-06 (1988)). With respect to the Massachusetts workers' compensation statute, \"the protections of &#167; 75B are subordinate to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement\" between Sullivan's union and Raytheon. Fant, 239 F.3d at 14. See also Magerer, 912 F.2d at 529 (\"[S]uch claims [under section 75B] are, by the express terms of the statute, subject to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.\"). The statute provides: \"In the event that any right set forth in this section is inconsistent with an applicable collective bargaining agreement, such agreement shall prevail.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B(3). We have said that this language</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">makes clear that to the extent that the collective bargaining agreement provides standards to govern the conduct underlying plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim, the claim will be governed by the standards of the agreement, rather than by the standards of ch. 152 &#167; 75B. And to that extent, claims under section 75B will require interpretation of the agreement and, therefore, will be preempted by Section 301.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Magerer, 912 F.2d at 529. We need not find explicitly that the collective bargaining agreement at issue here is inconsistent with section 75B to find Sullivan's claim under that statute preempted. See Fant, 239 F.3d at 16. In similar circumstances, we have found claims under section 75B preempted \"not because the collective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the state claims asserted, but because it may be so and requires interpretation.\" Martin v. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc., 105 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Fant, 239 F.3d at 16 (finding retaliation claim brought under section 75B preempted by the LMRA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the collective bargaining agreement between Raytheon and the Union contained a management rights clause providing that \"the management and control of the Company's business and operations, working force and plant, as well as the direction, supervision and assignment of duties of the Guards, is vested exclusively in the management of the Company.\" This broad grant of supervisory discretion to Raytheon could conflict with the provisions of section 75B that place limits on Raytheon's ability to refuse to reinstate employees after they have filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. Because we would have to interpret the agreement to determine whether this clause conflicts with section 75B, Sullivan's claim is preempted. See Martin, 105 F.3d at 43-44 (finding claim under chapter 75B preempted because of a potential conflict with the management rights clause of the collective bargaining agreement); Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530 (finding that management rights clause \"could be construed to govern the conduct underlying plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim\"). Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that Sullivan's section 75B claim was preempted by &#167; 301 of the LMRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that this outcome - finding a claim under chapter 75B preempted because of a potential conflict with the management rights clause in a collective bargaining agreement - seems \"faintly troubling.\" Martin, 105 F.3d at 44. However, the union may bargain to avoid this outcome in the future:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If all else fails, the union is free to negotiate language that eliminates this issue the next time it renews its labor agreement. . . . All that it would take to prevent preemption is an explicit provision stating that nothing in the agreement is intended to create management rights inconsistent with any workers' rights under sections 75A and 75B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. Moreover, even if we found that Sullivan's claim under chapter 75B was not preempted, no rational fact finder could infer a discriminatory animus on Raytheon's part because Raytheon refused to reinstate him more than two years after Sullivan filed for workers' compensation. See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding that period of nine months \"suggests the absence of a causal connection between the statutorily protected conduct and the adverse employment action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Termination of Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Raytheon, MetLife, and the Trust with respect to Sullivan's claim that MetLife's termination of his disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious. The parties agree that MetLife had discretion to determine Sullivan's eligibility for benefits. Where a benefits plan grants discretionary authority to the plan administrator, we review the administrator's decisions to determine whether they are arbitrary and capricious. See Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 418 (1st Cir. 2000); Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir. 1998). \"This standard means that [the administrator's] decision will be upheld if it was within [the administrator's] authority, reasoned, and 'supported by substantial evidence in the record.'\" Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997)). Substantial evidence exists if it is \"reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is evidence in the record that is reasonably sufficient to support MetLife's conclusion that Sullivan was not disabled from all occupations for which he was fit to perform by his training and experience. Network Medical Review completed a review of Sullivan's claim file in September 1996. Based on Sullivan's copious medical records, NMR concluded: \"The medical evidence, both subjective and objective, would support a sedentary work environment for Mr. Sullivan. . . . [A] sedentary work environment would not significantly exacerbate this claimant's discomfort or pain, and would not cause further worsening of his medical conditions.\" MetLife asked NMR to review Sullivan's file again after providing NMR with two additional medical reports<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> of his capabilities. In its second report dated October 23, 1996, NMR stated: \"Our initial assessment concluded that Mr. Sullivan's physical restrictions prevented him from performing his own occupation, but not from performing any occupation. The new information does not provide evidence that would alter this conclusion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evaluation of Sullivan's own physician reflects a similar assessment of his capabilities. In January 1996, Dr. Maureen Norman completed an evaluation of his condition at MetLife's request. While Dr. Norman indicated on her report form that Sullivan was disabled from his own occupation as a security guard, she also indicated that she could not determine whether he was totally disabled from any occupation. Dr. Norman also reported that Sullivan was a candidate for \"vocational rehabilitation (retraining for a different occupation)\" and physical rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trying to prove that he is totally disabled within the meaning of the LTD plan, Sullivan relies on the medical opinion of Dr. George Hazel, a physician asked to evaluate him in October, 1994 for the DIA in connection with his claim for workers' compensation. In that report, Dr. Hazel stated that \"at the present time [Sullivan] is medically disabled and that the disability is permanent and the level of activity [of] the patient is significantly restricted.\" However, Dr. Hazel also noted that Sullivan had \"numerous unassociated somatic complaints which makes evaluation difficult.\" For this reason, NMR declined to find, based on Dr. Hazel's evaluation, that Sullivan was totally disabled under the LTD plan. In reviewing Dr. Hazel's report, NMR also noted that some of the symptoms described by Dr. Hazel were dependent on subjective factors such as Sullivan's willingness to cooperate with the exam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, we cannot conclude that MetLife's decision to terminate Sullivan's disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious. The reports from NMR, while acknowledging that Sullivan's work environment should be structured to avoid aggravating his disability, indicate that Sullivan is capable of working in some occupation for which he is trained. See Doyle, 144 F.3d at 186 (affirming denial of long-term benefits where the evidence indicated the plaintiff \"was not 'totally disabled from any occupation' because he retained a 'sedentary' work capacity and a potential for further rehabilitation\"). Moreover, the report most favorable to Sullivan's claim of total disability, Dr. Hazel's assessment, evaluated his capacity in the context of his claim for workers' compensation benefits and did not consider whether Sullivan was totally disabled from every occupation for which he was fit by training or experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Therefore, MetLife's decision to terminate Sullivan's disability benefits under the LTD plan was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. Penalties for Failure to Provide Plan Documents</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Sullivan appeals the district court's decision not to impose penalties against MetLife pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(c)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> for failing to provide documents about the long term disability plan. The district court noted that there was disputed evidence about whether Sullivan did or did not receive the documents, but found that \"whether or not he had the plan documents, Sullivan exercised his rights under the plan and provided the type of [medical] information that was required for a decision to be made.\" Because MetLife \"carefully analyzed the medical evidence and relied on it,\" the district court concluded that Sullivan had not been prejudiced even if Raytheon had not furnished the documents he requested. We review the court's determination for abuse of discretion. See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 986 F.2d 580, 588 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court found, Sullivan has offered no evidence that MetLife acted in bad faith in not providing him with the documents in a more timely fashion. Additionally, Sullivan has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by any delay in receiving the documents. We agree with Sullivan that showings of bad faith and prejudice are not necessary for a court to award penalties under &#167; 1132(c)(1). See id. at 588 (\"[P]rejudice and bad faith are not prerequisites for imposition of penalties.\"). However, the district court did not require Sullivan to prove that Raytheon acted in bad faith or that he was prejudiced. Instead, the court appropriately cited the absence of those factors among the reasons for its decision not to award penalties. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's ruling. See id. at 588-89 (finding no abuse of discretion where the district court considered the absence of prejudice and bad faith in declining to award penalties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It is not clear from the record when Sullivan applied for workers' compensation.

Sullivan alleges that Raytheon discriminated against him on the basis of disability and age in refusing to reinstate him to his position at Raytheon. Sullivan also argues that Raytheon's failure to reinstate him constituted discriminatory retaliation for Sullivan's application for workers' compensation benefits and his filing a charge with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD). In addition, Sullivan asserts that Raytheon and the claims administrator of Raytheon's long term disability benefits plan, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), wrongly denied his application for disability benefits and violated ERISA in not furnishing him documents about Raytheon's disability plan. Finding no error in the determinations of the district court, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan began his employment as a security guard with Raytheon in 1965. Between 1971 and 1990, he suffered seven industrial accidents that caused injuries to his neck, lower back, and legs. Sullivan sought medical treatment for some of these injuries and occasionally missed work. Shortly after Sullivan's seventh accident in 1990, his absenteeism from work increased. After giving him a written warning in June 1990 and imposing a suspension for abuse of Raytheon's sick leave policy in September 1991, Raytheon terminated Sullivan's employment on March 31, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between Raytheon and his union, the Raytheon Guards Association (the Union), challenging his termination. After a hearing on August 10, 1995, the arbitrator found that Sullivan had been terminated without just cause. However, noting that \"on a current and prospective basis, [Sullivan] is not able to work,\" the arbitrator ordered Sullivan reinstated retroactive to March 31, 1992 on \"inactive employment status\" so that Sullivan could apply for disability benefits under Raytheon's long term disability plan (the LTD plan). Shortly after the arbitrator's decision, Sullivan wrote to Raytheon and requested information about the long-term disability plan so that he could apply for benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Raytheon's LTD plan, benefits are payable for twenty-four months for an employee who is \"fully disabled\"; they are payable indefinitely for an employee who is \"totally disabled.\" In statements provided to plan participants, employees are informed that they are fully disabled if \"because of a sickness or an injury you cannot do your job.\" An employee is totally disabled if \"because of sickness or injury: (a) you can not do your job; and (b) you can not do any other job for which you are fit by your education, your training, or your experience.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan submitted an application for long-term disability benefits in November 1995. MetLife, the claims administrator responsible for determining a participant's eligibility under the plan, denied his claim in March 1996. Metlife stated that there was \"inadequate evidence of a disabling condition that would prevent him from performing his occupation as a Guard from April 1, 1992 through the present.\" In addition, MetLife concluded that Sullivan's application for benefits was untimely. Sullivan appealed the denial of benefits to MetLife.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also applied for workers' compensation benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On August 4, 1994, an administrative law judge for the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) found that Sullivan was partially disabled as of March 22, 1992, and totally disabled as of October 12, 1994. Sullivan received workers' compensation benefits until 1998, when he exhausted his entitlement to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan requested reinstatement to Raytheon by letter dated June 18, 1996. In that letter, he stated that either he was totally disabled, in which case he should receive long-term disability benefits, or he was not disabled, in which case he sought reinstatement to a position with or without reasonable accommodation. By letter dated July 10, 1996, Raytheon advised Sullivan that it would not consider reinstating him until after MetLife considered Sullivan's appeal from its denial of his claim for benefits. Sullivan filed a charge of discrimination with the MCAD on October 9, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1997, MetLife determined that Sullivan was fully disabled for the first twenty-four months of his disability through April 30, 1994 because he was not capable of performing his job as a security guard, and thus entitled to benefits during that time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In this respect, MetLife's decision of October 1997 differed from its denial of benefits in March 1996. However, MetLife affirmed its previous determination that Sullivan was not totally disabled because he was not disabled from all occupations for which he was fit by his training or experience. Accordingly, MetLife terminated his benefits. Sullivan's appeal of that determination to MetLife was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court on November 3, 1998. His three-count complaint included the following claims: (1) that Raytheon discriminated against him on the basis of disability and age and engaged in discriminatory retaliation in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B; (2) that Raytheon retaliated against him for filing a worker's compensation claim in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B; and (3) that Raytheon violated his rights under the Employees Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1140. Raytheon removed the case to federal district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1999, the district court granted Raytheon's motion to dismiss the retaliation claims in count one and two. Because the parties submitted evidence outside the pleadings in arguing this motion, we treat the district court's ruling as one on summary judgment. See Davis v. Lucent Tech., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199416\"><a href=\"/opinion/199416/davis-v-lucent-technologies/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 231 (1st Cir. 2001). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on the remaining counts in October 2000. Sullivan appeals these rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Claims of Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on his claims of disability and age discrimination and retaliation. We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo, viewing the record in the light most favorable to Sullivan. See Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 2000). \"Summary judgment is appropriate only if 'there is no genuine issue as to any material fact' and 'the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\" Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Disability Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under chapter 151B of Massachusetts law, Sullivan must demonstrate that he is a \"qualified handicapped person.\" See August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596483\"><a href=\"/opinion/596483/irving-august-v-offices-unlimited-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 580 (1st Cir. 1992); Labonte v. Hutchins &amp; Wheeler, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span>, 859 (Mass. 1997). Chapter 151B defines this term as \"a handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 1(16). Thus, Sullivan must demonstrate that he is capable of performing, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of the position of security guard at Raytheon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted in its written memorandum and order, Sullivan has \"continually and consistently claimed that he was totally disabled.\" In a 1994 deposition, Sullivan stated that he believed he was totally disabled from March 1992 (when Raytheon terminated his employment) to the present time. In another deposition six years later, Sullivan stated that his condition had stayed the same or worsened since his 1994 deposition. Sullivan also represented that he was disabled in applications for social security disability insurance and workers' compensation benefits. Additionally, he stated on his tax returns for the years 1995 through 1998 that his occupation was \"disabled.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These claims of disability do not necessarily preclude Sullivan's ability to argue now that he is capable of performing his job with reasonable accommodation. See Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118294\"><a href=\"/opinion/118294/cleveland-v-policy-management-systems-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span>, 797 (1999) (holding that pursuit of benefits under Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) \"does not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim\"). However, to defeat Raytheon's motion for summary judgment, Sullivan must explain why the representations of total disability he has made in the past are consistent with his current claim that he could perform the essential functions of a security guard at Raytheon with reasonable accommodation. See id. at 798 (\"To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment, [the plaintiff] must explain why that SSDI contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she could 'perform the essential functions' of her previous job, at least with 'reasonable accommodation.'\"). Sullivan has offered no evidence to explain this discrepancy. Accordingly, Sullivan has not demonstrated that he is a \"qualified handicapped person\" for purposes of chapter 151B, and summary judgment in favor of Raytheon was proper. See August, 981 F.2d at 584 (\"Having conceded that he was totally disabled at all relevant times, [the plaintiff] cannot now establish that he was a 'qualified handicapped person' and thus cannot make the prima facie case required to prevail on his claim under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B, &#167; 4(16).\"). Compare D'Aprile v. Fleet Servs. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723913\"><a href=\"/opinion/723913/beverly-ruth-daprile-v-fleet-services-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting the reasoning of August where the plaintiff \"never claimed to have been totally disabled during the time she requested her accommodation, and demonstrated her ability to work with the accommodation she requested\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because Raytheon did not engage in \"an interactive process\" with Sullivan to determine an appropriate accommodation that would allow him to return to his position as a security guard. As Raytheon points out, the ADA's interpretive regulations \"may require an employer 'to initiate an informal, interactive process' with the individual seeking accommodation.\" Soto-Ocasio v. Federal Express Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198055\"><a href=\"/opinion/198055/soto-ocasio-v-federal-express/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(o)(3)). However, there is no such requirement under Massachusetts law in chapter 151B. Moreover, even if Raytheon were required to have engaged Sullivan in such an interactive process, we found in Soto-Ocasio that an interactive process is not necessary where, as here, no reasonable trier of fact could have found that the employee was capable of performing the job, with or without reasonable accommodation, for which he was seeking reinstatement. See id. Because Sullivan has presented no evidence to indicate that he was capable of returning to work as a security guard, even with a reasonable accommodation, Raytheon was not required to engage with him in an interactive process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Age Discrimination</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also appeals the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on his claim of age discrimination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Sullivan alleged in his complaint that he was more than forty years old at the time Raytheon refused to reinstate him and that Raytheon \"hired younger persons to fill positions for which Sullivan was qualified to fill.\" To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under this statute, Sullivan must prove \"by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was a member of the protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position in question; (3) he was denied the position; and (4) his employer sought to fill the position by hiring a younger individual with qualifications similar to those of the plaintiff.\" Lehman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711114\"><a href=\"/opinion/711114/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1752-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43906-pens-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 327-28 (1st Cir. 1996) (footnote omitted). As we have explained in our discussion of his claim for disability discrimination, Sullivan failed to show that he was qualified for the position he sought at Raytheon. Accordingly, he cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, and the district court properly entered judgment in favor of Raytheon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Discriminatory Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan further claims that Raytheon violated his rights under chapter 151B, &#167; 4(4)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> by engaging in retaliatory discrimination in not reinstating him after he filed a charge of discrimination with the MCAD. To establish a prima facie case for retaliation, Sullivan had to show that: (1) he engaged in conduct protected under Massachusetts or federal law; (2) he \"suffered an adverse employment action\"; and (3) \"a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\" McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752960\"><a href=\"/opinion/752960/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-589-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45354-dr-marjorie/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir. 1998). Sullivan's claim falters on the third prong of this test. He has not demonstrated a causal connection between his protected conduct - filing a charge of discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in October 1996--and Raytheon's refusal to reinstate him to his position as a security guard in July 1996. Indeed, Sullivan concedes this chronology in the facts section of his brief when he states: \"When Sullivan was not given disability benefits, and was not reinstated to a suitable position at Raytheon, he filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Massachusetts Commission against Discrimination on October 9, 1996.\" Because Sullivan's protected action - filing a charge of discrimination - occurred after the adverse employment action, we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Raytheon on the retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Retaliation for filing for workers' compensation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also claims that the district court should not have dismissed his claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Section 75B \"bars discrimination against qualified handicapped workers exercising their rights under the workers' compensation law, which includes procedures for filing claims for injuries, receiving payments, and determining re-employment.\" Fant v.

The district court found that this state law claim was preempted under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Section 301 [of the LMRA] completely preempts a state law claim, 'if the resolution of [the] state-law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement.'\" Magerer v.

With respect to the Massachusetts workers' compensation statute, \"the protections of &#167; 75B are subordinate to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement\" between Sullivan's union and Raytheon. Fant, 239 F.3d at 14. See also Magerer, 912 F.2d at 529 (\"[S]uch claims [under section 75B] are, by the express terms of the statute, subject to the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.\"). The statute provides: \"In the event that any right set forth in this section is inconsistent with an applicable collective bargaining agreement, such agreement shall prevail.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 75B(3). We have said that this language</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">makes clear that to the extent that the collective bargaining agreement provides standards to govern the conduct underlying plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim, the claim will be governed by the standards of the agreement, rather than by the standards of ch. 152 &#167; 75B. And to that extent, claims under section 75B will require interpretation of the agreement and, therefore, will be preempted by Section 301.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Magerer, 912 F.2d at 529. We need not find explicitly that the collective bargaining agreement at issue here is inconsistent with section 75B to find Sullivan's claim under that statute preempted. See Fant, 239 F.3d at 16. In similar circumstances, we have found claims under section 75B preempted \"not because the collective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the state claims asserted, but because it may be so and requires interpretation.\" Martin v. Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733389\"><a href=\"/opinion/733389/theresa-martin-v-shaws-supermarkets-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Fant, 239 F.3d at 16 (finding retaliation claim brought under section 75B preempted by the LMRA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the collective bargaining agreement between Raytheon and the Union contained a management rights clause providing that \"the management and control of the Company's business and operations, working force and plant, as well as the direction, supervision and assignment of duties of the Guards, is vested exclusively in the management of the Company.\" This broad grant of supervisory discretion to Raytheon could conflict with the provisions of section 75B that place limits on Raytheon's ability to refuse to reinstate employees after they have filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. Because we would have to interpret the agreement to determine whether this clause conflicts with section 75B, Sullivan's claim is preempted. See Martin, 105 F.3d at 43-44 (finding claim under chapter 75B preempted because of a potential conflict with the management rights clause of the collective bargaining agreement); Magerer, 912 F.2d at 530 (finding that management rights clause \"could be construed to govern the conduct underlying plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim\"). Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that Sullivan's section 75B claim was preempted by &#167; 301 of the LMRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that this outcome - finding a claim under chapter 75B preempted because of a potential conflict with the management rights clause in a collective bargaining agreement - seems \"faintly troubling.\" Martin, 105 F.3d at 44. However, the union may bargain to avoid this outcome in the future:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If all else fails, the union is free to negotiate language that eliminates this issue the next time it renews its labor agreement. . . .

Moreover, even if we found that Sullivan's claim under chapter 75B was not preempted, no rational fact finder could infer a discriminatory animus on Raytheon's part because Raytheon refused to reinstate him more than two years after Sullivan filed for workers' compensation.

Termination of Benefits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Raytheon, MetLife, and the Trust with respect to Sullivan's claim that MetLife's termination of his disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious. The parties agree that MetLife had discretion to determine Sullivan's eligibility for benefits. Where a benefits plan grants discretionary authority to the plan administrator, we review the administrator's decisions to determine whether they are arbitrary and capricious. See Pari-Fasano v.

Substantial evidence exists if it is \"reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is evidence in the record that is reasonably sufficient to support MetLife's conclusion that Sullivan was not disabled from all occupations for which he was fit to perform by his training and experience. Network Medical Review completed a review of Sullivan's claim file in September 1996. Based on Sullivan's copious medical records, NMR concluded: \"The medical evidence, both subjective and objective, would support a sedentary work environment for Mr. Sullivan. . . . [A] sedentary work environment would not significantly exacerbate this claimant's discomfort or pain, and would not cause further worsening of his medical conditions.\" MetLife asked NMR to review Sullivan's file again after providing NMR with two additional medical reports<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> of his capabilities. In its second report dated October 23, 1996, NMR stated: \"Our initial assessment concluded that Mr. Sullivan's physical restrictions prevented him from performing his own occupation, but not from performing any occupation. The new information does not provide evidence that would alter this conclusion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evaluation of Sullivan's own physician reflects a similar assessment of his capabilities. In January 1996, Dr. Maureen Norman completed an evaluation of his condition at MetLife's request. While Dr. Norman indicated on her report form that Sullivan was disabled from his own occupation as a security guard, she also indicated that she could not determine whether he was totally disabled from any occupation. Dr. Norman also reported that Sullivan was a candidate for \"vocational rehabilitation (retraining for a different occupation)\" and physical rehabilitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trying to prove that he is totally disabled within the meaning of the LTD plan, Sullivan relies on the medical opinion of Dr. George Hazel, a physician asked to evaluate him in October, 1994 for the DIA in connection with his claim for workers' compensation. In that report, Dr. Hazel stated that \"at the present time [Sullivan] is medically disabled and that the disability is permanent and the level of activity [of] the patient is significantly restricted.\" However, Dr. Hazel also noted that Sullivan had \"numerous unassociated somatic complaints which makes evaluation difficult.\" For this reason, NMR declined to find, based on Dr. Hazel's evaluation, that Sullivan was totally disabled under the LTD plan. In reviewing Dr. Hazel's report, NMR also noted that some of the symptoms described by Dr. Hazel were dependent on subjective factors such as Sullivan's willingness to cooperate with the exam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, we cannot conclude that MetLife's decision to terminate Sullivan's disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious. The reports from NMR, while acknowledging that Sullivan's work environment should be structured to avoid aggravating his disability, indicate that Sullivan is capable of working in some occupation for which he is trained. See Doyle, 144 F.3d at 186 (affirming denial of long-term benefits where the evidence indicated the plaintiff \"was not 'totally disabled from any occupation' because he retained a 'sedentary' work capacity and a potential for further rehabilitation\"). Moreover, the report most favorable to Sullivan's claim of total disability, Dr. Hazel's assessment, evaluated his capacity in the context of his claim for workers' compensation benefits and did not consider whether Sullivan was totally disabled from every occupation for which he was fit by training or experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Therefore, MetLife's decision to terminate Sullivan's disability benefits under the LTD plan was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. Penalties for Failure to Provide Plan Documents</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Sullivan appeals the district court's decision not to impose penalties against MetLife pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(c)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> for failing to provide documents about the long term disability plan. The district court noted that there was disputed evidence about whether Sullivan did or did not receive the documents, but found that \"whether or not he had the plan documents, Sullivan exercised his rights under the plan and provided the type of [medical] information that was required for a decision to be made.\" Because MetLife \"carefully analyzed the medical evidence and relied on it,\" the district court concluded that Sullivan had not been prejudiced even if Raytheon had not furnished the documents he requested. We review the court's determination for abuse of discretion. See Rodriguez-Abreu v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600732\"><a href=\"/opinion/600732/luis-e-rodriguez-abreu-v-the-chase-manhattan-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 588 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court found, Sullivan has offered no evidence that MetLife acted in bad faith in not providing him with the documents in a more timely fashion. Additionally, Sullivan has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by any delay in receiving the documents. We agree with Sullivan that showings of bad faith and prejudice are not necessary for a court to award penalties under &#167; 1132(c)(1). See id. at 588 (\"[P]rejudice and bad faith are not prerequisites for imposition of penalties.\"). However, the district court did not require Sullivan to prove that Raytheon acted in bad faith or that he was prejudiced. Instead, the court appropriately cited the absence of those factors among the reasons for its decision not to award penalties. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's ruling. See id. at 588-89 (finding no abuse of discretion where the district court considered the absence of prejudice and bad faith in declining to award penalties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> It is not clear from the record when Sullivan applied for workers' compensation.
