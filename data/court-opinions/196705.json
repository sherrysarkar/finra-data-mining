R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1990).\r\n\n          On March 18, 1991, as part of a sizeable reduction in\r\n\nforce, defendant-appellee John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance\r\n\nCompany (Hancock) laid off approximately 450 workers including\r\n\nplaintiff-appellant Daniel J. Roche.  The next day the principal\r\n\narchitect of Hancock's downsizing (a senior executive vice-\r\n\npresident who, for the sake of anonymity, we shall call \"Green\")\r\n\nreceived three electronically recorded telephone messages on his\r\n\noffice voice mail system.  The speaker threatened Green's life\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand forecast the imminent kidnapping and mutilation of his\r\n\nchildren.  Later that day Green's secretary received and recorded\r\n\nan equally ominous call.\r\n\n          Richard Louis, a Hancock employee responsible for\r\n\ninternal investigations, prepared recordings of the menacing\r\n\nmessages.  It was readily apparent that these anonymous calls\r\n\nwere made by a man endeavoring to disguise his voice.  Louis\r\n\ntentatively concluded that the mystery man was a casualty of the\r\n\nrecent reduction in force, reported the matter to the Boston\r\n\npolice, and took steps to ensure the safety of Green and his\r\n\nfamily.  When the police investigation fizzled, Hancock retained\r\n\na firm of private detectives (McCain &amp; Fitzpatrick).  Robert\r\n\nFitzpatrick spearheaded the probe.  After a preliminary review,\r\n\nFitzpatrick agreed that a disgruntled ex-employee most likely had\r\n\nmade the calls and predicted that the miscreant would strike\r\n\nagain around the anniversary of the March 18 layoffs.\r\n\n          All was quiet until the day before Christmas when Green\r\n\nreceived another anonymous call.  This call was sarcastic but not\r\n\nthreatening.  He received a second such call eight days later. \r\n\nLouis played recordings of these two calls for his supervisor,\r\n\nDavid Cullington, who thought that the voice belonged to Jack\r\n\nBudrow (an employee who had lost his job in the March layoffs). \r\n\nFitzpatrick's attempts to correlate these calls with the four\r\n\noriginal calls proved inconclusive, and Hancock discounted Budrow\r\n\nas a suspect vis-a-vis the threats.\r\n\n          In February of 1992, Hancock rehired Roche.  On March\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n13, Green received another anonymous voice mail message.  This\r\n\ntime the caller promised to kill him on the layoff anniversary\r\n\ndate.  Louis recorded the communique and notified the\r\n\nauthorities.  Cullington, understandably alarmed, played the\r\n\nrecording for Neil Smith (a manager acquainted with many of the\r\n\nemployees who had been cashiered in March 1991).  Smith had known\r\n\nRoche for twenty-two years and thought that he recognized Roche's\r\n\nvoice.  Cullington next played the four March 1991 messages for\r\n\nSmith's listening pleasure, but Smith could not positively\r\n\nidentify the caller.\r\n\n          Without mentioning Smith's views, Cullington aired the\r\n\nsame five messages for Paul Heaslip, Hancock's director of labor\r\n\nrelations, who had worked with Roche for four years.  Heaslip\r\n\nsaid that he recognized Roche's voice on the anniversary message,\r\n\nbut that he could not identify the disguised voice featured in\r\n\nthe four earlier recordings.  Without mentioning Roche's name,\r\n\nCullington consulted Barry Rubenstein, Hancock's in-house\r\n\ncounsel.  Rubenstein had worked with Roche off and on from 1985\r\n\nto 1989.  When he heard the same quintet of messages he\r\n\nvolunteered that the voice on the latest recording belonged to\r\n\nRoche.\r\n\n          At that juncture, Rubenstein assumed an active role in\r\n\nthe proceedings.  He researched the law, informed Cullington that\r\n\nthe threatening calls probably violated federal and state\r\n\ncriminal prohibitions, and stated that it would be appropriate to\r\n\nreport Hancock's suspicions to the authorities.  Rubenstein also\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncounselled Cullington that, under the terms of the applicable\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, Roche's employment could be\r\n\nterminated.  Out of an abundance of caution, Rubenstein suggested\r\n\nthat the company obtain yet another opinion.  Following this\r\n\nadvice, Cullington auditioned the recordings for Brooks Tingle  \r\n\nan employee who was in regular contact with Roche but not privy\r\n\nto the investigation.  Tingle stated without prompting that both\r\n\nthe March 1991 and March 1992 recordings contained Roche's voice.\r\n\n          In the same time frame Fitzpatrick, acting for Hancock,\r\n\nrecruited Sensimetric, a voice analysis firm, to compare the\r\n\nMarch 1991 and March 1992 messages in order to determine whether\r\n\nthe calls had been made by the same person.  Fitzpatrick reported\r\n\nto Hancock that  Sensimetric's analysis \"strongly indicate[d]\r\n\nthat the same individual may have made both recordings.\" \r\n\nFitzpatrick also asked Sensimetric to compare the non-threatening\r\n\nmessages attributed to Budrow with the threat made in March of\r\n\n1992.  Sensimetric's analysis failed to establish a likely tie. \r\n\nOn March 23, 1992, Hancock lawfully but surreptitiously obtained\r\n\na recorded specimen of Roche's normal speaking voice. \r\n\nFitzpatrick subsequently reported to Hancock that, based on\r\n\nSensimetric's examination of the sample, Roche's voiceprint\r\n\nmatched that of the minacious caller.\r\n\n          Armed with this information, Louis recontacted the\r\n\nauthorities.  A law enforcement official requested that he secure\r\n\nsworn affidavits from the individuals who claimed to be able to\r\n\nidentify Roche's voice.  Louis followed instructions and, on\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nMarch 25, he met with representatives of the Boston Police\r\n\nDepartment and the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. \r\n\nLouis played the five threatening messages and presented sworn\r\n\naffidavits from Smith, Heaslip, Rubenstein, and Tingle confirming\r\n\nthat each had identified Roche as the perpetrator.  Relying on\r\n\nFitzpatrick's reports, Louis also told the authorities that\r\n\nSensimetric had analyzed the recordings and had concluded that\r\n\nthe caller's speech matched Roche's normal speaking voice.\r\n\n          The police decided to pursue the case.  Without the\r\n\nparticipation of any Hancock representative, the officers applied\r\n\nfor a criminal complaint and procured an arrest warrant.  The\r\n\nnext morning four police officers arrived by prearrangement at\r\n\nthe company's Braintree office.  Louis joined them and summoned\r\n\nRoche.  After Louis handed Roche a termination letter, the\r\n\ngendarmes arrested him and, in short order, the district attorney\r\n\ncharged him with threatening to murder Green, threatening harm to\r\n\nGreen's family, and making harassing telephone calls.\r\n\n          Hancock kept close track of the criminal case:  it\r\n\nacceded to various prosecution requests for information, paid\r\n\nSensimetric's expert witness fees, and in addition, several of\r\n\nits employees (including Louis, Heaslip, and Tingle) testified at\r\n\nthe trial.  Notwithstanding Hancock's cheerleading, the jury\r\n\nvoted to acquit.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                        Travel of the Case\r                                  Travel of the Case\r                                                    \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          Roche sued Hancock in a Massachusetts state court.1 \r\n\nHe asserted claims for abridgement of his civil rights pursuant\r\n\nto 42 U.S.C.   1983 and counterpart state statutes.  He also\r\n\npleaded claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, abuse of\r\n\nprocess, malicious prosecution, and wrongful discharge.  Hancock\r\n\nremoved the suit to the federal district court citing federal\r\n\nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C.    1331, 1441.\r                                     \r\n\n          After the close of discovery, Hancock sought summary\r\n\njudgment.  The district court, ruling ore tenus, found that\r                                                         \r\n\nHancock, as a matter of law, had probable cause to believe that\r\n\nthe appellant had committed or would commit a crime, and thus had\r\n\nlegal justification to report the information in its possession\r\n\nto the police.  On this basis, the court rejected the appellant's\r\n\ncivil rights, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution claims. \r\n\nFinding his other claims to be equally lacking in merit, albeit\r\n\nfor different reasons, the court granted judgment in Hancock's\r\n\nfavor across the board.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                             Analysis\r                                       Analysis\r                                               \r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n                  The Summary Judgment Standard\r                            The Summary Judgment Standard\r                                                         \r\n\n          We afford plenary review to the entry of summary\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Roche's wife, Valerie, joined him as a party plaintiff and\r\nappears as an appellant in this venue.  Since her claims (for\r\ninfliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium) are\r\nentirely derivative of his, we discuss the case as if Daniel\r\nRoche were the sole plaintiff and appellant.  Of course, our\r\nreasoning and result are fully applicable to Valerie Roche's\r\nclaims.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\njudgment on the civil rights claim.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp;\r                                                                        \r\n\nCo., 76 F.3d 413, 428 (1st Cir. 1996).  The criteria are\r             \r\n\nfamiliar:  a court may grant summary judgment if the nisi prius\r\n\nroll discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if, viewing\r\n\nthe entire record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant,\r\n\nthe proponent demonstrates its entitlement to judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of law.  See McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995) (collecting cases); see also Fed. R.\r                                                               \r\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).\r\n\n          In applying these criteria, we recognize that\r\n\n\"genuineness and materiality are not infinitely elastic\r\n\neuphemisms that may be stretched to fit whatever pererrations\r\n\ncatch a litigant's fancy.\"  Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 721\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).  An issue is \"genuine\" only when the relevant\r\n\nevidence could lead a reasonable factfinder, drawing favorable\r\n\ninferences, to decide it in the manner described by the nonmoving\r\n\nparty; a fact is \"material\" only when it possesses the capacity,\r\n\nif determined as the nonmovant wishes, to alter the outcome of\r\n\nthe lawsuit under the applicable legal tenets.  See id.  In this\r                                                                 \r\n\nconnection, it is important to remember that genuine disputes\r\n\nover material facts can only sprout out of competent and\r\n\nreasonably definite evidence actually contained in the summary\r\n\njudgment record.  See Garside, 895 F.2d at 50.  Put bluntly,\r                                       \r\n\n\"motions for summary judgment must be decided on the record as it\r\n\nstands, not on a litigant's visions of what the facts might some\r\n\nday reveal.\"  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576,\r                                                             \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n581 (1st Cir. 1994).  Thus, speculation and surmise, even when\r\n\ncoupled with effervescent optimism that something definite will\r\n\nmaterialize further down the line, are impuissant in the face of\r\n\na properly documented summary judgment motion.  See Dow v.

To be sure, the rule is not absolute:  private actors\r\n\nmay align themselves so closely with either state action or state\r\n\nactors that the undertow pulls them inexorably into the grasp of\r\n\n  1983.  See, e.g., Adickes, 398 U.S. at 152; Burton v.\r                                                              \r\n\nWilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 724 (1961).  But the case\r                                  \r\n\nat hand exemplifies the general rule, not the exception to it.\r\n\n          Here, the undisputed evidence discloses that the\r\n\npolice, of their own volition, decided to seek an arrest warrant. \r\n\nAn independent magistrate then examined the collected evidence\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nand found it sufficient to justify issuance of the warrant. \r\n\nThere is not the smallest hint that the magistrate was a Hancock\r\n\npawn, or, for that matter, that Hancock solicited the magistrate\r\n\nto act.  From that point forward, the police dictated the time,\r\n\nplace, and manner of the arrest; the district attorney's office\r\n\nframed the charges; and that office directed the ensuing\r\n\nprosecution.  Because (1) the officers who requested the warrant\r\n\nindependently exercised reasonable professional judgment in\r\n\napplying for it, cf. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 345-46 &amp; n.9\r                                               \r\n\n(1986), (2) the magistrate acted autonomously and within the\r\n\nrange of her judicial competence in issuing the warrant, and (3)\r\n\nthe district attorney acted autonomously in prosecuting the case,\r\n\nthere is no principled basis for attributing state action to\r\n\nHancock.\r\n\n          Of course, liability under   1983 requires not only\r\n\nstate action but also an unconstitutional deprivation of rights. \r\n\nThe appellant fares no better on this aspect of the inquiry.  At\r\n\na bare minimum, if probable cause to arrest and prosecute the\r\n\nappellant existed, no unconstitutional deprivation occurred.2 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2We do not in any way imply that a citizen must have\r\nprobable cause (or anything remotely approaching probable cause)\r\nbefore informing the police of a suspected crime.  Indeed, to the\r\nextent that the appellant's thesis implies that a private citizen\r\nwho articulates his suspicions to the police may, without more,\r\nbe held liable as a state actor under   1983 for an ensuing\r\narrest and prosecution if probable cause is lacking, we\r\nunequivocally reject it.  There is a strong public interest in\r\nencouraging people to bring possible wrongdoing to the\r\nauthorities' attention.  Consequently, when a private party,\r\nacting in good faith, reports suspected criminal activity to the\r\npolice, the cutlass of the federal civil rights statute remains\r\nin its scabbard.  See, e.g., Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196,\r                                                         \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nSee Franco de Jerez v.

The preferred\r                     \r\n\napproach is pragmatic; it focuses on the \"factual and practical\r\n\nconsiderations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent\r\n\nmen, not legal technicians, act.\"  Gates, 462 U.S. at 231.  Thus,\r                                                  \r\n\nthe quantity and quality of proof necessary to ground a showing\r\n\nof probable cause is not the same as the quantity and quality of\r\n\nproof necessary to convict.  See United States v. Hoffman, 832\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 1299, 1305-06 (1st Cir. 1987); United States v.

It follows that one who asserts the existence of\r\n\nprobable cause is not a guarantor either of the accuracy of the\r\n\ninformation upon which he has reasonably relied or of the\r\n\nultimate conclusion that he reasonably drew therefrom.  See\r                                                                     \r\n\nFigueroa, 818 F.2d at 1024-25.\r                  \r\n\n          Even assuming that it was Hancock (and not the police)\r\n\nwho asserted the existence of probable cause, Hancock measures up\r\n\nagainst this benchmark.  Its own staff conducted an extensive\r\n\ninvestigation of the threatening messages.  That probe ultimately\r\n\nunearthed a quartet of employees who identified the appellant's\r\n\nvoice.  These individuals were all familiar with his speech, and\r\n\neach vouchsafed the accuracy of the identification.  There is no\r\n\nsuggestion in the record that any of these persons had the\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nslightest reason to dissemble.  Standing alone, the\r\n\nidentification evidence is sufficient to support a finding of\r\n\nprobable cause.\r\n\n          What is more, the finding of probable cause does not\r\n\nrest entirely on the identification evidence.  Voice analysis\r\n\nstrongly suggested that the same individual originated the calls\r\n\nplaced in March of 1991 and March of 1992, and that the appellant\r\n\n  whose voiceprint matched the voiceprint of the man who placed\r\n\nthe March 1992 call   was that individual.  To buttress this\r\n\nconclusion, Hancock received a series of reports from\r\n\nFitzpatrick, a twenty-year veteran of the FBI, indicating that\r\n\nthe appellant had placed the calls.  On the basis of the\r\n\nsubstantial evidence produced by Hancock's investigation, a\r\n\nreasonable factfinder would have no option but to conclude that\r\n\nHancock had probable cause to report its findings to the\r\n\npolice.3\r\n\n          The appellant attempts to undermine this conclusion by\r\n\nmeans of several expedients.  We find these expedients uniformly\r\n\nunavailing.\r\n\n          First, the fact that a state court jury acquitted the\r\n\nappellant of the criminal charges does not speak to the existence\r\n\nof probable cause.  The probable cause determination is made at a\r\n\ndifferent point in time by a different, less demanding\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3It should be noted that the incentive to contact the\r\nauthorities was great; the caller threatened murder, and Hancock\r\nhad every reason to believe that Green's life was in dire\r\njeopardy.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nmethodology, and requires less proof than a conviction.  See\r                                                                      \r\n\nFigueroa, 818 F.2d at 1023; Miller, 589 F.2d at 1128.\r                                            \r\n\n          Second, the appellant's claim that the recordings were\r\n\nof such poor quality that no one could glean anything useful from\r\n\nthem, even if true in retrospect, begs the question.  Roche\r\n\npoints to nothing that furnishes any rational basis for believing\r\n\nthat Hancock, at the time it contacted the police, knew of any\r                                                           \r\n\nsuch shortcoming.  This is of decretory significance because, for\r\n\nthe purpose of determining probable cause, courts must ask\r\n\nwhether a reasonable person would rely on a particular piece of\r\n\ninformation, not whether that information was unquestionably\r\n\naccurate.4  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 231.\r                               \r\n\n          Third, the appellant's claim that the voice\r\n\nidentifications were \"shaky\" because they were performed under\r\n\nhighly suggestive conditions is argumentative.  He offers not a\r\n\nshred of probative evidence to support this asseveration, and it\r\n\nis flatly contradicted by affidavits and depositions contained in\r\n\nthe record.\r\n\n          Fourth, the appellant asserts that the voice-imprint\r\n\nanalysis performed by Sensimetric failed conclusively to identify\r\n\nhim as the perpetrator.  We agree   but that fact is largely\r\n\nbeside the relevant point.  The record is pellucid that Hancock\r\n\nbased its assessment of the expert's findings on Fitzpatrick's\r\n\naccount, and faithfully reported that account (which tended to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4In any event, the magistrate independently examined the\r\nrecordings and apparently found them to be of adequate quality to\r\nsupport the issuance of an arrest warrant.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ninculpate Roche) to the authorities.  If Sensimetric bungled   \r\n\nand there is little in the record to suggest that it did   that\r\n\nfact was not known to Hancock.\r\n\n          Fifth, the appellant maintains that Louis withheld\r\n\ncertain of Sensimetric's findings that tended to exculpate him\r\n\nand did not mention the calls attributed to Budrow.  This claim  \r\n\nwhich amounts to an assertion that Hancock impermissibly edited\r\n\nwhat it told the police   is bootless.  Although Roche was able\r\n\nto demonstrate some equivocation on Sensimetric's part at the\r                                                                       \r\n\ncriminal trial, there is nothing in the record to show that\r                        \r\n\nHancock, which dealt with Sensimetric indirectly (through\r\n\nFitzpatrick), knew more than it disclosed at the relevant time. \r                                                                        \r\n\nSimilarly, the second part of the claim conveniently overlooks\r\n\nthe fact that Hancock's investigation implicated Roche, and that\r\n\nHancock lacked any cause to make a good-faith report to the\r\n\nauthorities concerning Budrow.\r\n\n          We could continue dissecting the appellant's\r\n\nasseverations, but it would be pointless to do so.  All of them\r\n\nshare the infirmities of the ones we have addressed.  The short\r\n\nof the matter is that, when Hancock went to the police, the\r\n\nevidence it had in hand provided probable cause to believe that\r\n\nthe appellant had threatened to commit a crime and had made\r\n\nharassing telephone calls, both of which constitute violations of\r\n\nMassachusetts law.\r\n\n                                C.\r                                          C.\r                                            \r\n\n                      Malicious Prosecution\r                                Malicious Prosecution\r                                                     \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          The appellant's allegations of malicious prosecution\r\n\ncannot salvage his   1983 claim.  The law is settled that a\r\n\ngarden-variety claim of malicious prosecution garbed in the\r\n\nregalia of   1983 must fail.

Even assuming the\r\nvitality of such an approach, the existence of probable cause\r\nvitiates any arguable Fourth Amendment claim.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nremanded the state-law claims to the state court or dismissed\r\n\nthem without prejudice.  The argument lacks force.\r\n\n          A federal court exercising jurisdiction over an\r\n\nasserted federal-question claim must also exercise supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction over asserted state-law claims that arise from the\r\n\nsame nucleus of operative facts.  See 28 U.S.C.   1367(a)\r                                               \r\n\n(providing that \"in any civil action of which the district courts\r\n\nhave original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have\r\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so\r\n\nrelated to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction\r\n\nthat they form part of the same case or controversy\").  Thus, the\r\n\ncourt below had jurisdiction over the appellant's pendent state-\r\n\nlaw claims once Hancock seasonably removed the action from the\r\n\nstate court.\r\n\n          Still, the appellant argues that the situation changed\r\n\nafter the district court threw out his   1983 claim.  That\r\n\ndevelopment, he says, stripped the court of power to exercise\r\n\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.  We disagree. \r\n\nIn a federal-question case, the termination of the foundational\r\n\nfederal claim does not divest the district court of power to\r\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction but, rather, sets the stage\r\n\nfor an exercise of the court's informed discretion.  See 28\r                                                                  \r\n\nU.S.C.   1367(c)(3) (authorizing a district court to decline\r\n\nadjudication of lingering state-law claims after it has dismissed\r\n\n\"all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\").  In\r\n\ndeciding whether or not to retain jurisdiction on such an\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\noccasion, the trial court must take into account concerns of\r\n\ncomity, judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and the like. \r\n\nSee Rodriquez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1995); Vera-Lozano v. International Broadcasting, 50 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n67, 70 (1st Cir. 1995); Newman v.

While dismissal may sometimes be appropriate if\r\n\nthe federal-question claim is eliminated early in the\r\n\nproceedings, see, e.g., Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 990 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 515 (1995), each case must be\r                             \r\n\ngauged on its own facts.  The preferred approach is pragmatic and\r\n\ncase-specific.  Thus, in \"an appropriate situation, a federal\r\n\ncourt may retain jurisdiction over state-law claims\r\n\nnotwithstanding the early demise of all foundational federal\r\n\nclaims.\"  Rodriguez, 57 F.3d at 1177.\r                             \r\n\n          Here, the district court's resolve to go forward with\r\n\nthe state-law claims fell squarely within the realm of its\r\n\ndiscretion.  The litigation had matured well beyond its nascent\r\n\nstages, discovery had closed, the summary judgment record was\r\n\ncomplete, the federal and state claims were interconnected, and\r\n\npowerful interests in both judicial economy and fairness tugged\r\n\nin favor of retaining jurisdiction.  We are bound to conclude on\r\n\nthis record that the district court appropriately exercised its\r\n\ndiscretion in retaining jurisdiction over, and disposing of, the\r\n\nentire compendium of claims in the case.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\n          That ends the matter.6  Since the appellant has not\r\n\nmade a particularized argument that the district court decided\r\n\nthe state-law claims erroneously, we need go no further.  See\r                                                                       \r\n\nRyan v. Royal Ins.

When the\r\ntime was right, he never asked the district court to withhold\r\ndecision on the state-law claims and to remand them to the state\r\ncourt.  It is settled in this circuit that a litigant who could\r\nhave asked the district court for relief fairly thought to be\r\navailable, but who chose not to do so, cannot seek that relief\r\nfor the first time on appeal.

Roche.  The next day the principal\r\n\narchitect of Hancock's downsizing (a senior executive vice-\r\n\npresident who, for the sake of anonymity, we shall call \"Green\")\r\n\nreceived three electronically recorded telephone messages on his\r\n\noffice voice mail system.  The speaker threatened Green's life\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand forecast the imminent kidnapping and mutilation of his\r\n\nchildren.  Later that day Green's secretary received and recorded\r\n\nan equally ominous call.\r\n\n          Richard Louis, a Hancock employee responsible for\r\n\ninternal investigations, prepared recordings of the menacing\r\n\nmessages.  It was readily apparent that these anonymous calls\r\n\nwere made by a man endeavoring to disguise his voice.  Louis\r\n\ntentatively concluded that the mystery man was a casualty of the\r\n\nrecent reduction in force, reported the matter to the Boston\r\n\npolice, and took steps to ensure the safety of Green and his\r\n\nfamily.  When the police investigation fizzled, Hancock retained\r\n\na firm of private detectives (McCain &amp; Fitzpatrick).  Robert\r\n\nFitzpatrick spearheaded the probe.  After a preliminary review,\r\n\nFitzpatrick agreed that a disgruntled ex-employee most likely had\r\n\nmade the calls and predicted that the miscreant would strike\r\n\nagain around the anniversary of the March 18 layoffs.\r\n\n          All was quiet until the day before Christmas when Green\r\n\nreceived another anonymous call.  This call was sarcastic but not\r\n\nthreatening.  He received a second such call eight days later. \r\n\nLouis played recordings of these two calls for his supervisor,\r\n\nDavid Cullington, who thought that the voice belonged to Jack\r\n\nBudrow (an employee who had lost his job in the March layoffs). \r\n\nFitzpatrick's attempts to correlate these calls with the four\r\n\noriginal calls proved inconclusive, and Hancock discounted Budrow\r\n\nas a suspect vis-a-vis the threats.\r\n\n          In February of 1992, Hancock rehired Roche.  On March\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n13, Green received another anonymous voice mail message.  This\r\n\ntime the caller promised to kill him on the layoff anniversary\r\n\ndate.  Louis recorded the communique and notified the\r\n\nauthorities.  Cullington, understandably alarmed, played the\r\n\nrecording for Neil Smith (a manager acquainted with many of the\r\n\nemployees who had been cashiered in March 1991).  Smith had known\r\n\nRoche for twenty-two years and thought that he recognized Roche's\r\n\nvoice.  Cullington next played the four March 1991 messages for\r\n\nSmith's listening pleasure, but Smith could not positively\r\n\nidentify the caller.\r\n\n          Without mentioning Smith's views, Cullington aired the\r\n\nsame five messages for Paul Heaslip, Hancock's director of labor\r\n\nrelations, who had worked with Roche for four years.  Heaslip\r\n\nsaid that he recognized Roche's voice on the anniversary message,\r\n\nbut that he could not identify the disguised voice featured in\r\n\nthe four earlier recordings.  Without mentioning Roche's name,\r\n\nCullington consulted Barry Rubenstein, Hancock's in-house\r\n\ncounsel.  Rubenstein had worked with Roche off and on from 1985\r\n\nto 1989.  When he heard the same quintet of messages he\r\n\nvolunteered that the voice on the latest recording belonged to\r\n\nRoche.\r\n\n          At that juncture, Rubenstein assumed an active role in\r\n\nthe proceedings.  He researched the law, informed Cullington that\r\n\nthe threatening calls probably violated federal and state\r\n\ncriminal prohibitions, and stated that it would be appropriate to\r\n\nreport Hancock's suspicions to the authorities.  Rubenstein also\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncounselled Cullington that, under the terms of the applicable\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement, Roche's employment could be\r\n\nterminated.  Out of an abundance of caution, Rubenstein suggested\r\n\nthat the company obtain yet another opinion.  Following this\r\n\nadvice, Cullington auditioned the recordings for Brooks Tingle  \r\n\nan employee who was in regular contact with Roche but not privy\r\n\nto the investigation.  Tingle stated without prompting that both\r\n\nthe March 1991 and March 1992 recordings contained Roche's voice.\r\n\n          In the same time frame Fitzpatrick, acting for Hancock,\r\n\nrecruited Sensimetric, a voice analysis firm, to compare the\r\n\nMarch 1991 and March 1992 messages in order to determine whether\r\n\nthe calls had been made by the same person.  Fitzpatrick reported\r\n\nto Hancock that  Sensimetric's analysis \"strongly indicate[d]\r\n\nthat the same individual may have made both recordings.\" \r\n\nFitzpatrick also asked Sensimetric to compare the non-threatening\r\n\nmessages attributed to Budrow with the threat made in March of\r\n\n1992.  Sensimetric's analysis failed to establish a likely tie. \r\n\nOn March 23, 1992, Hancock lawfully but surreptitiously obtained\r\n\na recorded specimen of Roche's normal speaking voice. \r\n\nFitzpatrick subsequently reported to Hancock that, based on\r\n\nSensimetric's examination of the sample, Roche's voiceprint\r\n\nmatched that of the minacious caller.\r\n\n          Armed with this information, Louis recontacted the\r\n\nauthorities.  A law enforcement official requested that he secure\r\n\nsworn affidavits from the individuals who claimed to be able to\r\n\nidentify Roche's voice.  Louis followed instructions and, on\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nMarch 25, he met with representatives of the Boston Police\r\n\nDepartment and the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office. \r\n\nLouis played the five threatening messages and presented sworn\r\n\naffidavits from Smith, Heaslip, Rubenstein, and Tingle confirming\r\n\nthat each had identified Roche as the perpetrator.  Relying on\r\n\nFitzpatrick's reports, Louis also told the authorities that\r\n\nSensimetric had analyzed the recordings and had concluded that\r\n\nthe caller's speech matched Roche's normal speaking voice.\r\n\n          The police decided to pursue the case.  Without the\r\n\nparticipation of any Hancock representative, the officers applied\r\n\nfor a criminal complaint and procured an arrest warrant.  The\r\n\nnext morning four police officers arrived by prearrangement at\r\n\nthe company's Braintree office.  Louis joined them and summoned\r\n\nRoche.  After Louis handed Roche a termination letter, the\r\n\ngendarmes arrested him and, in short order, the district attorney\r\n\ncharged him with threatening to murder Green, threatening harm to\r\n\nGreen's family, and making harassing telephone calls.\r\n\n          Hancock kept close track of the criminal case:  it\r\n\nacceded to various prosecution requests for information, paid\r\n\nSensimetric's expert witness fees, and in addition, several of\r\n\nits employees (including Louis, Heaslip, and Tingle) testified at\r\n\nthe trial.  Notwithstanding Hancock's cheerleading, the jury\r\n\nvoted to acquit.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                        Travel of the Case\r                                  Travel of the Case\r                                                    \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          Roche sued Hancock in a Massachusetts state court.1 \r\n\nHe asserted claims for abridgement of his civil rights pursuant\r\n\nto 42 U.S.C.   1983 and counterpart state statutes.  He also\r\n\npleaded claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, abuse of\r\n\nprocess, malicious prosecution, and wrongful discharge.

On this basis, the court rejected the appellant's\r\n\ncivil rights, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution claims. \r\n\nFinding his other claims to be equally lacking in merit, albeit\r\n\nfor different reasons, the court granted judgment in Hancock's\r\n\nfavor across the board.

But the case\r                                  \r\n\nat hand exemplifies the general rule, not the exception to it.\r\n\n          Here, the undisputed evidence discloses that the\r\n\npolice, of their own volition, decided to seek an arrest warrant. \r\n\nAn independent magistrate then examined the collected evidence\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nand found it sufficient to justify issuance of the warrant. \r\n\nThere is not the smallest hint that the magistrate was a Hancock\r\n\npawn, or, for that matter, that Hancock solicited the magistrate\r\n\nto act.  From that point forward, the police dictated the time,\r\n\nplace, and manner of the arrest; the district attorney's office\r\n\nframed the charges; and that office directed the ensuing\r\n\nprosecution.  Because (1) the officers who requested the warrant\r\n\nindependently exercised reasonable professional judgment in\r\n\napplying for it, cf. Malley v. Briggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345-46 &amp; n.9\r                                               \r\n\n(1986), (2) the magistrate acted autonomously and within the\r\n\nrange of her judicial competence in issuing the warrant, and (3)\r\n\nthe district attorney acted autonomously in prosecuting the case,\r\n\nthere is no principled basis for attributing state action to\r\n\nHancock.\r\n\n          Of course, liability under   1983 requires not only\r\n\nstate action but also an unconstitutional deprivation of rights. \r\n\nThe appellant fares no better on this aspect of the inquiry.  At\r\n\na bare minimum, if probable cause to arrest and prosecute the\r\n\nappellant existed, no unconstitutional deprivation occurred.2 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2We do not in any way imply that a citizen must have\r\nprobable cause (or anything remotely approaching probable cause)\r\nbefore informing the police of a suspected crime.  Indeed, to the\r\nextent that the appellant's thesis implies that a private citizen\r\nwho articulates his suspicions to the police may, without more,\r\nbe held liable as a state actor under   1983 for an ensuing\r\narrest and prosecution if probable cause is lacking, we\r\nunequivocally reject it.  There is a strong public interest in\r\nencouraging people to bring possible wrongdoing to the\r\nauthorities' attention.  Consequently, when a private party,\r\nacting in good faith, reports suspected criminal activity to the\r\npolice, the cutlass of the federal civil rights statute remains\r\nin its scabbard.

See\r                                                                     \r\n\nFigueroa, 818 F.2d at 1024-25.\r                  \r\n\n          Even assuming that it was Hancock (and not the police)\r\n\nwho asserted the existence of probable cause, Hancock measures up\r\n\nagainst this benchmark.  Its own staff conducted an extensive\r\n\ninvestigation of the threatening messages.  That probe ultimately\r\n\nunearthed a quartet of employees who identified the appellant's\r\n\nvoice.  These individuals were all familiar with his speech, and\r\n\neach vouchsafed the accuracy of the identification.  There is no\r\n\nsuggestion in the record that any of these persons had the\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nslightest reason to dissemble.  Standing alone, the\r\n\nidentification evidence is sufficient to support a finding of\r\n\nprobable cause.\r\n\n          What is more, the finding of probable cause does not\r\n\nrest entirely on the identification evidence.  Voice analysis\r\n\nstrongly suggested that the same individual originated the calls\r\n\nplaced in March of 1991 and March of 1992, and that the appellant\r\n\n  whose voiceprint matched the voiceprint of the man who placed\r\n\nthe March 1992 call   was that individual.  To buttress this\r\n\nconclusion, Hancock received a series of reports from\r\n\nFitzpatrick, a twenty-year veteran of the FBI, indicating that\r\n\nthe appellant had placed the calls.  On the basis of the\r\n\nsubstantial evidence produced by Hancock's investigation, a\r\n\nreasonable factfinder would have no option but to conclude that\r\n\nHancock had probable cause to report its findings to the\r\n\npolice.3\r\n\n          The appellant attempts to undermine this conclusion by\r\n\nmeans of several expedients.  We find these expedients uniformly\r\n\nunavailing.\r\n\n          First, the fact that a state court jury acquitted the\r\n\nappellant of the criminal charges does not speak to the existence\r\n\nof probable cause.  The probable cause determination is made at a\r\n\ndifferent point in time by a different, less demanding\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3It should be noted that the incentive to contact the\r\nauthorities was great; the caller threatened murder, and Hancock\r\nhad every reason to believe that Green's life was in dire\r\njeopardy.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nmethodology, and requires less proof than a conviction.  See\r                                                                      \r\n\nFigueroa, 818 F.2d at 1023; Miller, 589 F.2d at 1128.\r                                            \r\n\n          Second, the appellant's claim that the recordings were\r\n\nof such poor quality that no one could glean anything useful from\r\n\nthem, even if true in retrospect, begs the question.  Roche\r\n\npoints to nothing that furnishes any rational basis for believing\r\n\nthat Hancock, at the time it contacted the police, knew of any\r                                                           \r\n\nsuch shortcoming.  This is of decretory significance because, for\r\n\nthe purpose of determining probable cause, courts must ask\r\n\nwhether a reasonable person would rely on a particular piece of\r\n\ninformation, not whether that information was unquestionably\r\n\naccurate.4  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 231.\r                               \r\n\n          Third, the appellant's claim that the voice\r\n\nidentifications were \"shaky\" because they were performed under\r\n\nhighly suggestive conditions is argumentative.  He offers not a\r\n\nshred of probative evidence to support this asseveration, and it\r\n\nis flatly contradicted by affidavits and depositions contained in\r\n\nthe record.\r\n\n          Fourth, the appellant asserts that the voice-imprint\r\n\nanalysis performed by Sensimetric failed conclusively to identify\r\n\nhim as the perpetrator.  We agree   but that fact is largely\r\n\nbeside the relevant point.  The record is pellucid that Hancock\r\n\nbased its assessment of the expert's findings on Fitzpatrick's\r\n\naccount, and faithfully reported that account (which tended to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4In any event, the magistrate independently examined the\r\nrecordings and apparently found them to be of adequate quality to\r\nsupport the issuance of an arrest warrant.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ninculpate Roche) to the authorities.  If Sensimetric bungled   \r\n\nand there is little in the record to suggest that it did   that\r\n\nfact was not known to Hancock.\r\n\n          Fifth, the appellant maintains that Louis withheld\r\n\ncertain of Sensimetric's findings that tended to exculpate him\r\n\nand did not mention the calls attributed to Budrow.  This claim  \r\n\nwhich amounts to an assertion that Hancock impermissibly edited\r\n\nwhat it told the police   is bootless.  Although Roche was able\r\n\nto demonstrate some equivocation on Sensimetric's part at the\r                                                                       \r\n\ncriminal trial, there is nothing in the record to show that\r                        \r\n\nHancock, which dealt with Sensimetric indirectly (through\r\n\nFitzpatrick), knew more than it disclosed at the relevant time. \r                                                                        \r\n\nSimilarly, the second part of the claim conveniently overlooks\r\n\nthe fact that Hancock's investigation implicated Roche, and that\r\n\nHancock lacked any cause to make a good-faith report to the\r\n\nauthorities concerning Budrow.\r\n\n          We could continue dissecting the appellant's\r\n\nasseverations, but it would be pointless to do so.  All of them\r\n\nshare the infirmities of the ones we have addressed.  The short\r\n\nof the matter is that, when Hancock went to the police, the\r\n\nevidence it had in hand provided probable cause to believe that\r\n\nthe appellant had threatened to commit a crime and had made\r\n\nharassing telephone calls, both of which constitute violations of\r\n\nMassachusetts law.\r\n\n                                C.\r                                          C.\r                                            \r\n\n                      Malicious Prosecution\r                                Malicious Prosecution\r                                                     \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          The appellant's allegations of malicious prosecution\r\n\ncannot salvage his   1983 claim.  The law is settled that a\r\n\ngarden-variety claim of malicious prosecution garbed in the\r\n\nregalia of   1983 must fail.  There is no substantive due process\r\n\nright under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from malicious\r\n\nprosecution, see Albright v.

The\r\n\nargument is made for the first time on appeal that, because the  \r\n\n1983 claim furnished the sole underpinning for federal\r\n\njurisdiction, the district court at that point should have\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Although the Supreme Court left open the possibility that a\r\nmalicious prosecution claim might lie under   1983 on the basis\r\nof the Fourth Amendment, see Albright, 114 S. Ct. at 813-14, we\r                                               \r\nneed not explore this virgin territory.  Even assuming the\r\nvitality of such an approach, the existence of probable cause\r\nvitiates any arguable Fourth Amendment claim.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nremanded the state-law claims to the state court or dismissed\r\n\nthem without prejudice.  The argument lacks force.\r\n\n          A federal court exercising jurisdiction over an\r\n\nasserted federal-question claim must also exercise supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction over asserted state-law claims that arise from the\r\n\nsame nucleus of operative facts.  See 28 U.S.C.   1367(a)\r                                               \r\n\n(providing that \"in any civil action of which the district courts\r\n\nhave original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have\r\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so\r\n\nrelated to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction\r\n\nthat they form part of the same case or controversy\").  Thus, the\r\n\ncourt below had jurisdiction over the appellant's pendent state-\r\n\nlaw claims once Hancock seasonably removed the action from the\r\n\nstate court.\r\n\n          Still, the appellant argues that the situation changed\r\n\nafter the district court threw out his   1983 claim.  That\r\n\ndevelopment, he says, stripped the court of power to exercise\r\n\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.  We disagree. \r\n\nIn a federal-question case, the termination of the foundational\r\n\nfederal claim does not divest the district court of power to\r\n\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction but, rather, sets the stage\r\n\nfor an exercise of the court's informed discretion.  See 28\r                                                                  \r\n\nU.S.C.   1367(c)(3) (authorizing a district court to decline\r\n\nadjudication of lingering state-law claims after it has dismissed\r\n\n\"all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\").  In\r\n\ndeciding whether or not to retain jurisdiction on such an\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\noccasion, the trial court must take into account concerns of\r\n\ncomity, judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and the like. \r\n\nSee Rodriquez v.
