We  have reviewed the  parties' briefs and\r                            \r\n\nthe record on appeal.   We affirm essentially for the reasons\r\n\nstated  in the district  court's memoranda and  orders, dated\r\n\nJuly 14, 1997 and July 28, 1997.\r\n\n     We deny  the appellee's request  that we enter  an order\r\n\npreventing appellant from further court action based upon the\r\n\nsame underlying  facts.   Such  a  request is  more  properly\r\n\naddressed to  the district court  in the event of  any future\r\n\nfiling.  We  decline to  remark upon  the appropriateness  of\r\n\ngranting such a request and  leave it to the district court's\r\n\ndiscretion if and when the occasion for consideration arises.\r\n\n     Affirmed.
