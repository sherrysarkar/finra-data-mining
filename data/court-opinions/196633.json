In  his second  trip to  this\r                                        \r\n\ncourt, Joseph Argencourt argues  that he was denied effective\r\n\nassistance of counsel during his  criminal trial and that the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in denying his  Motion to  Vacate, Set\r\n\nAside or Correct Sentence under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  Argencourt\r\n\nwas  convicted of  conspiring  with  his co-defendant  Rodney\r\n\nAndreoni to distribute cocaine.   His conviction was affirmed\r\n\non direct appeal.  United States v. Argencourt, 996 F.2d 1300\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 731 (1994).  We now\r                                         \r\n\naffirm the denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C.   2255.\r\n\n        The  facts  are  set  forth  in  our  prior  opinion.\r\n\nSuffice  it  to  say  that  the  FBI,  in  the course  of  an\r\n\nundercover investigation  of insurance fraud in  Rhode Island\r\n\nand Massachusetts, learned that a target of the investigation\r\n\n-- Andreoni -- was willing to sell substantial  quantities of\r\n\ncocaine.  Recorded conversations revealed that Argencourt was\r\n\nto  be the supplier of  the cocaine.   Argencourt, having had\r\n\nprior experience with informants wearing wires, was skittish,\r\n\nbecame spooked, and failed  to appear to consummate  the deal\r\n\non the designated day.  The government thus had no cocaine to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nshow, but proved  its case  through the recordings.

Argencourt  must\r\n\ndemonstrate  both that trial counsel's performance fell below\r\n\nan objective standard of  reasonable effectiveness, and  that\r\n\ncounsel's  deficient performance  was  so  prejudicial as  to\r\n\nundermine confidence  in  the  outcome of  the  trial.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nStrickland v.

Many of  the arguments Argencourt presents  to this court\r\nwere not  raised in the  district court  and so  will not  be\r\nheard  here.  Among others,  he has waived  his argument that\r\ncounsel erred in not requesting  an instruction on aiding and\r\nabetting liability (which, in any event, was not even charged\r\nin the count  of conviction).   Another of  his arguments  --\r\nconcerning  the examination  of Special  Agent Brotan  -- was\r\nraised  and decided  against  him on  his  direct appeal,  on\r\ngrounds of lack of prejudice to  Argencourt.  See Argencourt,\r                                                                        \r\n996 F.2d at  1304.  Argencourt is not free to relitigate this\r\nissue.  See United States v. Michaud, 901 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n1990) (per curiam).\r\n    It  is unclear  whether Argencourt  also  argues that  he\r\nreceived ineffective assistance of  counsel at the sentencing\r\nphase, as the  issue is  mentioned but not  developed in  his\r\nbrief.   Thus, we do  not address it.   See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\nZannino,  895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)

A\r\n\nreasonable  probability   is  a  probability   sufficient  to\r\n\nundermine  confidence   in  the   outcome.\"    Id.   at  694.\r                                                              \r\n\nArgencourt has demonstrated  neither objectively  ineffective\r\n\nassistance nor prejudice.\r\n\nConspiracy Indictment\r                                 \r\n\n        Argencourt   argues  counsel  should  have  moved  to\r\n\ndismiss  the conspiracy  indictment  on the  grounds that  it\r\n\nfailed to charge  possession with intent to  distribute.  The\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nargument is based on the mistaken  premise that possession is\r\n\nan  essential element of a conspiracy to distribute.  Indeed,\r\n\nit  is not.   The  statute that  criminalizes possession  and\r\n\ndistribution makes it  unlawful to \"manufacture,  distribute,\r\n\nor  dispense,   or  possess   with  intent  to   manufacture,\r                              \r\n\ndistribute, or  dispense\" a controlled substance.   21 U.S.C.\r\n\n  841(a) (emphasis added).   Possession has not been found to\r\n\nbe   a  distinct,   essential   element  of   the  crime   of\r\n\ndistribution, let alone conspiracy to distribute.  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

To the  extent  that\r                         \r\n\nArgencourt is asserting that trial counsel should have argued\r\n\nthat  the government needed to  prove possession as an \"overt\r\n\nact\" in furtherance of the charged conspiracy,  he is clearly\r\n\nwrong.   See United  States v. Shabani,  115 S. Ct.  382, 386\r                                                  \r\n\n(1994)  (holding that proof of  an overt act  is not required\r\n\nfor conviction under 21 U.S.C.   846).\r\n\nTapes\r                 \r\n\n        Argencourt is bound by the prior ruling of this court\r\n\nconcerning  his challenge  to the  replaying of  a particular\r\n\ntape to the  jury, at its request, during  its deliberations.\r\n\nSee  Argencourt,  996 F.2d  at 1305  n.6.   Variants  of this\r                           \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nclaim, which Argencourt  did not argue  on direct appeal  but\r\n\nargues  now,  fare no  better.   He focuses  on  a tape  of a\r\n\nconversation between  himself, his co-defendant  Andreoni, an\r\n\nFBI  agent, and  an undercover informant.   He  contends that\r\n\ntrial counsel should  have objected to admission  of the tape\r\n\non  grounds that it was  inaudible.  The  asserted problem of\r\n\nthe  tape  being  inaudible,  however,  appears  to  be  more\r\n\nasserted  than a  problem.   The  trial  judge alone  of  the\r\n\nlisteners had  a  defective earphone  (which  was  replaced);\r\n\ncounsel  explicitly  stated  that he  was  able  to hear  the\r\n\nrecorded conversations; and there  was no indication from the\r\n\njury of  any problem in  hearing the tape,  in the face  of a\r\n\nprior instruction from the court to raise their hands if they\r\n\ncould  not hear.  Moreover,  the jurors were  provided with a\r\n\ntranscript of the tape.  The choice by defense counsel not to\r\n\nhave the tape highlighted by questioning jurors about whether\r\n\nthey  heard it was a classic strategy choice, not amenable to\r\n\nattack under  the guise of ineffective assistance.  See Lema,\r                                                                        \r\n\n987 F.2d at 55-56.\r\n\n        Argencourt makes the additional argument that defense\r\n\ncounsel should have insisted that the entire tape recordings,\r\n\nnot  just  redacted versions,  be played  to  the jury.   But\r\n\ncertainly, trial  counsel's decision  not to demand  that the\r\n\ntapes  be  played  in their  entirety  was,  on  its face,  a\r\n\nstrategic choice  to try to limit  what the jury heard.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nLema,  987 F.2d at 55-56.   Further, defendant  has failed to\r                \r\n\nshow  any prejudice.   He  has had  access to  the unredacted\r\n\ntapes since before trial.  It  is his burden to show that the\r\n\ntapes contained unplayed   exculpatory material  or otherwise\r\n\nundermined  confidence in  the  outcome of  the  trial.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.  That he has not done.\r                      \r\n\n\"Newly Discovered\" Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n        Argencourt  argues  that  he   was  entitled  to   an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing  in  the  district  court  to  determine\r\n\nwhether certain \"newly discovered evidence,\" which he asserts\r\n\nshould have  been discovered by trial  counsel, requires that\r\n\nhis  motion  be granted.   He  argues  that counsel  erred in\r\n\nfailing  to adduce proof that phone lines were not working at\r\n\na place called the  \"Phone Connection,\" from which a  call to\r\n\nhim  was purportedly made on the date the cocaine deal was to\r\n\nbe  consummated.  He claims he first learned, while in prison\r\n\nfor this offense, from  the \"CEO of the Phone  Connection\" (a\r\n\nfellow prisoner) that  the Phone  Connection's phone  service\r\n\nhad  been stopped.  From this he argues that his co-defendant\r\n\nAndreoni could not  have made a  call to him  from the  Phone\r\n\nConnection in furtherance of the drug deal, as the government\r\n\nasserted  at trial.    He  asserts  that  this  evidence  was\r\n\n\"discovered\"  after  the  district court  denied  his    2255\r\n\nmotion.  The government  says there is nothing new  about the\r\n\nPhone Connection evidence, that it  was well known to defense\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncounsel  before  trial,  and  that  the jury  even  had  such\r\n\nevidence  before it.  In  all events, Argencourt  did not ask\r\n\nthe district court to consider this evidence or to give him a\r\n\nhearing, and so has waived the argument.\r\n\n        Even if the  claim had been properly  raised, and the\r\n\nevidence truly  \"newly discovered,\"  it would still  fall far\r\n\nshort.   Even should  the phone call  not have  been made  to\r\n\nArgencourt from his co-defendant from the listed lines at the\r\n\nPhone  Connection   on  the   scheduled  date  of   the  drug\r\n\ntransaction,  no  resulting prejudice  could  be established.\r\n\nThe  jury could have credited the testimony before it that an\r\n\nillegal  line was rigged and used for the call.

Argencourt must demonstrate both that trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable effectiveness, and that counsel's deficient performance was so prejudicial as to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.   See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984);  Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1993).   In determining whether trial counsel's performance fell below the relevant objective benchmark, \"[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential,\" and \"every effort [should] be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.   The court \"must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance;  that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.' \"  Id.

The requisite showing of prejudice requires more than postulating that counsel's \"errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\"  Id. at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067.   Rather, Argencourt must affirmatively prove \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.   A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"  Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.   Argencourt has demonstrated neither objectively ineffective assistance nor prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conspiracy Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argencourt argues counsel should have moved to dismiss the conspiracy indictment on the grounds that it failed to charge possession with intent to distribute.   The argument is based on the mistaken premise that possession is an essential element of a conspiracy to distribute.   Indeed, it is not.   The statute that criminalizes possession and distribution makes it unlawful to \"manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense\" a controlled substance.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a) (emphasis added).   Possession has not been found to be a distinct, essential element of the crime of distribution, let alone conspiracy to distribute.   See United States v. Polan, 970 F.2d 1280, 1282 (3d Cir.1991) (\"[T]he offense of illegal drug distribution ... contains three essential elements:  the [defendant] must (1) knowingly or intentionally (2) distribute (3) a controlled substance.\"), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 953, 113 S.Ct. 1367, 122 L.Ed.2d 745 (1993).   To the extent that Argencourt is asserting that trial counsel should have argued that the government needed to prove possession as an \"overt act\" in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, he is clearly wrong.   See United States v. Shabani, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 382, 386, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994) (holding that proof of an overt act is not required for conviction under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Tapes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argencourt is bound by the prior ruling of this court concerning his challenge to the replaying of a particular tape to the jury, at its request, during its deliberations.   See Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1305 n. 6.   Variants of this claim, which Argencourt did not argue on direct appeal but argues now, fare no better.   He focuses on a tape of a conversation between himself, his co-defendant Andreoni, an FBI agent, and an undercover informant.   He contends that trial counsel should have objected to admission of the tape on grounds that it was inaudible.   The asserted problem of the tape being inaudible, however, appears to be more asserted than a problem.   The trial judge alone of the listeners had a defective earphone (which was replaced);  counsel explicitly stated that he was able to hear the recorded conversations;  and there was no indication from the jury of any problem in hearing the tape, in the face of a prior instruction from the court to raise their hands if they could not hear.   Moreover, the jurors were provided with a transcript of the tape.   The choice by defense counsel not to have the tape highlighted by questioning jurors about whether they heard it was a classic strategy choice, not amenable to attack under the guise of ineffective assistance.   See Lema, 987 F.2d at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argencourt makes the additional argument that defense counsel should have insisted that the entire tape recordings, not just redacted versions, be played to the jury.   But certainly, trial counsel's decision not to demand that the tapes be played in their entirety was, on its face, a strategic choice to try to limit what the jury heard.   See Lema, 987 F.2d at 55-56.   Further, defendant has failed to show any prejudice.   He has had access to the unredacted tapes since before trial.   It is his burden to show that the tapes contained unplayed exculpatory material or otherwise undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial.   See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.   That he has not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"Newly Discovered\" Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argencourt argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the district court to determine whether certain \"newly discovered evidence,\" which he asserts should have been discovered by trial counsel, requires that his motion be granted.   He argues that counsel erred in failing to adduce proof that phone lines were not working at a place called the \"Phone Connection,\" from which a call to him was purportedly made on the date the cocaine deal was to be consummated.   He claims he first learned, while in prison for this offense, from the \"CEO of the Phone Connection\" (a fellow prisoner) that the Phone Connection's phone service had been stopped.   From this he argues that his co-defendant Andreoni could not have made a call to him from the Phone Connection in furtherance of the drug deal, as the government asserted at trial.   He asserts that this evidence was \"discovered\" after the district court denied his &#167; 2255 motion.   The government says there is nothing new about the Phone Connection evidence, that it was well known to defense counsel before trial, and that the jury even had such evidence before it.   In all events, Argencourt did not ask the district court to consider this evidence or to give him a hearing, and so has waived the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the claim had been properly raised, and the evidence truly \"newly discovered,\" it would still fall far short.   Even should the phone call not have been made to Argencourt from his co-defendant from the listed lines at the Phone Connection on the scheduled date of the drug transaction, no resulting prejudice could be established.   The jury could have credited the testimony before it that an illegal line was rigged and used for the call.   Argencourt's suggestion that phone company records (which Argencourt asserts trial counsel should have obtained) would have shown that telephone service had been cancelled amounts to naught.   To the extent that the phone call testimony at trial was relevant to establish that Argencourt, on the scheduled date, was in the vicinity of the location where the parties had agreed the drug transaction would be completed, independent evidence that his car was seen in the area at the time undercuts the utility of this \"newly discovered evidence.\"   Furthermore, if the phone call testimony was somewhat relevant to the government's case in support of the charge of attempting to distribute drugs (of which Argencourt was acquitted), it had little apparent bearing on the government's case in support of the conspiracy charge.   That case, which was based primarily on the earlier recorded conversations between Argencourt, Andreoni, and FBI agents, would have been unaffected by the status of the Phone Connection's telephones.   Thus, Argencourt has shown no prejudice from any failure by trial counsel to obtain the Phone Connection evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Many of the arguments Argencourt presents to this court were not raised in the district court and so will not be heard here.   Among others, he has waived his argument that counsel erred in not requesting an instruction on aiding and abetting liability (which, in any event, was not even charged in the count of conviction).   Another of his arguments--concerning the examination of Special Agent Brotan--was raised and decided against him on his direct appeal, on grounds of lack of prejudice to Argencourt.   See Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1304.   Argencourt is not free to relitigate this issue.   See United States v. Michaud, 901 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam)</p>\n        <p>It is unclear whether Argencourt also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase, as the issue is mentioned but not developed in his brief.   Thus, we do not address it.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).

See Lema, 987 F.2d at 55-56.   Further, defendant has failed to show any prejudice.   He has had access to the unredacted tapes since before trial.   It is his burden to show that the tapes contained unplayed exculpatory material or otherwise undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial.   See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.   That he has not done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"Newly Discovered\" Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Argencourt argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the district court to determine whether certain \"newly discovered evidence,\" which he asserts should have been discovered by trial counsel, requires that his motion be granted.   He argues that counsel erred in failing to adduce proof that phone lines were not working at a place called the \"Phone Connection,\" from which a call to him was purportedly made on the date the cocaine deal was to be consummated.   He claims he first learned, while in prison for this offense, from the \"CEO of the Phone Connection\" (a fellow prisoner) that the Phone Connection's phone service had been stopped.   From this he argues that his co-defendant Andreoni could not have made a call to him from the Phone Connection in furtherance of the drug deal, as the government asserted at trial.   He asserts that this evidence was \"discovered\" after the district court denied his &#167; 2255 motion.   The government says there is nothing new about the Phone Connection evidence, that it was well known to defense counsel before trial, and that the jury even had such evidence before it.   In all events, Argencourt did not ask the district court to consider this evidence or to give him a hearing, and so has waived the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the claim had been properly raised, and the evidence truly \"newly discovered,\" it would still fall far short.   Even should the phone call not have been made to Argencourt from his co-defendant from the listed lines at the Phone Connection on the scheduled date of the drug transaction, no resulting prejudice could be established.   The jury could have credited the testimony before it that an illegal line was rigged and used for the call.   Argencourt's suggestion that phone company records (which Argencourt asserts trial counsel should have obtained) would have shown that telephone service had been cancelled amounts to naught.   To the extent that the phone call testimony at trial was relevant to establish that Argencourt, on the scheduled date, was in the vicinity of the location where the parties had agreed the drug transaction would be completed, independent evidence that his car was seen in the area at the time undercuts the utility of this \"newly discovered evidence.\"   Furthermore, if the phone call testimony was somewhat relevant to the government's case in support of the charge of attempting to distribute drugs (of which Argencourt was acquitted), it had little apparent bearing on the government's case in support of the conspiracy charge.   That case, which was based primarily on the earlier recorded conversations between Argencourt, Andreoni, and FBI agents, would have been unaffected by the status of the Phone Connection's telephones.   Thus, Argencourt has shown no prejudice from any failure by trial counsel to obtain the Phone Connection evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Many of the arguments Argencourt presents to this court were not raised in the district court and so will not be heard here.   Among others, he has waived his argument that counsel erred in not requesting an instruction on aiding and abetting liability (which, in any event, was not even charged in the count of conviction).   Another of his arguments--concerning the examination of Special Agent Brotan--was raised and decided against him on his direct appeal, on grounds of lack of prejudice to Argencourt.   See Argencourt, 996 F.2d at 1304.   Argencourt is not free to relitigate this issue.   See United States v.
