BOWLER,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                  v.\n\n                        STATE OF MAINE, ET AL.,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n              [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Eugene B. Bowler on brief pro se.\n     G. Steven Rowe, Attorney General, and William R. Fisher,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          December 27, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam.    Eugene Bowler filed this pro se action\n\nin an effort to challenge the constitutionality of Maine's\n\n\"stalking\" statute.    See 17-A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 210-A.   The\n\naction ended up being dismissed because of his noncompliance\n\nwith a court order directing that he respond to defendants'\n\ninterrogatories (and their accompanying requests for production\n\nof documents).    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).        Such a\n\ndisposition is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.          See,\n\ne.g., National Hockey League v. Metrop. Hockey Club, Inc., 427\n\nU.S. 639, 642 (1976) (per curiam).     Finding none, we affirm.\n\n          There   is    no   need    for   extended   discussion,\n\nparticularly since Bowler has offered little in the way of\n\npertinent argumentation on appeal. A number of factors support\n\nthe district court's decision.        For example, the various\n\nobjections voiced by Bowler to the interrogatories prove to\n\nhave been baseless.      He protested that providing complete\n\nanswers would impose an intolerable burden and would implicate\n\nFifth Amendment concerns, but he never elaborated in either\n\nregard.   He also complained that many of the questions were\n\n\"not relevant\"--overlooking, among other things, the fact that\n\nhis as-applied constitutional challenges were necessarily fact-\n\ndependent. In any event, whatever the merit of his objections,\n\nBowler persisted in his recalcitrance even after being ordered\n\nto furnish appropriate responses.    As to other points, we note\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f that the interrogatories were limited in scope and number; that\n\n defendants       undertook     no   other     discovery;   that     Bowler   was\n\n  familiar with the judicial process; and that he likely would\n\n  not have prevailed on his underlying constitutional claims.\n\n                To be sure, Bowler could retort that he was appearing\n\n  pro se; that he had otherwise acted in prompt fashion; that the\n\n  case    was    relatively     young;       and   that   he   had    not     been\n\n  specifically warned that dismissal might ensue. Yet he has not\n\n  done so.1       Instead, to excuse his noncompliance with the\n\n  district court order, Bowler points out that a challenge\n\n  thereto was pending before this court by way of a \"petition for\n\n  writ of prohibition.\" This argument fails for several reasons.\n\n  First, that petition was patently without merit, inasmuch as\n\n  the discovery order was a garden-variety, discretionary ruling\n\n  that was neither appealable nor subject to mandamus review.\n\n  See, e.g., Bennett v. City of Boston, 54 F.3d 18, 20-21 (1st\n\n  Cir. 1995) (per curiam).           Second, by the time the dismissal\n\n  here occurred, Bowler's petition had been denied by this court\n\n  and    was    the   subject   of   a   request    for   en   banc   review--a\n\n  frivolous filing. Finally, as the district court noted, Bowler\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        The cited factors would not have been dispositive in any\nevent. See, e.g., Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., 920\nF.2d 1072, 1078 n.9 (1st Cir. 1990) (stopping short of any\nsuggestion that lack of prior warning was \"controlling\").\n\n                                         -3-\n\fnever sought a stay of the discovery order pending his attempt\n\nto obtain appellate relief.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
