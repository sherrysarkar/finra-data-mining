The sole issue on this appeal is\r                                      \r\n\nwhether  the  district  court  erred  in   denying  Alexander\r\n\nMontanez the  benefit in  sentencing of the  recently enacted\r\n\n\"safety valve\" provision  which relates to  mandatory minimum\r\n\nsentences.  18  U.S.C.   3553(f); see  U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.   We\r                                                 \r\n\nreadily conclude that there  was no error in this case.   But\r\n\nin light  of the  far-reaching interpretation of  the statute\r\n\nurged  by the government,  something more  than a  per curiam\r                                                                         \r\n\naffirmance is required.\r\n\n     Montanez  and three  others were  arrested in  May 1994,\r\n\nafter Montanez  had aided  in five drug  sales to  undercover\r\n\nagents.  Montanez'  role was limited to  delivering the drugs\r\n\nand  collecting  the purchase  money.   He  was  charged with\r\n\nconspiring to  distribute drugs,  21 U.S.C.    846,  and with\r\n\nfive  substantive  counts   of  possession  with  intent   to\r\n\ndistribute, each relating to a different drug sale, 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n  841.  On  January 26, 1995, Montanez pleaded guilty  to all\r\n\ncounts.\r\n\n     On June 2,  1995, the district  court held a  sentencing\r\n\nhearing.   Montanez  protested that  the government's  latest\r\n\ncomputation  of  drug  quantity,  if  accepted,  triggered  a\r\n\nmandatory five-year minimum  sentence under  the statute,  21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B)(i).  Montanez said that he had not been\r\n\nwarned of  this  possibility  at  the time  that  he  pleaded\r\n\nguilty.  The district  court continued the sentencing hearing\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nto  June  19,  1995,  offering Montanez  the  opportunity  to\r\n\nwithdraw his plea.       Instead  of  withdrawing  his  plea,\r\n\nMontanez  filed a  supplemental memorandum  on June  9, 1995,\r\n\nasking the court to  apply the new safety valve  provision of\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    3553(f).   That provision requires  the district\r\n\ncourt  to disregard  the statutory  mandatory minimum  if the\r\n\ncourt finds at sentencing that five conditions have been met.\r\n\nFour, concededly  met in  this case, concern  the defendant's\r\n\nprior history and the nature of the crime.  The fifth finding\r\n\nis that:\r\n\n     [N]ot   later  than  the  time  of  the  sentencing\r\n     hearing, the defendant  has truthfully provided  to\r\n     the  Government all  information  and evidence  the\r\n     defendant  has concerning  the offense  or offenses\r\n     that  were part of the same course of conduct or of\r\n     a common  scheme or  plan, but  the  fact that  the\r\n     defendant  has   no   relevant  or   useful   other\r\n     information  to provide  or that the  Government is\r\n     already aware of the information shall not preclude\r\n     a determination by the court that the defendant has\r\n     complied with this requirement.\r\n\n     On the same date, June  9, 1995, Montanez' counsel  sent\r\n\nthe assistant  United States  attorney  an eight-page  letter\r\n\nsetting forth  what purported  to be Montanez'  \"information\"\r\n\nconcerning  the  crimes charged  in  the  case.   The  letter\r\n\ncontained a good  deal of  detail about the  crimes, but  the\r\n\ndetail came as  no surprise  to the prosecutor.   With  minor\r\n\nword changes, and not many of these, defense counsel's letter\r\n\nwas drawn almost verbatim  from an affidavit filed by  one of\r\n\nthe federal agents early in the case.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     The government filed a response, arguing inter alia that\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe letter  was plainly insufficient and  pointing to various\r\n\npieces of information that Montanez had not disclosed such as\r\n\nhow  he obtained the heroin  involved in several  of the five\r\n\ntransactions, where it was stored,  and who was the supplier.\r\n\nThis  information   was  not  contained  in   the  government\r\n\naffidavit or in Montanez' letter to the prosecutor.  Montanez\r\n\nmade no reply to this filing.\r\n\n     At the sentencing hearing on June 19, 1995, the district\r\n\ncourt ruled that it did not find that Montanez had truthfully\r\n\nprovided to the government  all information and evidence that\r\n\nhe possessed.  The  court said that it thought  that Congress\r\n\nhad  intended the  safety valve for  defendants who  tried to\r\n\ncooperate by  being debriefed by  the government.   But, said\r\n\nthe  court, it  would  \"cheerfully\" have  given Montanez  the\r\n\nbenefit  of the safety valve  if Montanez had  just come into\r\n\ncourt  \"and said everything he knew and persuaded me that was\r\n\neverything he knew . . . .  But he hasn't.\"\r\n\n     In due course, the  district court imposed the mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence and Montanez now appeals.  He argues that no\r\n\ndebriefing requirement exists and,  in addition, that defense\r\n\ncounsel's  June  9   letter  complied   with  the   statutory\r\n\nrequirement.   The  government  argues that  a debriefing  is\r\n\nrequired  but, in  the  alternative, says  that the  district\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ncourt properly found that Montanez had  not made the required\r\n\ndisclosure in any form.\r\n\n     It is  easy to understand  why the government  wants the\r\n\nstatute construed  to impose  a requirement that  a defendant\r\n\noffer  himself  to the  prosecutor for  a  debriefing.   If a\r\n\ndefendant  does  have  useful  information, it  can  best  be\r\n\nextracted and preserved  in that setting.   And a  debriefing\r\n\nalso puts  the  government in  the  best position  to  decide\r\n\nwhether it thinks that the defendant is telling everything he\r\n\nknows  and, if it believes  otherwise, to argue  to the court\r\n\nthat the safety valve provision should not be applied.\r\n\n     But the issue before us  is whether the statute requires\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe defendant to offer himself for debriefing as an automatic\r\n\npre-condition in every case, and it  is hard to locate such a\r\n\nrequirement in the statute.   All that Congress said  is that\r\n\nthe defendant be  found by the time of the sentencing to have\r\n\n\"truthfully provided  to the Government\"  all the information\r\n\nand evidence that he has.  Nothing in the statute, nor in any\r\n\nlegislative  history drawn  to our  attention,  specifies the\r\n\nform or place or manner of the disclosure.\r\n\n     The government's best argument turns on the relationship\r\n\nof the safety valve statute to the preexisting provisions for\r\n\na  substantial  assistance departure.    From  the outset,  a\r\n\ndeparture  below  the  statutory  minimum  sentence  has been\r\n\nallowed  where  the prosecutor  moves  the court  for  such a\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ndeparture  on the  ground  that the  defendant has  furnished\r\n\nsubstantial  assistance  to  the  government.   18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3553(e);  U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.   The decision to  move, with few\r\n\nqualifications,  is committed to the prosecutor's discretion.\r\n\nCarey v. United States, 50 F.3d 1097, 1101 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                  \r\n\n     As the  Seventh Circuit compactly explained  in a recent\r\n\ndecision, Congress discovered that substantial assistance may\r\n\ncommonly   be  available   from  highly   culpable  drug-ring\r\n\norganizers but often not from less culpable street dealers or\r\n\n\"mules\"  who  merely  transport  drugs.    United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nArrington, 73 F.3d 144, 147-48 (7th Cir. 1996).  To cope with\r                     \r\n\nthis  situation, section  3553(f) was  enacted in  1994.   It\r\n\nrewards  low level  offenders who  meet the  other conditions\r\n\nspecified  (e.g., non-violence, little  criminal history) and\r                            \r\n\nwho truthfully  provide all  of the information  and evidence\r\n\nthey have, even if it does not prove useful.  Id. at 147.\r                                                             \r\n\n     Montanez  seeks to contrast  the preexisting substantial\r\n\nassistance statute with the new safety valve statute, arguing\r\n\nthat the former is concerned with cooperation, but the latter\r\n\nonly   with  culpability.     While   there  are   mechanical\r\n\ndifferences  between  the  statutes,  see  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nAcosta-Olivas, 71 F.3d 373, 379 (10th Cir. 1995), both values\r                         \r\n\nwere  probably of  concern  to Congress  in drafting  section\r\n\n3553(f).   In enacting the  safety valve provision,  we think\r\n\nCongress was aiming  its leniency at low level defendants who\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\ndid  their best  to cooperate  to the  extent of  making full\r                                         \r\n\ndisclosure.1   Such disclosure may prove to be of use even if\r\n\nit does not amount to \"substantial assistance.\"\r\n\n     Section 3553(f) could easily have required a debriefing;\r\n\ncertainly  that  would have  provided  a  brighter line  than\r\n\nmerely to require that the defendant \"truthfully provide [his\r\n\ninformation and evidence]\" in some unspecified form.  But the\r\n\nfact remains  that  Congress wrote  the  statute as  it  did.\r\n\nCourts  can and  do apply  restrictive  glosses  on statutory\r\n\nlanguage,  but  everything  depends  on the  breadth  of  the\r\n\nlinguistic leap and strength of the arguments for making it. \r\n\nHere, we think that Congress'  own formulation is adequate to\r\n\nachieve its ends.\r\n\n     Courts  have  thus far  found  it  fairly easy  to  cull\r\n\nserious efforts at full disclosure from mere pretense.   This\r\n\ncourt in Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3, readily dismissed a defendant's\r                          \r\n\nclaim  that the  necessary disclosure  was achieved  when the\r\n\ngovernment covertly taped him  in the course of the  criminal\r\n\nventure; and  another circuit only recently  rejected a claim\r\n\nthat  a defendant had made the necessary disclosure through a\r\n\nroutine interview with his  probation officer.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1United States v.

Ct. 542 (1995).\r\n\n     As a practical matter, a defendant who declines to offer\r\n\nhimself for a debriefing  takes a very dangerous course.   It\r\n\nis up to the defendant to persuade the district court that he\r\n\nhas  \"truthfully  provided\"   the  required  information  and\r\n\nevidence to the  government.  United States v. Flanagan, 1996\r                                                                   \r\n\nWL 143333, at *2-3 (5th Cir. Mar. 29, 1996).  And a defendant\r\n\nwho  contents  himself  with a  letter  runs  an  obvious and\r\n\nprofound risk:  The government is perfectly free to point out\r\n\nthe  suspicious  omissions at  sentencing,  and the  district\r\n\ncourt  is entitled to make  a common sense  judgment, just as\r\n\nthe district judge did in this case.\r\n\n     Of  course,  nothing  prevents  a  district  court  from\r\n\ndeciding  that  it is  unpersuaded  of  full disclosure,  cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRodriguez,  60 F.3d  at 195,  but might  be if  the defendant\r                     \r\n\nsubmitted himself to a debriefing.  Yet  such a determination\r\n\nwould rest in  the hands  of the judge,  not the  prosecutor.\r\n\nThe possibility remains, however rare, that a defendant could\r\n\nmake  a disclosure without  a debriefing (e.g.,  by letter to\r                                                          \r\n\nthe  prosecutor)   so  truthful  and  so   complete  that  no\r\n\nprosecutor could fairly suggest any gap or omission.\r\n\n     To  suggest  this course  as  a  possibility is  not  to\r\n\nencourage  it.  A defendant  whose only concern  is to secure\r\n\nthe  benefit of the safety  valve provision should be anxious\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nfor  a debriefing.   It  offers an  occasion to  persuade the\r\n\ngovernment that  the defendant  has made full  disclosure and\r\n\nthus to  win its \"recommendation\" for  avoiding the mandatory\r\n\nminimum.

But  full disclosure  is  the price  that\r\n\nCongress has attached  to relief under  the statute, and  the\r\n\nburden  remains on  the defendant  to prove  his entitlement.\r\n\nFlanagan, 1996  WL 143333  at *3.   Defendants  will discover\r                    \r\n\nsoon enough that there is little mileage in gambits  designed\r\n\nto  qualify  the defendant  for  relief  while avoiding  full\r\n\ndisclosure.        \r\n\n     This case is  a good illustration of  a bad gambit.   In\r\n\ntheory full disclosure might exist where a defendant's letter\r\n\nrecited back to the government, in virtually the government's\r\n\nown  words,   the  information   already  possessed  by   the\r\n\ngovernment  and nothing more.  But in practice this is hardly\r\n\nlikely, especially where  several different drug transactions\r\n\nand multiple  players are involved.   Here--merely to mention\r\n\nthe  most  conspicuous  omission--Montanez'  letter  does not\r\n\ndisclose  as to several of the  transactions who provided him\r\n\nwith the drugs he delivered.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     It is enough that  Montanez did not disclose information\r\n\nthat  he  might  reasonably   be  expected  to  possess,  nor\r\n\npersuasively explain its absence.   See Wrenn, 66 F.3d  at 3.\r                                                         \r\n\nThe failure to  disclose is so  patent in this  case that  no\r\n\nreason  exists  for extended  discussion.    Indeed, even  on\r\n\nappeal  Montanez offers no plausible reason  why he could not\r\n\nhave  provided  such  information  as the  identity  of  each\r\n\nseller.   The district court did not \"clearly err\" in finding\r\n\nthat the  fifth requirement  was unsatisfied.   Rodriguez, 69\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 144. \r\n\n     Montanez  now argues that he ought to have been given an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing on the question  whether he had made full\r\n\ndisclosure.   But he  did not  request such a  hearing in  he\r\n\ndistrict  court  and  that  largely disposes  of  his  claim.\r\n\nUnited States v. Gertner,  65 F.3d 963, 969 (1st  Cir. 1995).\r                                    \r\n\nEven on appeal  Montanez does not  suggest what testimony  he\r\n\ncould  have offered to show that he had made full disclosure.\r\n\nOn the present facts,  a conclusory statement by Montanez  on\r\n\nhis own behalf would never have been credited.\r\n\n     Montanez might  have made a different  but related claim\r\n\non appeal, namely, that the  district judge should have given\r\n\nhim  a second  chance to make  full disclosure  after finding\r\n\nthat his June 9 letter was inadequate.  But  this claim would\r\n\nalso be foreclosed by  the failure to ask the  district court\r\n\nfor such  an opportunity.

We readily conclude that there was no error in this case.   But in light of the far-reaching interpretation of the statute urged by the government, something more than a per curiam affirmance is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez and three others were arrested in May 1994, after Montanez had aided in five drug sales to undercover agents.   Montanez' role was limited to delivering the drugs and collecting the purchase money.   He was charged with conspiring to distribute drugs, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and with five substantive counts of possession with intent to distribute, each relating to a different drug sale, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841.   On January 26, 1995, Montanez pleaded guilty to all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1995, the district court held a sentencing hearing.   Montanez protested that the government's latest computation of drug quantity, if accepted, triggered a mandatory five-year minimum sentence under the statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)(i).   Montanez said that he had not been warned of this possibility at the time that he pleaded guilty.   The district court continued the sentencing hearing to June 19, 1995, offering Montanez the opportunity to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of withdrawing his plea, Montanez filed a supplemental memorandum on June 9, 1995, asking the court to apply the new safety valve provision of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f).   That provision requires the district court to disregard the statutory mandatory minimum if the court finds at sentencing that five conditions have been met.   Four, concededly met in this case, concern the defendant's prior history and the nature of the crime.   The fifth finding is that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>[N]ot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same date, June 9, 1995, Montanez' counsel sent the assistant United States attorney an eight-page letter setting forth what purported to be Montanez' \"information\" concerning the crimes charged in the case.   The letter contained a good deal of detail about the crimes, but the detail came as no surprise to the prosecutor.   With minor word changes, and not many of these, defense counsel's letter was drawn almost verbatim from an affidavit filed by one of the federal agents early in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a response, arguing inter alia that the letter was plainly insufficient and pointing to various pieces of information that Montanez had not disclosed such as how he obtained the heroin involved in several of the five transactions, where it was stored, and who was the supplier.   This information was not contained in the government affidavit or in Montanez' letter to the prosecutor.   Montanez made no reply to this filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on June 19, 1995, the district court ruled that it did not find that Montanez had truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence that he possessed.   The court said that it thought that Congress had intended the safety valve for defendants who tried to cooperate by being debriefed by the government. But, said the court, it would \"cheerfully\" have given Montanez the benefit of the safety valve if Montanez had just come into court \"and said everything he knew and persuaded me that was everything he knew....  But he hasn't.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence and Montanez now appeals.   He argues that no debriefing requirement exists and, in addition, that defense counsel's June 9 letter complied with the statutory requirement.   The government argues that a debriefing is required but, in the alternative, says that the district court properly found that Montanez had not made the required disclosure in any form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is easy to understand why the government wants the statute construed to impose a requirement that a defendant offer himself to the prosecutor for a debriefing.   If a defendant does have useful information, it can best be extracted and preserved in that setting.   And a debriefing also puts the government in the best position to decide whether it thinks that the defendant is telling everything he knows and, if it believes otherwise, to argue to the court that the safety valve provision should not be applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the issue before us is whether the statute requires the defendant to offer himself for debriefing as an automatic pre-condition in every case, and it is hard to locate such a requirement in the statute.   All that Congress said is that the defendant be found by the time of the sentencing to have \"truthfully provided to the Government\" all the information and evidence that he has.   Nothing in the statute, nor in any legislative history drawn to our attention, specifies the form or place or manner of the disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's best argument turns on the relationship of the safety valve statute to the preexisting provisions for a substantial assistance departure.   From the outset, a departure below the statutory minimum sentence has been allowed where the prosecutor moves the court for such a departure on the ground that the defendant has furnished substantial assistance to the government.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.   The decision to move, with few qualifications, is committed to the prosecutor's discretion.  Carey v. United States, 50 F.3d 1097, 1101 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Seventh Circuit compactly explained in a recent decision, Congress discovered that substantial assistance may commonly be available from highly culpable drug-ring organizers but often not from less culpable street dealers or \"mules\" who merely transport drugs.  United States v. Arrington, 73 F.3d 144, 147-48 (7th Cir.1996).   To cope with this situation, section 3553(f) was enacted in 1994.   It rewards low level offenders who meet the other conditions specified (e.g., non-violence, little criminal history) and who truthfully provide all of the information and evidence they have, even if it does not prove useful.  Id. at 147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez seeks to contrast the preexisting substantial assistance statute with the new safety valve statute, arguing that the former is concerned with cooperation, but the latter only with culpability.   While there are mechanical differences between the statutes, see United States v. Acosta-Olivas, 71 F.3d 375, 379 (10th Cir.1995), both values were probably of concern to Congress in drafting section 3553(f).   In enacting the safety valve provision, we think Congress was aiming its leniency at low level defendants who did their best to cooperate to the extent of making full disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Such disclosure may prove to be of use even if it does not amount to \"substantial assistance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(f) could easily have required a debriefing;  certainly that would have provided a brighter line than merely to require that the defendant \"truthfully provide [his information and evidence]\" in some unspecified form.   But the fact remains that Congress wrote the statute as it did.   Courts can and do apply restrictive glosses on statutory language, but everything depends on the breadth of the linguistic leap and strength of the arguments for making it.   Here, we think that Congress' own formulation is adequate to achieve its ends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have thus far found it fairly easy to cull serious efforts at full disclosure from mere pretense.   This court in Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3, readily dismissed a defendant's claim that the necessary disclosure was achieved when the government covertly taped him in the course of the criminal venture;  and another circuit only recently rejected a claim that a defendant had made the necessary disclosure through a routine interview with his probation officer.  United States v. Rodriguez, 60 F.3d 193, 196 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 542, 133 L.Ed.2d 446 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, a defendant who declines to offer himself for a debriefing takes a very dangerous course.   It is up to the defendant to persuade the district court that he has \"truthfully provided\" the required information and evidence to the government.  United States v. Flanagan, 80 F.3d 143, 145-47 (5th Cir.1996).   And a defendant who contents himself with a letter runs an obvious and profound risk:  The government is perfectly free to point out the suspicious omissions at sentencing, and the district court is entitled to make a common sense judgment, just as the district judge did in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, nothing prevents a district court from deciding that it is unpersuaded of full disclosure, cf. Rodriguez, 60 F.3d at 195, but might be if the defendant submitted himself to a debriefing.   Yet such a determination would rest in the hands of the judge, not the prosecutor.   The possibility remains, however rare, that a defendant could make a disclosure without a debriefing (e.g., by letter to the prosecutor) so truthful and so complete that no prosecutor could fairly suggest any gap or omission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To suggest this course as a possibility is not to encourage it.   A defendant whose only concern is to secure the benefit of the safety valve provision should be anxious for a debriefing.   It offers an occasion to persuade the government that the defendant has made full disclosure and thus to win its \"recommendation\" for avoiding the mandatory minimum.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 comment (n.8).   If the government still opposes the departure, the defendant can say to the judge that the government had a chance to ask everything it wanted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants often have reasons, such as loyalty to a confederate or fear of retribution, for not wanting to make full disclosure.   But full disclosure is the price that Congress has attached to relief under the statute, and the burden remains on the defendant to prove his entitlement.  Flanagan, 80 F.3d at 146-47.   Defendants will discover soon enough that there is little mileage in gambits designed to qualify the defendant for relief while avoiding full disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a good illustration of a bad gambit.   In theory full disclosure might exist where a defendant's letter recited back to the government, in virtually the government's own words, the information already possessed by the government and nothing more.   But in practice this is hardly likely, especially where several different drug transactions and multiple players are involved.   Here--merely to mention the most conspicuous omission--Montanez' letter does not disclose as to several of the transactions who provided him with the drugs he delivered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough that Montanez did not disclose information that he might reasonably be expected to possess, nor persuasively explain its absence.   See Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3.   The failure to disclose is so patent in this case that no reason exists for extended discussion.   Indeed, even on appeal Montanez offers no plausible reason why he could not have provided such information as the identity of each seller.   The district court did not \"clearly err\" in finding that the fifth requirement was unsatisfied.  Rodriguez, 69 F.3d at 144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez now argues that he ought to have been given an evidentiary hearing on the question whether he had made full disclosure.   But he did not request such a hearing in the district court and that largely disposes of his claim.  United States v. Gertner, 65 F.3d 963, 969 (1st Cir.1995).   Even on appeal Montanez does not suggest what testimony he could have offered to show that he had made full disclosure.   On the present facts, a conclusory statement by Montanez on his own behalf would never have been credited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez might have made a different but related claim on appeal, namely, that the district judge should have given him a second chance to make full disclosure after finding that his June 9 letter was inadequate.   But this claim would also be foreclosed by the failure to ask the district court for such an opportunity.   We add, by way of warning, that defendants who make partial disclosure as an opening bid are engaging in a risky gamble.   Here there was no serious effort at any disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> United States v.

With minor word changes, and not many of these, defense counsel's letter was drawn almost verbatim from an affidavit filed by one of the federal agents early in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a response, arguing inter alia that the letter was plainly insufficient and pointing to various pieces of information that Montanez had not disclosed such as how he obtained the heroin involved in several of the five transactions, where it was stored, and who was the supplier.   This information was not contained in the government affidavit or in Montanez' letter to the prosecutor.   Montanez made no reply to this filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on June 19, 1995, the district court ruled that it did not find that Montanez had truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence that he possessed.   The court said that it thought that Congress had intended the safety valve for defendants who tried to cooperate by being debriefed by the government. But, said the court, it would \"cheerfully\" have given Montanez the benefit of the safety valve if Montanez had just come into court \"and said everything he knew and persuaded me that was everything he knew....  But he hasn't.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence and Montanez now appeals.   He argues that no debriefing requirement exists and, in addition, that defense counsel's June 9 letter complied with the statutory requirement.   The government argues that a debriefing is required but, in the alternative, says that the district court properly found that Montanez had not made the required disclosure in any form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is easy to understand why the government wants the statute construed to impose a requirement that a defendant offer himself to the prosecutor for a debriefing.   If a defendant does have useful information, it can best be extracted and preserved in that setting.   And a debriefing also puts the government in the best position to decide whether it thinks that the defendant is telling everything he knows and, if it believes otherwise, to argue to the court that the safety valve provision should not be applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the issue before us is whether the statute requires the defendant to offer himself for debriefing as an automatic pre-condition in every case, and it is hard to locate such a requirement in the statute.   All that Congress said is that the defendant be found by the time of the sentencing to have \"truthfully provided to the Government\" all the information and evidence that he has.   Nothing in the statute, nor in any legislative history drawn to our attention, specifies the form or place or manner of the disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's best argument turns on the relationship of the safety valve statute to the preexisting provisions for a substantial assistance departure.   From the outset, a departure below the statutory minimum sentence has been allowed where the prosecutor moves the court for such a departure on the ground that the defendant has furnished substantial assistance to the government.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.   The decision to move, with few qualifications, is committed to the prosecutor's discretion.  Carey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692274\"><a href=\"/opinion/692274/martin-carey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span>, 1101 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Seventh Circuit compactly explained in a recent decision, Congress discovered that substantial assistance may commonly be available from highly culpable drug-ring organizers but often not from less culpable street dealers or \"mules\" who merely transport drugs.  United States v. Arrington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710295\"><a href=\"/opinion/710295/united-states-v-robert-arrington-jacqueline-k-burch-aka-jacqueline/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 147-48 (7th Cir.1996).   To cope with this situation, section 3553(f) was enacted in 1994.   It rewards low level offenders who meet the other conditions specified (e.g., non-violence, little criminal history) and who truthfully provide all of the information and evidence they have, even if it does not prove useful.  Id. at 147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez seeks to contrast the preexisting substantial assistance statute with the new safety valve statute, arguing that the former is concerned with cooperation, but the latter only with culpability.   While there are mechanical differences between the statutes, see United States v. Acosta-Olivas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709087\"><a href=\"/opinion/709087/united-states-v-jesus-acosta-olivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 379 (10th Cir.1995), both values were probably of concern to Congress in drafting section 3553(f).   In enacting the safety valve provision, we think Congress was aiming its leniency at low level defendants who did their best to cooperate to the extent of making full disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Such disclosure may prove to be of use even if it does not amount to \"substantial assistance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(f) could easily have required a debriefing;  certainly that would have provided a brighter line than merely to require that the defendant \"truthfully provide [his information and evidence]\" in some unspecified form.   But the fact remains that Congress wrote the statute as it did.   Courts can and do apply restrictive glosses on statutory language, but everything depends on the breadth of the linguistic leap and strength of the arguments for making it.   Here, we think that Congress' own formulation is adequate to achieve its ends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have thus far found it fairly easy to cull serious efforts at full disclosure from mere pretense.   This court in Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3, readily dismissed a defendant's claim that the necessary disclosure was achieved when the government covertly taped him in the course of the criminal venture;  and another circuit only recently rejected a claim that a defendant had made the necessary disclosure through a routine interview with his probation officer.  United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699565\"><a href=\"/opinion/699565/united-states-v-ernesto-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 196 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span> (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a practical matter, a defendant who declines to offer himself for a debriefing takes a very dangerous course.   It is up to the defendant to persuade the district court that he has \"truthfully provided\" the required information and evidence to the government.  United States v. Flanagan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715681\"><a href=\"/opinion/715681/united-states-v-george-woodrow-flanagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 145-47 (5th Cir.1996).   And a defendant who contents himself with a letter runs an obvious and profound risk:  The government is perfectly free to point out the suspicious omissions at sentencing, and the district court is entitled to make a common sense judgment, just as the district judge did in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, nothing prevents a district court from deciding that it is unpersuaded of full disclosure, cf. Rodriguez, 60 F.3d at 195, but might be if the defendant submitted himself to a debriefing.   Yet such a determination would rest in the hands of the judge, not the prosecutor.   The possibility remains, however rare, that a defendant could make a disclosure without a debriefing (e.g., by letter to the prosecutor) so truthful and so complete that no prosecutor could fairly suggest any gap or omission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To suggest this course as a possibility is not to encourage it.   A defendant whose only concern is to secure the benefit of the safety valve provision should be anxious for a debriefing.   It offers an occasion to persuade the government that the defendant has made full disclosure and thus to win its \"recommendation\" for avoiding the mandatory minimum.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 comment (n.8).   If the government still opposes the departure, the defendant can say to the judge that the government had a chance to ask everything it wanted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants often have reasons, such as loyalty to a confederate or fear of retribution, for not wanting to make full disclosure.   But full disclosure is the price that Congress has attached to relief under the statute, and the burden remains on the defendant to prove his entitlement.  Flanagan, 80 F.3d at 146-47.   Defendants will discover soon enough that there is little mileage in gambits designed to qualify the defendant for relief while avoiding full disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a good illustration of a bad gambit.   In theory full disclosure might exist where a defendant's letter recited back to the government, in virtually the government's own words, the information already possessed by the government and nothing more.   But in practice this is hardly likely, especially where several different drug transactions and multiple players are involved.   Here--merely to mention the most conspicuous omission--Montanez' letter does not disclose as to several of the transactions who provided him with the drugs he delivered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough that Montanez did not disclose information that he might reasonably be expected to possess, nor persuasively explain its absence.   See Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3.   The failure to disclose is so patent in this case that no reason exists for extended discussion.   Indeed, even on appeal Montanez offers no plausible reason why he could not have provided such information as the identity of each seller.   The district court did not \"clearly err\" in finding that the fifth requirement was unsatisfied.  Rodriguez, 69 F.3d at 144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez now argues that he ought to have been given an evidentiary hearing on the question whether he had made full disclosure.   But he did not request such a hearing in the district court and that largely disposes of his claim.  United States v. Gertner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703980\"><a href=\"/opinion/703980/united-states-v-nancy-gertner-etc-john-doe-intervenor/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 969 (1st Cir.1995).   Even on appeal Montanez does not suggest what testimony he could have offered to show that he had made full disclosure.   On the present facts, a conclusory statement by Montanez on his own behalf would never have been credited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montanez might have made a different but related claim on appeal, namely, that the district judge should have given him a second chance to make full disclosure after finding that his June 9 letter was inadequate.   But this claim would also be foreclosed by the failure to ask the district court for such an opportunity.   We add, by way of warning, that defendants who make partial disclosure as an opening bid are engaging in a risky gamble.   Here there was no serious effort at any disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> United States v.
