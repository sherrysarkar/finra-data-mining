Appellant Angel Rodriguez appeals from\r                                \r\n\nthe denial of his motion filed  under 28 U.S.C.   2255.   For\r\n\nthe following reasons, we agree with the district court  that\r\n\nthe motion was meritless.\r\n\n          1.   Appellant's claim  that the forfeiture  of his\r\n\nproperty  was excessive  under the  Eighth  Amendment is  not\r\n\ncognizable in a   2255 proceeding since  appellant seeks only\r\n\nrelief  from a  monetary-type penalty  and  not release  from\r\n\nconfinement.   See Smullen v.  United States, 94 F.3d  20, 25\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1996)  (holding that  a  claim that  defendant  is\r\n\nentitled to  a reduced  restitution order  falls outside  the\r\n\nscope of   2255).\r\n\n          2.    Appellant's   argument  that  the  forfeiture\r\n\nviolates the  prohibition against  double jeopardy  fails for\r\n\nthe simple reason that the forfeiture was imposed in the same\r                                                                         \r\n\nproceeding that resulted in appellant's  conviction.  Compare\r                                                                         \r\n\nDepartment  of Revenue  v.  Kurth Ranch,  511  U.S. 767,  784\r                                                   \r\n\n(1994) (the collection of a  tax on dangerous drugs sought in\r\n\na   separate  proceeding   initiated   subsequently  to   the\r                                                               \r\n\ntermination  of  the  proceeding  in  which  defendants  were\r\n\nconvicted violates the prohibition against double jeopardy; a\r\n\nsecond  punishment   \"must  be   imposed  during   the  first\r\n\nprosecution or not at all\").\r\n\n          3.    Appellant's  claims   regarding  the  alleged\r\n\nineffective assistance rendered by his trial counsel were not\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npresented  to the district  court in the    2255 motion.   We\r\n\ntherefore  will  not consider  them  for  the first  time  on\r\n\nappeal.   See Dziurgot  v. Luther, 897  F.2d 1222,  1224 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir. 1990)  (per curiam).   Appellant's ignorance of  the law\r\n\ndoes not provide  an excuse for this default.   See Eagle Eye\r                                                                         \r\n\nFishing Corp.  v.

In any event, appellant's failure to assert all\r\n\nbut one of  his claims in his first   2255 motion is an abuse\r\n\nof the  writ under  McCleskey v. Zant,  499 U.S.  467 (1991).\r                                                 \r\n\nAgain, appellant's  pro se status  and ignorance  of the  law\r\n\ndoes  not  constitute  \"cause\"   sufficient  to  excuse  this\r\n\nomission.   See, e.g., Saahir  v. Collins, 956 F.2d  115, 118\r                                                     \r\n\n(5th Cir.  1992) (ignorance  of the law  is not  an objective\r\n\nexternal  impediment); Rodriguez  v.  Maynard, 948  F.2d 684,\r                                                         \r\n\n687-88  (10th Cir. 1991)  (where the factual  and legal bases\r\n\nfor the new claims existed when the first habeas petition was\r\n\nfiled, petitioner's  ignorance of  the legal  significance of\r\n\nthose  claims does  not amount  to cause).   Nor,  obviously,\r\n\nwould failure to consider these  claims on appeal amount to a\r\n\nfundamental  miscarriage of justice.  See Andiarena v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 967 F.2d 715, 719  (1st Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (this\r                  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nnarrow   exception  applies   only  where   a  constitutional\r\n\nviolationlikely caused the conviction of an innocent person).\r\n\n          The one  claim that  appellant did  present in  the\r\n\nfirst    2255 motion  -- the government's  alleged sentencing\r\n\nentrapment and  counsel's alleged  ineffective assistance  in\r\n\nconnection  therewith -- cannot  be raised again  because the\r\n\ndistrict court disposed of it  on the merits in that  first  \r\n\n2255  proceeding.    See Rule  9(b)  of  the  Rules Governing\r                                    \r\n\nSection 2255 Cases (\"[a]  second or successive motion  may be\r\n\ndismissed if the judge finds that  it fails to allege new  or\r\n\ndifferent  grounds for relief and the prior determination was\r\n\non the merits\").\r\n\n          5.   It  follows that  the district  court did  not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in not holding a hearing  on appellant's\r\n\nforfeiture claims.  See United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223,\r                                                           \r\n\n225-26 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
