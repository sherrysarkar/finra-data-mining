Inserni, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\r\n   Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                           \r\n\n                       April 3, 1998\r\n\n                                             SELYA, Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Moises Velez\r\nCarrero comes before us for the second time.  See United States v.\r\nVelez Carrero, 77 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 1996) (Velez I).  On this\r\noccasion, he remarks the district court's refusal to set aside his\r\nguilty plea and invites us to reverse its order.  Because \"[h]aving\r\none's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit,\"\r\nUnited States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir. 1985), we\r\ndecline the invitation.\r\n                              I.\r\nA grand jury indicted the appellant in 1994 in connection\r\nwith a conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  He entered\r\ninto a plea agreement (the Agreement) whereby, in exchange for his\r\nadmission of guilt, the government promised, among other things, to\r\nrecommend that no upward adjustment be made to his base offense\r\nlevel (BOL) for his role in the criminal activity.  See USSG 3B1.1\r\n(authorizing upward adjustment of a defendant's BOL if the\r\ndefendant, in carrying out the offense of conviction, served as \"an\r\norganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\").  The government failed\r\nto keep its end of the bargain: rather than affirmatively\r\nsuggesting to the district court that no role-in-the-offense\r\nenhancement was warranted, the prosecutor simply took no position\r\nat the disposition hearing as to the appropriateness of such an\r\nadjustment.\r\nUnnerved by this fecklessness, the appellant asked us to\r\nreview the matter and requested that we vacate his 87-month\r\nsentence and order specific performance of the Agreement's terms. \r\nWe determined that the government had breached the Agreement,\r\ngranted the appellant the form of relief that he sought, and\r\nremanded for resentencing before a different judge.  See Velez I,\r\n77 F.3d at 12.\r\n                             II.\r\nOn remand, Judge Perez-Gimenez inherited the case and\r\nallowed the appellant's attorney to withdraw.  On two subsequent\r\noccasions, the judge appointed successor counsel, but each of those\r\ncounsel also moved to withdraw.  Eventually, the district court\r\nappointed yet a fourth lawyer to represent the appellant.  By then,\r\nthe appellant had begun to express an interest in changing his\r\nplea, and his newly designated attorney followed the appellant's\r\nlead.  He struck out in a new direction, moving to set aside the\r\nappellant's guilty plea on the ground that the plea itself had been\r\ntainted by the government's breach of the Agreement.\r\nThe district court wrote a thoughtful rescript denying\r\nthe motion.  See United States v. Velez Carrero, No. 94-199 (D.P.R.\r\nJan. 30, 1997) (Velez II).  After the appellant unsuccessfully\r\nmoved for reconsideration, the lower court sentenced the appellant\r\nto a 71-month incarcerative term   a sentence within the guideline\r\nsentencing range, unaugmented by any role-in-the-offense\r\nenhancement.  This appeal followed.\r\n                             III.\r\nWe review a district court's denial of a motion to\r\nwithdraw a guilty plea, made prior to sentencing, for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  We discern no abuse in this instance.\r\nJudge Perez-Gimenez set forth the correct legal regime\r\nfor determining whether to allow the withdrawal of a guilty plea,\r\nsee Velez II, slip op. at 3-4, and he meticulously appraised the\r\nappellant's case in light of those criteria, see id. at 4-7.  No\r\nuseful purpose would be served by repastinating that well-ploughed\r\nsoil.  After all, \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive,\r\nwell-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from\r\nwriting at length to no other end than to hear its own words\r\nresonate.\"  Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., 101\r\nF.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).  Hence, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's order for substantially the reasons set forth in its\r\nrescript, adding only four brief comments.\r\nFirst:  It is an indispensable prerequisite to a plea-\r\nwithdrawal motion, made before the imposition of sentence, that the\r\ndefendant proffer a fair and just reason for wishing to scrap his\r\nguilty plea.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e); see also United States v.\r\nDoyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 1992).  The record in this case\r\nindicates quite clearly that the prime motivation behind the\r\nappellant's request to withdraw his plea is that, in his words,\r\n\"the government broke its part of the bargain.\"  Appellant's Motion\r\nto Reconsider at 2.  But the appellant has received precisely the\r\nanodyne that he himself specified to mend that broken promise, and\r\nhe is not entitled to further relief in consequence of it.\r\nWhen the prosecution fails to adhere to the terms of a\r\nplea agreement, the aggrieved defendant is entitled to either\r\nspecific performance of the agreement or an opportunity to retract\r\nhis plea.  See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 263 (1971);\r\nVelez I, 77 F.3d at 12.  He is not entitled to both.  Here, Velez\r\nCarrero made an informed choice, requesting during his first appeal\r\nthat we order the government to fulfill its promise.   See Velez I,\r\n77 F.3d at 12.  We granted him the precise relief that he had\r\nrequested.  See id.  Having obtained his chosen remedy, the\r\nappellant's current reliance on the broken promise as a\r\njustification for retracting his guilty plea is an empty gesture. \r\nAccordingly, he has failed to proffer a fair and just reason that\r\nwould warrant setting aside his plea.\r\nSecond:  We also believe that the appellant's\r\nafterthought request for withdrawal of his plea is precluded by his\r\nprior (successful) appeal.  In Velez I, 77 F.3d at 12, we ordered\r\nthe appellant resentenced pursuant to the Agreement.  On remand,\r\nthe sentencing court was duty bound to follow our mandate.  SeeUnited States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 251 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n(explicating the mandate rule and describing it as \"a specific\r\napplication of the law of the case doctrine\"); United States v.\r\nRivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 150 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"When a case is\r\nappealed and remanded, the decision of the appellate court\r\nestablishes the law of the case and it must be followed by the\r\ntrial court on remand.\") (quoting 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas, &amp; T.\r\nCurrier, Moore's Federal Practice  0.404[1] (2d ed. 1991)).\r\nOf course, notwithstanding the mandate rule and the law\r\nof the case doctrine, an issue may be reopened for further\r\nconsideration if justice so requires.  See Bell, 988 F.2d at 251. \r\nBut this modicum of residual flexibility does not mean that\r\npreclusion can (or should) lightly be brushed aside.  See Rivera-\r\nMartinez, 931 F.2d at 151.  In this case, the appellant did not\r\ngive the district court any plausible reason for revisiting the\r\nVelez I resentencing determination, and he likewise offers none to\r\nus.  Indeed, he does not even suggest that circumstances have\r\nchanged in any material respect since the date we decided Velez I. \r\nCertainly, the mere fact that the appellant has a new lawyer who\r\nhas a somewhat different strategic vision is not, in itself, a\r\nmaterial change in circumstances.\r\n   Third:  Just as the companion doctrines of judicial\r\nestoppel and election of remedies preclude parties in civil\r\nlitigation from asserting legal or factual positions  inconsistent\r\nwith the positions that they took in prior proceedings, see, e.g.,\r\nGens v. Resolution Trust Corp., 112 F.3d 569, 572 (1st Cir.), cert.denied, 118 S. Ct. 335 (1997), so, too, a criminal defendant\r\nordinarily must raise claims in a timely fashion, consistent with\r\nhis prior positions in the case, or suffer the consequences.  See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 121 (1st Cir. 1987). \r\nDuring his first appeal, Velez Carrero successfully maintained that\r\nthe Agreement should be specifically enforced; now, he asserts that\r\nit should be annulled.  Such an arbitrary about-face cannot be\r\ncountenanced.\r\n   Plea agreements are construed in most respects according\r\nto principles of contract law, see United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d\r\n386, 388 (1st Cir. 1988), and that body of law includes the\r\nelection-of-remedies principle, see Jones v. Childers, 18 F.3d 899,\r\n915 (11th Cir. 1994).  In the realm of commercial contracts, \"[a]\r\nparty may not invoke (or at least may not be granted) a remedy\r\nbased upon affirmance of a contract . . . and also a remedy based\r\nupon disaffirmance, such as recission.\"  Continental Sand &amp; Gravel,\r\nInc. v. K &amp; K Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., 755 F.2d 87, 93 (7th Cir. 1985);\r\naccord Far West Fed. Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 119 F.3d\r\n1358, 1365 (9th Cir. 1994).  It follows that, absent a showing of\r\nspecial circumstances, a criminal defendant ought properly to be\r\nprecluded from pursuing a remedy which, in a previous iteration of\r\nthe case, he eschewed in favor of a different (and inconsistent)\r\nremedy.  See United States v. Thomas, 709 F.2d 968, 971 (5th Cir.\r\n1983).\r\n   Fourth:  The appellant's counsel, both in his appellate\r\nbrief and at oral argument, made glancing references to the\r\ndistrict court's order of November 29, 1996, in which the court\r\nrefused to direct the Bureau of Prisons and/or the Marshals Service\r\nto restore certain of the appellant's belongings to him.  This\r\npoint is procedurally defaulted twice over.\r\n   For one thing, there is no specific reference to the\r\nNovember 29 order in appellant's notice of appeal.  That omission,\r\nin itself, is fatal.  See Fed R. App. P. 3(c) (stating that the\r\nnotice of appeal must designate the challenged orders or\r\njudgments); see also Kotler v. American Tobacco Co., 981 F.2d 7, 11\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).  For another thing, the appellant's unhappiness\r\nwith the November 29 order is mentioned only in passing in his\r\nbrief, with no attempt at developed argumentation.  Accordingly, it\r\nis not properly before us.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d\r\n1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (memorializing \"the settled appellate rule\r\nthat issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\r\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").  In\r\nany event, the appellant has not shown, or even intimated, how that\r\norder prejudiced him in regard to the attempted withdrawal of his\r\nplea.  Thus, we need go no further.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

On this occasion, he remarks the district court's refusal to set aside his guilty plea and invites us to reverse its order.  Because \"[h]aving one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit,\" United States v. Tierney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451517\"><a href=\"/opinion/451517/united-states-v-robert-f-tierney/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.1985), we decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury indicted the appellant in 1994 in connection with a conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine.  He entered into a plea agreement (the Agreement) whereby, in exchange for his admission of guilt, the government promised, among other things, to recommend that no upward adjustment be made to his base offense level (BOL) for his role in the criminal activity.  See USSG &#167; 3B1.1 (authorizing upward adjustment of a defendant's BOL if the defendant, in carrying out the offense of conviction, served as \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\").  The government failed to keep its end of the bargain:  rather than affirmatively suggesting to the district court that no role-in-the-offense enhancement was warranted, the prosecutor simply took no position at the disposition hearing as to the appropriateness of such an adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unnerved by this fecklessness, the appellant asked us to review the matter and requested that we vacate his 87-month sentence and order specific performance of the Agreement's terms.  We determined that the government had breached the Agreement, granted the appellant the form of relief that he sought, and remanded for resentencing before a different judge.  See Velez I, 77 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, Judge Perez-Gimenez inherited the case and allowed the appellant's attorney to withdraw.  On two subsequent occasions, the judge appointed successor counsel, but each of those counsel also moved to withdraw.  Eventually, the district court appointed yet a fourth lawyer to represent the appellant.  By then, the appellant had begun to express an interest in changing his plea, and his newly designated attorney followed the appellant's lead.  He struck out in a new direction, moving to set aside the appellant's guilty plea on the ground that the plea itself had been tainted by the government's breach of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court wrote a thoughtful rescript denying the motion.  See United States v. Velez Carrero, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span> (D.P.R.1997) (Velez II ).   After the appellant unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration, the lower court sentenced the appellant to a 71-month incarcerative term--a sentence within the guideline sentencing range, unaugmented by any role-in-the-offense enhancement.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, made prior to sentencing, for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 371 (1st Cir.1994).  We discern no abuse in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Perez-Gimenez set forth the correct legal regime for determining whether to allow the withdrawal of a guilty plea, see Velez II, at 29, and he meticulously appraised the appellant's case in light of those criteria, see id. at 30-31.   No useful purpose would be served by repastinating that well-ploughed soil.  After all, \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"  Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197113\"><a href=\"/opinion/197113/lawton-v-state-mutual/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1996).  Hence, we affirm the district court's order for substantially the reasons set forth in its rescript, adding only four brief comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  It is an indispensable prerequisite to a plea-withdrawal motion, made before the imposition of sentence, that the defendant proffer a fair and just reason for wishing to scrap his guilty plea.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e);  see also United States v. Doyle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596485\"><a href=\"/opinion/596485/united-states-v-clifford-a-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 594 (1st Cir.1992).  The record in this case indicates quite clearly that the prime motivation behind the appellant's request to withdraw his plea is that, in his words, \"the government broke its part of the bargain.\"   Appellant's Motion to Reconsider at 2. But the appellant has received precisely the anodyne that he himself specified to mend that broken promise, and he is not entitled to further relief in consequence of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the prosecution fails to adhere to the terms of a plea agreement, the aggrieved defendant is entitled to either specific performance of the agreement or an opportunity to retract his plea.  See Santobello v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 499, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span> (1971);  Velez I, 77 F.3d at 12.   He is not entitled to both.  Here, Velez Carrero made an informed choice, requesting during his first appeal that we order the government to fulfill its promise.  See Velez I, 77 F.3d at 12.   We granted him the precise relief that he had requested.  See id.   Having obtained his chosen remedy, the appellant's current reliance on the broken promise as a justification for retracting his guilty plea is an empty gesture.  Accordingly, he has failed to proffer a fair and just reason that would warrant setting aside his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  We also believe that the appellant's afterthought request for withdrawal of his plea is precluded by his prior (successful) appeal.  In Velez I, 77 F.3d at 12, we ordered the appellant resentenced pursuant to the Agreement.  On remand, the sentencing court was duty bound to follow our mandate.  See United States v. Bell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602344\"><a href=\"/opinion/602344/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 251 (1st Cir.1993) (explicating the mandate rule and describing it as \"a specific application of the law of the case doctrine\");  United States v. Rivera-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559873\"><a href=\"/opinion/559873/united-states-v-hector-rivera-martinez-aka-el-men/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 150 (1st Cir.1991) (\"When a case is appealed and remanded, the decision of the appellate court establishes the law of the case and it must be followed by the trial court on remand.\")  (quoting 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas, &amp; T. Currier, Moore's Federal Practice p 0.404 (2d ed.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, notwithstanding the mandate rule and the law of the case doctrine, an issue may be reopened for further consideration if justice so requires.  See Bell, 988 F.2d at 251.   But this modicum of residual flexibility does not mean that preclusion can (or should) lightly be brushed aside.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 151.   In this case, the appellant did not give the district court any plausible reason for revisiting the Velez I resentencing determination, and he likewise offers none to us.  Indeed, he does not even suggest that circumstances have changed in any material respect since the date we decided Velez I. Certainly, the mere fact that the appellant has a new lawyer who has a somewhat different strategic vision is not, in itself, a material change in circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  Just as the companion doctrines of judicial estoppel and election of remedies preclude parties in civil litigation from asserting legal or factual positions inconsistent with the positions that they took in prior proceedings, see, e.g., Gens v. Resolution Trust Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197343\"><a href=\"/opinion/197343/gens-v-resolution/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span> (1997), so, too, a criminal defendant ordinarily must raise claims in a timely fashion, consistent with his prior positions in the case, or suffer the consequences.  See, e.g., United States v. Coady, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 121 (1st Cir.1987).  During his first appeal, Velez Carrero successfully maintained that the Agreement should be specifically enforced;  now, he asserts that it should be annulled.  Such an arbitrary about-face cannot be countenanced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plea agreements are construed in most respects according to principles of contract law, see United States v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515175\"><a href=\"/opinion/515175/united-states-v-mark-hogan-and-patricia-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.1988), and that body of law includes the election-of-remedies principle, see Jones v. Childers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664757\"><a href=\"/opinion/664757/gordon-jones-and-laura-jones-v-john-h-childers-and-talent-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span>, 915 (11th Cir.1994).  In the realm of commercial contracts, \"[a] party may not invoke (or at least may not be granted) a remedy based upon affirmance of a contract ... and also a remedy based upon disaffirmance, such as recission.\"  Continental Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. K &amp; K Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448027\"><a href=\"/opinion/448027/continental-sand-gravel-inc-an-illinois-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 93 (7th Cir.1985);  accord Far West Fed.  Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744182\"><a href=\"/opinion/744182/97-cal-daily-op-serv-5457-97-daily-journal-dar-8851-far-west-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span>, 1365 (9th Cir.1997).  It follows that, absent a showing of special circumstances, a criminal defendant ought properly to be precluded from pursuing a remedy which, in a previous iteration of the case, he eschewed in favor of a different (and inconsistent) remedy.  See United States v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419948\"><a href=\"/opinion/419948/united-states-v-john-h-thomas-lonnie-d-clark-and-john-h-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">968</span></a></span>, 971 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  The appellant's counsel, both in his appellate brief and at oral argument, made glancing references to the district court's order of November 29, 1996, in which the court refused to direct the Bureau of Prisons and/or the Marshals Service to restore certain of the appellant's belongings to him.
