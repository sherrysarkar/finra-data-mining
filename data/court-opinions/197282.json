Even assuming  appellant Debra  L.\r                                 \r\n\nMorgan held a property interest in her position of employment\r\n\nwith the Boston Redevelopment  Authority, a careful review of\r\n\nthe  record and  the parties' briefs  on appeal  satisfies us\r\n\nthat the district court correctly ruled that Morgan failed to\r\n\ndemonstrate a trialworthy issue  as to whether the defendants\r\n\nacted  arbitrarily  and   capriciously  in  terminating   her\r\n\nemployment.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt in  this regard for  essentially the reasons  stated in\r\n\nits Memorandum and Order, dated May 22, 1996.\r\n\n          Affirmed.
