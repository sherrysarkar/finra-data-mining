This is an  action on a promissory note by\r                            \r\n\nCME Associates against the Fords, two of whom were co-signers\r\n\nof  the note.   The  district court  granted partial  summary\r\n\njudgment  in favor  of  CME, establishing  the senior  Fords'\r\n\nliability on the note.  A number of other issues remain to be\r\n\nresolved, but the court  entered a separate judgment pursuant\r\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\r\n\n     The  Fords' primary defense  to the note  was an alleged\r\n\noral  modification  of the  terms of  the  note by  the prior\r\n\nholder, the FDIC.   The district court rejected  this defense\r\n\non the ground that the note's current owner, CME, is a holder\r\n\nin  due course  protected by  Massachusetts law  against such\r\n\nmodifications absent notice.   See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  106,\r                                              \r\n\n  3-305(2)(e).   We are satisfied from a review of the record\r\n\nthat  CME did not have notice and that there was insufficient\r\n\nevidence to the contrary to warrant a trial on this question.\r\n\n     The  Fords also  argued that  CME's foreclosure  sale of\r\n\nreal  property   securing  the   note  was  conducted   in  a\r\n\ncommercially  unreasonable fashion.   E.g.,  RTC v.  Carr, 13\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 425 (1st Cir. 1993).  In effect, the Fords said that the\r\n\nsale  was  conducted  in  a  negligent  manner.    But  their\r\n\naffidavit to this effect did not even purport to show that it\r\n\nwas made by someone  with knowledge of the facts  as required\r\n\nby Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).     The  Fords  say that  more time\r\n\nshould have been allowed for discovery concerning the conduct\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nof the sale, but this is a matter largely  within the purview\r\n\nof  the district court,  Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1996), and we perceive no abuse\r               \r\n\nof discretion.   Moreover, the record  does not reflect  that\r\n\nthe  Fords made  anything  approaching  an  adequate  showing\r\n\nbefore  the  district  court  to justify  invocation  of  the\r\n\n\"escape hatch\" under  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).  Paterson-Leitch\r                                                                         \r\n\nCompany,  Inc. v. Massachusetts  Municipal Wholesale Electric\r                                                                         \r\n\nCompany, 840 F.2d 985, 988-989 (1st Cir. 1988).\r                   \r\n\n     No other issues argued by the Fords in this case require\r\n\nfurther comment.   It would be helpful in the  future for the\r\n\ndistrict  court to  be  more explicit  in  setting forth  its\r\n\nexpress determination that there is no just reason for  delay\r\n\nas required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n",
