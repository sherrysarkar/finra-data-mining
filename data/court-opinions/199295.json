This case arises out of the\n\nfailure and chapter 7 bankruptcy of Healthco International, Inc.\n\n(\"Healthco\"), a major global distributor of dental products and\n\nservices.    Following this debacle, the chapter 7 trustee brought\n\nthe   present   case   on   behalf   of    the   estate   against   numerous\n\nparties alleged to have been responsible for, or beneficiaries\n\nof, the leveraged buyout that precipitated the collapse of\n\nHealthco.    We begin with a short history of the transactions and\n\nproceedings, and then address the claims on appeal made by the\n\nbankruptcy trustee, William Brandt.1\n\n                        I. Factual Background\n\n            In the late spring of 1990, Gemini Partners,             L.P., a\n\nDelaware limited partnership that owned 9.96% of Healthco's\n\ncommon shares, formed the Committee for Maximizing Shareholder\n\nValue of Healthco International (\"the Committee\") and began a\n\n\n      1\n      Aspects of Healthco's bankruptcy are addressed in Hicks,\nMuse & Co. v. Brandt (In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 136 F.3d 45\n(1st Cir. 1998); Brandt v. Repco Printers & Lithographics, Inc.\n(In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 132 F.3d 104 (1st Cir. 1997);\nBrandt v. Hicks, Muse & Co., 213 B.R. 784 (D. Mass. 1997);\nBrandt v. Hicks, Muse & Co. (In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 208\nB.R. 288 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997); Brandt v. Hicks, Muse & Co.

(In\nre Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 195 B.R. 971 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1996);\nIn re Healthco Int'l, Inc., 174 B.R. 174 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1994).\nTwo opinions in this group, Brandt, 213 B.R. 784, and Brandt,\n208 B.R. 288, provide more detailed accounts of the leveraged\nbuyout than our own summary.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fproxy contest to remove Healthco's incumbent directors.                      In\n\nresponse,    Healthco   engaged     Lazard   Frères   &   Co.   LLC    as   its\n\nfinancial advisor and sought to arrange the company's sale to\n\nanother buyer.\n\n            On September 4, 1990, Healthco entered into a merger\n\nagreement with affiliates of Hicks, Muse & Co. (\"Hicks, Muse\"),\n\na Dallas-based investment firm.           Under the agreement, a company\n\nformed by Hicks, Muse would merge with Healthco after acquiring\n\nits stock at a price of $19.25 per share.             After reaching this\n\nagreement,    in    mid-September    Healthco    negotiated     a     separate\n\nsettlement agreement with Gemini and the Committee, under which\n\nthree Committee nominees became members of Healthco's seven-\n\nmember board.       The settlement agreement provided that, if the\n\nmerger agreement was terminated or sufficient progress toward a\n\nsale of the company was not subsequently made, the Committee\n\ncould increase its share of the board from three out of seven to\n\nfive out of nine.      As a further spur to a merger or sale, Gemini\n\npromised     each    Committee    director     $24,000,    less       director\n\ncompensation, if Gemini sold its shares at a profit.\n\n            In February 1991, Hicks, Muse's initial plan for a\n\nleveraged buyout2 (\"LBO\") of Healthco fell apart after Healthco's\n\n\n     2\n     A leveraged buyout is a transaction to acquire a\ncorporation\n\"in which a substantial portion of the purchase price paid for\n\n                                    -5-\n\fannual physical inventory indicated that the company's unaudited\n\n1990 earnings were several million dollars lower than expected.\n\nHealthco's auditors, Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., later certified\n\nfinancial statements that revealed a 1990 net loss of just over\n\n$5 million and 1990 earnings of less than $22 million.                        Given\n\nsuch figures, Hicks, Muse determined the $19.25 share price was\n\ntoo high, and the parties set to work drawing up a new plan.\n\n           On   March   26,   1991,    Healthco's       board    voted       5-2   to\n\napprove a new merger plan involving Hicks, Muse affiliates.\n\nMarvin   Cyker,    Healthco's    chief      executive    officer       and    board\n\nchairman, who held stock options but no outstanding shares in\n\nHealthco, was one of the two board members who voted against the\n\ntransaction.      The proposal was for a tender offer for Healthco\n\nstock at $15 per share to be made under Hicks, Muse's auspices,\n\nwith financing by other parties, after which Healthco would\n\nmerge with a new entity controlled by the new investors.                     Lazard\n\nFrères   advised    that   the   transaction      was     fair    to     Healthco\n\nstockholders.\n\n\n\nthe stock of a target corporation is borrowed and where the loan\nis secured by the target corporation's assets.\" Mellon Bank,\nN.A. v. Metro Communications, Inc., 945 F.2d 635, 645 (3d Cir.\n1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 937 (1992); 3 Norton Bankruptcy\nLaw and Practice 2d § 58A:1, at 58A-2 to 58A-3 (William L.\nNorton, Jr., ed., 1997). See generally Day, Walls & Dolak,\nRiding the Rapids: Financing the Leveraged Transaction Without\nGetting Wet, 41 Syracuse L. Rev. 661 (1990).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            On April 2, a tender offer for Healthco stock was made\n\nby HMD Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Healthco\n\nHolding Co.; Healthco Holding was itself a company set up by\n\nHicks, Muse to be the recipient of $55 million of the Hicks,\n\nMuse investors' funds.       Additional funds for the merger were to\n\nbe supplied by a bank group that would provide a $50 million\n\ntender   facility   (i.e.,     an   available   loan)   in   exchange   for\n\nperfected first priority liens on HMD Acquisition's shares in\n\nHealthco. Another group of investment entities were to provide\n\n$45 million in cash, in exchange for subordinated debt.\n\n            The tender offer was successful.            HMD Acquisition\n\nacquired more than 90% of Healthco's stock in the tender offer.\n\nAmong the stockholders who tendered shares or options in the\n\nmerger were Marvin Cyker, who received over $1 million for his\n\nstock options, and J.P. Morgan & Co., an investment firm that\n\nhad held 17.3% of Healthco's shares (13.0% on a fully diluted\n\nbasis,   i.e.,   after   the    exercise   of   options)     as   a   record\n\nshareholder for its clients.\n\n            The buyout of Healthco was completed on May 22, 1991,\n\nthrough a short-form, cash-out merger, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, §\n\n253 (1999), in which HMD Acquisition Corp. was merged into\n\nHealthco.    Healthco's remaining original stockholders received\n\n$15 per share in exchange for their holdings.            The Hicks, Muse\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\finvestors, by contrast, were now largely dependent on Healthco's\n\nfate.     As a result of the merger, Healthco, the surviving\n\ncompany, inherited all of HMD Acquisition's debts--namely, the\n\nmultimillion-dollar debts owed to non-equity investors (e.g.,\n\nthe banks) who helped to finance the Healthco buyout.\n\n           After    the   merger,    Healthco's    financial    situation\n\nsteadily deteriorated.      (It is unclear to what extent this was\n\ndue to pre-existing problems and to what extent the situation\n\nwas aggravated by new debt.)         In the spring of 1992, Healthco\n\nwas placed on credit hold by a large European supplier, and by\n\nJune 1992 more than forty of Healthco's suppliers were refusing\n\nto ship it goods until they were paid for past receivables.\n\nAfter defaulting on several loan covenants, Healthco faced an\n\nincreasingly hostile relationship with the bank group that had\n\nfinanced the tender facility for the buyout.\n\n           On June 9, 1993, Healthco filed a petition for chapter\n\n11 bankruptcy in the federal bankruptcy court in Massachusetts,\n\n11 U.S.C. § 301 (1994).         That September, after declining to\n\napprove   a   new   borrowing   arrangement,      the   bankruptcy   court\n\ngranted    Healthco's     motion    for   conversion      to   chapter   7\n\nbankruptcy.    Id. § 1112(a).       The buyout of Healthco, which had\n\npossessed assets of greater than $300 million at the time of the\n\nmerger, had ended in a liquidation proceeding that yielded less\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthan $60 million, far less than what was needed to pay off\n\nHealthco's creditors.\n\n           On    June    8,    1995,   Brandt,    as   Healthco's    chapter    7\n\ntrustee,        began    the    present   adversary      proceeding    in     the\n\nbankruptcy court, implicating almost all of those involved in\n\nthe   merger    transaction      and   ultimately      claiming    around   $300\n\nmillion in damages.           Brandt's 22-count complaint made 12 claims\n\nfor fraudulent transfers (counts I-XII).3                Brandt also alleged\n\nfour counts of breach of fiduciary duty, or of aiding and\n\nabetting the same (counts XIII-XVI).4              Finally, Brandt charged\n\nCoopers & Lybrand with accounting malpractice; accused Lazard\n\nand   Valuation    Research      Corporation,     a    financial    advisor    of\n\nHicks, Muse, of negligence; claimed that all the tendering\n\nshareholders      were   unjustly      enriched    and   benefitted    from     a\n\ncommercially unreasonable distribution; and alleged that the\n\n\n      3\n     Those accused of benefitting from fraudulent transfers\nincluded (1) Hicks, Muse, the primary orchestrator of the\nleveraged buyout; (2) the bank group and subordinated\ndebtholders who helped finance the buyout; (3) various other\nHealthco stockholders, whose tendering of shares allowed the\nbuyout to proceed; (4) and various professionals who were paid\nfor their roles in bringing about the buyout.\n      4\n     The primary targets of these counts were the directors of\nHealthco and HMD Acquisition, as well as Healthco's controlling\nshareholders. Their alleged aiders and abettors included Hicks,\nMuse, Healthco Holding Co., the bank group, Healthco directors\nwho voted for the buyout, Valuation Research which had endorsed\nthe feasibility of the original $19 buyout plan, and Lazard\nwhich had endorsed the fairness of the $15 plan.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fbank group was liable because of the commercially unreasonable\n\nway in which it liquidated its collateral (counts XVII-XXII).\n\n           Proceedings in the bankruptcy court were extensive\n\nduring the balance of 1995 and throughout 1996.   In addition to\n\ndiscovery (and discovery disputes), there were several amended\n\ncomplaints by Brandt, dismissal or summary judgment grants in\n\nfavor of various defendants on specific claims, and efforts\n\n(generally unsuccessful) by Brandt to get interlocutory review\n\non various rulings in the district court.     Although it became\n\nclear in 1996 that a jury trial would likely be required in the\n\ndistrict court on certain claims, the bankruptcy judge continued\n\nto oversee the matter.\n\n           In early 1997, the district court began to move the\n\nremaining claims toward trial.   Brandt then reached a settlement\n\nwith the bank group defendants and later filed a fourth amended\n\ncomplaint streamlining various of the claims that remained.\n\nShortly before trial, Brandt settled his claim with Coopers &\n\nLybrand.   Except for claims against Lazard, (where jury trial\n\nhad been waived) the remaining claims were tried to a jury in a\n\n27-day trial from April 23 until June 6, 1997.    Brandt lost on\n\nevery claim tried to the jury, and the district court found in\n\nfavor of Lazard.\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f           Brandt now appeals on numerous issues.        Importantly,\n\nthese include the dismissal by the bankruptcy court of key\n\nfraudulent transfer claims, its grant of summary judgment for\n\nvarious defendants as to the unjust enrichment claims against\n\nthem, the district court's disposition of certain fiduciary duty\n\nclaims, and miscellaneous claims relating to discovery and the\n\nconduct of the trial.      The details, and certain concerns about\n\nour jurisdiction, are discussed in connection with each set of\n\nclaims.\n\n               II. Fraudulent Transfer Dismissals\n\n           We start with Brandt's effort to revive the fraudulent\n\ntransfer   claims   that   the   bankruptcy   judge   dismissed.   In\n\nessence, Brandt's theory of fraudulent transfer is that because\n\nHealthco's assumption of HMD Acquisition's liabilities meant\n\nthat Healthco's assets became collateral for the debt that\n\nfinanced the buyout, both the tendering shareholders and the\n\nfinanciers obtained proceeds from a \"fraudulent\" transaction\n\nthat deprived Healthco's pre-existing unsecured creditors of\n\nmost of the value of the company's assets.\n\n           The bankruptcy court refused to see the transaction as\n\na stripping of Healthco assets.          Rejecting Brandt's call to\n\n\"collapse\" the multi-step buyout into a transfer of Healthco's\n\nassets to shareholders and buyout financiers, the bankruptcy\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcourt   repeatedly   held   that   \"funds   transferred   by   [HMD]\n\nAcquisition prior to the effectiveness of the merger [were] not\n\ntransfers by [Healthco] and hence are immune from fraudulent\n\ntransfer attack.\"    Brandt, 201 B.R. at 21.    It is this refusal\n\nto \"collapse\" the leveraged buyout, and hence treat the payments\n\nin question as ones made in substance (although not in form) out\n\nof Healthco's assets, which is the focus of Brandt's challenge\n\non appeal.\n\n          Whether the transaction should have been \"collapsed\"\n\nappears to be a difficult issue of state law (the parties do not\n\nagree on which state or states supply the law) on which there is\n\nfairly limited precedent.5 Of course, there are similar problems\n\n\n    5See, e.g., Kupetz v. Wolf, 845 F.2d 842, 847-48, 850 (9th\nCir. 1988) (respecting \"the formal structure of [the] LBO,\" and\ndeclining to apply a theory of constructive fraud); United\nStates v. Tabor Court Realty Corp., 803 F.2d 1288, 1297 (3d Cir.\n1986) (applying Pennsylvania's fraudulent conveyance statute to\nleveraged buyouts), cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1005 (1987); MFS/Sun\nLife Trust-High Yield Series v. Van Dusen Airport Servs. Co.,\n910 F. Supp. 913, 933-34 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (finding collapsing an\nLBO appropriate where \"all parties to each subsidiary transfer\nwere aware of the overall leveraged buyout\"); Wieboldt Stores,\nInc. v. Schottenstein, 94 B.R. 488, 501-03 (N.D. Ill. 1988)\n(collapsing   an   LBO  with   respect   to   \"the   controlling\nshareholders, the LBO lenders, and the insider shareholders,\"\nbut not with respect to shareholders who were only aware of the\ntender offer made to them); Murphy v. Meritor Sav. Bank (In re\nO'Day Corp.), 126 B.R. 370, 394 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991)\n(collapsing an LBO where \"all parties . . . were aware of the\nstructure of the transaction and participated in implementing\nit\"); In re Revco D.S., Inc., 118 B.R. 468, 517-18 (Bankr. N.D.\nOhio 1990) (noting the competition between more traditional\n\"anti-collapse\" and more modern \"pro-collapse\" perspectives).\n\n                               -12-\n\fin other areas (e.g., tax law, see True v. United States, 190\n\nF.3d 1165, 1176-77 (10th Cir. 1999)), and there are countless\n\ndifficult      arguments   in    policy    presented      by    the    request   to\n\ncollapse the buyout.         Indeed, the bankruptcy court itself, in\n\ndealing with directors' obligations of loyalty, recognized that\n\nHealthco's assets were security for the transaction's financing\n\nand described as \"myopic\" the defendants' argument that the\n\nbuyout transaction should be analyzed only in terms of its\n\nseparate parts.      Brandt, 208 B.R. at 302.\n\n            We conclude, however, that the issue is not properly\n\nbefore    us    because    our   authority      is    limited    to    review    of\n\njudgments by the district court and Brandt never secured a\n\ndistrict court judgment resolving any of the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaims.     Abbreviating the history, the story begins with the\n\nbankruptcy court's orders of October 27, 1995, granting motions\n\nto dismiss on the basis of a bench ruling from the prior day.\n\nThe   dismissals    were    of   fraudulent      transfer       claims      against\n\nvarious    defendants      who   were     for   the     most    part    tendering\n\nshareholders in the multi-step buyout:                 J.P. Morgan & Co., the\n\nAirlie    Group   defendants     (a   limited        partnership      and   several\n\nindividuals who owned approximately 10% of Healthco's stock), J.\n\nRobert Casey, and Helen and Marvin Cyker.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            On November 6, 1995, Brandt sought leave to appeal\n\nthese dismissals as interlocutory orders, 28 U.S.C. § 158(a);\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 8003.         On June 27, 1996, the district court\n\ndenied this motion.       Brandt then asked the bankruptcy court to\n\ncertify the dismissals for an appeal under Federal Rule of\n\nBankruptcy Procedure 7054(a), the bankruptcy counterpart of\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), but the bankruptcy court\n\ndenied this motion.        Later the bankruptcy court issued orders\n\ndismissing further claims of fraudulent transfers to Healthco\n\nshareholders, subordinated preferred shareholders, and others.\n\nAgain Brandt did not secure review by the district court.\n\n            At this stage, the bankruptcy court's orders were\n\ndismissals of claims on the merits but were not final (and\n\ntherefore not immediately appealable as of right).            28 U.S.C. §\n\n158(a).     The bankruptcy court has authority to deny on the\n\nmerits    claims   that   are   within   its   core   authority,   and   one\n\nproceeding so listed is the voiding of fraudulent conveyances.\n\nId. § 157(b)(2)(H).       Even if for some reason the claims at issue\n\nare not within this rubric (the parties have not briefed the\n\nissue and we do not decide it), Brandt did not contest the\n\nbankruptcy court's power to dismiss on the merits, so there was\n\nalso jurisdiction by consent.        See In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d\n\n1467, 1476-77 (1st Cir. 1991).             See generally 28 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f157(c)(2); Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S.\n\n833, 848-50 (1986).\n\n            The finality issue is complicated.            Although a \"final\n\njudgment\"    rule   of   some    kind     applies   to   appeals   from   the\n\nbankruptcy court to the district court (with exceptions for\n\ncertification and leave of the court), the concept of finality\n\nis more flexibly applied than with regard to district court\n\njudgments, In re American Colonial Broad. Corp., 758 F.2d 794,\n\n801 (1st Cir. 1985); this approach recognizes that complex\n\nbankruptcies are often an umbrella for a multitude of claims\n\nbetween different parties and, thus, that the strict requirement\n\nof final judgment used in district court appeals--the resolution\n\nof all claims as between all parties--could delay for years\n\ndistrict court review of matters that are essentially final as\n\nbetween the parties concerned in a bankruptcy.\n\n            The difficulty is that despite some agreement as to\n\nwhich actions are final or not final, no uniform and well-\n\ndeveloped set of rules exists and on many points there is a good\n\ndeal   of   uncertainty.        See   1   Collier   on   Bankruptcy   §   5.07\n\n(Lawrence P. King ed., 15th ed. 2000); cf. In re Public Serv.\n\nCo. of N.H., 898 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting \"strong\n\nanalogies\" between adversary proceedings and ordinary district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fcourt cases, and suggesting that a bankruptcy court's partial\n\nsummary judgment order was not final).\n\n            In this case, it appears that most defendants who had\n\nfraudulent transfer claims dismissed by the bankruptcy judge\n\nstill had other limited claims ( e.g., unjust enrichment) pending\n\nagainst them (subordinated debtholders who helped finance the\n\nbuyout     possibly   being       the    only    significant    exceptions).\n\nFurthermore, all the dismissed claims were substantially related\n\nto those that remained before the lower courts.                Indeed, it is\n\nseemingly    for   these     reasons     that   the   bankruptcy   court   and\n\ndistrict court resisted interlocutory review or certification.\n\nBrandt himself thought the dismissals were interlocutory at the\n\ntime the orders were entered, and no one has disputed that view.\n\nWe thus proceed on that premise, without any further effort to\n\ndevelop clear-cut rules in this difficult area.\n\n            Eventually, the district court withdrew its reference\n\nto the bankruptcy court as to various components of the case so\n\nthat it could dispose of a number of claims that required a jury\n\ntrial    (together    with    a   parallel      jury-waived    claim   against\n\nLazard).     Possibly at this time Brandt could have taken the\n\nposition that the transfer of other claims as to the defendants\n\nin question rendered final the earlier orders dismissing the\n\nfraudulent transfer claims.             In that event, Brandt would have\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fhad ten days following the termination of the reference to file\n\nan appeal in the district court challenging the dismissals.   See\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a).       However, Brandt did not follow\n\nthis course, nor did he alert the district court, as the court\n\nproceeded to try the remaining claims, that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's dismissal of the fraudulent transfer claims remained\n\nopen to challenge in the district court.   If the district court\n\nhad been so alerted, it is unlikely that it would have ignored\n\nthe matter; and regardless of whether the district court upheld\n\nthe bankruptcy judge or reversed him and tried these claims\n\nalong with the others, there would have been a resolution of the\n\nfraudulent transfer claims by the district court that could now\n\nbe brought before us.\n\n            Following the trial, Brandt filed new trial motions\n\ndirected to the claims that had been resolved by the district\n\ncourt but again made no mention of the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaims.     Instead, after the motions were denied, Brandt filed\n\nhis appeal from the district court's judgment and then proceeded\n\nin this court to brief the dismissal of the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaims as if they were encompassed by the district court's\n\njudgment.     But, of course, the district court's judgment only\n\nresolved the claims that had been presented to the district\n\ncourt and decided by the judge or the jury.\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f           After various defendants objected to consideration of\n\nthe fraudulent transfer claims on appeal, Brandt filed a reply\n\nbrief urging that \"the entry of final judgment in the District\n\nCourt    calls       up   for     appellate        review     by    this    Court     all\n\ninterlocutory orders of which the Trustee is aggrieved, whether\n\nentered by the District Court or by the Bankruptcy Court, and\n\nthis Court therefore has jurisdiction over all aspects of this\n\nappeal.\"     Brandt also points to his earlier efforts to appeal\n\nthe dismissals as interlocutory orders and pokes fun at the\n\nnotion that there should now be an appeal of those dismissals to\n\nthe district court with appeals proceeding simultaneously before\n\nthe district court (on the fraudulent transfer claims) and\n\nbefore   this    court      (on      the    claims    already      resolved      in   the\n\ndistrict court).          None of these arguments works.\n\n           True, where the district court has made interlocutory\n\ndecisions before entering a final judgment, an appeal from the\n\nfinal judgment brings up the interlocutory decisions for review\n\nby this court.        John's Insulation, Inc. v. L. Addison & Assocs.,\n\nInc., 156 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir. 1998).                    The difficulty is that\n\nthis logic works only with respect to the interlocutory orders\n\nof the district court; the bankruptcy court, although a unit of\n\nthe   district       court,     is   a     distinct    entity      whose    orders    are\n\nappealable      to    the   district        court     under   a    set     of   detailed\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\frestrictions and time limits.           If proper and timely review is\n\nnot sought in the district court, the matter never reaches that\n\ncourt and a fortiori does not reach this court.\n\n          One could argue that the dismissal orders in question\n\nbecame   final    only    when   the    district     court   dismissed     the\n\nremaining claims against the same defendants following trial.\n\nIf so, Brandt might then have appealed the dismissal orders to\n\nthe district court, obtained a ruling and (assuming affirmance)\n\nsought to consolidate an appeal from this judgment with its\n\nprevious appeal from the judgment on issues actually tried to\n\nthe district court.       However, Brandt did not follow this course\n\neither and cannot do so now because the time limit on an appeal\n\nto the district court expired before Brandt filed his appeal in\n\nthis court.6     The failure of Brandt's case on this ground also\n\nspares us from considering various so-called \"waiver\" arguments\n\nthat some of the defendants pressed based on Brandt's failure to\n\nact earlier to raise the dismissed claims in the district court.\n\n          From    an     equitable     standpoint,    one    may   feel   some\n\nsympathy for Brandt, who was faced with poorly developed rules\n\n\n    6Fed. R. Bankr. 8002(a). This discrepancy in timing also\nforecloses any option we otherwise might have had to treat the\nappeal to us as an appeal of the bankruptcy court orders filed\nin the wrong court and to transfer the appeal to the district\ncourt based on the transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1631. Notably,\nBrandt has neither cited the transfer statute nor made any such\ntransfer request.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fon finality and who made early efforts to seek district court\n\nreview of the dismissals; it is much less easy to excuse the\n\napparent failure of Brandt to call vividly to the district\n\ncourt's attention the fact that, while that court was proceeding\n\nto try a set of claims properly before it, Brandt still desired\n\nto press other claims that the bankruptcy court had dismissed\n\nand which would almost certainly have been tried at the same\n\ntime if the district court had overturned the bankruptcy court's\n\ndismissals.\n\n            However, our inability to address the merits does not\n\nrest on an equitable objection.       Rather, it rests on the simple\n\nfact that our authority is to review judgments of the district\n\ncourt, and Brandt never secured a district court judgment on the\n\nfraudulent transfer claims nor is it apparent how he could do so\n\nnow.     Counsel for the trustee in a complicated bankruptcy case\n\nhas to make its own decisions even where the law is unclear, and\n\nthe course here followed did not preserve Brandt's claims.\n\n                 III. The Unjust Enrichment Claims\n\n            The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment rejecting\n\nclaims    of   unjust   enrichment   leveled   against   a   number   of\n\ndefendants.      Most of the grants were never reviewed by the\n\ndistrict court and are thus not before us, but Brandt did seek\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\freview by the district court of the summary judgments on these\n\ncounts in favor of J.P. Morgan and Marvin Cyker.\n\n          The district court granted Brandt leave to appeal these\n\ntwo summary judgments as interlocutory orders but nevertheless\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court's judgments on the ground that\n\nneither J.P. Morgan nor Cyker had been shown to have committed\n\nthe \"minimal wrongdoing\" that the district court deemed required\n\nfor an unjust enrichment claim under Massachusetts law.      The\n\ndistrict court's rationale differed from those of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt:   the bankruptcy court had ruled in favor of Cyker because\n\nhe opposed the transaction, and in favor of J.P. Morgan because,\n\nas a mere recordholder, it received no direct benefit from the\n\ntransaction.\n\n          J.P. Morgan argues that Brandt is seeking to appeal\n\ndirectly to this court from the bankruptcy court rulings, which\n\nBrandt may not do.     Brandt's arguments in his opening brief\n\nsuggest that he has the same view.       But given the district\n\ncourt's affirmance and the lack of any limiting language in the\n\nnotice of appeal to this court, we are free to treat Brandt as\n\nappealing from the district judge's affirmance of these orders.\n\nSo viewed, these district court orders merged in the final\n\njudgment entered by the district court and are properly before\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fus now.   Cf. In re Parque Forestal, Inc., 949 F.2d 504, 508 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n           Brandt appears to be right that under Massachusetts law\n\nunjust    enrichment     does    not    always   require    a     finding    of\n\nwrongdoing by the defendant.           There are cases, albeit addressed\n\nto a somewhat different problem (mutual mistake), that hold that\n\nwrongdoing is not required so long as retention of the benefit\n\nwould be unjust.       E.g., White v. White, 190 N.E.2d 102, 104\n\n(Mass. 1963); National Shawmut Bank of Boston v. Fidelity Mut.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 61 N.E.2d 18, 22 (Mass. 1945); see Keller v.\n\nO'Brien, 683 N.E.2d 1026, 1029-33 (Mass. 1997).                 See generally\n\nRestatement of Restitution ch. 2, intro. note (1936).                   Indeed,\n\nthe   district   court    so     instructed    the   jury   on    the   unjust\n\nenrichment    claim    against    Gemini,     listing   three    elements    of\n\nunjust enrichment that the plaintiff \"must show\":\n\n           First, a benefit or enrichment was conferred\n           upon the defendant . . . ; second, the\n           retention of that benefit or enrichment\n           resulted in a detriment to [the plaintiff];\n           and, third, there are circumstances which\n           make the retention of that benefit . . .\n           unjust.\n\n           However, if, as the above suggests, the district court\n\nerred in its reason for affirming the dismissal of the claims\n\nagainst J.P. Morgan and Cyker, the error was harmless--and this\n\nis so even without reliance on the different reasons for those\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fdismissals given by the bankruptcy judge.           After receiving the\n\nabove instruction on unjust enrichment, which did not require a\n\nshowing of wrongdoing, the jury proceeded to reject on the\n\nmerits   the   claim    that   Gemini   was   unjustly   enriched   by   the\n\npayment made to Gemini in exchange for its Healthco shares.              The\n\ncounterpart claims against J.P. Morgan and Cyker were of the\n\nsame order but weaker.\n\n           Gemini      was   the   partnership   that    precipitated    the\n\noriginal abortive LBO and then actively cooperated in achieving\n\nthe second and successful one.          As noted above, after its failed\n\nattempt to take over Healthco, Gemini entered an agreement that\n\neffectively gave it power to control the nominations of three of\n\nthe seven members of Healthco's board, and the three resulting\n\nnominees were on Healthco's board, and voted for the buyout and\n\nmerger, when it approved the merger plan by a 5-2 vote.                  By\n\ncontrast, J.P. Morgan          held its shares as recordholder for\n\nothers and played no active role in the buyout, merely tendering\n\nshares in response to a public offer.          And Cyker, who later sold\n\nstock options in Healthco, opposed and voted against the buyout.\n\nIt is hard to see how a jury that found in Gemini's favor could\n\npossibly have resolved in Brandt's favor the decidedly weaker\n\nclaims against the other two defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f            The jury verdict against Gemini thus entitles us to\n\ntreat any error in the rationale for dismissing the claims\n\nagainst the other two defendants as harmless.                        See Fite v.\n\nDigital Equip. Corp., 232 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 2000).                        As in\n\nWills v. Brown University, 184 F.3d 20, 30 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nthere is no practical likelihood that the dismissed claim could\n\nhave succeeded where the tried claim failed.                     Other circuits\n\nhave similarly found summary judgment orders harmless based on\n\nthe implications of subsequent jury verdicts.                 See, e.g., Gross\n\nv. Weingarten, 217 F.3d 208, 219-20 (4th Cir. 2000); Thompson v.\n\nBoggs, 33 F.3d 847, 859 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S.\n\n1063 (1995); Wing v. Britton, 748 F.2d 494, 498 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\n                     IV. The Fiduciary Duty Claims\n\n            One of the claims made by Brandt charged the directors\n\nof HMD Acquisition Corp. with breaching their \"fiduciary duties\n\nto   Healthco    and     HMD    Acquisition          and    their    successors,\n\nshareholders, and creditors.\"             The bankruptcy judge dismissed\n\nthis claim on the ground that these directors owed their duties\n\nto   HMD   Acquisition    and    not    to     Healthco.      Even    though   the\n\ndefendants    also     began    to     serve    as   directors       of   Healthco\n\nbeginning on April 30, 1991, when the tender offer closed, the\n\nbankruptcy    judge    said     that    Healthco      had   by   then     \"already\n\ncommitted itself to the transaction through its prior board.\"\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fThe bankruptcy judge also said that although these were non-core\n\nclaims, he was entitled to determine them on the merits because\n\nthe parties had in effect consented to their disposition.\n\n              On April 23, 1997, the first day of the jury trial, the\n\ndistrict court announced that it was treating the bankruptcy\n\ncourt    judgment     dismissing    the     fiduciary     duty    claims    as   a\n\nproposed conclusion of law on a non-core matter, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n157(c)(1), and then said that it was accepting and adopting the\n\nbankruptcy      court's     recommendation.         In     this    court,    the\n\ndefendants argue that Brandt forfeited any appeal when he failed\n\nto object to the bankruptcy court's recommendation within ten\n\ndays of the district court's recharacterization.                   See Fed. R.\n\nBankr. P. 9033(b).          But if the bankruptcy court ruling was\n\nconverted at that time to a recommendation, there was no reason\n\nfor a further objection since the ruling was simultaneously\n\nresolved on the merits by the district court.                     The district\n\ncourt's merits resolution is merged in its final judgment and\n\nproperly before us.\n\n              Nonetheless, all this is for naught.               In his opening\n\nbrief Brandt devotes only a single paragraph to the ruling on\n\nHMD Acquisition's directors that he now seeks to reverse, saying\n\nthat    any   claim   for   duty   breached    by   the    directors    of   HMD\n\nAcquisition \"survived the merger.\"           Brandt's terse argument does\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fnot attempt to address the lower courts' ruling that there was\n\nno breach of any fiduciary duty to Healthco when the critical\n\ndecision was taken.           Brandt's effort to offer new arguments in\n\nhis reply brief, after the defendants filed their answering\n\nbriefs, comes too late.           Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959\n\nF.2d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                              V. Discovery Matters\n\n              Brandt    argues   that    the   bankruptcy   court   committed\n\nreversible error in various discovery rulings.                None of these\n\nrulings was formally appealed to the district court.                 However,\n\nduring a pre-trial telephone conference on February 14, 1997,\n\nthe district court judge indicated that he was aware of the\n\nbankruptcy judge's discovery orders and was reluctant to disturb\n\nthem,   but    would    nonetheless      \"allow   some   minimum    amount    of\n\nfurther pretrial discovery.\"             To the extent that the district\n\ncourt did modify the bankruptcy court's discovery orders, the\n\nmodified orders are obviously before us for review.\n\n              The jurisdictional issue is more debatable as to the\n\ndiscovery      orders    of    the   bankruptcy     court   that    were     not\n\ndisturbed.       Perhaps the district court's statements could be\n\nregarded as an implicit affirmance of those orders (or at least\n\nsome of them) on interlocutory appeal; if so, the affirmance\n\nwould be merged into the final judgment and properly before us.\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fWe will assume this is so arguendo since it does not alter the\n\nresult.\n\n            The most controversial of the bankruptcy judge's orders\n\nis that of June 20, 1996, which limited each side to ten\n\ndepositions as of right, in accordance with Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 30(a)(2), with the remaining depositions to be\n\nconducted from September through December 1996.              Brandt had\n\nalready taken four depositions and was therefore allowed only\n\nsix more under the order.        But the order also provided that\n\nfurther depositions could be taken with leave of the court and\n\nin accordance with the general principles set forth in Rule\n\n26(b)(2).      Brandt,   who   had   planned   to   take   sixty   or   so\n\nadditional depositions, immediately asked the bankruptcy judge\n\nto remove any limit or at least to allow dozens of depositions,\n\nand the bankruptcy judge refused.\n\n            On December 17, 1996, Brandt asked permission to take\n\nadditional depositions and for a one-month extension of the\n\ndeposition deadline.     Although Brandt identified 19 additional\n\nindividuals and the subjects in question, the bankruptcy judge\n\ndenied the motion, saying that it came only two weeks before the\n\nlong-established deadline, a year-and-a-half after the complaint\n\nwas filed, and two-and-a-half years after the trustee began\n\ninvestigation.     The court said it was not impressed with the\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fneed for the depositions and that \"[p]ermitting the requested\n\ndepositions [would] unnecessarily increase counsel's fees and\n\n[would] more likely delay the trial scheduled to begin April 7,\n\n1997.\"\n\n            Brandt then sought but was denied leave by the district\n\ncourt for an immediate appeal.           But, thereafter, in a pre-trial\n\nconference on February 14, 1997, the district court allowed each\n\nside to take an additional 20 hours of depositions before trial.\n\nAt a further pre-trial hearing on March 17, 1997, Brandt asked\n\nfor   an   adjournment      of   the   April    trial    to   allow      for   more\n\ndepositions;     but    after      learning     that    the    20     additional\n\ndeposition hours had not yet been exhausted, the district court\n\nrejected the adjournment motion.                Later, the court granted\n\nBrandt two additional depositions during the trial.\n\n            Discovery decisions by the bankruptcy judge or district\n\ncourt are reviewed for abuse of discretion, and the discretion\n\nin this area is very broad, recognizing that an appeals court\n\nsimply cannot manage the intricate process of discovery from a\n\ndistance.    In Modern Continental/Obayashi v. Occupational Safety\n\n& Health Review Comm'n, 196 F.3d 274, 281 (1st Cir. 1999), this\n\ncourt    spoke   of   the   need   for   \"a    clear    showing     of   manifest\n\ninjustice,\" saying that, to warrant reversal, the lower court's\n\ndiscovery order must be \"plainly wrong\" and must be shown to\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fhave resulted in \"substantial prejudice\" to the complaining\n\nparty.    Although at first blush the limitations imposed by the\n\nbankruptcy judge seem severe, even when somewhat modified by the\n\ndistrict court, there is more to the story.\n\n            Brandt       devotes    almost    ten   pages    of   his     brief    to\n\nexplaining that the case involves a large amount of money and\n\nmany parties and that none of the defendants registered any\n\nobjection    to    his    original    proposal      to    take    sixty    or   more\n\ndepositions.        Of    course,    the   lack     of   objection     from     other\n\nparties   is      not    dispositive;      the    bankruptcy      judge    had     an\n\nindependent responsibility to manage the litigation and conserve\n\nthe resources of the estate.               But the size and scope of the\n\nlitigation might well have provided a basis for justifying a\n\ngreater number of depositions than was allowed.\n\n            However, the bankruptcy judge did not say that only ten\n\ndepositions were permitted.            Obviously concerned with the slow\n\npace and mounting expense of discovery, he held the plaintiff's\n\nfeet to the fire to move quickly and then justify any additional\n\nrequests for depositions on a case-specific basis.                    In fact, the\n\norder fixing the ten-deposition limit referred to Federal Rules'\n\nprovisions     setting      the    criteria      for     justifying     additional\n\ndiscovery.     Thus, the bankruptcy judge's order is not quite the\n\narbitrary limit that Brandt suggests.\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\f              The more troubling aspect is the bankruptcy court's\n\nrefusal    in    December     1996    to    extend    the    deadline      and   allow\n\nfurther       depositions.       Brandt's      request       at    that    time     was\n\nreasonably detailed as to proposed deponents and the subject\n\nmatter for questioning.          It is hard to lean too heavily on the\n\nbankruptcy judge's brief statement that he was \"not impressed\n\nwith the critical nature of the dispositions.\"                       And while the\n\ndistrict       judge   effectively         allowed    another       four    or     five\n\ndepositions, this was far short of what Brandt had sought even\n\nin December.\n\n              However we might otherwise feel about the severe limit\n\non depositions--and it would take a more detailed examination of\n\nthe record for us to make a final judgment--Brandt's opening\n\nbrief    is    virtually     devoid    of    any     showing      that    Brandt    was\n\nprejudiced.       In the entire ten-page discussion there is only a\n\nsingle elliptical sentence describing a specific witness.                          Even\n\nthis    discussion     does    not    make    clear    why    Brandt      thinks    the\n\nwitness was so vital.         Thus there is no reason to think that the\n\noutcome of the case was affected by the limit on depositions.\n\n              Brandt says that this is a catch 22, since one can\n\nnever be sure what further discovery might have adduced.                         While\n\nthis (standard) argument has some force, it is not conclusive:\n\nboth in justifying discovery and in explaining later why a\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\frefusal to allow it caused harm, lawyers are accustomed to\n\nshowing specifically just what gaps in their claim and defense\n\nmight be filled by evidence within the likely knowledge of the\n\nwitness.   And it is just such specifics that are absent from\n\nBrandt's opening brief.   Indeed, the trial being over, it should\n\nhave been even easier than before or at trial for Brandt to\n\nexplain just where he thinks that additional depositions could\n\nhave filled any apparent gaps in the case presented.\n\n           In his reply brief, Brandt does make a broader, but at\n\nthe same time better supported, showing that he was expected to\n\nconduct too much discovery within too brief a time frame when\n\none takes into account both depositions and the huge number of\n\ndocuments to be sorted and analyzed.    But Brandt's time frame\n\nmay be an artificial one; there is some reason to think that he\n\ncould have made more progress at an earlier stage and that he\n\nmoved too slowly even after the initial discovery deadline was\n\nset in June 1996.7   But we need not resolve this point, since,\n\n\n    7Brandt says that he had insufficient time to conduct\ndiscovery between June 1996 (when the case management order was\nadopted) and December 1996 (the scheduled end of discovery), as\nwell as insufficient time for additional discovery before trial\nin April 1997.   However, Brandt became Healthco's trustee in\nOctober 1993, filed his complaint in June 1995, and had\npossession of many of the documents that he complains he had\ninsufficient time to review long before June 1996. Further, in\nthe six months between the case management order and his motion\nfor   additional  depositions,   Brandt   conducted  only   six\ndepositions.\n\n                               -31-\n\fas we have already noted, arguments first developed in a reply\n\nbrief come too late.       Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 354.\n\n            Brandt's second claim of discovery error concerns the\n\nfailure of Coopers & Lybrand to produce documents from Coopers'\n\nforeign offices relating to its review of Healthco's year-end\n\nfinancial statements for 1990.        The unsecured creditors earlier\n\nsought to     obtain these and other papers from Coopers, see Fed.\n\nR.   Bankr.   P.   2004,   and   Brandt   and   Coopers   agreed   on   the\n\nproduction of certain of these documents, but apparently Coopers\n\nfailed to produce documents from its foreign offices.              Yet it\n\nwas not until February 20, 1997, less than two months before the\n\nscheduled trial date and six months after the bankruptcy court's\n\ndeadline for document discovery, that Brandt filed an expedited\n\nmotion with the bankruptcy court to obtain the audit-related\n\npapers from Coopers.\n\n            Although Brandt now offers an explanation as to why\n\nthese papers were necessary, the request originally filed in the\n\nbankruptcy court merely asserted that Brandt \"need[ed] to review\n\nall C & L memoranda and audit workpapers regarding Healthco's\n\nforeign subsidiaries in order to prepare properly his case for\n\ntrial.\"   And, not surprisingly, the bankruptcy court denied the\n\nmotion without explanation about a week after it was filed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\f          There is no indication that Brandt then brought the\n\nmatter   to     the    attention       of      the     district     court    by    an\n\ninterlocutory        appeal;    nor    does       it   appear   that,   as     trial\n\napproached,     he    ever     asked    the    district     court    for    belated\n\ndocument discovery against Coopers, which might conceivably have\n\nbeen justified if a new need arose at the last minute.                       In any\n\nevent, Brandt apparently never gave the bankruptcy judge the\n\nexplanation he now gives us as to why the papers from Coopers'\n\nforeign subsidiaries were necessary.                   Faced only with a bland\n\nand   belated    statement       that       the    papers   were     needed,      the\n\nbankruptcy court acted within its discretion in denying the\n\nrequested discovery.\n\n          Finally, Brandt says that the bankruptcy court erred\n\nin refusing to permit him to discover the identity of the\n\nbeneficial owners of the Healthco shares that were tendered by\n\nJ.P. Morgan and Chancellor.            Brandt argues that this information\n\nwas necessary so that Brandt could direct its unjust enrichment\n\nclaims against those who actually benefitted from the $15 per\n\nshare buyout of Healthco stock.                   This point takes on added\n\nsignificance because the bankruptcy court relied on the fact\n\nthat J.P. Morgan and Chancellor were merely recordholders in\n\ndismissing the unjust enrichment claims against them.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\f          Brandt    attempts   to     show   that   the   denial   of   an\n\nopportunity to discover beneficial ownership was based on the\n\nbankruptcy court's misconstrual of its own orders.               However,\n\nthere is no indication that a ruling on this discovery issue was\n\never sought from the district court.            In any case, the jury\n\nrejected the unjust enrichment claims directed at defendants who\n\nwere both stockholders and active in promoting the LBO; it is\n\nvery hard to see how Brandt could have expected a more favorable\n\nresult if he had unearthed the names of passive beneficial\n\nstockholders for whom record ownership was held in the name of\n\nJ.P. Morgan or Chancellor.\n\n                     VI. Conduct of the Trial\n\n          Brandt objects to a set of alleged errors occurring\n\nduring the course of the trial and says that the errors and\n\nmisconduct   of   defense   counsel   fatally   tainted    the   verdict.\n\nSpecifically, Brandt objects to references to settlements with\n\nother defendants, admission of an expert's testimony and report,\n\ntime limits imposed by the trial judge, restrictions on the\n\n\"publication\" of documents to the jury, and comments or evidence\n\ndesigned to paint the trustee or the trustee's counsel in a bad\n\nlight.   We consider the claims of error in the order in which\n\nBrandt has briefed them.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f           First, citing McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., 765 F.2d 240\n\n(1st Cir. 1985), Brandt complains of references to settlements\n\nBrandt reached with other defendants.         In McInnis, this court\n\nconstrued broadly Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which excludes\n\nsettlements when offered to prove the validity or invalidity of\n\na claim.   Id. at 246-48.    There, the plaintiff, the victim in a\n\nmotorcycle accident, had sued the manufacturers (for making a\n\ndefective product); the plaintiff had also previously obtained\n\na settlement paid on behalf of the driver of a car that had hit\n\nthe motorcycle, and the trial court admitted evidence of the\n\nsettlement to show that the accident had been caused by the\n\ndriver of the car rather than the faulty manufacture of the\n\nmotorcycle.    Id.   at   241-42.   McInnis    held   that   using   the\n\nsettlement agreement to show causation amounted to using it to\n\nshow the invalidity of a claim, and found that the error in\n\nadmitting evidence of the settlement required a new trial.           Id.\n\nat 246-48.\n\n           Here, Brandt says that one of the defendant's opening\n\nstatements at trial mentioned Brandt's settlements with other\n\nparties.   However, the passages that Brandt identifies refer not\n\nto settlements but to the fact that Brandt had initially sued 69\n\npeople or businesses.     The thrust was not that other defendants\n\nhad settled (and were therefore the real perpetrators) but\n\n\n                                -35-\n\frather that Brandt was a plaintiff who sued everyone in sight\n\nregardless of whether the individual defendant was responsible.\n\nThis    was    not   an   offer    of   proof    of,   or   a    reference     to,   a\n\nsettlement, which is what Rule 408 and McInnis are concerned\n\nwith.\n\n              Some of Brandt's discussion of this issue suggests that\n\nhe is concerned not so much with the inference of settlement,\n\nbut     with the inference that a large number of parties were\n\nresponsible for the transaction but the blame has been unfairly\n\nfocused on the few remaining at trial.                          While this was a\n\npossible inference, it is not clear that, in this respect, the\n\ncomments complained of were very helpful to the defendants;\n\nindeed,       they   might   rather     have    suggested       that    the   parties\n\nremaining at trial were those most responsible.                        In any event,\n\nthe trustee makes no substantial effort to make a real showing\n\nof prejudice.\n\n              Brandt also refers in his brief to a closing argument\n\nby defense counsel insinuating that the proof offered in the\n\ntrial    of    negligence     by    Coopers     &   Lybrand      \"undermines      the\n\nintegrity of the case against the defendants in this courtroom.\"\n\nWhether or not the inference is a fair one, once again it has\n\nnothing to do with settlement, there having been affirmative\n\nevidence against Coopers & Lybrand offered during the trial\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fitself.      It   is   worth   adding   that   the   first   references   to\n\nsettlement were made not by defendants but by Brandt's counsel.\n\nCf. Willco Kuwait (Trading) S.A.K. v. deSavary, 843 F.2d 618,\n\n625 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Second, Brandt says that the district court erred in\n\npermitting the defendants to call Robert W. Berliner--Brandt's\n\naccounting expert--to examine him about portions of a report he\n\nhad prepared for Brandt.          The disputed portion of the report\n\nconcerns Berliner's conclusion that Coopers had negligently\n\nperformed the Healthco audit for 1990; the implication, which\n\ndefendants hoped would be drawn, was that Coopers and not the\n\ndefendants at trial bore responsibility for the unhappy outcome\n\nof the LBO.       Brandt made a timely objection that the report was\n\nhearsay and now says that evidence regarding it was highly\n\nprejudicial and should have been excluded under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.\n\n          Brandt expressly admits in his opening brief that the\n\ndefendants had \"a right to argue that Coopers was the cause of\n\nthe failure of Healthco,\" but objects that the defendants were\n\nobliged to prove this through their own evidence and expert\n\nwitnesses.    The latter is an overstatement:         at Brandt's behest,\n\nBerliner gave testimony arguably implying that Coopers did not\n\nbear responsibility for the failure of Healthco, so he certainly\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fcould be cross-examined and impeached on this issue.                    Whether\n\nthe   Berliner    report   was    admissible    as    the   admission    of    an\n\nopposing party, and therefore admissible not just to impeach but\n\nas proof of the facts asserted in it, is a different question\n\nwhich the district court resolved in favor of the defendants.\n\n           The    district   court,       supported    on    appeal     by    the\n\ndefendants, viewed the report as an admission of Brandt through\n\nan agent (the expert) acting within the scope of his agency, and\n\ntherefore found it admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n801(d)(2)(D).     Since the report was prepared by Berliner during\n\nhis work for Brandt, it might at first blush seem to fit\n\ncomfortably within this rule, assuming always that Berliner\n\ncould be regarded as an agent for this purpose.               Some authority\n\npoints in this direction but the Third Circuit emphatically\n\ndisagrees, saying that an expert is more like an independent\n\ncontractor offering his own opinion and is not \"controlled\" by\n\nthe party who employs him.           Kirk v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 61\n\nF.3d 147, 163-64 (3d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1145\n\n(1996) (discussed in 30B Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\n§ 7022, at 202 n.1 (2000)).\n\n           The authorities are fairly sparse, but we need not\n\ndecide the Rule 801(d) issue.            Prior to introducing in evidence\n\nthe   pertinent    portion   of    the    report,    the    defendants   asked\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fBerliner    questions       and    elicited         statements         from    him     as    to\n\nCooper's actions that covered more or less the same ground as\n\nthe report.        As noted above, the defendants' questions were\n\npermissible cross-examination.                    The resulting statements--not\n\nunexpected       unless   Berliner          was    prepared       to    contradict          his\n\nreport--were       in-court       statements        not     subject      to     a    hearsay\n\nobjection.         Accordingly,         even       if    the    report        itself    were\n\nobjectionable, any error in its admission is rendered harmless\n\nby the questioning of Berliner.                         See Texaco P.R., Inc. v.\n\nDepartment of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 886 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n            As for the objection under Rule 403, it is hard to\n\nunderstand       Brandt's    argument.             Brandt       agrees    that       whether\n\nCoopers    was    careless      was     a    pertinent         issue    and    Berliner's\n\ntestimony and report were directed to that question.                                No doubt\n\nthe testimony had more impact because it came from Brandt's own\n\nexpert, but the expert was one whom Brandt himself had called to\n\ntestify    at    trial    and     who       had    given       testimony       that    might\n\notherwise have led the jury to believe that Coopers was not at\n\nfault.    Assuming a Rule 403               objection to the Berliner evidence\n\nwas preserved, it was not error under Rule 403 to allow the\n\nevidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -39-\n\f             Third, Brandt objects, in the caption of one section\n\nof   his     opening   brief,       to    the    district      court's   placing\n\n\"unreasonable pre-determined time limitations upon the trial,\"\n\ni.e.,   60    hours.       Then--in      the    body    of   the   discussion--he\n\ndevelops two arguments:            that defense counsel manipulated the\n\ntime limits to Brandt's disadvantage (naming witnesses, forcing\n\nBrandt to reserve some of his time to cross-examine them, and\n\nthen not calling those witnesses); and that the district court\n\npromised Brandt that he could use all of his otherwise unused\n\ntime for his closing argument but then limited him to four and\n\na half hours when he still had ten hours remaining.\n\n             How   trial    time    should      be     limited--obviously    some\n\nlimitations are appropriate--raises interesting problems, see\n\nBorges v. Our Lady of the Sea Corp., 935 F.2d 436, 442-43 (1st\n\nCir. 1991), but they need not be addressed here because (despite\n\nthe caption in the opening brief) Brandt's argument makes no\n\neffort to show that the 60 hours of trial time allotted to each\n\nside was unreasonable.             The related suggestion that defense\n\ncounsel manipulated the time limits by listing witnesses who\n\nwere not called is mentioned in a single sentence, is not\n\nseriously supported, and is therefore waived.                       Massachusetts\n\nSch. of Law v. American Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\f1998).8    We add that we have found no additional serious support\n\nfor this claim in Brandt's earlier arguments to the district\n\ncourt on this same issue.\n\n            The   bulk   of   Brandt's    argument   is   directed   to    a\n\ndifferent    and,   as   presented,   more   striking     claim   that   the\n\ndistrict court promised unlimited time for closing argument (so\n\nlong as the 60-hour limit was not exceeded) and then broke this\n\npromise.    Brandt describes a colloquy during the trial where the\n\ndistrict court allegedly \"prohibited the Trustee's counsel from\n\npublishing to the jury relevant portions of voluminous documents\n\nthat had been received in evidence\"; and Brandt then quotes his\n\ncounsel as asking the court whether it was \"going to impose any\n\nlimitation on the time of closing assuming I still have it\n\navailable in my allotted hours.\"         Brandt's brief then quotes the\n\ncourt as saying:     \"You can have any length of closing.\"\n\n            The trial transcript shows that the district court\n\nnever made an unconditional promise to allow Brandt to use any\n\nunused time in closing argument.          The district court said, \"You\n\ncan have any length of closing as long as--\" and was then\n\ninterrupted by Brandt's counsel who said, \"Then that solves a\n\n\n\n     8\n     A similar lack of development marks Brandt's suggestion, in\nthe \"Issues Presented\" portion of his opening brief, that the\ndistrict court erred in imposing a time penalty after Brandt\nmade an unsuccessful motion.\n\n                                   -41-\n\flot of my problem.\"        Shortly before the close of evidence, the\n\ncourt made clear that it did not intend to allow Brandt to make\n\na ten-hour closing argument even though he still had ten hours\n\nleft on his clock and, despite a pro forma protest, Brandt then\n\nsuggested four and a half hours and made no effort to show that\n\nthis would prejudice him or that he could not present the\n\nsubstance of his case in this time frame.        In the end he elected\n\nto use less in order to complete his argument within one day.\n\n            Providing no specifics, Brandt intimates that he was\n\nsomehow     limited   in   his   ability   to   publish   documents   or\n\ndeposition transcript evidence to the jury during trial and that\n\nhe hoped to use the closing argument to read portions of this\n\nevidence to the jury.       In fact, the trial transcript shows that\n\nBrandt published a great deal of such evidence during the trial,\n\nand the colloquy to which he refers to show that he was limited\n\nactually appears to have been concerned with how the materials\n\nwere presented, the district court having objected to Brandt's\n\ncounsel reading deposition pages at length to the jury while\n\npurporting to question the witness.        Once again, Brandt's brief\n\npoints to no specific material, let alone material of vital\n\nimportance, that he was effectively prevented from publishing to\n\nthe jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f            Fourth, Brandt argues that during the course of the\n\ntrial,    some   defense     counsel    made     arguments       or   introduced\n\nevidence besmirching the character of the trustee by suggesting\n\nthat he was in the business of acting as a trustee for many\n\nbankrupt companies, that he received fees based on the amount of\n\nmoney he collected, that in the past he had sued many defendants\n\non claims like the ones pressed here, that he hired his own\n\ncompany to provide administrative services to the estate, and so\n\non.      These   charges,     says   Brandt,     were    irrelevant     and   (if\n\nmarginally relevant in some respects) far more prejudicial than\n\nis proper under Rule 403.\n\n            Brandt's complaints would have more force if he had not\n\ninvited many of these \"charges\" by the claims that his counsel\n\nmade     during opening argument, claims later echoed by Brandt\n\nhimself when he briefly appeared as a witness.                   In opening to\n\nthe jury, Brandt's counsel sought to paint a picture of the\n\ntrustee as essentially a neutral party engaged in a quasi-\n\nofficial    function:         counsel     said    that     the    trustee     was\n\n\"supervised\"     by   the    bankruptcy     judge,   was   \"a    disinterested\n\nparty\" and would not \"get to keep any of the money [from a\n\nverdict] himself.\"      Later, Brandt himself told the jury that the\n\nmoney    recovered    from    defendants     would   be    \"disseminated\"      to\n\nHealthco's creditors. During cross-examination, Brandt conceded\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fthat the trustee would receive \"a commission\" from litigation\n\nproceeds based on a percentage formula.             See 11 U.S.C. § 326(a).\n\n            But even assuming that counsel for the trustee did not\n\nprovoke defense counsel's responses, and that one or more of the\n\ndefense counsel went too far in some of their remarks, the trial\n\njudge addressed the issue appropriately.                After concluding that\n\nthe   comments     were   improper,      the    judge   rebuked    counsel    and\n\ndirected the jury to disregard the comments.               It is our practice\n\nto presume that such instructions are followed, unless the\n\nevidence is hopelessly sure to warp the jury's judgment.                  Conde\n\nv. Starlight I, Inc., 103 F.3d 210, 213 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            The same conclusion, and much of the same analysis,\n\napplies to Brandt's complaints about remarks in some defense\n\ncounsel's    closing      arguments      that    Brandt   believes     unfairly\n\nportrayed his attorneys in an ill light.                As with the comments\n\nregarding Brandt himself, the trial judge responded to the\n\nremarks about Brandt's attorneys by instructing the jury to\n\ndisregard negative comments about their integrity.                     Without\n\napproving every remark or question posed by defense counsel, we\n\nfind that this is not a case in which the verdict should be\n\noverturned    or    a     new   trial     required.

This case arises out of the\n\nfailure and chapter 7 bankruptcy of Healthco International, Inc.\n\n(\"Healthco\"), a major global distributor of dental products and\n\nservices.    Following this debacle, the chapter 7 trustee brought\n\nthe   present   case   on   behalf   of    the   estate   against   numerous\n\nparties alleged to have been responsible for, or beneficiaries\n\nof, the leveraged buyout that precipitated the collapse of\n\nHealthco.

In\n\nresponse,    Healthco   engaged     Lazard   Frères   &   Co.   LLC    as   its\n\nfinancial advisor and sought to arrange the company's sale to\n\nanother buyer.\n\n            On September 4, 1990, Healthco entered into a merger\n\nagreement with affiliates of Hicks, Muse & Co. (\"Hicks, Muse\"),\n\na Dallas-based investment firm.           Under the agreement, a company\n\nformed by Hicks, Muse would merge with Healthco after acquiring\n\nits stock at a price of $19.25 per share.             After reaching this\n\nagreement,    in    mid-September    Healthco    negotiated     a     separate\n\nsettlement agreement with Gemini and the Committee, under which\n\nthree Committee nominees became members of Healthco's seven-\n\nmember board.       The settlement agreement provided that, if the\n\nmerger agreement was terminated or sufficient progress toward a\n\nsale of the company was not subsequently made, the Committee\n\ncould increase its share of the board from three out of seven to\n\nfive out of nine.      As a further spur to a merger or sale, Gemini\n\npromised     each    Committee    director     $24,000,    less       director\n\ncompensation, if Gemini sold its shares at a profit.\n\n            In February 1991, Hicks, Muse's initial plan for a\n\nleveraged buyout2 (\"LBO\") of Healthco fell apart after Healthco's\n\n\n     2\n     A leveraged buyout is a transaction to acquire a\ncorporation\n\"in which a substantial portion of the purchase price paid for\n\n                                    -5-\n\fannual physical inventory indicated that the company's unaudited\n\n1990 earnings were several million dollars lower than expected.\n\nHealthco's auditors, Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., later certified\n\nfinancial statements that revealed a 1990 net loss of just over\n\n$5 million and 1990 earnings of less than $22 million.                        Given\n\nsuch figures, Hicks, Muse determined the $19.25 share price was\n\ntoo high, and the parties set to work drawing up a new plan.\n\n           On   March   26,   1991,    Healthco's       board    voted       5-2   to\n\napprove a new merger plan involving Hicks, Muse affiliates.\n\nMarvin   Cyker,    Healthco's    chief      executive    officer       and    board\n\nchairman, who held stock options but no outstanding shares in\n\nHealthco, was one of the two board members who voted against the\n\ntransaction.      The proposal was for a tender offer for Healthco\n\nstock at $15 per share to be made under Hicks, Muse's auspices,\n\nwith financing by other parties, after which Healthco would\n\nmerge with a new entity controlled by the new investors.

Rev. 661 (1990).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            On April 2, a tender offer for Healthco stock was made\n\nby HMD Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Healthco\n\nHolding Co.; Healthco Holding was itself a company set up by\n\nHicks, Muse to be the recipient of $55 million of the Hicks,\n\nMuse investors' funds.       Additional funds for the merger were to\n\nbe supplied by a bank group that would provide a $50 million\n\ntender   facility   (i.e.,     an   available   loan)   in   exchange   for\n\nperfected first priority liens on HMD Acquisition's shares in\n\nHealthco. Another group of investment entities were to provide\n\n$45 million in cash, in exchange for subordinated debt.\n\n            The tender offer was successful.            HMD Acquisition\n\nacquired more than 90% of Healthco's stock in the tender offer.\n\nAmong the stockholders who tendered shares or options in the\n\nmerger were Marvin Cyker, who received over $1 million for his\n\nstock options, and J.P. Morgan & Co., an investment firm that\n\nhad held 17.3% of Healthco's shares (13.0% on a fully diluted\n\nbasis,   i.e.,   after   the    exercise   of   options)     as   a   record\n\nshareholder for its clients.\n\n            The buyout of Healthco was completed on May 22, 1991,\n\nthrough a short-form, cash-out merger, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, §\n\n253 (1999), in which HMD Acquisition Corp. was merged into\n\nHealthco.    Healthco's remaining original stockholders received\n\n$15 per share in exchange for their holdings.            The Hicks, Muse\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\finvestors, by contrast, were now largely dependent on Healthco's\n\nfate.     As a result of the merger, Healthco, the surviving\n\ncompany, inherited all of HMD Acquisition's debts--namely, the\n\nmultimillion-dollar debts owed to non-equity investors (e.g.,\n\nthe banks) who helped to finance the Healthco buyout.\n\n           After    the   merger,    Healthco's    financial    situation\n\nsteadily deteriorated.      (It is unclear to what extent this was\n\ndue to pre-existing problems and to what extent the situation\n\nwas aggravated by new debt.)         In the spring of 1992, Healthco\n\nwas placed on credit hold by a large European supplier, and by\n\nJune 1992 more than forty of Healthco's suppliers were refusing\n\nto ship it goods until they were paid for past receivables.\n\nAfter defaulting on several loan covenants, Healthco faced an\n\nincreasingly hostile relationship with the bank group that had\n\nfinanced the tender facility for the buyout.\n\n           On June 9, 1993, Healthco filed a petition for chapter\n\n11 bankruptcy in the federal bankruptcy court in Massachusetts,\n\n11 U.S.C. § 301 (1994).         That September, after declining to\n\napprove   a   new   borrowing   arrangement,      the   bankruptcy   court\n\ngranted    Healthco's     motion    for   conversion      to   chapter   7\n\nbankruptcy.    Id. § 1112(a).       The buyout of Healthco, which had\n\npossessed assets of greater than $300 million at the time of the\n\nmerger, had ended in a liquidation proceeding that yielded less\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthan $60 million, far less than what was needed to pay off\n\nHealthco's creditors.\n\n           On    June    8,    1995,   Brandt,    as   Healthco's    chapter    7\n\ntrustee,        began    the    present   adversary      proceeding    in     the\n\nbankruptcy court, implicating almost all of those involved in\n\nthe   merger    transaction      and   ultimately      claiming    around   $300\n\nmillion in damages.           Brandt's 22-count complaint made 12 claims\n\nfor fraudulent transfers (counts I-XII).3                Brandt also alleged\n\nfour counts of breach of fiduciary duty, or of aiding and\n\nabetting the same (counts XIII-XVI).4              Finally, Brandt charged\n\nCoopers & Lybrand with accounting malpractice; accused Lazard\n\nand   Valuation    Research      Corporation,     a    financial    advisor    of\n\nHicks, Muse, of negligence; claimed that all the tendering\n\nshareholders      were   unjustly      enriched    and   benefitted    from     a\n\ncommercially unreasonable distribution; and alleged that the\n\n\n      3\n     Those accused of benefitting from fraudulent transfers\nincluded (1) Hicks, Muse, the primary orchestrator of the\nleveraged buyout; (2) the bank group and subordinated\ndebtholders who helped finance the buyout; (3) various other\nHealthco stockholders, whose tendering of shares allowed the\nbuyout to proceed; (4) and various professionals who were paid\nfor their roles in bringing about the buyout.\n      4\n     The primary targets of these counts were the directors of\nHealthco and HMD Acquisition, as well as Healthco's controlling\nshareholders. Their alleged aiders and abettors included Hicks,\nMuse, Healthco Holding Co., the bank group, Healthco directors\nwho voted for the buyout, Valuation Research which had endorsed\nthe feasibility of the original $19 buyout plan, and Lazard\nwhich had endorsed the fairness of the $15 plan.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fbank group was liable because of the commercially unreasonable\n\nway in which it liquidated its collateral (counts XVII-XXII).\n\n           Proceedings in the bankruptcy court were extensive\n\nduring the balance of 1995 and throughout 1996.   In addition to\n\ndiscovery (and discovery disputes), there were several amended\n\ncomplaints by Brandt, dismissal or summary judgment grants in\n\nfavor of various defendants on specific claims, and efforts\n\n(generally unsuccessful) by Brandt to get interlocutory review\n\non various rulings in the district court.     Although it became\n\nclear in 1996 that a jury trial would likely be required in the\n\ndistrict court on certain claims, the bankruptcy judge continued\n\nto oversee the matter.\n\n           In early 1997, the district court began to move the\n\nremaining claims toward trial.   Brandt then reached a settlement\n\nwith the bank group defendants and later filed a fourth amended\n\ncomplaint streamlining various of the claims that remained.\n\nShortly before trial, Brandt settled his claim with Coopers &\n\nLybrand.   Except for claims against Lazard, (where jury trial\n\nhad been waived) the remaining claims were tried to a jury in a\n\n27-day trial from April 23 until June 6, 1997.    Brandt lost on\n\nevery claim tried to the jury, and the district court found in\n\nfavor of Lazard.\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f           Brandt now appeals on numerous issues.        Importantly,\n\nthese include the dismissal by the bankruptcy court of key\n\nfraudulent transfer claims, its grant of summary judgment for\n\nvarious defendants as to the unjust enrichment claims against\n\nthem, the district court's disposition of certain fiduciary duty\n\nclaims, and miscellaneous claims relating to discovery and the\n\nconduct of the trial.      The details, and certain concerns about\n\nour jurisdiction, are discussed in connection with each set of\n\nclaims.\n\n               II. Fraudulent Transfer Dismissals\n\n           We start with Brandt's effort to revive the fraudulent\n\ntransfer   claims   that   the   bankruptcy   judge   dismissed.   In\n\nessence, Brandt's theory of fraudulent transfer is that because\n\nHealthco's assumption of HMD Acquisition's liabilities meant\n\nthat Healthco's assets became collateral for the debt that\n\nfinanced the buyout, both the tendering shareholders and the\n\nfinanciers obtained proceeds from a \"fraudulent\" transaction\n\nthat deprived Healthco's pre-existing unsecured creditors of\n\nmost of the value of the company's assets.\n\n           The bankruptcy court refused to see the transaction as\n\na stripping of Healthco assets.          Rejecting Brandt's call to\n\n\"collapse\" the multi-step buyout into a transfer of Healthco's\n\nassets to shareholders and buyout financiers, the bankruptcy\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcourt   repeatedly   held   that   \"funds   transferred   by   [HMD]\n\nAcquisition prior to the effectiveness of the merger [were] not\n\ntransfers by [Healthco] and hence are immune from fraudulent\n\ntransfer attack.\"    Brandt, 201 B.R. at 21.    It is this refusal\n\nto \"collapse\" the leveraged buyout, and hence treat the payments\n\nin question as ones made in substance (although not in form) out\n\nof Healthco's assets, which is the focus of Brandt's challenge\n\non appeal.\n\n          Whether the transaction should have been \"collapsed\"\n\nappears to be a difficult issue of state law (the parties do not\n\nagree on which state or states supply the law) on which there is\n\nfairly limited precedent.5 Of course, there are similar problems\n\n\n    5See, e.g., Kupetz v.

Indeed, the bankruptcy court itself, in\n\ndealing with directors' obligations of loyalty, recognized that\n\nHealthco's assets were security for the transaction's financing\n\nand described as \"myopic\" the defendants' argument that the\n\nbuyout transaction should be analyzed only in terms of its\n\nseparate parts.      Brandt, 208 B.R. at 302.\n\n            We conclude, however, that the issue is not properly\n\nbefore    us    because    our   authority      is    limited    to    review    of\n\njudgments by the district court and Brandt never secured a\n\ndistrict court judgment resolving any of the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaims.     Abbreviating the history, the story begins with the\n\nbankruptcy court's orders of October 27, 1995, granting motions\n\nto dismiss on the basis of a bench ruling from the prior day.\n\nThe   dismissals    were    of   fraudulent      transfer       claims      against\n\nvarious    defendants      who   were     for   the     most    part    tendering\n\nshareholders in the multi-step buyout:                 J.P. Morgan & Co., the\n\nAirlie    Group   defendants     (a   limited        partnership      and   several\n\nindividuals who owned approximately 10% of Healthco's stock), J.\n\nRobert Casey, and Helen and Marvin Cyker.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            On November 6, 1995, Brandt sought leave to appeal\n\nthese dismissals as interlocutory orders, 28 U.S.C. § 158(a);\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 8003.         On June 27, 1996, the district court\n\ndenied this motion.       Brandt then asked the bankruptcy court to\n\ncertify the dismissals for an appeal under Federal Rule of\n\nBankruptcy Procedure 7054(a), the bankruptcy counterpart of\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), but the bankruptcy court\n\ndenied this motion.        Later the bankruptcy court issued orders\n\ndismissing further claims of fraudulent transfers to Healthco\n\nshareholders, subordinated preferred shareholders, and others.\n\nAgain Brandt did not secure review by the district court.\n\n            At this stage, the bankruptcy court's orders were\n\ndismissals of claims on the merits but were not final (and\n\ntherefore not immediately appealable as of right).            28 U.S.C. §\n\n158(a).     The bankruptcy court has authority to deny on the\n\nmerits    claims   that   are   within   its   core   authority,   and   one\n\nproceeding so listed is the voiding of fraudulent conveyances.\n\nId. § 157(b)(2)(H).       Even if for some reason the claims at issue\n\nare not within this rubric (the parties have not briefed the\n\nissue and we do not decide it), Brandt did not contest the\n\nbankruptcy court's power to dismiss on the merits, so there was\n\nalso jurisdiction by consent.

Indeed, it is\n\nseemingly    for   these     reasons     that   the   bankruptcy   court   and\n\ndistrict court resisted interlocutory review or certification.\n\nBrandt himself thought the dismissals were interlocutory at the\n\ntime the orders were entered, and no one has disputed that view.\n\nWe thus proceed on that premise, without any further effort to\n\ndevelop clear-cut rules in this difficult area.\n\n            Eventually, the district court withdrew its reference\n\nto the bankruptcy court as to various components of the case so\n\nthat it could dispose of a number of claims that required a jury\n\ntrial    (together    with    a   parallel      jury-waived    claim   against\n\nLazard).     Possibly at this time Brandt could have taken the\n\nposition that the transfer of other claims as to the defendants\n\nin question rendered final the earlier orders dismissing the\n\nfraudulent transfer claims.             In that event, Brandt would have\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fhad ten days following the termination of the reference to file\n\nan appeal in the district court challenging the dismissals.   See\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a).       However, Brandt did not follow\n\nthis course, nor did he alert the district court, as the court\n\nproceeded to try the remaining claims, that the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's dismissal of the fraudulent transfer claims remained\n\nopen to challenge in the district court.   If the district court\n\nhad been so alerted, it is unlikely that it would have ignored\n\nthe matter; and regardless of whether the district court upheld\n\nthe bankruptcy judge or reversed him and tried these claims\n\nalong with the others, there would have been a resolution of the\n\nfraudulent transfer claims by the district court that could now\n\nbe brought before us.\n\n            Following the trial, Brandt filed new trial motions\n\ndirected to the claims that had been resolved by the district\n\ncourt but again made no mention of the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaims.     Instead, after the motions were denied, Brandt filed\n\nhis appeal from the district court's judgment and then proceeded\n\nin this court to brief the dismissal of the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaims as if they were encompassed by the district court's\n\njudgment.     But, of course, the district court's judgment only\n\nresolved the claims that had been presented to the district\n\ncourt and decided by the judge or the jury.\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f           After various defendants objected to consideration of\n\nthe fraudulent transfer claims on appeal, Brandt filed a reply\n\nbrief urging that \"the entry of final judgment in the District\n\nCourt    calls       up   for     appellate        review     by    this    Court     all\n\ninterlocutory orders of which the Trustee is aggrieved, whether\n\nentered by the District Court or by the Bankruptcy Court, and\n\nthis Court therefore has jurisdiction over all aspects of this\n\nappeal.\"     Brandt also points to his earlier efforts to appeal\n\nthe dismissals as interlocutory orders and pokes fun at the\n\nnotion that there should now be an appeal of those dismissals to\n\nthe district court with appeals proceeding simultaneously before\n\nthe district court (on the fraudulent transfer claims) and\n\nbefore   this    court      (on      the    claims    already      resolved      in   the\n\ndistrict court).          None of these arguments works.\n\n           True, where the district court has made interlocutory\n\ndecisions before entering a final judgment, an appeal from the\n\nfinal judgment brings up the interlocutory decisions for review\n\nby this court.

The difficulty is that\n\nthis logic works only with respect to the interlocutory orders\n\nof the district court; the bankruptcy court, although a unit of\n\nthe   district       court,     is   a     distinct    entity      whose    orders    are\n\nappealable      to    the   district        court     under   a    set     of   detailed\n\n\n                                            -18-\n\frestrictions and time limits.           If proper and timely review is\n\nnot sought in the district court, the matter never reaches that\n\ncourt and a fortiori does not reach this court.\n\n          One could argue that the dismissal orders in question\n\nbecame   final    only    when   the    district     court   dismissed     the\n\nremaining claims against the same defendants following trial.\n\nIf so, Brandt might then have appealed the dismissal orders to\n\nthe district court, obtained a ruling and (assuming affirmance)\n\nsought to consolidate an appeal from this judgment with its\n\nprevious appeal from the judgment on issues actually tried to\n\nthe district court.       However, Brandt did not follow this course\n\neither and cannot do so now because the time limit on an appeal\n\nto the district court expired before Brandt filed his appeal in\n\nthis court.6     The failure of Brandt's case on this ground also\n\nspares us from considering various so-called \"waiver\" arguments\n\nthat some of the defendants pressed based on Brandt's failure to\n\nact earlier to raise the dismissed claims in the district court.\n\n          From    an     equitable     standpoint,    one    may   feel   some\n\nsympathy for Brandt, who was faced with poorly developed rules\n\n\n    6Fed. R. Bankr. 8002(a). This discrepancy in timing also\nforecloses any option we otherwise might have had to treat the\nappeal to us as an appeal of the bankruptcy court orders filed\nin the wrong court and to transfer the appeal to the district\ncourt based on the transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1631. Notably,\nBrandt has neither cited the transfer statute nor made any such\ntransfer request.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fon finality and who made early efforts to seek district court\n\nreview of the dismissals; it is much less easy to excuse the\n\napparent failure of Brandt to call vividly to the district\n\ncourt's attention the fact that, while that court was proceeding\n\nto try a set of claims properly before it, Brandt still desired\n\nto press other claims that the bankruptcy court had dismissed\n\nand which would almost certainly have been tried at the same\n\ntime if the district court had overturned the bankruptcy court's\n\ndismissals.\n\n            However, our inability to address the merits does not\n\nrest on an equitable objection.       Rather, it rests on the simple\n\nfact that our authority is to review judgments of the district\n\ncourt, and Brandt never secured a district court judgment on the\n\nfraudulent transfer claims nor is it apparent how he could do so\n\nnow.     Counsel for the trustee in a complicated bankruptcy case\n\nhas to make its own decisions even where the law is unclear, and\n\nthe course here followed did not preserve Brandt's claims.\n\n                 III. The Unjust Enrichment Claims\n\n            The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment rejecting\n\nclaims    of   unjust   enrichment   leveled   against   a   number   of\n\ndefendants.      Most of the grants were never reviewed by the\n\ndistrict court and are thus not before us, but Brandt did seek\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\freview by the district court of the summary judgments on these\n\ncounts in favor of J.P. Morgan and Marvin Cyker.\n\n          The district court granted Brandt leave to appeal these\n\ntwo summary judgments as interlocutory orders but nevertheless\n\naffirmed the bankruptcy court's judgments on the ground that\n\nneither J.P. Morgan nor Cyker had been shown to have committed\n\nthe \"minimal wrongdoing\" that the district court deemed required\n\nfor an unjust enrichment claim under Massachusetts law.      The\n\ndistrict court's rationale differed from those of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt:   the bankruptcy court had ruled in favor of Cyker because\n\nhe opposed the transaction, and in favor of J.P. Morgan because,\n\nas a mere recordholder, it received no direct benefit from the\n\ntransaction.\n\n          J.P. Morgan argues that Brandt is seeking to appeal\n\ndirectly to this court from the bankruptcy court rulings, which\n\nBrandt may not do.     Brandt's arguments in his opening brief\n\nsuggest that he has the same view.       But given the district\n\ncourt's affirmance and the lack of any limiting language in the\n\nnotice of appeal to this court, we are free to treat Brandt as\n\nappealing from the district judge's affirmance of these orders.\n\nSo viewed, these district court orders merged in the final\n\njudgment entered by the district court and are properly before\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fus now.

See generally\n\nRestatement of Restitution ch. 2, intro. note (1936).                   Indeed,\n\nthe   district   court    so     instructed    the   jury   on    the   unjust\n\nenrichment    claim    against    Gemini,     listing   three    elements    of\n\nunjust enrichment that the plaintiff \"must show\":\n\n           First, a benefit or enrichment was conferred\n           upon the defendant . . . ; second, the\n           retention of that benefit or enrichment\n           resulted in a detriment to [the plaintiff];\n           and, third, there are circumstances which\n           make the retention of that benefit . . .\n           unjust.\n\n           However, if, as the above suggests, the district court\n\nerred in its reason for affirming the dismissal of the claims\n\nagainst J.P. Morgan and Cyker, the error was harmless--and this\n\nis so even without reliance on the different reasons for those\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fdismissals given by the bankruptcy judge.           After receiving the\n\nabove instruction on unjust enrichment, which did not require a\n\nshowing of wrongdoing, the jury proceeded to reject on the\n\nmerits   the   claim    that   Gemini   was   unjustly   enriched   by   the\n\npayment made to Gemini in exchange for its Healthco shares.              The\n\ncounterpart claims against J.P. Morgan and Cyker were of the\n\nsame order but weaker.\n\n           Gemini      was   the   partnership   that    precipitated    the\n\noriginal abortive LBO and then actively cooperated in achieving\n\nthe second and successful one.          As noted above, after its failed\n\nattempt to take over Healthco, Gemini entered an agreement that\n\neffectively gave it power to control the nominations of three of\n\nthe seven members of Healthco's board, and the three resulting\n\nnominees were on Healthco's board, and voted for the buyout and\n\nmerger, when it approved the merger plan by a 5-2 vote.                  By\n\ncontrast, J.P. Morgan          held its shares as recordholder for\n\nothers and played no active role in the buyout, merely tendering\n\nshares in response to a public offer.          And Cyker, who later sold\n\nstock options in Healthco, opposed and voted against the buyout.\n\nIt is hard to see how a jury that found in Gemini's favor could\n\npossibly have resolved in Brandt's favor the decidedly weaker\n\nclaims against the other two defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f            The jury verdict against Gemini thus entitles us to\n\ntreat any error in the rationale for dismissing the claims\n\nagainst the other two defendants as harmless.

The Fiduciary Duty Claims\n\n            One of the claims made by Brandt charged the directors\n\nof HMD Acquisition Corp. with breaching their \"fiduciary duties\n\nto   Healthco    and     HMD    Acquisition          and    their    successors,\n\nshareholders, and creditors.\"             The bankruptcy judge dismissed\n\nthis claim on the ground that these directors owed their duties\n\nto   HMD   Acquisition    and    not    to     Healthco.      Even    though   the\n\ndefendants    also     began    to     serve    as   directors       of   Healthco\n\nbeginning on April 30, 1991, when the tender offer closed, the\n\nbankruptcy    judge    said     that    Healthco      had   by   then     \"already\n\ncommitted itself to the transaction through its prior board.\"\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fThe bankruptcy judge also said that although these were non-core\n\nclaims, he was entitled to determine them on the merits because\n\nthe parties had in effect consented to their disposition.\n\n              On April 23, 1997, the first day of the jury trial, the\n\ndistrict court announced that it was treating the bankruptcy\n\ncourt    judgment     dismissing    the     fiduciary     duty    claims    as   a\n\nproposed conclusion of law on a non-core matter, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n157(c)(1), and then said that it was accepting and adopting the\n\nbankruptcy      court's     recommendation.         In     this    court,    the\n\ndefendants argue that Brandt forfeited any appeal when he failed\n\nto object to the bankruptcy court's recommendation within ten\n\ndays of the district court's recharacterization.                   See Fed. R.\n\nBankr. P. 9033(b).          But if the bankruptcy court ruling was\n\nconverted at that time to a recommendation, there was no reason\n\nfor a further objection since the ruling was simultaneously\n\nresolved on the merits by the district court.                     The district\n\ncourt's merits resolution is merged in its final judgment and\n\nproperly before us.\n\n              Nonetheless, all this is for naught.               In his opening\n\nbrief Brandt devotes only a single paragraph to the ruling on\n\nHMD Acquisition's directors that he now seeks to reverse, saying\n\nthat    any   claim   for   duty   breached    by   the    directors    of   HMD\n\nAcquisition \"survived the merger.\"           Brandt's terse argument does\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fnot attempt to address the lower courts' ruling that there was\n\nno breach of any fiduciary duty to Healthco when the critical\n\ndecision was taken.           Brandt's effort to offer new arguments in\n\nhis reply brief, after the defendants filed their answering\n\nbriefs, comes too late.           Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579946\"><a href=\"/opinion/579946/juan-rivera-muriente-v-juan-agosto-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                              V. Discovery Matters\n\n              Brandt    argues   that    the   bankruptcy   court   committed\n\nreversible error in various discovery rulings.                None of these\n\nrulings was formally appealed to the district court.                 However,\n\nduring a pre-trial telephone conference on February 14, 1997,\n\nthe district court judge indicated that he was aware of the\n\nbankruptcy judge's discovery orders and was reluctant to disturb\n\nthem,   but    would    nonetheless      \"allow   some   minimum    amount    of\n\nfurther pretrial discovery.\"             To the extent that the district\n\ncourt did modify the bankruptcy court's discovery orders, the\n\nmodified orders are obviously before us for review.\n\n              The jurisdictional issue is more debatable as to the\n\ndiscovery      orders    of    the   bankruptcy     court   that    were     not\n\ndisturbed.       Perhaps the district court's statements could be\n\nregarded as an implicit affirmance of those orders (or at least\n\nsome of them) on interlocutory appeal; if so, the affirmance\n\nwould be merged into the final judgment and properly before us.\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fWe will assume this is so arguendo since it does not alter the\n\nresult.\n\n            The most controversial of the bankruptcy judge's orders\n\nis that of June 20, 1996, which limited each side to ten\n\ndepositions as of right, in accordance with Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 30(a)(2), with the remaining depositions to be\n\nconducted from September through December 1996.              Brandt had\n\nalready taken four depositions and was therefore allowed only\n\nsix more under the order.        But the order also provided that\n\nfurther depositions could be taken with leave of the court and\n\nin accordance with the general principles set forth in Rule\n\n26(b)(2).      Brandt,   who   had   planned   to   take   sixty   or   so\n\nadditional depositions, immediately asked the bankruptcy judge\n\nto remove any limit or at least to allow dozens of depositions,\n\nand the bankruptcy judge refused.\n\n            On December 17, 1996, Brandt asked permission to take\n\nadditional depositions and for a one-month extension of the\n\ndeposition deadline.     Although Brandt identified 19 additional\n\nindividuals and the subjects in question, the bankruptcy judge\n\ndenied the motion, saying that it came only two weeks before the\n\nlong-established deadline, a year-and-a-half after the complaint\n\nwas filed, and two-and-a-half years after the trustee began\n\ninvestigation.     The court said it was not impressed with the\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fneed for the depositions and that \"[p]ermitting the requested\n\ndepositions [would] unnecessarily increase counsel's fees and\n\n[would] more likely delay the trial scheduled to begin April 7,\n\n1997.\"\n\n            Brandt then sought but was denied leave by the district\n\ncourt for an immediate appeal.           But, thereafter, in a pre-trial\n\nconference on February 14, 1997, the district court allowed each\n\nside to take an additional 20 hours of depositions before trial.\n\nAt a further pre-trial hearing on March 17, 1997, Brandt asked\n\nfor   an   adjournment      of   the   April    trial    to   allow      for   more\n\ndepositions;     but    after      learning     that    the    20     additional\n\ndeposition hours had not yet been exhausted, the district court\n\nrejected the adjournment motion.                Later, the court granted\n\nBrandt two additional depositions during the trial.\n\n            Discovery decisions by the bankruptcy judge or district\n\ncourt are reviewed for abuse of discretion, and the discretion\n\nin this area is very broad, recognizing that an appeals court\n\nsimply cannot manage the intricate process of discovery from a\n\ndistance.    In Modern Continental/Obayashi v. Occupational Safety\n\n& Health Review Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766720\"><a href=\"/opinion/766720/modern-continentalobayashi-a-joint-venture-v-occupational-safety-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (1st Cir. 1999), this\n\ncourt    spoke   of   the   need   for   \"a    clear    showing     of   manifest\n\ninjustice,\" saying that, to warrant reversal, the lower court's\n\ndiscovery order must be \"plainly wrong\" and must be shown to\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fhave resulted in \"substantial prejudice\" to the complaining\n\nparty.    Although at first blush the limitations imposed by the\n\nbankruptcy judge seem severe, even when somewhat modified by the\n\ndistrict court, there is more to the story.\n\n            Brandt       devotes    almost    ten   pages    of   his     brief    to\n\nexplaining that the case involves a large amount of money and\n\nmany parties and that none of the defendants registered any\n\nobjection    to    his    original    proposal      to    take    sixty    or   more\n\ndepositions.        Of    course,    the   lack     of   objection     from     other\n\nparties   is      not    dispositive;      the    bankruptcy      judge    had     an\n\nindependent responsibility to manage the litigation and conserve\n\nthe resources of the estate.               But the size and scope of the\n\nlitigation might well have provided a basis for justifying a\n\ngreater number of depositions than was allowed.\n\n            However, the bankruptcy judge did not say that only ten\n\ndepositions were permitted.            Obviously concerned with the slow\n\npace and mounting expense of discovery, he held the plaintiff's\n\nfeet to the fire to move quickly and then justify any additional\n\nrequests for depositions on a case-specific basis.                    In fact, the\n\norder fixing the ten-deposition limit referred to Federal Rules'\n\nprovisions     setting      the    criteria      for     justifying     additional\n\ndiscovery.     Thus, the bankruptcy judge's order is not quite the\n\narbitrary limit that Brandt suggests.\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\f              The more troubling aspect is the bankruptcy court's\n\nrefusal    in    December     1996    to    extend    the    deadline      and   allow\n\nfurther       depositions.       Brandt's      request       at    that    time     was\n\nreasonably detailed as to proposed deponents and the subject\n\nmatter for questioning.          It is hard to lean too heavily on the\n\nbankruptcy judge's brief statement that he was \"not impressed\n\nwith the critical nature of the dispositions.\"                       And while the\n\ndistrict       judge   effectively         allowed    another       four    or     five\n\ndepositions, this was far short of what Brandt had sought even\n\nin December.\n\n              However we might otherwise feel about the severe limit\n\non depositions--and it would take a more detailed examination of\n\nthe record for us to make a final judgment--Brandt's opening\n\nbrief    is    virtually     devoid    of    any     showing      that    Brandt    was\n\nprejudiced.       In the entire ten-page discussion there is only a\n\nsingle elliptical sentence describing a specific witness.                          Even\n\nthis    discussion     does    not    make    clear    why    Brandt      thinks    the\n\nwitness was so vital.         Thus there is no reason to think that the\n\noutcome of the case was affected by the limit on depositions.\n\n              Brandt says that this is a catch 22, since one can\n\nnever be sure what further discovery might have adduced.                         While\n\nthis (standard) argument has some force, it is not conclusive:\n\nboth in justifying discovery and in explaining later why a\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\frefusal to allow it caused harm, lawyers are accustomed to\n\nshowing specifically just what gaps in their claim and defense\n\nmight be filled by evidence within the likely knowledge of the\n\nwitness.   And it is just such specifics that are absent from\n\nBrandt's opening brief.   Indeed, the trial being over, it should\n\nhave been even easier than before or at trial for Brandt to\n\nexplain just where he thinks that additional depositions could\n\nhave filled any apparent gaps in the case presented.\n\n           In his reply brief, Brandt does make a broader, but at\n\nthe same time better supported, showing that he was expected to\n\nconduct too much discovery within too brief a time frame when\n\none takes into account both depositions and the huge number of\n\ndocuments to be sorted and analyzed.    But Brandt's time frame\n\nmay be an artificial one; there is some reason to think that he\n\ncould have made more progress at an earlier stage and that he\n\nmoved too slowly even after the initial discovery deadline was\n\nset in June 1996.7   But we need not resolve this point, since,\n\n\n    7Brandt says that he had insufficient time to conduct\ndiscovery between June 1996 (when the case management order was\nadopted) and December 1996 (the scheduled end of discovery), as\nwell as insufficient time for additional discovery before trial\nin April 1997.   However, Brandt became Healthco's trustee in\nOctober 1993, filed his complaint in June 1995, and had\npossession of many of the documents that he complains he had\ninsufficient time to review long before June 1996. Further, in\nthe six months between the case management order and his motion\nfor   additional  depositions,   Brandt   conducted  only   six\ndepositions.\n\n                               -31-\n\fas we have already noted, arguments first developed in a reply\n\nbrief come too late.       Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 354.\n\n            Brandt's second claim of discovery error concerns the\n\nfailure of Coopers & Lybrand to produce documents from Coopers'\n\nforeign offices relating to its review of Healthco's year-end\n\nfinancial statements for 1990.        The unsecured creditors earlier\n\nsought to     obtain these and other papers from Coopers, see Fed.\n\nR.   Bankr.   P.   2004,   and   Brandt   and   Coopers   agreed   on   the\n\nproduction of certain of these documents, but apparently Coopers\n\nfailed to produce documents from its foreign offices.              Yet it\n\nwas not until February 20, 1997, less than two months before the\n\nscheduled trial date and six months after the bankruptcy court's\n\ndeadline for document discovery, that Brandt filed an expedited\n\nmotion with the bankruptcy court to obtain the audit-related\n\npapers from Coopers.\n\n            Although Brandt now offers an explanation as to why\n\nthese papers were necessary, the request originally filed in the\n\nbankruptcy court merely asserted that Brandt \"need[ed] to review\n\nall C & L memoranda and audit workpapers regarding Healthco's\n\nforeign subsidiaries in order to prepare properly his case for\n\ntrial.\"   And, not surprisingly, the bankruptcy court denied the\n\nmotion without explanation about a week after it was filed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\f          There is no indication that Brandt then brought the\n\nmatter   to     the    attention       of      the     district     court    by    an\n\ninterlocutory        appeal;    nor    does       it   appear   that,   as     trial\n\napproached,     he    ever     asked    the    district     court    for    belated\n\ndocument discovery against Coopers, which might conceivably have\n\nbeen justified if a new need arose at the last minute.                       In any\n\nevent, Brandt apparently never gave the bankruptcy judge the\n\nexplanation he now gives us as to why the papers from Coopers'\n\nforeign subsidiaries were necessary.                   Faced only with a bland\n\nand   belated    statement       that       the    papers   were     needed,      the\n\nbankruptcy court acted within its discretion in denying the\n\nrequested discovery.\n\n          Finally, Brandt says that the bankruptcy court erred\n\nin refusing to permit him to discover the identity of the\n\nbeneficial owners of the Healthco shares that were tendered by\n\nJ.P. Morgan and Chancellor.            Brandt argues that this information\n\nwas necessary so that Brandt could direct its unjust enrichment\n\nclaims against those who actually benefitted from the $15 per\n\nshare buyout of Healthco stock.                   This point takes on added\n\nsignificance because the bankruptcy court relied on the fact\n\nthat J.P. Morgan and Chancellor were merely recordholders in\n\ndismissing the unjust enrichment claims against them.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\f          Brandt    attempts   to     show   that   the   denial   of   an\n\nopportunity to discover beneficial ownership was based on the\n\nbankruptcy court's misconstrual of its own orders.               However,\n\nthere is no indication that a ruling on this discovery issue was\n\never sought from the district court.            In any case, the jury\n\nrejected the unjust enrichment claims directed at defendants who\n\nwere both stockholders and active in promoting the LBO; it is\n\nvery hard to see how Brandt could have expected a more favorable\n\nresult if he had unearthed the names of passive beneficial\n\nstockholders for whom record ownership was held in the name of\n\nJ.P. Morgan or Chancellor.\n\n                     VI. Conduct of the Trial\n\n          Brandt objects to a set of alleged errors occurring\n\nduring the course of the trial and says that the errors and\n\nmisconduct   of   defense   counsel   fatally   tainted    the   verdict.\n\nSpecifically, Brandt objects to references to settlements with\n\nother defendants, admission of an expert's testimony and report,\n\ntime limits imposed by the trial judge, restrictions on the\n\n\"publication\" of documents to the jury, and comments or evidence\n\ndesigned to paint the trustee or the trustee's counsel in a bad\n\nlight.   We consider the claims of error in the order in which\n\nBrandt has briefed them.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f           First, citing McInnis v. A.M.F., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454262\"><a href=\"/opinion/454262/patricia-j-mcinnis-v-amf-inc-patricia-j-mcinnis-v-amf-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1st Cir. 1985), Brandt complains of references to settlements\n\nBrandt reached with other defendants.         In McInnis, this court\n\nconstrued broadly Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which excludes\n\nsettlements when offered to prove the validity or invalidity of\n\na claim.   Id. at 246-48.    There, the plaintiff, the victim in a\n\nmotorcycle accident, had sued the manufacturers (for making a\n\ndefective product); the plaintiff had also previously obtained\n\na settlement paid on behalf of the driver of a car that had hit\n\nthe motorcycle, and the trial court admitted evidence of the\n\nsettlement to show that the accident had been caused by the\n\ndriver of the car rather than the faulty manufacture of the\n\nmotorcycle.    Id.   at   241-42.   McInnis    held   that   using   the\n\nsettlement agreement to show causation amounted to using it to\n\nshow the invalidity of a claim, and found that the error in\n\nadmitting evidence of the settlement required a new trial.           Id.\n\nat 246-48.\n\n           Here, Brandt says that one of the defendant's opening\n\nstatements at trial mentioned Brandt's settlements with other\n\nparties.   However, the passages that Brandt identifies refer not\n\nto settlements but to the fact that Brandt had initially sued 69\n\npeople or businesses.     The thrust was not that other defendants\n\nhad settled (and were therefore the real perpetrators) but\n\n\n                                -35-\n\frather that Brandt was a plaintiff who sued everyone in sight\n\nregardless of whether the individual defendant was responsible.\n\nThis    was    not   an   offer    of   proof    of,   or   a    reference     to,   a\n\nsettlement, which is what Rule 408 and McInnis are concerned\n\nwith.\n\n              Some of Brandt's discussion of this issue suggests that\n\nhe is concerned not so much with the inference of settlement,\n\nbut     with the inference that a large number of parties were\n\nresponsible for the transaction but the blame has been unfairly\n\nfocused on the few remaining at trial.                          While this was a\n\npossible inference, it is not clear that, in this respect, the\n\ncomments complained of were very helpful to the defendants;\n\nindeed,       they   might   rather     have    suggested       that    the   parties\n\nremaining at trial were those most responsible.                        In any event,\n\nthe trustee makes no substantial effort to make a real showing\n\nof prejudice.\n\n              Brandt also refers in his brief to a closing argument\n\nby defense counsel insinuating that the proof offered in the\n\ntrial    of    negligence     by    Coopers     &   Lybrand      \"undermines      the\n\nintegrity of the case against the defendants in this courtroom.\"\n\nWhether or not the inference is a fair one, once again it has\n\nnothing to do with settlement, there having been affirmative\n\nevidence against Coopers & Lybrand offered during the trial\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fitself.      It   is   worth   adding   that   the   first   references   to\n\nsettlement were made not by defendants but by Brandt's counsel.\n\nCf. Willco Kuwait (Trading) S.A.K. v. deSavary, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n625 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Second, Brandt says that the district court erred in\n\npermitting the defendants to call Robert W. Berliner--Brandt's\n\naccounting expert--to examine him about portions of a report he\n\nhad prepared for Brandt.          The disputed portion of the report\n\nconcerns Berliner's conclusion that Coopers had negligently\n\nperformed the Healthco audit for 1990; the implication, which\n\ndefendants hoped would be drawn, was that Coopers and not the\n\ndefendants at trial bore responsibility for the unhappy outcome\n\nof the LBO.       Brandt made a timely objection that the report was\n\nhearsay and now says that evidence regarding it was highly\n\nprejudicial and should have been excluded under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.\n\n          Brandt expressly admits in his opening brief that the\n\ndefendants had \"a right to argue that Coopers was the cause of\n\nthe failure of Healthco,\" but objects that the defendants were\n\nobliged to prove this through their own evidence and expert\n\nwitnesses.    The latter is an overstatement:         at Brandt's behest,\n\nBerliner gave testimony arguably implying that Coopers did not\n\nbear responsibility for the failure of Healthco, so he certainly\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\fcould be cross-examined and impeached on this issue.                    Whether\n\nthe   Berliner    report   was    admissible    as    the   admission    of    an\n\nopposing party, and therefore admissible not just to impeach but\n\nas proof of the facts asserted in it, is a different question\n\nwhich the district court resolved in favor of the defendants.\n\n           The    district   court,       supported    on    appeal     by    the\n\ndefendants, viewed the report as an admission of Brandt through\n\nan agent (the expert) acting within the scope of his agency, and\n\ntherefore found it admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n801(d)(2)(D).     Since the report was prepared by Berliner during\n\nhis work for Brandt, it might at first blush seem to fit\n\ncomfortably within this rule, assuming always that Berliner\n\ncould be regarded as an agent for this purpose.               Some authority\n\npoints in this direction but the Third Circuit emphatically\n\ndisagrees, saying that an expert is more like an independent\n\ncontractor offering his own opinion and is not \"controlled\" by\n\nthe party who employs him.

Prior to introducing in evidence\n\nthe   pertinent    portion   of    the    report,    the    defendants   asked\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fBerliner    questions       and    elicited         statements         from    him     as    to\n\nCooper's actions that covered more or less the same ground as\n\nthe report.        As noted above, the defendants' questions were\n\npermissible cross-examination.                    The resulting statements--not\n\nunexpected       unless   Berliner          was    prepared       to    contradict          his\n\nreport--were       in-court       statements        not     subject      to     a    hearsay\n\nobjection.         Accordingly,         even       if    the    report        itself    were\n\nobjectionable, any error in its admission is rendered harmless\n\nby the questioning of Berliner.

Brandt       agrees    that       whether\n\nCoopers    was    careless      was     a    pertinent         issue    and    Berliner's\n\ntestimony and report were directed to that question.                                No doubt\n\nthe testimony had more impact because it came from Brandt's own\n\nexpert, but the expert was one whom Brandt himself had called to\n\ntestify    at    trial    and     who       had    given       testimony       that    might\n\notherwise have led the jury to believe that Coopers was not at\n\nfault.    Assuming a Rule 403               objection to the Berliner evidence\n\nwas preserved, it was not error under Rule 403 to allow the\n\nevidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -39-\n\f             Third, Brandt objects, in the caption of one section\n\nof   his     opening   brief,       to    the    district      court's   placing\n\n\"unreasonable pre-determined time limitations upon the trial,\"\n\ni.e.,   60    hours.       Then--in      the    body    of   the   discussion--he\n\ndevelops two arguments:            that defense counsel manipulated the\n\ntime limits to Brandt's disadvantage (naming witnesses, forcing\n\nBrandt to reserve some of his time to cross-examine them, and\n\nthen not calling those witnesses); and that the district court\n\npromised Brandt that he could use all of his otherwise unused\n\ntime for his closing argument but then limited him to four and\n\na half hours when he still had ten hours remaining.\n\n             How   trial    time    should      be     limited--obviously    some\n\nlimitations are appropriate--raises interesting problems, see\n\nBorges v.

The related suggestion that defense\n\ncounsel manipulated the time limits by listing witnesses who\n\nwere not called is mentioned in a single sentence, is not\n\nseriously supported, and is therefore waived.

Brandt describes a colloquy during the trial where the\n\ndistrict court allegedly \"prohibited the Trustee's counsel from\n\npublishing to the jury relevant portions of voluminous documents\n\nthat had been received in evidence\"; and Brandt then quotes his\n\ncounsel as asking the court whether it was \"going to impose any\n\nlimitation on the time of closing assuming I still have it\n\navailable in my allotted hours.\"         Brandt's brief then quotes the\n\ncourt as saying:     \"You can have any length of closing.\"\n\n            The trial transcript shows that the district court\n\nnever made an unconditional promise to allow Brandt to use any\n\nunused time in closing argument.          The district court said, \"You\n\ncan have any length of closing as long as--\" and was then\n\ninterrupted by Brandt's counsel who said, \"Then that solves a\n\n\n\n     8\n     A similar lack of development marks Brandt's suggestion, in\nthe \"Issues Presented\" portion of his opening brief, that the\ndistrict court erred in imposing a time penalty after Brandt\nmade an unsuccessful motion.\n\n                                   -41-\n\flot of my problem.\"        Shortly before the close of evidence, the\n\ncourt made clear that it did not intend to allow Brandt to make\n\na ten-hour closing argument even though he still had ten hours\n\nleft on his clock and, despite a pro forma protest, Brandt then\n\nsuggested four and a half hours and made no effort to show that\n\nthis would prejudice him or that he could not present the\n\nsubstance of his case in this time frame.        In the end he elected\n\nto use less in order to complete his argument within one day.\n\n            Providing no specifics, Brandt intimates that he was\n\nsomehow     limited   in   his   ability   to   publish   documents   or\n\ndeposition transcript evidence to the jury during trial and that\n\nhe hoped to use the closing argument to read portions of this\n\nevidence to the jury.       In fact, the trial transcript shows that\n\nBrandt published a great deal of such evidence during the trial,\n\nand the colloquy to which he refers to show that he was limited\n\nactually appears to have been concerned with how the materials\n\nwere presented, the district court having objected to Brandt's\n\ncounsel reading deposition pages at length to the jury while\n\npurporting to question the witness.        Once again, Brandt's brief\n\npoints to no specific material, let alone material of vital\n\nimportance, that he was effectively prevented from publishing to\n\nthe jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\f            Fourth, Brandt argues that during the course of the\n\ntrial,    some   defense     counsel    made     arguments       or   introduced\n\nevidence besmirching the character of the trustee by suggesting\n\nthat he was in the business of acting as a trustee for many\n\nbankrupt companies, that he received fees based on the amount of\n\nmoney he collected, that in the past he had sued many defendants\n\non claims like the ones pressed here, that he hired his own\n\ncompany to provide administrative services to the estate, and so\n\non.      These   charges,     says   Brandt,     were    irrelevant     and   (if\n\nmarginally relevant in some respects) far more prejudicial than\n\nis proper under Rule 403.\n\n            Brandt's complaints would have more force if he had not\n\ninvited many of these \"charges\" by the claims that his counsel\n\nmade     during opening argument, claims later echoed by Brandt\n\nhimself when he briefly appeared as a witness.                   In opening to\n\nthe jury, Brandt's counsel sought to paint a picture of the\n\ntrustee as essentially a neutral party engaged in a quasi-\n\nofficial    function:         counsel     said    that     the    trustee     was\n\n\"supervised\"     by   the    bankruptcy     judge,   was   \"a    disinterested\n\nparty\" and would not \"get to keep any of the money [from a\n\nverdict] himself.\"      Later, Brandt himself told the jury that the\n\nmoney    recovered    from    defendants     would   be    \"disseminated\"      to\n\nHealthco's creditors. During cross-examination, Brandt conceded\n\n\n                                     -43-\n\fthat the trustee would receive \"a commission\" from litigation\n\nproceeds based on a percentage formula.             See 11 U.S.C. § 326(a).\n\n            But even assuming that counsel for the trustee did not\n\nprovoke defense counsel's responses, and that one or more of the\n\ndefense counsel went too far in some of their remarks, the trial\n\njudge addressed the issue appropriately.                After concluding that\n\nthe   comments     were   improper,      the    judge   rebuked    counsel    and\n\ndirected the jury to disregard the comments.               It is our practice\n\nto presume that such instructions are followed, unless the\n\nevidence is hopelessly sure to warp the jury's judgment.                  Conde\n\nv.
