Senior District Judge Martin F. Loughlin, who\r\n\npresided over the related criminal case, found the statements\r\n\nto have  been  \"totally false,\"  \"misleading,\"  \"outrageous,\"\r\n\n\"self-serving\"  and  \"unfair.\"     In   this  civil   action,\r\n\nMagistrate  Judge  Lovegreen  and  District  Judge Mary  Lisi\r\n\nagreed with  Judge Loughlin's condemnation,  adding that  the\r\n\ndefendants'  conduct  showed \"extraordinarily  poor judgment\"\r\n\nand was  \"lacking in  professionalism.\"  The  district court,\r\n\nhowever, dismissed  the Aversas' lawsuit, finding  that Walsh\r\n\nand Claunch were  absolutely immune from suit  for the common\r\n\nlaw  torts,   and  qualifiedly  immune  from   suit  for  the\r\n\nconstitutional tort. \r\n\n          The purpose of immunity -- absolute or qualified --\r\n\nis  not   to  protect  erring  federal   officials  from  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nconsequences of  their injurious  acts, but to  safeguard the\r\n\npublic interest in having responsible  governmental employees\r\n\nfaithfully carry out their  duties without fear of protracted\r\n\nlitigation in unfounded damage suits.

In\r                                 \r\n\nobvious  tension  with that  objective  is that  well-founded\r\n\ndamage  suits  promote  the public  interest  in compensating\r\n\nvictims and deterring unlawful conduct.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                        I.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Except  where otherwise noted,  the following facts\r\n\nare taken from Aversa's  complaint.  Daniel Aversa (\"Aversa\")\r\n\nand  Vincent Mento  (\"Mento\") were  partners in  a legitimate\r\n\nreal  estate  business.1   In January  of  1989, they  sold a\r\n\nparcel  of land, splitting the  proceeds.  At  the same time,\r\n\nAversa  was experiencing marital  difficulties with  his wife\r\n\nCarla.   In order to conceal some of his assets from his wife\r\n\nin  the event of  a divorce, Aversa  asked Mento if  he could\r\n\ndeposit his share of the proceeds, amounting to $55,000, into\r\n\nMento's personal bank account.  Mento agreed.  \r\n\n          Both  men   were  aware  that   domestic  financial\r\n\ninstitutions were required to report currency transactions in\r\n\nexcess  of $10,000 to the  Secretary of the  Treasury, see 31\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Vincent and Shirley Mento  were plaintiffs in this action\r\nbut did not pursue an appeal.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nU.S.C.   5313(a);  31 C.F.R.    103.22(a)(1),  and wished  to\r\n\navoid  causing a  Currency Transaction  Report (\"CTR\")  to be\r\n\nfiled.   Aversa  therefore  made a  series  of deposits  into\r\n\nMento's  account in sums just  under $10,000.2   At the time,\r\n\nAversa was unaware that structuring the transactions to avoid\r\n\ncausing a CTR to be filed was a crime under federal law.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n31 U.S.C.   5324(a).\r\n\n          In June  of 1990,  IRS agents contacted  Aversa and\r\n\ninformed him that he  was under investigation for structuring\r\n\ndeposits.   He immediately  met with Assistant  United States\r\n\nAttorney  Walsh, and  without an attorney  present, explained\r\n\nthat he was  hiding the money from his wife,  that it was not\r\n\nderived from an illegal source, and that he did not know that\r\n\nstructuring was illegal.  Walsh told Aversa that he and Mento\r\n\nhad been under investigation for some time and that he had no\r\n\nreason to  believe the  money was  anything but \"clean,\"  but\r\n\nsaid that he did not  need to prove that it was  derived from\r\n\nan illegal  source or that  Aversa knew that  structuring was\r\n\nillegal.  Walsh told  Aversa that there was no reason to seek\r\n\ncounsel and encouraged  him to plead guilty because  all that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Aversa's  purpose in  transferring the  money out  of his\r\naccount was to conceal it from his wife, a purpose  we do not\r\ncondone.   But Judge  Loughlin found  that  Aversa and  Mento\r\nwished  to avoid a CTR  being filed because  they believed it\r\nwould  cause  the  Internal  Revenue Service  to  hold  Mento\r\nresponsible  for the taxes on the amount, and that Aversa and\r\nMento  each reported his share of the proceeds on his own tax\r\nreturn.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nwas needed for  a conviction  was what Aversa  had just  told\r\n\nhim.   In a later  meeting with Aversa's  counsel, Walsh said\r\n\nthat  he  previously  had  been  successful  in   prosecuting\r\n\nindividuals  for structuring  in  Miami, but  that this  case\r\n\nwould be his first involving \"clean money,\" and he planned to\r\n\nuse it to \"set a precedent\" and \"educate the public about the\r\n\ncurrency transaction reporting requirements.\"\r\n\n          On  June  28, 1990,  Walsh  obtained  an indictment\r\n\ncharging  Aversa and Mento  with conspiracy, structuring, and\r\n\nmaking false statements, and  Aversa alone with attempting to\r\n\ncause  a  domestic financial  institution  to  file a  report\r\n\ncontaining a material omission or misstatement of fact.  That\r\n\nsame day, Walsh, Claunch, and the United States Attorney  for\r\n\nthe District of  New Hampshire, Jeffrey R.  Howard (with whom\r\n\nAversa alleged  Walsh and Claunch  conspired but who  was not\r\n\njoined  as a  defendant) issued  a press  release and  held a\r\n\npress conference  announcing to  the local and  national news\r\n\nmedia, which  reported to the  public, that Aversa  and Mento\r\n\nhad been arrested  for money laundering.   Walsh and  Claunch\r\n\nknew  that Aversa and  Mento were not  involved in laundering\r\n\nillegally-gotten money,  or in drug trafficking,  tax evasion\r\n\nor  organized crime,  but  created the  impression that  they\r\n\nwere.   An article in  the Boston Globe dated  June 29, 1990,\r\n\nreported:  \r\n\n          Walsh  said  money laundering  is usually\r\n          done  for purposes  of tax  evasion, drug\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          dealing or organized crime.  He would not\r\n          say if either of  yesterday's indictments\r\n          are  related  to  these  activities,  but\r\n          added  after the news conference that \"it\r\n          would  be   a  fair  statement\"   to  say\r\n          authorities are looking into  how [these]\r\n          men amassed the sums of money involved.\r\n\nWalsh  also stated  that Aversa  faced up  to forty  years in\r\n\nprison and  added that  the investigation was  continuing and\r\n\nmore charges would be filed.\r\n\n          A front-page article  in the Concord Monitor  dated\r\n\nJune 29, 1990 reported:\r\n\n          The   indictments   are   a   sign   that\r\n          prosecutors are serious  about using  the\r\n          money laundering laws, a tool that allows\r\n          them  to charge people for handling money\r\n          illegally  without  having to  prove that\r\n          the  money  was  gained  illegally,  said\r\n          Jeffrey Howard, U.S.A.  attorney for  New\r\n          Hampshire.\r\n\n          \"The  indictments  are important  because\r\n          they are  examples of the  commitment the\r\n          I.R.S.  has made .  . . to  use the money\r\n          laundering  statutes  in order  to ferret\r\n          out  tax  evasion,  drug trafficking  and\r\n          other crimes,\" he said.\r\n\n          Prosecutors  declined  to say  how Aversa\r\n          and  Mento  got  the  money or  why  they\r\n          believe   the  men  tried  to  evade  the\r\n          currency laws.\r\n\n          Claunch  stated  at   the  press  conference   that\r\n\n\"[t]hese  cases represent  the IRS's commitment  to ferreting\r\n\nout money launderers,\"  and that  the IRS wanted  \"to send  a\r\n\nmessage  that  money  laundering  is going  to  be  detected,\r\n\ninvestigated and prosecuted to the full extent.\"  \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          On October 10,  1990, after Judge Loughlin  granted\r\n\nthe government's motion in limine to preclude a defense based\r                                             \r\n\non ignorance of the  anti-structuring law, Aversa pled guilty\r\n\nto structuring.  The plea agreement stipulated:\r\n\n          1.   The  United  States has  no evidence\r\n          that  the  currency  involved   in  these\r\n          transactions   was   obtained   from   an\r\n          unlawful source.\r\n\n          2.   The  United  States has  no evidence\r\n          that   the   defendant   knew    of   the\r\n          structuring provision, but states  to the\r\n          Court   that   such   knowledge  is   not\r\n          necessary  to  establish  a violation  of\r\n          Section 5324.\r\n\nAversa  reserved his right to  appeal the issue  of whether a\r\n\nconviction  under 31  U.S.C.    5324 required  knowledge that\r\n\nstructuring is illegal.  \r\n\n          On October 17, 1990, following  Mento's conviction,\r\n\nWalsh  issued a  press release  in which  he stated  that the\r\n\ncurrency  transaction  reporting  laws  and  the   laws  that\r\n\nprohibit   structuring  \"were   passed   to  assist   in  the\r\n\ninvestigation  of related criminal conduct, such as narcotics\r\n\ntrafficking,  organized crime  and racketeering  activity and\r\n\ntax  violations,\" and  that these  convictions would  send \"a\r\n\nstrong clear message that persons who violate . . . and evade\r\n\nthose laws  will be vigorously prosecuted.\"   Walsh made oral\r\n\nstatements to the press stating  and implying that Aversa and\r\n\nMento  had  violated the  anti-structuring  law  in order  to\r\n\nfurther  an  underlying criminal  enterprise,  and that  they\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncould  not  account for  some of  the  money involved  in the\r\n\nstructured  transactions.   No evidence  had been  adduced at\r\n\nMento's trial  that there was an  underlying criminal purpose\r\n\nor that the source of the money  was unexplained.\r\n\n          At Aversa's and Mento's sentencing,  Judge Loughlin\r\n\nfound  that Aversa  and Mento  would bear  the stigma  of the\r\n\n\"totally false\" innuendoes reported in the media for the rest\r\n\nof their lives.   In a memorandum opinion ruling  on Aversa's\r\n\nand  Mento's post-conviction motions,3  the judge  noted that\r\n\nthe government had admitted  that Aversa and Mento  were \"not\r\n\ninvolved in drugs and not laundering ill-gotten gains and not\r\n\nkeeping information  from the United States,\"  and found that\r\n\nthe prosecutors' statements to the press were \"outrageous and\r\n\nunfair,\" \"misleading and cruel,\"  \"self-serving and more than\r\n\na little disingenuous,\" and  \"smeared the reputation of these\r\n\ntwo men.\"  \r\n\n          This   court   vacated    Aversa's   and    Mento's\r\n\nconvictions, ruling that  the willfulness requirement  of the\r\n\napplicable criminal penalty provision,  31 U.S.C.    5322(a),\r\n\nrequired the  government to  prove the violation  of a  known\r\n\nlegal duty  or the  reckless disregard  thereof, and  that an\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

The case was\r\n\ntransferred  from  the  District  of  New  Hampshire  to  the\r\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island.   Pursuant to the Federal Employees\r\n\nLiability Reform and Tort  Compensation Act of 1988, commonly\r\n\nknown  as the  Westfall Act,  the Attorney  General certified\r\n\nthat  Walsh  and  Claunch  acted within  the  scope  of their\r\n\nfederal  employment and the  United States  was provisionally\r\n\nsubstituted as the party defendant.   28 U.S.C.   2679(d)(1).\r\n\nAversa  was permitted to depose  Walsh and Claunch  in aid of\r\n\nhis challenge  to the  scope certification, and  he submitted\r\n\nthe  depositions   and  various   exhibits  to   the  court.5\r\n\nThereafter, Magistrate  Judge Lovegreen ruled that  Walsh and\r\n\nClaunch  were acting  within the  scope of  their employment,\r\n\nthus converting the common law claims into claims against the\r\n\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2679(d)(1),  1346(b), then  recommended that those  claims be\r\n\ndismissed for  lack of  subject matter jurisdiction  based on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The  exhibits included  copies  of  press releases  dated\r\nJune 28,  1990, and  October  17, 1990,  a newspaper  article\r\ndated  June 29,  1990,  a transcript  of Aversa's  sentencing\r\nhearing  on  March  14,  1991,  Judge  Loughlin's  memorandum\r\nopinion dated April 29, 1991,  ruling on Aversa's and Mento's\r\nmotions  for writ  of coram  nobis, Chapter  7 of  the United\r                                              \r\nStates Attorneys' Manual (1988), 28 C.F.R.   50.2, Rule 35 of\r\nthe Local  New Hampshire District Court  Rules, Claunch's job\r\ndescription,   and  an  Internal   Revenue  Policy  Statement\r\nconcerning news coverage.  \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nthe  exception  to the  Federal  Tort Claims  Act  for claims\r\n\narising  out of  libel  or slander.    28 U.S.C.     2680(h).\r\n\nTreating the defendants' motion to dismiss the constitutional\r\n\nclaim as a motion for summary judgment, the magistrate  judge\r\n\nrecommended summary judgment in favor of Walsh and Claunch on\r\n\nthe basis that they were qualifiedly immune.\r\n\n          Magistrate Judge Lovegreen stated in his Report and\r\n\nRecommendation  that  he was  in  full  agreement with  Judge\r\n\nLoughlin's  assessment of the  defendants' conduct, and added\r\n\nthat the \"defendants' extraordinarily poor judgment in making\r\n\nthese statements should  not go unnoticed.\"  In  adopting the\r\n\nmagistrate's  Report  and  Recommendation  in  its  entirety,\r\n\nUnited  States  District  Judge  Mary  Lisi  found  that  the\r\n\ndefendants'  \"publication  of  misleading  information  [was]\r\n\nlacking in professionalism  and deserving  of the  opprobrium\r\n\narticulated by Judge Loughlin and Magistrate Lovegreen.\"\r\n\n                       II.

The Common Law Claims\r\n\n          As   an  initial  matter,  the  Aversas'  complaint\r\n\ndescribes  a claim for slander under New Hampshire law, which\r\n\ndefines the tort as follows:\r\n\n          In order to  be actionable, the  language\r\n          complained  of  must  tend to  lower  the\r\n          plaintiff   in   the   esteem    of   any\r\n          substantial  and respectable  group, even\r\n          though it may be quite a small  minority.\r\n          The  defamatory meaning must  be one that\r\n          could be ascribed to the words by hearers\r\n          of common and reasonable understanding. .\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          .  .  The threshold  question  .  . .  is\r\n          whether the published  words are  capable\r\n          of  conveying  the defamatory  meaning or\r\n          innuendo   ascribed   to   them  by   the\r\n          plaintiff.\r\n\nThomson v.

We agree  with the\r\n\ndistrict  court (and  the  Aversas do  not contest)  that the\r\n\nclaims for  intentional infliction of emotional  distress and\r\n\nloss of  consortium through  \"verbal abuse and  slander\" also\r\n\n\"arose  out of\"  slander within  the meaning  of 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2680(h).

The Westfall Act\r                      1.   The Westfall Act\r\n\n          Before 1988, a plaintiff  with a tort claim against\r\n\na federal employee could proceed against the  employee in his\r\n\nor  her personal  capacity, and  if the employee  was \"acting\r\n\nwithin  the scope of his  office or employment,\"  28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1346(b), could proceed against  the United States, instead of\r\n\nor in  addition to  the federal  employee, under  the Federal\r\n\nTort  Claims Act  (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.     1346,  2671-78, 2680.\r\n\nCongress, however, expressly excepted certain kinds of claims\r\n\nfrom the FTCA's otherwise broad waiver of sovereign immunity,\r\n\nincluding  any  claim  arising   out  of  slander  and  other\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nspecified intentional torts.   28 U.S.C.    2680(h).6   Thus,\r\n\nwhile a plaintiff with a claim not excepted from the right to\r\n\nsue  the  United  States  likely  would  choose  to  sue  the\r\n\ngovernment rather than  or in addition  to an individual  who\r\n\nmay  be judgment-proof,  a plaintiff  with an  excepted claim\r\n\nlike  the Aversas' would have no choice but to proceed solely\r\n\nagainst the employee.   The employee, however, might be found\r\n\nabsolutely immune  from suit according to  federal common law\r\n\nprinciples.  See Howard v. Lyons, 360 U.S. 593, 597 (1959).\r                                            \r\n\n          In  1988, the  Supreme  Court decided  Westfall  v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nErwin, 484  U.S. 292  (1988), holding that  absolute immunity\r                 \r\n\nfrom  state-law  tort  actions   was  available  to   federal\r\n\nemployees only when their conduct was both \"within the  scope\r\n\nof  their official duties and . . . discretionary in nature.\"\r                                         \r\n\nId. at  297-98 (emphasis in  original).

The  legislative history  regarding the  intentional tort\r\nexceptions is  scant, but  they  appear to  rest on  concerns\r\nraised by the Department of Justice that those torts would be\r\n\"easily   exaggerated\"  and  \"difficult  to  make  a  defense\r\nagainst.\"  See 2 L.

In 1973,  Congress removed\r\nfrom  the list  assault, battery,  false imprisonment,  false\r\narrest, abuse of process and malicious prosecution  committed\r\nby investigative or law  enforcement officers, in recognition\r\nof the \"manifest injustice\" of denying a federal remedy  when\r\na  federal  agent  intentionally  assaults a  citizen  in  an\r\nillegal raid,  while providing  the remedy  to a  citizen run\r\ndown  by a negligent mail truck driver.

The Westfall Act amended\r\n\nthe  FTCA to  make an  action against  the United  States the\r\n\nexclusive remedy  for money  damages for injury  arising from\r\n\nthe  \"negligent or  wrongful act  or omission\"  of a  federal\r\n\nemployee  \"acting   within  the   scope  of  his   office  or\r\n\nemployment,\"  28 U.S.C.    2679(b)(1),  thus eliminating  the\r\n\ndiscretionary   function   requirement  and   making  federal\r\n\nemployees absolutely  immune  from suit  for torts  committed\r\n\nwithin the scope of  employment.7  The FTCA is  the exclusive\r\n\nremedy even when, as here, an exception to the FTCA precludes\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Congress understood prior  immunity law as  not requiring\r\nthe  act  to  have   been  discretionary  in  nature,  feared\r\nprotracted litigation  in  determining whether  the  employee\r\nexercised  governmental discretion,  and intended  \"to return\r\nFederal employees  to  the  status  they held  prior  to  the\r\nWestfall  decision.\"  See H.R.

Lamagno, supra, might indicate that scope of employment is\r                             \r\n\nto  be determined according to federal common law rather than\r\n\nstate  respondeat superior  law.   In  that  case, the  Court\r                                      \r\n\nconcluded that a certification by the Attorney General or her\r\n\ndelegate  that the  federal  employee was  acting within  the\r\n\nscope  of his or her employment is subject to judicial review\r\n\nfor purposes of permanently substituting the United States as\r\n\nthe party defendant.  115 S. Ct. at 2234-36.  Amicus raised a\r\n\npotential Article  III problem -- that if the court concluded\r\n\nthat the employee acted outside the  scope of employment, and\r\n\nthe plaintiff and defendant  were not of diverse citizenship,\r\n\nthere  would  no longer  be  a  federal question  to  support\r\n\nsubject  matter  jurisdiction once  the federal  employee was\r\n\nresubstituted.    Id.  at  2236.   A  four-justice  plurality\r                                \r\n\nconcluded that Article III nonetheless was satisfied  because\r\n\n\"there was a nonfrivolous  federal question\" presented at the\r                      \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\noutset  of the  case.   Id. at  2236 (emphasis  in original).\r                                      \r\n\nJustice Ginsburg wrote: \r\n\n          At that  time, the United  States was the\r\n          defendant, and the action was  thus under\r\n          the  FTCA.    Whether  the  employee  was\r\n          acting  within the  scope of  his federal\r\n          employment   is  a   significant  federal\r\n          question  -- and  the  Westfall  Act  was\r\n          designed  to  assure  that this  question\r\n          could  be  aired  in  a   federal  forum.\r\n          Because  a  case under  the  Westfall Act\r\n          thus    \"raises    [a]   questio[n]    of\r\n          substantive  federal  law  at   the  very\r\n          outset,\"   it  \"clearly   'arises  under'\r\n          federal law, as that term is used in Art.\r\n          III.\"\r\n\nId. at 2236 (citations omitted).  \r              \r\n\n          After further briefing in which both parties agreed\r\n\nthat the plurality did not mean that  the scope determination\r\n\nshould be  resolved by reference to federal rather than state\r\n\nlaw, we reach the same conclusion.  First,  we think that all\r\n\nthe  plurality intended  to address  was  whether there  is a\r\n\nsufficient federal predicate  to keep a Westfall  Act case in\r\n\nfederal court, once  a determination has  been made that  the\r\n\ndefendant  was not  acting within  the scope  of his  federal\r\n\nemployment.  The answer  was yes, because at the  outset, the\r\n\ncase arose  under a law of the  United States (the FTCA), and\r\n\nthe United States was a  party.  See U.S. Const. art.  III,  \r                                                \r\n\n2.   Second, even if  Justice Ginsburg was  referring in some\r\n\nmeasure  to   the  scope  determination,  federal   law  does\r\n\ndetermine  whether a  person is  a  federal employee  and the\r\n\nnature and  contours of his or  her federal responsibilities.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nSee  Ezekiel v.  Michel, 66  F.3d 894,  899 (7th  Cir. 1995);\r                                   \r\n\nPlatis v.

But state  law governs whether the person  was acting\r\n\nwithin   the   scope    of   that   employment    and   those\r\n\nresponsibilities.   As already noted, the legislative history\r\n\nis clear  that Congress so  intended, H.R. Rep.  No. 100-700,\r\n\nsupra, at 5949, and although we are the first to grapple with\r                 \r\n\nthe  meaning  of  the  plurality's remarks  in  Gutierrez  de\r                                                                         \r\n\nMartinez,  the  courts of  appeal,  including  our own,  have\r                    \r\n\nconcluded that state law  controls.

There, we\r\n\nstated that \"the tort charged (assault and battery) is one of\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nthe   2680(h)  exceptions which  could not  by definition  be\r\n\nwithin the scope of employment.\"  906 F.2d at 813 n.16.  This\r\n\nremark,  however,  does  not  mean  that  intentional   torts\r\n\nexcepted  by  section  2680(h)   are  outside  the  scope  of\r\n\nemployment as a matter  of federal law regardless of  the law\r\n\nof  respondeat  superior  of  the  state  in  which the  tort\r                                    \r\n\noccurred.    The assault  at issue  in  Nasuti took  place in\r                                                          \r\n\nMassachusetts, under whose law an assault is within the scope\r\n\nof employment only if done in response to some conduct of the\r\n\nplaintiff  that interfered  at the  time with  the employee's\r\n\nability to do his or her job.

He found  that\r\n\nbecause Walsh  and Claunch  were authorized to  prepare press\r\n\nreleases  and participate  in press  conferences in  order to\r\n\nkeep  the public  informed, and  because Howard  approved the\r\n\npress  releases,   made  the  decision  to   hold  the  press\r\n\nconferences, and  was present for the  press conferences, the\r\n\nstatements were either authorized or incidental to authorized\r\n\nduties.   The magistrate judge  further found that  Walsh and\r\n\nClaunch  acted  at least  in part  to serve  their employers'\r\n\ninterests in  keeping the public informed  of law enforcement\r\n\nefforts. \r\n\n          Aversa  correctly  argues  that Walsh's  defamatory\r\n\nstatements to the press were not authorized.  Walsh testified\r\n\nthat as an Assistant United States Attorney, he  was expected\r\n\nto  abide  by  the  United  States  Attorneys'  Manual  (\"the\r\n\nManual\") issued  by his employer, the  Department of Justice.\r\n\nChapter 7 of the Manual, entitled \"Media Relations,\" provides\r\n\nthat  \"fairness  [and] accuracy  . .  .  must prevail  in all\r\n\ndealings  with the  news media.\"   Manual,  ch. 7,    1-7.001\r\n\n(1988).

See D.N.H. L.R. 35.\r                         \r\n\n          Walsh admitted that, in dealing with the news media\r\n\nregarding  a  criminal case,  he  was not  authorized  to say\r\n\nanything that was inaccurate  or misleading, not contained in\r\n\na public document, or prejudicial to a defendant's right to a\r\n\nfair trial, or to otherwise contravene the directives of  the\r\n\nManual, 28 C.F.R.   50.2, or  Local Rule 35.

Howard\r\n\ndid  not approve in advance any of Walsh's oral statements to\r\n\nthe  press.10    Moreover,  we  do  not  think  that Howard's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Howard did  approve Walsh's  statements after the  fact.\r\nJudge  Loughlin required Howard's  presence at the sentencing\r\nhearing  and asked  him to  respond to  his criticism  of the\r\n\"various innuendoes,  totally false, in the  media that these\r\ncrimes were drug related.\"   Howard stated that he  \"stood by\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\napproval can suffice as authorization  for Walsh's defamatory\r\n\nstatements.   An employee  of the Department  of Justice  who\r\n\nwishes  to  release information  beyond  that  allowed by  28\r\n\nC.F.R.     50.2  must  obtain permission  from  the  Attorney\r\n\nGeneral or Deputy Attorney General,  28 C.F.R.   50.2(9), not\r\n\nthe  United States  Attorney,  and Walsh  did  not seek  such\r\n\napproval.  \r\n\n          Although an employee's  intentionally tortious  act\r\n\nwas not authorized, it  may nonetheless have been within  the\r\n\nscope  of  employment if  it  was  \"incidental to  authorized\r\n\nduties.\"   According to New Hampshire  cases deciding whether\r\n\nassaults  were within  the scope  of employment,  the conduct\r\n\nmust  meet  three  requirements  in order  to  be  considered\r\n\nincidental to authorized duties:  (1) the employer authorized\r\n\nor could  foresee that the  employee would  use a  reasonable\r\n\ndegree  of force  as a  means of  carrying out  an authorized\r\n\nduty;  (2)  the  employee  used  excessive  force,   although\r\n\nwrongly, as  a means of accomplishing an authorized duty; and\r\n\n(3)  the employee's purpose was,  at least in  part, to carry\r\n\nout an  authorized  duty.

During his deposition, Walsh did not\r\n\ndeny  that  the  media  accurately  reported  his  words  and\r\n\ntestified that  he believed  he was discharging  his duty  to\r\n\ninform the public in making these statements.

The\r\n          master  may be  liable  even  though  the\r\n          servant knows the statement to be untrue,\r\n          as where the manager  of a store, for the\r\n          purpose  of obtaining an admission from a\r\n          suspected thief, charges such person with\r\n          other similar crimes, although  having no\r\n          belief in his own statements.  \r\n\nId.,   247 &amp; cmts. a, c.\r              \r\n\n          We also conclude that  the district court correctly\r\n\nheld that  Claunch acted within the scope  of his employment.\r\n\nOne of  his duties was  to inform  the public  about tax  and\r\n\nother cases in which the  IRS was involved in order  to deter\r\n\nviolations  of the law and  to instill public confidence that\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nthe IRS prosecuted violators.  The  IRS's policy statement on\r\n\nnews  coverage required Claunch to act with due regard for an\r\n\nindividual's  right to a fair trial and the public's right to\r\n\nknow, and, particularly in view of the \"statutory prohibition\r\n\non the disclosure of tax information,\" to strictly limit what\r\n\nhe said  to facts that were  a matter of public  record.  IRS\r\n\nPolicy Statement P-1-181.  Aversa alleged that Claunch stated\r\n\nthat the  case represented the IRS's  commitment to ferreting\r\n\nout, investigating and prosecuting money launderers.   Aversa\r\n\nwas  indicted  for  and  convicted  of  violating  the  anti-\r\n\nstructuring  law, which  was enacted  as  part of  the \"Money\r\n\nLaundering Control Act  of 1986.\"   See Pub.  L.

The\r\n\nlegislative  history,  however,  defines  \"money  laundering\"\r\n\nessentially  as  concealing money  from  the  government (not\r\n\none's spouse) for the purpose of covering up illegal activity\r\n\nor evading taxes.

Aversa was not,  therefore, a  \"money\r\n\nlaunderer.\"   Nonetheless,  we have  no doubt  that Claunch's\r\n\nemployer would  be held  responsible for his  statement under\r\n\nthe principles of New Hampshire law set forth above.\r\n\n          Because Walsh and Claunch acted within the scope of\r\n\ntheir employment, the United States was  properly substituted\r\n\nas the  party  defendant,  and  the common  law  claims  were\r\n\nproperly  dismissed pursuant to the exception to jurisdiction\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nunder the FTCA for claims arising from libel and slander.  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   2680(h).  \r\n\n                 B.

Local Rule  35,\r\nentitled  \"Release  of Information  by Attorneys  in Criminal\r\nCases,\" limits the information that may be made public before\r\nand during a  criminal trial, and can be said  to be intended\r\nto protect a criminal defendant's right to  a fair trial.  We\r\ndo not reach  the question  whether a civil  cause of  action\r\ncould  ever rest on  Local Rule 35,  because we do  not think\r\nthat  Rule  35  was  intended  to  protect  against  loss  of\r\nemployment or business goodwill.  Thus, denial of the request\r\nto amend was  not error.   The answer  to Aversa's  complaint\r\nabout  the denial of his second proposed addition is that the\r\ncourt considered Aversa's allegations  that he was fired from\r\nhis  job  and  lost  future employment  opportunities  as  an\r\naccountant and we consider them here.  \r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nfinding  that  the  right  Aversa asserted  was  not  clearly\r\n\nestablished, the district court not only relied on the law as\r\n\nit  was in  1990,  but on  Siegert v.  Gilley,  500 U.S.  226\r                                                         \r\n\n(1991), which  postdated the  alleged  violation.   Qualified\r\n\nimmunity, however,  must be decided  according to the  law in\r\n\neffect at the time  of the alleged violation --  \"implicit in\r\n\nthe  Harlow  formulation . . .  is a temporal dimension:  the\r                       \r\n\nright must have been  clearly established at the time  of the\r\n\ndefendants' alleged  improper actions.\"    Souza v.

The court's  reliance on\r\n\nSiegert in its qualified  immunity analysis stemmed from some\r                   \r\n\nconfusing language in that very case:\r\n\n          A    necessary    concomitant   to    the\r\n          determination     of      whether     the\r\n          constitutional   right   asserted  by   a\r\n          plaintiff is \"clearly established\" at the\r\n          time   the   defendant   acted   is   the\r\n          determination  of  whether the  plaintiff\r\n          has   asserted   a    violation   of    a\r\n          constitutional right at all.

Id. at 233.\r                                 \r\n\n          Some courts have read  this language as requiring a\r\n\nresolution of  the merits under current  law before beginning\r\n\nthe  analysis  of the  law as  it stood  at  the time  of the\r\n\nalleged violation.  See DiMeglio v.

But  we think  that  these  statements, read  in\r                   \r\n\ncontext, simply mean that the plaintiff must assert a clearly\r\n\nestablished federal constitutional  (or statutory) right, and\r\n\nnot  merely  a  state law  tort  claim.

See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818 (\"On summary\r                                           \r\n\njudgment, the judge appropriately may determine, not only the\r\n\ncurrently applicable  law, but  whether that law  was clearly\r\n\nestablished at the time an action occurred.\").   For example,\r\n\na court of  appeals may recognize a right  for the first time\r\n\nin that circuit, but find that it was not clearly established\r\n\nat  the time of  the alleged violation.

Davis, 424 U.S.  693 (1976), the  Court\r                                       \r\n\nindicated that  a  claim  for  defamation  could  rise  to  a\r\n\nconstitutional level if accompanied  by a loss of employment,\r\n\nbut  left unclear whether that loss would have to result from\r\n\nsome  further action  by  the defendant  in  addition to  the\r\n\ndefamation  itself.   In  Siegert v.  Gilley, the  Court made\r                                                        \r\n\nclear that  it would.   Siegert resigned  from his  job as  a\r\n\npsychologist  at a federal  hospital in order  to avoid being\r\n\nterminated, then  began working at an Army hospital.  Because\r\n\nArmy  hospitals  required  \"credentialing\"  by  a  committee,\r\n\nSiegert  signed a request form asking the federal hospital to\r\n\nprovide his  new employer with information  regarding his job\r\n\nperformance  and  privileges.     Gilley,  Siegert's   former\r\n\nsupervisor, sent a letter in  response, stating that he could\r\n\nnot recommend  Siegert for privileges as  a psychologist, and\r\n\nthat Siegert was inept,  unethical and the most untrustworthy\r\n\nindividual  he  had  supervised   in  thirteen  years.    The\r\n\ncommittee  denied Siegert  credentials.   Thereafter, Siegert\r\n\nwas turned down for  a position at another Army  hospital and\r\n\nreturned  to work at the first Army hospital with provisional\r\n\ncredentials.   After his administrative appeals  were denied,\r\n\nhis  federal employment  was terminated  altogether.   Id. at\r                                                                     \r\n\n228-29.  The Court  found that Gilley's defamatory statements\r\n\nand their  consequences were not actionable  as a deprivation\r\n\nof liberty, stating:\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\n          The  alleged  defamation was  not uttered\r\n          incident to the termination  of Siegert's\r\n          employment  by  the  hospital,  since  he\r\n          voluntarily resigned from his position at\r\n          the hospital, and  the letter was written\r\n          several  weeks  later.    The  statements\r\n          contained in the letter would undoubtedly\r\n          damage  the  reputation  of  one  in  his\r\n          position,    and   impair    his   future\r\n          employment prospects.  But  the plaintiff\r\n          in  Paul  v.   Davis  similarly   alleged\r                                          \r\n          serious   impairment    of   his   future\r\n          employment opportunities as well as other\r\n          harm.  Most defamation plaintiffs attempt\r\n          to show some  sort of damage and  out-of-\r\n          pocket loss which  flows from the  injury\r\n          to their reputation.  But so long as such\r\n          damage  flows from  injury caused  by the\r\n          defendant to a plaintiff's reputation, it\r\n          may be  recoverable under state  tort law\r\n          but it  is not  recoverable  in a  Bivens\r                                                               \r\n          action.  \r\n\nId. at 234.  Thus, what may have  been left open by Davis was\r                                                                     \r\n\nforeclosed by Siegert -- in order to state a cognizable claim\r                                 \r\n\nthat  defamation together  with loss  of employment  worked a\r\n\ndeprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty interest,\r\n\na plaintiff must allege that  the loss of employment resulted\r\n\nfrom  some further action by the defendant in addition to the\r\n\ndefamation.   Where it  is the  defendant who  terminated the\r\n\nplaintiff, the further action is the termination.  But where,\r\n\nas  here, a  third party  discharges or  refuses to  hire the\r\n\nplaintiff solely  as a result of  the defendant's defamation,\r\n\nthe plaintiffhas notdescribed a viableconstitutional claim.15\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Aversa  contends that  even  if the  defamation was  not\r\nuttered in conjunction with some other more direct  action by\r\nWalsh or Claunch causing  him to be discharged from  his job,\r\nthe defamatory statements stood in the midst of circumstances\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\n                       III.

Senior District Judge Martin F.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except where otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from Aversa's complaint. Daniel Aversa (\"Aversa\") and Vincent Mento (\"Mento\") were partners in a legitimate real estate business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In January of 1989, they sold a parcel of land, splitting the proceeds.  At the same time, Aversa was experiencing marital difficulties with his wife Carla.  In order to conceal some of his assets from his wife in the event of a divorce, Aversa asked Mento if he could deposit his share of the proceeds, amounting to $55,000, into Mento's personal bank account.  Mento agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both men were aware that domestic financial institutions were required to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 to the Secretary of the Treasury, see 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5313(a);  31 C.F.R. &#167; 103.22(a)(1), and wished to avoid causing a Currency Transaction Report (\"CTR\") to be filed.  Aversa therefore made a series of deposits into Mento's account in sums just under $10,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At the time, Aversa was unaware that structuring the transactions to avoid causing a CTR to be filed was a crime under federal law.  See 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5324(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1990, IRS agents contacted Aversa and informed him that he was under investigation for structuring deposits.  He immediately met with Assistant United States Attorney Walsh, and without an attorney present, explained that he was hiding the money from his wife, that it was not derived from an illegal source, and that he did not know that structuring was illegal.  Walsh told Aversa that he and Mento had been under investigation for some time and that he had no reason to believe the money was anything but \"clean,\" but said that he did not need to prove that it was derived from an illegal source or that Aversa knew that structuring was illegal.  Walsh told Aversa that there was no reason to seek counsel and encouraged him to plead guilty because all that was needed for a conviction was what Aversa had just told him.  In a later meeting with Aversa's counsel, Walsh said that he previously had been successful in prosecuting individuals for structuring in Miami, but that this case would be his first involving \"clean money,\" and he planned to use it to \"set a precedent\" and \"educate the public about the currency transaction reporting requirements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1990, Walsh obtained an indictment charging Aversa and Mento with conspiracy, structuring, and making false statements, and Aversa alone with attempting to cause a domestic financial institution to file a report containing a material omission or misstatement of fact.  That same day, Walsh, Claunch, and the United States Attorney for the District of New Hampshire, Jeffrey R. Howard (with whom Aversa alleged Walsh and Claunch conspired but who was not joined as a defendant) issued a press release and held a press conference announcing to the local and national news media, which reported to the public, that Aversa and Mento had been arrested for money laundering.  Walsh and Claunch knew that Aversa and Mento were not involved in laundering illegally-gotten money, or in drug trafficking, tax evasion or organized crime, but created the impression that they were.  An article in the Boston Globe dated June 29, 1990, reported:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Walsh said money laundering is usually done for purposes of tax evasion, drug dealing or organized crime.  He would not say if either of yesterday's indictments are related to these activities, but added after the news conference that \"it would be a fair statement\" to say authorities are looking into how [these] men amassed the sums of money involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh also stated that Aversa faced up to forty years in prison and added that the investigation was continuing and more charges would be filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A front-page article in the Concord Monitor dated June 29, 1990 reported:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>The indictments are a sign that prosecutors are serious about using the money laundering laws, a tool that allows them to charge people for handling money illegally without having to prove that the money was gained illegally, said Jeffrey Howard, U.S.A. attorney for New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>\"The indictments are important because they are examples of the commitment the I.R.S. has made ... to use the money laundering statutes in order to ferret out tax evasion, drug trafficking and other crimes,\" he said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Prosecutors declined to say how Aversa and Mento got the money or why they believe the men tried to evade the currency laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claunch stated at the press conference that \"[t]hese cases represent the IRS's commitment to ferreting out money launderers,\" and that the IRS wanted \"to send a message that money laundering is going to be detected, investigated and prosecuted to the full extent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1990, after Judge Loughlin granted the government's motion in limine to preclude a defense based on ignorance of the anti-structuring law, Aversa pled guilty to structuring.

No evidence had been adduced at Mento's trial that there was an underlying criminal purpose or that the source of the money was unexplained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Aversa's and Mento's sentencing, Judge Loughlin found that Aversa and Mento would bear the stigma of the \"totally false\" innuendoes reported in the media for the rest of their lives.  In a memorandum opinion ruling on Aversa's and Mento's post-conviction motions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the judge noted that the government had admitted that Aversa and Mento were \"not involved in drugs and not laundering ill-gotten gains and not keeping information from the United States,\" and found that the prosecutors' statements to the press were \"outrageous and unfair,\" \"misleading and cruel,\" \"self-serving and more than a little disingenuous,\" and \"smeared the reputation of these two men.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court vacated Aversa's and Mento's convictions, ruling that the willfulness requirement of the applicable criminal penalty provision, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5322(a), required the government to prove the violation of a known legal duty or the reckless disregard thereof, and that an unintentional, nonreckless mistake of law was a complete defense to a structuring charge.

United States, 510 U.S. 1069, 114 S.Ct. 873, 127 L.Ed.2d 70 (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We remanded for a new trial, but the government elected not to proceed again against Aversa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Aversas then brought a civil action seeking compensatory and punitive damages against Walsh, Claunch, and other unnamed defendants, alleging in Count I that the defendants, acting under color of federal law, deprived Aversa of his Fifth Amendment right to liberty;  in Counts II and III that they committed the torts of slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress under New Hampshire law;  and in Count IV that the defendants' conduct caused Carla Aversa to lose the consortium of her husband.  The complaint alleged that Walsh and Claunch defamed Aversa for the purpose of personally benefitting in their careers, and that their false and misleading statements caused irreparable harm to Aversa's personal and business reputations and his business goodwill, caused him to be discharged from his job as an accountant, and prevented him from finding other employment as an accountant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was transferred from the District of New Hampshire to the District of Rhode Island.  Pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, the Attorney General certified that Walsh and Claunch acted within the scope of their federal employment and the United States was provisionally substituted as the party defendant.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).  Aversa was permitted to depose Walsh and Claunch in aid of his challenge to the scope certification, and he submitted the depositions and various exhibits to the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Thereafter, Magistrate Judge Lovegreen ruled that Walsh and Claunch were acting within the scope of their employment, thus converting the common law claims into claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2679(d)(1), 1346(b), then recommended that those claims be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising out of libel or slander.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).  Treating the defendants' motion to dismiss the constitutional claim as a motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment in favor of Walsh and Claunch on the basis that they were qualifiedly immune.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Magistrate Judge Lovegreen stated in his Report and Recommendation that he was in full agreement with Judge Loughlin's assessment of the defendants' conduct, and added that the \"defendants' extraordinarily poor judgment in making these statements should not go unnoticed.\"   In adopting the magistrate's Report and Recommendation in its entirety, United States District Judge Mary Lisi found that the defendants' \"publication of misleading information [was] lacking in professionalism and deserving of the opprobrium articulated by Judge Loughlin and Magistrate Lovegreen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The Common Law Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, the Aversas' complaint describes a claim for slander under New Hampshire law, which defines the tort as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>In order to be actionable, the language complained of must tend to lower the plaintiff in the esteem of any substantial and respectable group, even though it may be quite a small minority.  The defamatory meaning must be one that could be ascribed to the words by hearers of common and reasonable understanding....  The threshold question ... is whether the published words are capable of conveying the defamatory meaning or innuendo ascribed to them by the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomson v. Cash, 119 N.H. 371, 402 A.2d 651, 653 (1979) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We agree with the district court (and the Aversas do not contest) that the claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium through \"verbal abuse and slander\" also \"arose out of\" slander within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).  See Jimenez-Nieves v. United States, 682 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1982) (court must look beyond the literal language to ascertain the real cause of the complaint;  heartland of the tort of defamation is injury to reputation by the implicit or explicit communication of an idea).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Westfall Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before 1988, a plaintiff with a tort claim against a federal employee could proceed against the employee in his or her personal capacity, and if the employee was \"acting within the scope of his office or employment,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b), could proceed against the United States, instead of or in addition to the federal employee, under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346, 2671-78, 2680.  Congress, however, expressly excepted certain kinds of claims from the FTCA's otherwise broad waiver of sovereign immunity, including any claim arising out of slander and other specified intentional torts.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Thus, while a plaintiff with a claim not excepted from the right to sue the United States likely would choose to sue the government rather than or in addition to an individual who may be judgment-proof, a plaintiff with an excepted claim like the Aversas' would have no choice but to proceed solely against the employee.  The employee, however, might be found absolutely immune from suit according to federal common law principles.  See Howard v. Lyons, 360 U.S. 593, 597, 79 S.Ct. 1331, 1333-34, 3 L.Ed.2d 1454 (1959).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, the Supreme Court decided Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U.S. 292, 108 S.Ct. 580, 98 L.Ed.2d 619 (1988), holding that absolute immunity from state-law tort actions was available to federal employees only when their conduct was both \"within the scope of their official duties and ... discretionary in nature.\"  Id. at 297-98, 108 S.Ct. at 584 (emphasis in original).  The Court, however, invited Congress to legislate standards defining the scope of federal employee immunity, since it was in the best position to resolve the \"complex and often highly empirical inquiry\" whether the \"contribution to effective government\" sufficiently \"outweighs the potential harm to individual citizens\" to warrant immunity in a particular context.  Id. at 299-300, 108 S.Ct. at 585.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress responded within the year with the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act.  The Westfall Act amended the FTCA to make an action against the United States the exclusive remedy for money damages for injury arising from the \"negligent or wrongful act or omission\" of a federal employee \"acting within the scope of his office or employment,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b)(1), thus eliminating the discretionary function requirement and making federal employees absolutely immune from suit for torts committed within the scope of employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The FTCA is the exclusive remedy even when, as here, an exception to the FTCA precludes government liability.  United States v. Smith, 499 U.S. 160, 165-67, 111 S.Ct. 1180, 1184-85, 113 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exclusive remedy provision is first invoked through a certification by the Attorney General or her delegate that the employee was acting within the scope of employment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).  Once the certification is made, the suit is \"deemed an action against the United States\" under the FTCA and the United States is substituted as the party defendant, id., but the certification is provisional and subject to judicial review, after which the employee may be resubstituted.  Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U.S. 417, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 2227, 2230-31, 132 L.Ed.2d 375 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. State Respondeat Superior Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Westfall Act, federal employee immunity from suit for state law torts was decided according to federal common law.  The Westfall Act provides that a federal employee is immune if he or she acted \"within the scope of his office or employment,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b)(1), which, according to the legislative history, is to be determined by the same law that had previously been used only to determine whether the United States could be sued under the FTCA:  the law of respondeat superior of the state in which the incident occurred.  See H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, supra, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1988 at 5949.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, we raised a concern about whether certain comments in the recent case of Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, supra, might indicate that scope of employment is to be determined according to federal common law rather than state respondeat superior law.  In that case, the Court concluded that a certification by the Attorney General or her delegate that the federal employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment is subject to judicial review for purposes of permanently substituting the United States as the party defendant.  515 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2234-36.   Amicus raised a potential Article III problem--that if the court concluded that the employee acted outside the scope of employment, and the plaintiff and defendant were not of diverse citizenship, there would no longer be a federal question to support subject matter jurisdiction once the federal employee was resubstituted.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2236.   A four-justice plurality concluded that Article III nonetheless was satisfied because \"there was a nonfrivolous federal question\" presented at the outset of the case.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2236 (emphasis in original).  Justice Ginsburg wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>At that time, the United States was the defendant, and the action was thus under the FTCA.  Whether the employee was acting within the scope of his federal employment is a significant federal question--and the Westfall Act was designed to assure that this question could be aired in a federal forum.  Because a case under the Westfall Act thus \"raises [a] questio[n] of substantive federal law at the very outset,\" it \"clearly 'arises under' federal law, as that term is used in Art.  III.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2236 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further briefing in which both parties agreed that the plurality did not mean that the scope determination should be resolved by reference to federal rather than state law, we reach the same conclusion.  First, we think that all the plurality intended to address was whether there is a sufficient federal predicate to keep a Westfall Act case in federal court, once a determination has been made that the defendant was not acting within the scope of his federal employment.  The answer was yes, because at the outset, the case arose under a law of the United States (the FTCA), and the United States was a party.  See U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 2.  Second, even if Justice Ginsburg was referring in some measure to the scope determination, federal law does determine whether a person is a federal employee and the nature and contours of his or her federal responsibilities.  See Ezekiel v. Michel, 66 F.3d 894, 899 (7th Cir.1995);  Platis v. United States, 409 F.2d 1009, 1011 (10th Cir.1969).  But state law governs whether the person was acting within the scope of that employment and those responsibilities.  As already noted, the legislative history is clear that Congress so intended, H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, supra, at 5949, and although we are the first to grapple with the meaning of the plurality's remarks in Gutierrez de Martinez, the courts of appeal, including our own, have concluded that state law controls.  See Heuton v. Anderson, 75 F.3d 357, 360 (8th Cir.1996);  Haddon v. United States, 68 F.3d 1420 (D.C.Cir.1995);  Garcia v. United States, 62 F.3d 126, 127 (5th Cir.1995);  Jamison v. Wiley, 14 F.3d 222, 227 n. 4 (4th Cir.1994);  Schrob v. Catterson, 967 F.2d 929, 934 (3d Cir.1992);  McHugh v. Univ. of Vermont, 966 F.2d 67 (2d Cir.1992);  S.J. &amp; W. Ranch, Inc. v. Lehtinen, 913 F.2d 1538, 1542 (11th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 813, 112 S.Ct. 62, 116 L.Ed.2d 37 (1991);  Nasuti v. Scannell, 906 F.2d 802, 805 n. 3 (1st Cir.1990);  Arbour v. Jenkins, 903 F.2d 416, 421-22 (6th Cir.1990);  Washington v. United States, 868 F.2d 332, 334 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 992, 110 S.Ct. 539, 107 L.Ed.2d 536 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, Aversa argues that we indicated in Nasuti v. Scannell, supra, that intentional torts are not within the scope of employment as a matter of law.  There, we stated that \"the tort charged (assault and battery) is one of the &#167; 2680(h) exceptions which could not by definition be within the scope of employment.\"  906 F.2d at 813 n. 16.   This remark, however, does not mean that intentional torts excepted by section 2680(h) are outside the scope of employment as a matter of federal law regardless of the law of respondeat superior of the state in which the tort occurred.  The assault at issue in Nasuti took place in Massachusetts, under whose law an assault is within the scope of employment only if done in response to some conduct of the plaintiff that interfered at the time with the employee's ability to do his or her job.  Id. at 805 n. 3 (citing Miller v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., 364 Mass. 340, 304 N.E.2d 573, 579 (1973)).  Because the district court found no evidence of those circumstances, the assault on Nasuti was outside the scope of employment as a matter of Massachusetts law.  Generally, however, an intentional tort excepted by section 2680(h) can be within the scope of employment if state respondeat superior law so requires.  See, e.g., Henson v. NASA, 14 F.3d 1143, 1147-48 (6th Cir.1994) (under Ohio law, an employee's acts are within the scope of employment if he acts within his authority during the course of employment even though acting intentionally or maliciously, but are outside the scope if the acts are self-serving and in no way facilitate the employer's business);  Nadler v. Mann, 951 F.2d 301, 305-06 (11th Cir.1992) (under Florida law, prosecutor's allegedly slanderous conduct in referring bribery allegation to FBI was within scope of employment, but leaking the story to the press was not);  Jayson, supra, &#167; 9.07, at 9-168 (that the employee's conduct was intentional does not preclude a finding that he was acting within the scope of employment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Scope of Employment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the merits.  It is the plaintiff's burden to prove the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.  Murphy v. United States, 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2581, 132 L.Ed.2d 831 (1995).  Because it is not in dispute that Aversa cannot sue the United States for defamation, there is subject matter jurisdiction only if Walsh and/or Claunch acted outside the scope of his employment.  It was Aversa's burden to persuade the court that they did.  Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 813 n. 16.   In ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), the district court must construe the complaint liberally, treating all well-pleaded facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Murphy, 45 F.3d at 522.   In addition, the court may consider whatever evidence has been submitted, such as the depositions and exhibits submitted in this case.  Cf. Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 808 (trial court may hold evidentiary hearing to resolve immunity-related factual disputes).  We review the district court's scope of employment determination de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no New Hampshire case resolving a scope-of-employment question in a defamation case, but we find sufficient guidance in New Hampshire cases dealing with the question in the context of assault and in those sections of the Restatement (Second) of Agency that we feel confident the New Hampshire Supreme Court would follow.  See Croes v. United States, 726 F.2d 31, 32 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An act is within the scope of employment under New Hampshire law if it was authorized by the employer or incidental to authorized duties;  if it was done within the time and space limits of the employment;  and if it was actuated at least in part by a purpose to serve an objective of the employer.  See Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, 129 N.H. 561, 534 A.2d 689, 698-700, 701-02 (1987);  Richard v. Amoskeag Mfg. Co., 79 N.H. 380, 109 A. 88, 91-92 (1919);  Restatement (Second) of Agency &#167; 228(1) (1958).  The conduct is not within the scope of employment if it was \"different in kind from that authorized, far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.\"   Restatement, supra, &#167; 228(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there was no dispute that Walsh and Claunch acted within the time and space limits of their employment, the magistrate judge focused on whether their conduct was authorized or incidental to authorized duties, and was intended by them to serve their employers.  He found that because Walsh and Claunch were authorized to prepare press releases and participate in press conferences in order to keep the public informed, and because Howard approved the press releases, made the decision to hold the press conferences, and was present for the press conferences, the statements were either authorized or incidental to authorized duties.  The magistrate judge further found that Walsh and Claunch acted at least in part to serve their employers' interests in keeping the public informed of law enforcement efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aversa correctly argues that Walsh's defamatory statements to the press were not authorized.  Walsh testified that as an Assistant United States Attorney, he was expected to abide by the United States Attorneys' Manual (\"the Manual\") issued by his employer, the Department of Justice.  Chapter 7 of the Manual, entitled \"Media Relations,\" provides that \"fairness [and] accuracy ... must prevail in all dealings with the news media.\"   Manual, ch. 7, &#167; 1-7.001 (1988).  News conferences should not be held to announce indictments or arrests except in \"unusual circumstances,\" such as to alert the public about a fugitive from justice, and then \"extreme care\" should be taken to avoid statements branding an accused as guilty of a crime of which he or she has not been convicted.  Id.  Written news releases \"relating the essentials of the indictment\" may be distributed, and, with permission of the United States Attorney, an Assistant United States Attorney \"may answer legitimate questions about indictments or arrests, either in press conferences or in discussions with individual reporters, but answers should not go beyond explanation of what is in the public document or the confines of 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2.\"  Id.  The Manual provides that 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2 \"defines the types of information that may be and the types of information that may not be made available to the news media about pending ... criminal cases by employees of the Department of Justice.\"  Id. (emphasis in original).  Employees are to adhere to the regulation \"in both letter and spirit.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulation provides that, among other facts and circumstances not relevant here, Justice Department employees may make public the \"substance or text of the charge, such as a[n] indictment,\" and may disclose \"only incontrovertible, factual matters.\"  28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2(b)(3).  Release of information that would be prejudicial or would serve no law enforcement function is prohibited.  Id. &#167; 50.2(b)(3), (5), (6).  Statements which could \"reasonably be expected to influence the outcome of a pending or future trial,\" and statements concerning evidence in the case, whether or not anticipated to be used at trial, are prohibited.  Id. &#167; 50.2(b)(2), (6)(v).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh also testified that he was subject to Rule 35 of the Local New Hampshire District Court Rules, which prohibits any lawyer from releasing information that is not a matter of public record, or is likely to interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.  See D.N.H. L.R. 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh admitted that, in dealing with the news media regarding a criminal case, he was not authorized to say anything that was inaccurate or misleading, not contained in a public document, or prejudicial to a defendant's right to a fair trial, or to otherwise contravene the directives of the Manual, 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2, or Local Rule 35.  The statements, as represented in the complaint and appearing in the press releases and news articles submitted to the court, transgressed these policies and rules and therefore were not authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Howard approved the press releases, made the decision to call the press conferences, and was present at the press conferences does not change that result.  Howard did not approve in advance any of Walsh's oral statements to the press.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, we do not think that Howard's approval can suffice as authorization for Walsh's defamatory statements.  An employee of the Department of Justice who wishes to release information beyond that allowed by 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2 must obtain permission from the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General, 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2(9), not the United States Attorney, and Walsh did not seek such approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although an employee's intentionally tortious act was not authorized, it may nonetheless have been within the scope of employment if it was \"incidental to authorized duties.\"   According to New Hampshire cases deciding whether assaults were within the scope of employment, the conduct must meet three requirements in order to be considered incidental to authorized duties:  (1) the employer authorized or could foresee that the employee would use a reasonable degree of force as a means of carrying out an authorized duty;  (2) the employee used excessive force, although wrongly, as a means of accomplishing an authorized duty;  and (3) the employee's purpose was, at least in part, to carry out an authorized duty.  Daigle, 534 A.2d at 699-702;  Richard, 109 A. at 90-91;  Rowell v. Boston &amp; Maine R.R., 68 N.H. 358, 359, 44 A. 488 (1895).  See also Restatement, supra, &#167; 229 cmt. b (even though an act is of an entirely different kind than that authorized, it may be \"incidental to an authorized act\" if it is \"within the ultimate objective of the principal and an act which it is not unlikely that such a servant might do\").  If these conditions are met, it follows that the employer is liable for the employee's negligent or willful use of excessive force although the employer did not authorize it and even forbade it.  See Daigle, 534 A.2d at 699-700 (police officer's use of excessive force in effecting arrest was within scope of employment);  Richard, 109 A. at 91-92 (supervisor's use of excessive force in keeping employee at her work station was within scope of employment);  Rowell, 68 N.H. at 359, 44 A. 488 (conductor's use of excessive force in ejecting plaintiff from railroad car was within scope of employment).  If any one of the conditions is not met, the employee's conduct is outside the scope of employment.  Morin v. People's Wet Wash Laundry Co., 85 N.H. 233, 156 A. 499, 500 (1931) (although employee's motive in assaulting plaintiff may have been to serve his employer, assault was outside scope of employment because the employment implied no measure of force).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Justice Department authorized or at least could foresee that an Assistant United States Attorney permitted to inform the public about arrests, indictments and convictions would convey to the public a reasonable amount of negative information about the persons involved.  Further, although unfortunate, we think that the Department of Justice reasonably could anticipate that an employee entrusted with that power might abuse it.  Analogously, the Daigle court stated that \"excessive force in the use of guns and nightsticks is always foreseeable.\"  534 A.2d at 700.   True, there were policies and regulations against the kinds of statements that were made, but an act which is forbidden or done in a forbidden manner may nonetheless be within the scope of employment.  Restatement, supra, &#167; 230.  A \"master cannot direct a servant to accomplish a result and anticipate that he will always use the means which he directs or will refrain from acts which it is natural to expect that servants may do.\"  Id., &#167; 230 cmt. b.  See also Danforth v. Fisher, 75 N.H. 111, 111-12, 71 A. 535 (1908) (if employee was serving some purpose of his employer, it is immaterial that he did it in a way that was unexpected).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think that Walsh made the alleged statements as a means, albeit tortious and contrary to his employer's policies and rules, of accomplishing the Justice Department's objective of informing the public of recent law enforcement efforts.  To be sure, Walsh's suggestions that Aversa was involved in drug trafficking, tax evasion and racketeering furthered no legitimate law enforcement objective and actually misinformed the public.  But his statements did inform the public about a recent prosecution under the anti-structuring laws.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court agrees with the Restatement's view that \"the criminal or tortious character of an employee's act does not, ipso facto, remove the act from the scope of employment,\" Daigle, 534 A.2d at 700 (citing Restatement, supra, &#167; 231), so long as it is \"exerted in, and for the purpose of, doing the employer's business.\"  Id.  And that court does not necessarily agree with the Restatement's view that, if these conditions are met, the degree of outrageousness of the conduct may remove it from the scope of employment.  Id. (referring to Restatement, supra, &#167; 229 cmt. b);  Rowell, 68 N.H. at 359, 44 A. 488 (master is responsible for the acts of the servant done as a means and for the purpose of performing that work although done with a wanton or reckless purpose to accomplish the work in an unlawful manner);  Arthur v. Balch, 23 N.H. 157, 161 (1851) (employee acted within the scope of his employment when he used a horse he had stolen to do his employer's business).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we think that Walsh's statements were actuated, at least in part, by an intention to serve his employer.  Daigle, 534 A.2d at 699;  Restatement, supra, &#167; 228(1)(c).  This inquiry focuses on the subjective intent of the employee and his notion of how to serve his employer's interests need not be reasonable or reflective of good judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Aversa points out that the complaint, which the district court was required to take as true, alleged that Walsh defamed Aversa for the purpose of promoting his own career, and that Judge Loughlin found at least some of Walsh's statements to have been \"self-serving.\"   The complaint, however, also alleged that Walsh told Aversa's attorney that he planned to use the case to \"set a precedent\" and \"educate the public\" about the currency transaction reporting requirements.  During his deposition, Walsh did not deny that the media accurately reported his words and testified that he believed he was discharging his duty to inform the public in making these statements.  From this, the district court justifiably could find that Walsh intended, at least in part and although misguidedly, to serve an objective of his employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we have little doubt that the New Hampshire Supreme Court would hold Walsh's employer responsible for his defamatory statements.  We find further support for this conclusion in the Restatement's special rule for defamation, which embodies the general principle, recognized in the New Hampshire assault cases, that an employer should be held responsible when it entrusts an employee with a duty particularly susceptible of abuse to cause harm:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>A master is subject to liability for defamatory statements made by a servant acting within the scope of his employment....  If the scope of employment of a servant includes the making of statements concerning others which he believes to be true and privileged, the master is subject to liability for untrue and unprivileged defamatory statements made by the servant concerning such others, if the statements are otherwise within the scope of the servant's employment....  If the master employs a servant to speak for him, he is subject to liability if the servant makes a mistake as to the truth of the words spoken or as to the justification for speaking them, or even if he speaks with an improper motive, provided that he acts at least in part to serve his employer's purposes.  The master may be liable even though the servant knows the statement to be untrue, as where the manager of a store, for the purpose of obtaining an admission from a suspected thief, charges such person with other similar crimes, although having no belief in his own statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., &#167; 247 &amp; cmts. a, c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that the district court correctly held that Claunch acted within the scope of his employment.  One of his duties was to inform the public about tax and other cases in which the IRS was involved in order to deter violations of the law and to instill public confidence that the IRS prosecuted violators.  The IRS's policy statement on news coverage required Claunch to act with due regard for an individual's right to a fair trial and the public's right to know, and, particularly in view of the \"statutory prohibition on the disclosure of tax information,\" to strictly limit what he said to facts that were a matter of public record.  IRS Policy Statement P-1-181.  Aversa alleged that Claunch stated that the case represented the IRS's commitment to ferreting out, investigating and prosecuting money launderers.  Aversa was indicted for and convicted of violating the anti-structuring law, which was enacted as part of the \"Money Laundering Control Act of 1986.\"   See Pub.L. No. 99-570, Subtitle H, 100 Stat. 3207-18 (Oct. 27, 1986).  The legislative history, however, defines \"money laundering\" essentially as concealing money from the government (not one's spouse) for the purpose of covering up illegal activity or evading taxes.  See H.R.Rep. No. 746, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 16 (1986).  Aversa was not, therefore, a \"money launderer.\"   Nonetheless, we have no doubt that Claunch's employer would be held responsible for his statement under the principles of New Hampshire law set forth above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Walsh and Claunch acted within the scope of their employment, the United States was properly substituted as the party defendant, and the common law claims were properly dismissed pursuant to the exception to jurisdiction under the FTCA for claims arising from libel and slander.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.  Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).  Relying on Bivens, the Aversas alleged in Count I of their complaint that Walsh and Claunch deprived Aversa of a liberty interest guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by making false and misleading statements to the press with willful or reckless disregard of his rights, thus causing his employer to discharge him from his job as an accountant, preventing him from finding other employment as an accountant, and damaging his business goodwill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Walsh and Claunch, finding that they were qualifiedly immune from suit.  Summary judgment is proper if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Because no material fact is in dispute, the question before us is one of pure law.  Our review is de novo and we view the facts in the light most favorable to Aversa.  St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2548, 135 L.Ed.2d 1068, 64 U.S.L.W. 3849 (U.S. June 24, 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An official is qualifiedly immune if his \"conduct [did] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  In finding that the right Aversa asserted was not clearly established, the district court not only relied on the law as it was in 1990, but on Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991), which postdated the alleged violation.  Qualified immunity, however, must be decided according to the law in effect at the time of the alleged violation--\"implicit in the Harlow formulation ... is a temporal dimension:  the right must have been clearly established at the time of the defendants' alleged improper actions.\"  Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 425 (1st Cir.1995).  The court's reliance on Siegert in its qualified immunity analysis stemmed from some confusing language in that very case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A necessary concomitant to the determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is \"clearly established\" at the time the defendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all.  Id. at 232, 111 S.Ct. at 1793.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>Siegert failed not only to allege a violation of a constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of Gilley's actions, but also to establish the violation of any constitutional right at all.  Id. at 233, 111 S.Ct. at 1793-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts have read this language as requiring a resolution of the merits under current law before beginning the analysis of the law as it stood at the time of the alleged violation.  See DiMeglio v. Haines, 45 F.3d 790, 795-97 (4th Cir.1995) (discussing various interpretations of Siegert ).   But we think that these statements, read in context, simply mean that the plaintiff must assert a clearly established federal constitutional (or statutory) right, and not merely a state law tort claim.  The Siegert Court concluded that the damage Siegert alleged \"may be recoverable under state tort law but it is not recoverable in a Bivens action,\" Siegert, 500 U.S. at 234, 111 S.Ct. at 1794, and held that he had \"failed to satisfy the first inquiry in the examination of such a claim;  he failed to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\"  Id. at 231, 111 S.Ct. at 1793.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that currently applicable law cannot be considered in the course of, in addition to, or instead of determining the law in effect at the time of the alleged violation.  See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738 (\"On summary judgment, the judge appropriately may determine, not only the currently applicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action occurred.\").  For example, a court of appeals may recognize a right for the first time in that circuit, but find that it was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.  See Calhoun v. New York State Div. of Parole Officers, 999 F.2d 647, 655 (2d Cir.1993).  Or a court may look to current Supreme Court law to determine that, although the right may now exist, it was not clearly established before.  See St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 27-28.   A court may also bypass the qualified immunity analysis if it would be futile because current law forecloses the claim on the merits.  See Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 F.2d 774, 779-80 (10th Cir.1993).  We follow the latter course in this case because Aversa failed to state a claim under current law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aversa claimed that Walsh and Claunch deprived him of his right to liberty under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which protects against \"certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\"  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 665, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).  See also Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 879, 112 S.Ct. 226, 116 L.Ed.2d 183 (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  We have said that substantive due process is violated if either (1) the government actor deprived the plaintiff of an identified interest in life, liberty or property protected by the Fifth Amendment, or (2) the government actor's conduct \"shocks the conscience.\"   See Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 531 (1st Cir.1995) (citations omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1044, 134 L.Ed.2d 191 (1996).  Because Aversa did not address the latter theory below or in his brief to this court, we limit our discussion to the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), the Court indicated that a claim for defamation could rise to a constitutional level if accompanied by a loss of employment, but left unclear whether that loss would have to result from some further action by the defendant in addition to the defamation itself.  In Siegert v. Gilley, the Court made clear that it would.  Siegert resigned from his job as a psychologist at a federal hospital in order to avoid being terminated, then began working at an Army hospital.  Because Army hospitals required \"credentialing\" by a committee, Siegert signed a request form asking the federal hospital to provide his new employer with information regarding his job performance and privileges.  Gilley, Siegert's former supervisor, sent a letter in response, stating that he could not recommend Siegert for privileges as a psychologist, and that Siegert was inept, unethical and the most untrustworthy individual he had supervised in thirteen years.  The committee denied Siegert credentials.  Thereafter, Siegert was turned down for a position at another Army hospital and returned to work at the first Army hospital with provisional credentials.  After his administrative appeals were denied, his federal employment was terminated altogether.  Id. at 228-29, 111 S.Ct. at 1791-92.   The Court found that Gilley's defamatory statements and their consequences were not actionable as a deprivation of liberty, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>The alleged defamation was not uttered incident to the termination of Siegert's employment by the hospital, since he voluntarily resigned from his position at the hospital, and the letter was written several weeks later.  The statements contained in the letter would undoubtedly damage the reputation of one in his position, and impair his future employment prospects.  But the plaintiff in Paul v. Davis similarly alleged serious impairment of his future employment opportunities as well as other harm.  Most defamation plaintiffs attempt to show some sort of damage and out-of-pocket loss which flows from the injury to their reputation.  But so long as such damage flows from injury caused by the defendant to a plaintiff's reputation, it may be recoverable under state tort law but it is not recoverable in a Bivens action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 234, 111 S.Ct. at 1794.   Thus, what may have been left open by Davis was foreclosed by Siegert--in order to state a cognizable claim that defamation together with loss of employment worked a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty interest, a plaintiff must allege that the loss of employment resulted from some further action by the defendant in addition to the defamation.  Where it is the defendant who terminated the plaintiff, the further action is the termination.  But where, as here, a third party discharges or refuses to hire the plaintiff solely as a result of the defendant's defamation, the plaintiff has not described a viable constitutional claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

As to the first proposed addition, a plaintiff may sue for violation of a federal statute under section 1983 or Bivens if the statute \"create[s] enforceable rights, privileges, or immunities,\" which, in turn, depends on whether the provision \"was intend[ed] to benefit the putative plaintiff.\"  Wilder v.

Local Rule 35, entitled \"Release of Information by Attorneys in Criminal Cases,\" limits the information that may be made public before and during a criminal trial, and can be said to be intended to protect a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial.  We do not reach the question whether a civil cause of action could ever rest on Local Rule 35, because we do not think that Rule 35 was intended to protect against loss of employment or business goodwill.  Thus, denial of the request to amend was not error.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except where otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from Aversa's complaint. Daniel Aversa (\"Aversa\") and Vincent Mento (\"Mento\") were partners in a legitimate real estate business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In January of 1989, they sold a parcel of land, splitting the proceeds.  At the same time, Aversa was experiencing marital difficulties with his wife Carla.  In order to conceal some of his assets from his wife in the event of a divorce, Aversa asked Mento if he could deposit his share of the proceeds, amounting to $55,000, into Mento's personal bank account.  Mento agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both men were aware that domestic financial institutions were required to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 to the Secretary of the Treasury, see 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5313(a);  31 C.F.R. &#167; 103.22(a)(1), and wished to avoid causing a Currency Transaction Report (\"CTR\") to be filed.  Aversa therefore made a series of deposits into Mento's account in sums just under $10,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At the time, Aversa was unaware that structuring the transactions to avoid causing a CTR to be filed was a crime under federal law.  See 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5324(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1990, IRS agents contacted Aversa and informed him that he was under investigation for structuring deposits.  He immediately met with Assistant United States Attorney Walsh, and without an attorney present, explained that he was hiding the money from his wife, that it was not derived from an illegal source, and that he did not know that structuring was illegal.  Walsh told Aversa that he and Mento had been under investigation for some time and that he had no reason to believe the money was anything but \"clean,\" but said that he did not need to prove that it was derived from an illegal source or that Aversa knew that structuring was illegal.  Walsh told Aversa that there was no reason to seek counsel and encouraged him to plead guilty because all that was needed for a conviction was what Aversa had just told him.  In a later meeting with Aversa's counsel, Walsh said that he previously had been successful in prosecuting individuals for structuring in Miami, but that this case would be his first involving \"clean money,\" and he planned to use it to \"set a precedent\" and \"educate the public about the currency transaction reporting requirements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1990, Walsh obtained an indictment charging Aversa and Mento with conspiracy, structuring, and making false statements, and Aversa alone with attempting to cause a domestic financial institution to file a report containing a material omission or misstatement of fact.  That same day, Walsh, Claunch, and the United States Attorney for the District of New Hampshire, Jeffrey R. Howard (with whom Aversa alleged Walsh and Claunch conspired but who was not joined as a defendant) issued a press release and held a press conference announcing to the local and national news media, which reported to the public, that Aversa and Mento had been arrested for money laundering.  Walsh and Claunch knew that Aversa and Mento were not involved in laundering illegally-gotten money, or in drug trafficking, tax evasion or organized crime, but created the impression that they were.  An article in the Boston Globe dated June 29, 1990, reported:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Walsh said money laundering is usually done for purposes of tax evasion, drug dealing or organized crime.  He would not say if either of yesterday's indictments are related to these activities, but added after the news conference that \"it would be a fair statement\" to say authorities are looking into how [these] men amassed the sums of money involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh also stated that Aversa faced up to forty years in prison and added that the investigation was continuing and more charges would be filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A front-page article in the Concord Monitor dated June 29, 1990 reported:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>The indictments are a sign that prosecutors are serious about using the money laundering laws, a tool that allows them to charge people for handling money illegally without having to prove that the money was gained illegally, said Jeffrey Howard, U.S.A. attorney for New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>\"The indictments are important because they are examples of the commitment the I.R.S. has made ... to use the money laundering statutes in order to ferret out tax evasion, drug trafficking and other crimes,\" he said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Prosecutors declined to say how Aversa and Mento got the money or why they believe the men tried to evade the currency laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claunch stated at the press conference that \"[t]hese cases represent the IRS's commitment to ferreting out money launderers,\" and that the IRS wanted \"to send a message that money laundering is going to be detected, investigated and prosecuted to the full extent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1990, after Judge Loughlin granted the government's motion in limine to preclude a defense based on ignorance of the anti-structuring law, Aversa pled guilty to structuring.

No evidence had been adduced at Mento's trial that there was an underlying criminal purpose or that the source of the money was unexplained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Aversa's and Mento's sentencing, Judge Loughlin found that Aversa and Mento would bear the stigma of the \"totally false\" innuendoes reported in the media for the rest of their lives.  In a memorandum opinion ruling on Aversa's and Mento's post-conviction motions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the judge noted that the government had admitted that Aversa and Mento were \"not involved in drugs and not laundering ill-gotten gains and not keeping information from the United States,\" and found that the prosecutors' statements to the press were \"outrageous and unfair,\" \"misleading and cruel,\" \"self-serving and more than a little disingenuous,\" and \"smeared the reputation of these two men.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court vacated Aversa's and Mento's convictions, ruling that the willfulness requirement of the applicable criminal penalty provision, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5322(a), required the government to prove the violation of a known legal duty or the reckless disregard thereof, and that an unintentional, nonreckless mistake of law was a complete defense to a structuring charge.

The complaint alleged that Walsh and Claunch defamed Aversa for the purpose of personally benefitting in their careers, and that their false and misleading statements caused irreparable harm to Aversa's personal and business reputations and his business goodwill, caused him to be discharged from his job as an accountant, and prevented him from finding other employment as an accountant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was transferred from the District of New Hampshire to the District of Rhode Island.  Pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, the Attorney General certified that Walsh and Claunch acted within the scope of their federal employment and the United States was provisionally substituted as the party defendant.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).  Aversa was permitted to depose Walsh and Claunch in aid of his challenge to the scope certification, and he submitted the depositions and various exhibits to the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Thereafter, Magistrate Judge Lovegreen ruled that Walsh and Claunch were acting within the scope of their employment, thus converting the common law claims into claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2679(d)(1), 1346(b), then recommended that those claims be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising out of libel or slander.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).  Treating the defendants' motion to dismiss the constitutional claim as a motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment in favor of Walsh and Claunch on the basis that they were qualifiedly immune.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Magistrate Judge Lovegreen stated in his Report and Recommendation that he was in full agreement with Judge Loughlin's assessment of the defendants' conduct, and added that the \"defendants' extraordinarily poor judgment in making these statements should not go unnoticed.\"   In adopting the magistrate's Report and Recommendation in its entirety, United States District Judge Mary Lisi found that the defendants' \"publication of misleading information [was] lacking in professionalism and deserving of the opprobrium articulated by Judge Loughlin and Magistrate Lovegreen.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Congress, however, expressly excepted certain kinds of claims from the FTCA's otherwise broad waiver of sovereign immunity, including any claim arising out of slander and other specified intentional torts.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Thus, while a plaintiff with a claim not excepted from the right to sue the United States likely would choose to sue the government rather than or in addition to an individual who may be judgment-proof, a plaintiff with an excepted claim like the Aversas' would have no choice but to proceed solely against the employee.  The employee, however, might be found absolutely immune from suit according to federal common law principles.  See Howard v.

The Court, however, invited Congress to legislate standards defining the scope of federal employee immunity, since it was in the best position to resolve the \"complex and often highly empirical inquiry\" whether the \"contribution to effective government\" sufficiently \"outweighs the potential harm to individual citizens\" to warrant immunity in a particular context.

State Respondeat Superior Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the Westfall Act, federal employee immunity from suit for state law torts was decided according to federal common law.  The Westfall Act provides that a federal employee is immune if he or she acted \"within the scope of his office or employment,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(b)(1), which, according to the legislative history, is to be determined by the same law that had previously been used only to determine whether the United States could be sued under the FTCA:  the law of respondeat superior of the state in which the incident occurred.  See H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, supra, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1988 at 5949.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, we raised a concern about whether certain comments in the recent case of Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, supra, might indicate that scope of employment is to be determined according to federal common law rather than state respondeat superior law.  In that case, the Court concluded that a certification by the Attorney General or her delegate that the federal employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment is subject to judicial review for purposes of permanently substituting the United States as the party defendant.  515 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2234-36.   Amicus raised a potential Article III problem--that if the court concluded that the employee acted outside the scope of employment, and the plaintiff and defendant were not of diverse citizenship, there would no longer be a federal question to support subject matter jurisdiction once the federal employee was resubstituted.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2236.   A four-justice plurality concluded that Article III nonetheless was satisfied because \"there was a nonfrivolous federal question\" presented at the outset of the case.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2236 (emphasis in original).  Justice Ginsburg wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>At that time, the United States was the defendant, and the action was thus under the FTCA.  Whether the employee was acting within the scope of his federal employment is a significant federal question--and the Westfall Act was designed to assure that this question could be aired in a federal forum.  Because a case under the Westfall Act thus \"raises [a] questio[n] of substantive federal law at the very outset,\" it \"clearly 'arises under' federal law, as that term is used in Art.  III.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2236 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After further briefing in which both parties agreed that the plurality did not mean that the scope determination should be resolved by reference to federal rather than state law, we reach the same conclusion.  First, we think that all the plurality intended to address was whether there is a sufficient federal predicate to keep a Westfall Act case in federal court, once a determination has been made that the defendant was not acting within the scope of his federal employment.  The answer was yes, because at the outset, the case arose under a law of the United States (the FTCA), and the United States was a party.  See U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 2.  Second, even if Justice Ginsburg was referring in some measure to the scope determination, federal law does determine whether a person is a federal employee and the nature and contours of his or her federal responsibilities.  See Ezekiel v. Michel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705116\"><a href=\"/opinion/705116/annamma-a-ezekiel-and-al-ezekiel-v-jaime-t-michel-and-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span>, 899 (7th Cir.1995);  Platis v.

But state law governs whether the person was acting within the scope of that employment and those responsibilities.  As already noted, the legislative history is clear that Congress so intended, H.R.Rep. No. 100-700, supra, at 5949, and although we are the first to grapple with the meaning of the plurality's remarks in Gutierrez de Martinez, the courts of appeal, including our own, have concluded that state law controls.

Scannell, supra, that intentional torts are not within the scope of employment as a matter of law.  There, we stated that \"the tort charged (assault and battery) is one of the &#167; 2680(h) exceptions which could not by definition be within the scope of employment.\"  906 F.2d at 813 n. 16.   This remark, however, does not mean that intentional torts excepted by section 2680(h) are outside the scope of employment as a matter of federal law regardless of the law of respondeat superior of the state in which the tort occurred.  The assault at issue in Nasuti took place in Massachusetts, under whose law an assault is within the scope of employment only if done in response to some conduct of the plaintiff that interfered at the time with the employee's ability to do his or her job.  Id. at 805 n. 3 (citing Miller v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239249/miller-v-federated-department-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239249/miller-v-federated-department-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>, 579 (1973)).  Because the district court found no evidence of those circumstances, the assault on Nasuti was outside the scope of employment as a matter of Massachusetts law.  Generally, however, an intentional tort excepted by section 2680(h) can be within the scope of employment if state respondeat superior law so requires.  See, e.g., Henson v.

Because it is not in dispute that Aversa cannot sue the United States for defamation, there is subject matter jurisdiction only if Walsh and/or Claunch acted outside the scope of his employment.  It was Aversa's burden to persuade the court that they did.  Nasuti, 906 F.2d at 813 n. 16.   In ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), the district court must construe the complaint liberally, treating all well-pleaded facts as true and indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Murphy, 45 F.3d at 522.   In addition, the court may consider whatever evidence has been submitted, such as the depositions and exhibits submitted in this case.  Cf.

He found that because Walsh and Claunch were authorized to prepare press releases and participate in press conferences in order to keep the public informed, and because Howard approved the press releases, made the decision to hold the press conferences, and was present for the press conferences, the statements were either authorized or incidental to authorized duties.  The magistrate judge further found that Walsh and Claunch acted at least in part to serve their employers' interests in keeping the public informed of law enforcement efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aversa correctly argues that Walsh's defamatory statements to the press were not authorized.  Walsh testified that as an Assistant United States Attorney, he was expected to abide by the United States Attorneys' Manual (\"the Manual\") issued by his employer, the Department of Justice.  Chapter 7 of the Manual, entitled \"Media Relations,\" provides that \"fairness [and] accuracy ... must prevail in all dealings with the news media.\"   Manual, ch. 7, &#167; 1-7.001 (1988).  News conferences should not be held to announce indictments or arrests except in \"unusual circumstances,\" such as to alert the public about a fugitive from justice, and then \"extreme care\" should be taken to avoid statements branding an accused as guilty of a crime of which he or she has not been convicted.  Id.  Written news releases \"relating the essentials of the indictment\" may be distributed, and, with permission of the United States Attorney, an Assistant United States Attorney \"may answer legitimate questions about indictments or arrests, either in press conferences or in discussions with individual reporters, but answers should not go beyond explanation of what is in the public document or the confines of 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2.\"  Id.  The Manual provides that 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2 \"defines the types of information that may be and the types of information that may not be made available to the news media about pending ... criminal cases by employees of the Department of Justice.\"  Id. (emphasis in original).  Employees are to adhere to the regulation \"in both letter and spirit.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulation provides that, among other facts and circumstances not relevant here, Justice Department employees may make public the \"substance or text of the charge, such as a[n] indictment,\" and may disclose \"only incontrovertible, factual matters.\"  28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2(b)(3).  Release of information that would be prejudicial or would serve no law enforcement function is prohibited.  Id. &#167; 50.2(b)(3), (5), (6).  Statements which could \"reasonably be expected to influence the outcome of a pending or future trial,\" and statements concerning evidence in the case, whether or not anticipated to be used at trial, are prohibited.

See D.N.H. L.R. 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walsh admitted that, in dealing with the news media regarding a criminal case, he was not authorized to say anything that was inaccurate or misleading, not contained in a public document, or prejudicial to a defendant's right to a fair trial, or to otherwise contravene the directives of the Manual, 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2, or Local Rule 35.  The statements, as represented in the complaint and appearing in the press releases and news articles submitted to the court, transgressed these policies and rules and therefore were not authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Howard approved the press releases, made the decision to call the press conferences, and was present at the press conferences does not change that result.  Howard did not approve in advance any of Walsh's oral statements to the press.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Moreover, we do not think that Howard's approval can suffice as authorization for Walsh's defamatory statements.  An employee of the Department of Justice who wishes to release information beyond that allowed by 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2 must obtain permission from the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General, 28 C.F.R. &#167; 50.2(9), not the United States Attorney, and Walsh did not seek such approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although an employee's intentionally tortious act was not authorized, it may nonetheless have been within the scope of employment if it was \"incidental to authorized duties.\"   According to New Hampshire cases deciding whether assaults were within the scope of employment, the conduct must meet three requirements in order to be considered incidental to authorized duties:  (1) the employer authorized or could foresee that the employee would use a reasonable degree of force as a means of carrying out an authorized duty;  (2) the employee used excessive force, although wrongly, as a means of accomplishing an authorized duty;  and (3) the employee's purpose was, at least in part, to carry out an authorized duty.

If these conditions are met, it follows that the employer is liable for the employee's negligent or willful use of excessive force although the employer did not authorize it and even forbade it.  See Daigle, 534 A.2d at 699-700 (police officer's use of excessive force in effecting arrest was within scope of employment);  Richard, 109 A. at 91-92 (supervisor's use of excessive force in keeping employee at her work station was within scope of employment);  Rowell, 68 N.H. at 359, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3553544\"><a href=\"/opinion/3573322/rowell-v-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span> (conductor's use of excessive force in ejecting plaintiff from railroad car was within scope of employment).  If any one of the conditions is not met, the employee's conduct is outside the scope of employment.  Morin v.

Further, although unfortunate, we think that the Department of Justice reasonably could anticipate that an employee entrusted with that power might abuse it.  Analogously, the Daigle court stated that \"excessive force in the use of guns and nightsticks is always foreseeable.\"  534 A.2d at 700.   True, there were policies and regulations against the kinds of statements that were made, but an act which is forbidden or done in a forbidden manner may nonetheless be within the scope of employment.  Restatement, supra, &#167; 230.  A \"master cannot direct a servant to accomplish a result and anticipate that he will always use the means which he directs or will refrain from acts which it is natural to expect that servants may do.\"  Id., &#167; 230 cmt. b.

To be sure, Walsh's suggestions that Aversa was involved in drug trafficking, tax evasion and racketeering furthered no legitimate law enforcement objective and actually misinformed the public.  But his statements did inform the public about a recent prosecution under the anti-structuring laws.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court agrees with the Restatement's view that \"the criminal or tortious character of an employee's act does not, ipso facto, remove the act from the scope of employment,\" Daigle, 534 A.2d at 700 (citing Restatement, supra, &#167; 231), so long as it is \"exerted in, and for the purpose of, doing the employer's business.\"  Id.  And that court does not necessarily agree with the Restatement's view that, if these conditions are met, the degree of outrageousness of the conduct may remove it from the scope of employment.  Id.

Daigle, 534 A.2d at 699;  Restatement, supra, &#167; 228(1)(c).  This inquiry focuses on the subjective intent of the employee and his notion of how to serve his employer's interests need not be reasonable or reflective of good judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Aversa points out that the complaint, which the district court was required to take as true, alleged that Walsh defamed Aversa for the purpose of promoting his own career, and that Judge Loughlin found at least some of Walsh's statements to have been \"self-serving.\"   The complaint, however, also alleged that Walsh told Aversa's attorney that he planned to use the case to \"set a precedent\" and \"educate the public\" about the currency transaction reporting requirements.  During his deposition, Walsh did not deny that the media accurately reported his words and testified that he believed he was discharging his duty to inform the public in making these statements.  From this, the district court justifiably could find that Walsh intended, at least in part and although misguidedly, to serve an objective of his employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we have little doubt that the New Hampshire Supreme Court would hold Walsh's employer responsible for his defamatory statements.  We find further support for this conclusion in the Restatement's special rule for defamation, which embodies the general principle, recognized in the New Hampshire assault cases, that an employer should be held responsible when it entrusts an employee with a duty particularly susceptible of abuse to cause harm:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>A master is subject to liability for defamatory statements made by a servant acting within the scope of his employment....  If the scope of employment of a servant includes the making of statements concerning others which he believes to be true and privileged, the master is subject to liability for untrue and unprivileged defamatory statements made by the servant concerning such others, if the statements are otherwise within the scope of the servant's employment....  If the master employs a servant to speak for him, he is subject to liability if the servant makes a mistake as to the truth of the words spoken or as to the justification for speaking them, or even if he speaks with an improper motive, provided that he acts at least in part to serve his employer's purposes.  The master may be liable even though the servant knows the statement to be untrue, as where the manager of a store, for the purpose of obtaining an admission from a suspected thief, charges such person with other similar crimes, although having no belief in his own statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., &#167; 247 &amp; cmts. a, c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that the district court correctly held that Claunch acted within the scope of his employment.  One of his duties was to inform the public about tax and other cases in which the IRS was involved in order to deter violations of the law and to instill public confidence that the IRS prosecuted violators.  The IRS's policy statement on news coverage required Claunch to act with due regard for an individual's right to a fair trial and the public's right to know, and, particularly in view of the \"statutory prohibition on the disclosure of tax information,\" to strictly limit what he said to facts that were a matter of public record.  IRS Policy Statement P-1-181.  Aversa alleged that Claunch stated that the case represented the IRS's commitment to ferreting out, investigating and prosecuting money launderers.  Aversa was indicted for and convicted of violating the anti-structuring law, which was enacted as part of the \"Money Laundering Control Act of 1986.\"   See Pub.L. No. 99-570, Subtitle H, 100 Stat. 3207-18 (Oct. 27, 1986).  The legislative history, however, defines \"money laundering\" essentially as concealing money from the government (not one's spouse) for the purpose of covering up illegal activity or evading taxes.  See H.R.Rep. No. 746, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 16 (1986).  Aversa was not, therefore, a \"money launderer.\"   Nonetheless, we have no doubt that Claunch's employer would be held responsible for his statement under the principles of New Hampshire law set forth above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Walsh and Claunch acted within the scope of their employment, the United States was properly substituted as the party defendant, and the common law claims were properly dismissed pursuant to the exception to jurisdiction under the FTCA for claims arising from libel and slander.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Relying on Bivens, the Aversas alleged in Count I of their complaint that Walsh and Claunch deprived Aversa of a liberty interest guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by making false and misleading statements to the press with willful or reckless disregard of his rights, thus causing his employer to discharge him from his job as an accountant, preventing him from finding other employment as an accountant, and damaging his business goodwill.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Walsh and Claunch, finding that they were qualifiedly immune from suit.

Id. at 233, 111 S.Ct. at 1793-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts have read this language as requiring a resolution of the merits under current law before beginning the analysis of the law as it stood at the time of the alleged violation.  See DiMeglio v. Haines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687282\"><a href=\"/opinion/687282/frank-m-dimeglio-v-j-robert-haines-individually-and-in-his-former/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 795-97 (4th Cir.1995) (discussing various interpretations of Siegert ).   But we think that these statements, read in context, simply mean that the plaintiff must assert a clearly established federal constitutional (or statutory) right, and not merely a state law tort claim.  The Siegert Court concluded that the damage Siegert alleged \"may be recoverable under state tort law but it is not recoverable in a Bivens action,\" Siegert, 500 U.S. at 234, 111 S.Ct. at 1794, and held that he had \"failed to satisfy the first inquiry in the examination of such a claim;  he failed to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\"  Id. at 231, 111 S.Ct. at 1793.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that currently applicable law cannot be considered in the course of, in addition to, or instead of determining the law in effect at the time of the alleged violation.  See Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738 (\"On summary judgment, the judge appropriately may determine, not only the currently applicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action occurred.\").  For example, a court of appeals may recognize a right for the first time in that circuit, but find that it was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.  See Calhoun v. New York State Div. of Parole Officers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612090\"><a href=\"/opinion/612090/bennie-f-calhoun-v-new-york-state-division-of-parole-officers-j-mcquire/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span>, 655 (2d Cir.1993).  Or a court may look to current Supreme Court law to determine that, although the right may now exist, it was not clearly established before.  See St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 27-28.   A court may also bypass the qualified immunity analysis if it would be futile because current law forecloses the claim on the merits.  See Hinton v. City of Elwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610700\"><a href=\"/opinion/610700/kenneth-l-hinton-for-himself-and-as-father-and-next-friend-of-kamilah/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 779-80 (10th Cir.1993).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1976), the Court indicated that a claim for defamation could rise to a constitutional level if accompanied by a loss of employment, but left unclear whether that loss would have to result from some further action by the defendant in addition to the defamation itself.  In Siegert v. Gilley, the Court made clear that it would.  Siegert resigned from his job as a psychologist at a federal hospital in order to avoid being terminated, then began working at an Army hospital.  Because Army hospitals required \"credentialing\" by a committee, Siegert signed a request form asking the federal hospital to provide his new employer with information regarding his job performance and privileges.  Gilley, Siegert's former supervisor, sent a letter in response, stating that he could not recommend Siegert for privileges as a psychologist, and that Siegert was inept, unethical and the most untrustworthy individual he had supervised in thirteen years.  The committee denied Siegert credentials.  Thereafter, Siegert was turned down for a position at another Army hospital and returned to work at the first Army hospital with provisional credentials.  After his administrative appeals were denied, his federal employment was terminated altogether.  Id. at 228-29, 111 S.Ct. at 1791-92.   The Court found that Gilley's defamatory statements and their consequences were not actionable as a deprivation of liberty, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>The alleged defamation was not uttered incident to the termination of Siegert's employment by the hospital, since he voluntarily resigned from his position at the hospital, and the letter was written several weeks later.  The statements contained in the letter would undoubtedly damage the reputation of one in his position, and impair his future employment prospects.  But the plaintiff in Paul v. Davis similarly alleged serious impairment of his future employment opportunities as well as other harm.  Most defamation plaintiffs attempt to show some sort of damage and out-of-pocket loss which flows from the injury to their reputation.  But so long as such damage flows from injury caused by the defendant to a plaintiff's reputation, it may be recoverable under state tort law but it is not recoverable in a Bivens action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 234, 111 S.Ct. at 1794.   Thus, what may have been left open by Davis was foreclosed by Siegert--in order to state a cognizable claim that defamation together with loss of employment worked a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty interest, a plaintiff must allege that the loss of employment resulted from some further action by the defendant in addition to the defamation.  Where it is the defendant who terminated the plaintiff, the further action is the termination.  But where, as here, a third party discharges or refuses to hire the plaintiff solely as a result of the defendant's defamation, the plaintiff has not described a viable constitutional claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

Davis.\"  Celia v. O'Malley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551475\"><a href=\"/opinion/551475/nicholas-v-celia-jr-v-william-c-omalley-and-joseph-p-gaughan/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span>, 1021 (1st Cir.1990).  In any event, Aversa did not present this theory to the district court and we decline to consider it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The characterizations of the defendants' conduct are quotations from the various trial judges who have heard the proceedings in this and the underlying criminal cases.  This court makes no findings itself as to the defendants' conduct, but acts on the basis of the record</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
