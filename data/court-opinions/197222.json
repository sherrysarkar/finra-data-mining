Appellant Alan D. Emerson has\r                                           \r\n\nbeen  ordered to  pay a  civil penalty  of $185,000  for numerous\r\n\nviolations  of  federal  aviation  law.1    He  claims  that  the\r\n\nassessment violates both the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth\r\n\nAmendment and the Double Jeopardy Clause of  the Fifth Amendment.\r\n\nWe find no constitutional error, and therefore affirm.\r\n\n               I. Factual and Procedural Background\r                                                             \r\n\n     On  February  15, 1994,  the  administrator  of the  Federal\r\n\nAviation Administration (FAA) issued  an emergency order revoking\r\n\nEmerson's commercial pilot certificate.  The action was based  on\r\n\nallegations  that Emerson  was responsible  for more  than thirty\r\n\nunlawful flights.  About  a month later,  on March 29, 1994,  the\r\n\nUnited  States filed  the complaint  that underlies  this appeal,\r\n\nseeking civil penalties based on the same  conduct that triggered\r\n\nthe FAA order, namely, the operation of charter flights after FAA\r\n\nauthorization to conduct  such flights  had been  revoked.2   The\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  The complaint in this case also was filed against Emerson\r\nd/b/a  Emerson Aviation.  Emerson Aviation no longer exists as an\r\nenterprise,  and  we refer  throughout  this  opinion to  Emerson\r\nindividually  as   the  sole  defendant/appellant.     We   note,\r\nadditionally, that a corporation named Emerson Aviation, Inc. was\r\nformed in 1994 after the  violations at issue in this case.   The\r\n\"New  Emerson\"  acquired many  of Emerson  Aviation's operations,\r\nassets and  liabilities, though  no compensation passed  from one\r\nentity  to the  other.   Appellant's  wife  is president  of  New\r\nEmerson, and he testified at trial that he is an employee without\r\nany role as officer or shareholder.\r\n\n     2  In  May  1992,  the  FAA  had  revoked  Emerson's \"Airman\r\nCertificate\" and Emerson Aviation's \"Air  Taxi Certificate,\" both\r\nof which were required for  appellant to operate charter flights.\r\nIn its 1992 order, the FAA found that Emerson \".  . . lack[s] the\r\nrequired  care, judgment  and responsibility  . .  .\" to  hold an\r\nAirman  Certificate.  It determined, inter alia, that Emerson had\r                                                         \r\noperated an aircraft  that was not in airworthy condition, having\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncomplaint sought  a $10,000  penalty for each  alleged violation.\r\n\nAn  amended  complaint later  increased  the  number of  asserted\r\n\nviolations to fifty-three.\r\n\n     Emerson  filed  several  motions  seeking  to   dismiss  the\r\n\ncomplaint, arguing, inter alia, that requiring him  to defend the\r                                        \r\n\nsame allegations in both the administrative and civil proceedings\r\n\nconstituted  a  violation of  the Double  Jeopardy Clause  of the\r\n\nFifth Amendment.   He  also claimed that  the monetary  penalties\r\n\nsought  were in  violation of  the Excessive  Fines Clause.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  denied  the  motions,  finding  that  the  FAA's\r\n\nadministrative  action  was  remedial  in  nature,   rather  than\r\n\npunitive, and that double  jeopardy principles therefore were not\r\n\nimplicated.  The court  made no explicit ruling on  the excessive\r\n\nfines issue.\r\n\n     In March 1996, Emerson  and the United States stipulated  to\r\n\nthe district court that  twenty-six of the flights alleged  to be\r\n\nunlawful  were  operated  in  violation   of  applicable  federal\r\n\naviation law  and regulations.   Eleven of those  were round-trip\r\n\nflights,  and  thus  were  counted as  two  separate  violations,\r\n\nbringing  the  total number  of  admitted  violations to  thirty-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nfailed to repair a crack that he knew about and that rendered the\r\naircraft unairworthy.   The FAA  found that an  emergency in  air\r\nsafety existed,  and it ordered  an immediate revocation  of both\r\ncertificates.   On  appeal,  the National  Transportation  Safety\r\nBoard upheld the revocations. \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nseven.3   The stipulation  left for trial  only the issue  of the\r\n\nappropriate penalty.\r\n\n     A  two-day bench trial  was held in  April 1996.   The court\r\n\nrejected Emerson's claim  that he held  a good-faith belief  that\r\n\nthe  flights were lawful, and  imposed a civil  penalty of $5,000\r\n\nper violation, for a total of $185,000.  In  reducing the penalty\r\n\nfrom  that requested by the government (at that point, $8,500 per\r\n\nviolation,  or  $314,500),  the  court  noted  Emerson's  limited\r\n\nfinancial  ability  to pay  the higher  amount.   It  also found,\r\n\nhowever,  that a  significant  civil penalty  was appropriate  in\r\n\nlight  of  the  nature,  circumstances,  extent  and  gravity  of\r\n\nEmerson's violations, his knowledge  or reckless disregard of the\r\n\nlaw, his extensive enforcement history, and the effect of a large\r\n\npenalty in  deterring future violators and  fostering respect for\r\n\nand compliance with the law.4\r\n\n     This appeal followed.  Emerson again asserts that imposition\r\n\nof  the civil penalty subsequent to the FAA administrative action\r\n\nviolates the Double Jeopardy Clause, and contends that the amount\r\n\nof that penalty transgresses the Excessive Fines Clause.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3 Emerson argued before the  district court that each round-\r\ntrip flight constituted only a single violation.   The government\r\ncontended  that  the applicable  precedent  required  them to  be\r\ncounted  as two separate violations.  Emerson does not raise this\r\nargument on appeal, and we therefore do not consider it.\r\n\n     4  The court also issued a  permanent injunction that, inter\r                                                                           \r\nalia,  barred Emerson  and Emerson  Aviation from  performing any\r              \r\naviation-related acts without proper FAA authority to do so. \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n                    II.

United States, 509 U.S. 602, 606-12 (1993); id. at 627\r                                                                    \r\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring  in the judgment);\r\n\nBrowning-Ferris Industries v.

Although precedent provides no precise guideposts\r\n\nfor  evaluating  a  fine's \"excessiveness,\"  Justice  Scalia  has\r\n\nobserved that \"the touchstone is value of the fine in relation to\r\n\nthe offense,\"  Austin, 509 U.S. at 627  (Scalia, J., concurring).\r                               \r\n\nSee  also  Harmelin v.

(assuming for the sake of  argument that\r\n\n\"excessive fines\" means \"disproportionate fines\").  \r\n\n     Here, the court  imposed a  fine one-half the  size of  that\r\n\npermitted by the relevant  statute, assessing $5,000 for each  of\r\n\nEmerson's   thirty-seven  admitted  violations  rather  than  the\r\n\nstatutory  maximum of  $10,000 per  violation.   See 49  U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n46301(a)(2).6    We  are  persuaded  that  this  penalty,  though\r\n\nsubstantial, is constitutionally permissible.  Cf. United  States\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5 The government contends that Emerson waived this  issue by\r\nfailing to raise it  after the district court imposed  a specific\r                                    \r\nfine,  asserting only an abstract  claim in pretrial motions that\r\nthe  maximum penalty permitted by statute was excessive.  We have\r\ndoubts  that the claim  was preserved, but  nonetheless choose to\r\nconsider  it briefly.   See Cheffer  v. Reno, 55  F.3d 1517, 1523\r                                                      \r\n(11th Cir. 1995) (\"[C]hallenges  under the Excessive Fines clause\r\nare .  . .  generally not  ripe until  the actual,  or impending,\r\nimposition of the challenged fine.\").\r\n\n     6 At the time of Emerson's violations in 1992 and 1993, this\r\nprovision was codified at 49 U.S.C. App.   1471.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nv.  Pilgrim Market  Corp.,  944  F.2d  14,  22  (1st  Cir.  1991)\r                                   \r\n\n(upholding penalty against Eighth  Amendment challenge where fine\r\n\nwas  less than  half the  statutory maximum  and one-half  of the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendation).\r\n\n     We  note  initially  that  the  district  court   thoroughly\r\n\nexplored  Emerson's explanation for the underlying violations, as\r\n\nwell  as  his  enforcement  history,  and   found  a  pattern  of\r\n\npersistent  disregard of  government regulation.   The  court was\r\n\nunimpressed  with Emerson's  evidence that  he held  a good-faith\r\n\nbelief  that the  flights were  lawful,7 and  found \"particularly\r\n\nunpersuasive\" evidence  of reliance on  advice from counsel.   It\r\n\nfurther rejected  Emerson's contention  that the large  number of\r\n\nadmitted  violations  and  the  record  of  his  past  regulatory\r\n\nproblems overstated the severity of his actual conduct:\r\n\n     It is of no moment that many of the violations involved\r\n     record-keeping  or other  technical functions  and that\r\n     none resulted in serious  personal injury.  The federal\r\n     aviation laws safeguard  public safety as  a collective\r\n     whole and compliance with the entire regulatory scheme,\r\n     and  not just the rules  governing matters that have an\r\n     immediate  and  direct  effect  on life  and  limb,  is\r\n     presumed.   The maintenance of proper  records and like\r\n     tasks  is  a crucial  component  in  the prevention  of\r\n     accidents and, as such, the failure to comply cannot be\r\n     viewed  as a  benign  violation simply  because of  the\r\n     clerical   or  technical   nature   of   the   violated\r\n     regulations.\r\n\nOpinion at 13-14.\r\n\n     We  detect  no  flaw  in  the  court's reasoning  that  even\r\n\ntechnical air safety rules  are important, and no clear  error in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7  The  court  felt  that  his  explanations  were based  on\r\n\"convenient   interpretations\"   of   federal  regulations   that\r\n\"strain[ed] reason and common sense\".  Opinion at 11. \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nits finding that Emerson did, in fact, engage in repeated, highly\r\n\nculpable conduct.   See Sullivan  v. Young Bros.  &amp; Co., 91  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n242,  246-47 (1st Cir. 1996).   With this supportable foundation,\r\n\nthe  conclusion the  court  drew --  that  the latest  series  of\r\n\nviolations  warranted   a  significant  penalty   --  is  equally\r\n\nunassailable.  Moreover, the  court recognized that a substantial\r\n\npenalty would be important as a deterrent to potential violators,\r\n\nsince  \"aviation   safety  rests  in  large   part  on  voluntary\r\n\ncompliance  by those who, in all probability, will never face the\r\n\nregulatory scrutiny  encountered by the defendants.\"   Opinion at\r\n\n15.\r\n\n     Despite these  conclusions inclining it toward  a penalty at\r\n\nor  near the magnitude requested by the government, the court did\r\n\nnot  order such a  fine.  It gave  offsetting effect to Emerson's\r\n\nlimited  financial  resources.   Although  he  continues to  earn\r\n\nincome from an aviation  business and has ownership  interests in\r\n\nvarious real  estate and  airplanes, the evidence  indicated that\r\n\nthe properties are heavily mortgaged and that Emerson also owes a\r\n\nsubstantial tax debt.  Based on his economic circumstances alone,\r\n\nthe  court reduced  the  penalty from  the government's  proposed\r\n\n$8,500 per violation to $5,000 per violation, producing the total\r\n\nfine of $185,000.\r\n\n     We  are  hardpressed  to  see the  \"excessiveness\"  in  this\r\n\nthoughtfully  levied   fine.    First,  as   noted  earlier,  the\r\n\n\"touchstone\"  is the  value  of  the  fine  in  relation  to  the\r\n\nparticular offense, not the  defendant's means.  Moreover, though\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nEmerson appears at  present not to have the  resources to pay the\r\n\nentire  penalty,  he is  employed and,  still  in his  early 50s,\r\n\nshould have longterm future earning potential.8  In addition, the\r\n\ncontinuing nature  of the obligation has  significance beyond the\r\n\namount; the fact that the debt  will remain with Emerson for some\r\n\ntime to come  is a  sobering reality that  should discourage  him\r\n\n(and   deter   others)   from   committing   future   violations.\r\n\nAdditionally, if  Emerson's future prospects become  more clearly\r\n\nlimited, and the fine  consequently becomes more clearly onerous,\r\n\nno barrier apparently exists to his seeking an amelioration  from\r\n\nthe district court.\r\n\n     In short,  the district court's judgment  reflects a careful\r\n\nbalance  between Emerson's  means and the  justifiable punishment\r\n\nfor these latest violations.   Thus, the fine bears  a reasonable\r\n\nrelationship  not only to the  offense but also  to the offender.\r\n\nConsequently, it does not offend the Constitution.9\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8 Emerson testified at trial that New Emerson offers various\r\naviation  services  to  the  public,  including  scenic  flights,\r\naircraft  maintenance,  hangar  services,  mechanic's  work,  and\r\nflight  instruction.     Although,  as   noted  earlier,  Emerson\r\npresently has no ownership  interest in the company, New  Emerson\r\nacquired  all  of  Emerson  Aviation's  affairs  and  his  future\r\nrelationship with the company therefore remains to be seen.\r\n\n     9 Emerson  argues that in determining  excessiveness we must\r\nconsider whether the penalty  imposed here is disproportionate to\r\nsuch penalties in similar cases, and offers in comparison several\r\ncases involving regulatory violations  that he claims demonstrate\r\nthe unfairness of  his punishment.   We note,  firstly, that  the\r\nproportionality concern  in an excessive fines  case is generally\r\nconsidered  to  be a  question of  \"whether  the fine  imposed is\r\ndisproportionate  to the crime  committed,\" Harmelin v. Michigan,\r                                                                          \r\n501  U.S. 957, 1009 (1991) (White, J., dissenting), not whether a\r\ngiven  fine is disproportionate  to other fines  imposed on other\r\ndefendants.  Although review of penalties in similar cases may be\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n                    III. Double Jeopardy Issue\r                                                        \r\n\n     Emerson alternatively seeks to invalidate the fine under the\r\n\nDouble  Jeopardy  Clause,  claiming  that it  constituted  double\r\n\npunishment in light of the earlier administrative sanction of de-\r\n\ncertification.  There is no contention that the civil fine is not\r\n\npunitive;  the  issue  is the  nature  of  the  FAA penalty  that\r\n\npreceded it.  If  the certificate revocation is  remedial, rather\r\n\nthan punitive, the later fine is permissible.\r\n\n     We recently have established that, in determining whether an\r\n\nadministrative  action constitutes punishment for double jeopardy\r\n\npurposes, a court must consider\r\n\n     the totality of the circumstances, including the source\r\n     of  the   authority  under   which  the   debarment  is\r\n     imposable,  the  goals  underpinning   the  authorizing\r\n     statute, the order itself,  the purposes it serves, and\r\n     the circumstances attendant to its promulgation.\r\n\nUnited  States v.

The\r\n\ncourt noted that  the FAA's investigation  of Emerson revealed  a\r\n\nnumber of  unsafe and unlawful  practices, and observed  that the\r\n\ndecision  to  limit  the  defendant's  flying  privileges  was  a\r\n\n\"logical[]\"  response.

Therefore,\r\n     the Administrator finds that the safety in air commerce\r\n     or  air transportation and  the public interest require\r\n     the revocation of your  Airman Certificate No. 2130849,\r\n     with all its ratings  and privileges.  Furthermore, the\r\n     Administrator finds that an emergency exists and safety\r\n     in  air  commerce or  air  transportation requires  the\r\n     immediate effectiveness of this Order.\r\n\nFAA's  Emergency  Order  of Revocation  at  5.    The \"facts  and\r\n\ncircumstances\" to which the  order referred included both details\r\n\nof  the current  violations and  a listing  of prior  violations.\r\n\nAlthough  it unquestionably  is true  that a  governing authority\r\n\nmight  view  this  record   of  unlawful  conduct  as  warranting\r\n\npunishment, the emphasis here is not on  slapping Emerson's wrist\r\n\nbut on preventing him  from continuing to present a  safety risk.\r\n\nHe  is deprived of his Airman Certification not as punishment for\r\n\nbad  conduct, but because he  is \"not qualified.\"   The immediate\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nimplementation of the order  further buttresses the judgment that\r\n\nit originated out of a concern for safety, not retribution.  \r\n\n     Emerson  acknowledges  that  the  language  of  the  statute\r\n\nauthorizing the license revocation, 49 U.S.C.A.   44701,\r\n\nsuggests that the FAA's only purposes are non-punitive: to ensure\r\n\nsafety and  competence in aviation.   He contends,  however, that\r\n\nthe most severe of the available enforcement options -- including\r\n\nde-certification --  are,  in fact,  punitive,  and he  cites  in\r\n\nsupport  a  1994  memorandum  describing  aspects  of  the  FAA's\r\n\n\"Compliance  and Enforcement Program.\"  See App. at 311-314.  The\r                                                     \r\n\ndocument notes that the FAA's program ranges from educational and\r\n\nremedial  efforts   to  \"punitive  legal   enforcement  remedies,\r\n\nincluding  criminal sanctions.\"    Id.  at  312.    He  cites  in\r                                                \r\n\nparticular   a   section   of  the   memorandum   that  describes\r\n\n\"progressive discipline,\" starting with a letter of correction to\r\n\na  first-time  violator  and  culminating in  \"a  punitive  legal\r\n\nenforcement  sanction,  i.e.,  a  civil  penalty  or  certificate\r\n\nsuspension,\" for  offenders who  fail to sustain  compliance with\r\n\nthe law.  Id. at 313-14.\r                       \r\n\n     On the basis of this memorandum, Emerson points out that the\r\n\nFAA Administrator plainly views  his enforcement power to include\r\n\npunitive and  deterrent measures,  and he  maintains that it  was\r\n\nthis punitive power that  was used against him in  the revocation\r\n\norder.  We  addressed a  somewhat similar argument  in Allen,  80\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d at 574, where  the petitioner contended that  the increasing\r\n\nlength  of a driver's license  suspension based on  the number of\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\noffenses reflected a  punitive aim.   We acknowledged there  that\r\n\ntying the severity  of a  penalty to the  number of offenses  may\r\n\nindicate a retributive intent,  but pointed out that it  also may\r\n\nreflect  a protective  intent.   The  escalating suspensions,  we\r\n\nobserved,  reflected a desire  to protect  the public  from those\r\n\nwho, on average, present the greatest safety hazard -- recidivist\r\n\ndrunk drivers.\r\n\n     So, too, here.   Following the reference to  \"punitive legal\r\n\nenforcement  sanction[s]\"  in  the  FAA  memorandum  stressed  by\r\n\nEmerson, see id.  at 314, the  document states that,  \"Repetitive\r                          \r\n\nviolations by a certificate holder may even demonstrate a lack of\r                                                                           \r\n\nqualification  warranting  certificate  revocation.\"    (Emphasis\r                       \r\n\nadded.)   This  is precisely  the basis  given for  revocation of\r\n\nEmerson's certificate.  See supra at 10 (\"[T]he Administrator has\r                                           \r\n\ndetermined  that   you  are  not  qualified  to  hold  an  Airman\r\n\nCertification, in that you  lack the required care,  judgment and\r\n\nresponsibility.\").    Thus,  making  our   conclusion  even  more\r\n\ncompelling   than  in   Allen,   the  remedial   nature  of   the\r                                       \r\n\nadministrative sanction is explicit.  \r\n\n     Characterizing  the sanction as primarily remedial does not,\r\n\nof course,  mean that  we must conclude  that it has  had neither\r\n\ndeterrent  nor punitive effect.   Unquestionably, the loss of his\r\n\nlicense  has  had a  severe impact  on  Emerson and  his aviation\r\n\nbusiness.  It  is equally  apparent that the  FAA's more  serious\r\n\nenforcement  measures  are  designed  with  deterrence  at  least\r\n\npartially  in mind.  Yet, we previously have recognized that \"the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nfact  that something  akin to punishment  occurs along  with, and\r\n\nincidental to, a sanction's  overriding remedial purpose will not\r\n\ntransform a permissible civil  penalty into a prohibited multiple\r\n\npunishment,\"  Stoller, 78  F.3d at 724.  Likewise,  the fact that\r                               \r\n\ndeterrence is  among the  objectives underlying a  civil sanction\r\n\n\"is merely one factor to be taken into account  in the decisional\r\n\ncalculus,\" Allen,  80 F.3d at 576 (citing Bae v. Shalala, 44 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n489,  494  (7th Cir.  1995)).   Indeed,  deterrence should  be an\r\n\nanticipated byproduct of aggressive safety enforcement.\r\n\n     We note,  finally, Emerson's  reliance on Pangburn  v. Civil\r                                                                           \r\n\nAeronautics Bd., 311 F.2d  349, 354-55 (1st Cir. 1962),  where we\r                         \r\n\nheld that the Civil Aeronautics Board could order revocation as a\r\n\nsanction    for   \"disciplinary   purposes,\"   apart   from   the\r\n\nqualifications or competency of a  pilot.  Having such  authority\r\n\ndoes not  mean, however,  that it  is  wielded in  every case  of\r\n\nrevocation.  Here, as  we have explained, the  evidence persuades\r\n\nus  that the sanction  \"displays colors more  consistent with the\r\n\nremedial  end  of  the  spectrum,\"   Stoller,  78  F.3d  at  721.\r                                                      \r\n\nConsequently,  the  district court  did  not err  in  refusing to\r\n\ndismiss the civil action on double jeopardy grounds.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                        \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n",

Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1994, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order revoking Emerson's commercial pilot certificate.  The action was based on allegations that Emerson was responsible for more than thirty unlawful flights.  About a month later, on March 29, 1994, the United States filed the complaint that underlies this appeal, seeking civil penalties based on the same conduct that triggered the FAA order, namely, the operation of charter flights after FAA authorization to conduct such flights had been revoked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The complaint sought a $10,000 penalty for each alleged violation.  An amended complaint later increased the number of asserted violations to fifty-three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson filed several motions seeking to dismiss the complaint, arguing, inter alia, that requiring him to defend the same allegations in both the administrative and civil proceedings constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  He also claimed that the monetary penalties sought were in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause.  The district court denied the motions, finding that the FAA's administrative action was remedial in nature, rather than punitive, and that double jeopardy principles therefore were not implicated.  The court made no explicit ruling on the excessive fines issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Emerson and the United States stipulated to the district court that twenty-six of the flights alleged to be unlawful were operated in violation of applicable federal aviation law and regulations.  Eleven of those were round-trip flights, and thus were counted as two separate violations, bringing the total number of admitted violations to thirty-seven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The stipulation left for trial only the issue of the appropriate penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A two-day bench trial was held in April 1996.  The court rejected Emerson's claim that he held a good-faith belief that the flights were lawful, and imposed a civil penalty of $5,000 per violation, for a total of $185,000, 927 F.Supp. 23.   In reducing the penalty from that requested by the government (at that point, $8,500 per violation, or $314,500), the court noted Emerson's limited financial ability to pay the higher amount.  It also found, however, that a significant civil penalty was appropriate in light of the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of Emerson's violations, his knowledge or reckless disregard of the law, his extensive enforcement history, and the effect of a large penalty in deterring future violators and fostering respect for and compliance with the law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.  Emerson again asserts that imposition of the civil penalty subsequent to the FAA administrative action violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, and contends that the amount of that penalty transgresses the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Excessive Fines Issue<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Excessive Fines Clause protects individuals against abusive penalties imposed by the government.

Although precedent provides no precise guideposts for evaluating a fine's \"excessiveness,\" Justice Scalia has observed that \"the touchstone is value of the fine in relation to the offense,\" Austin, 509 U.S. at 627, 113 S.Ct. at 2815 (Scalia, J., concurring).  See also Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 978 n. 9, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2693 n. 9, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.)

See 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46301(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We are persuaded that this penalty, though substantial, is constitutionally permissible.  Cf. United States v. Pilgrim Market Corp., 944 F.2d 14, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (upholding penalty against Eighth Amendment challenge where fine was less than half the statutory maximum and one-half of the government's recommendation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note initially that the district court thoroughly explored Emerson's explanation for the underlying violations, as well as his enforcement history, and found a pattern of persistent disregard of government regulation.  The court was unimpressed with Emerson's evidence that he held a good-faith belief that the flights were lawful,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and found \"particularly unpersuasive\" evidence of reliance on advice from counsel.  It further rejected Emerson's contention that the large number of admitted violations and the record of his past regulatory problems overstated the severity of his actual conduct:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>It is of no moment that many of the violations involved record-keeping or other technical functions and that none resulted in serious personal injury.  The federal aviation laws safeguard public safety as a collective whole and compliance with the entire regulatory scheme, and not just the rules governing matters that have an immediate and direct effect on life and limb, is presumed.  The maintenance of proper records and like tasks is a crucial component in the prevention of accidents and, as such, the failure to comply cannot be viewed as a benign violation simply because of the clerical or technical nature of the violated regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">927 F.Supp. at 28-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We detect no flaw in the court's reasoning that even technical air safety rules are important, and no clear error in its finding that Emerson did, in fact, engage in repeated, highly culpable conduct.  See Sullivan v. Young Bros. &amp; Co., 91 F.3d 242, 246-47 (1st Cir.1996).  With this supportable foundation, the conclusion the court drew--that the latest series of violations warranted a significant penalty--is equally unassailable.  Moreover, the court recognized that a substantial penalty would be important as a deterrent to potential violators, since \"aviation safety rests in large part on voluntary compliance by those who, in all probability, will never face the regulatory scrutiny encountered by the defendants.\"  927 F.Supp. at 29 .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these conclusions inclining it toward a penalty at or near the magnitude requested by the government, the court did not order such a fine.  It gave offsetting effect to Emerson's limited financial resources.  Although he continues to earn income from an aviation business and has ownership interests in various real estate and airplanes, the evidence indicated that the properties are heavily mortgaged and that Emerson also owes a substantial tax debt.  Based on his economic circumstances alone, the court reduced the penalty from the government's proposed $8,500 per violation to $5,000 per violation, producing the total fine of $185,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are hardpressed to see the \"excessiveness\" in this thoughtfully levied fine.  First, as noted earlier, the \"touchstone\" is the value of the fine in relation to the particular offense, not the defendant's means.  Moreover, though Emerson appears at present not to have the resources to pay the entire penalty, he is employed and, still in his early 50s, should have longterm future earning potential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In addition, the continuing nature of the obligation has significance beyond the amount;  the fact that the debt will remain with Emerson for some time to come is a sobering reality that should discourage him (and deter others) from committing future violations.  Additionally, if Emerson's future prospects become more clearly limited, and the fine consequently becomes more clearly onerous, no barrier apparently exists to his seeking an amelioration from the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district court's judgment reflects a careful balance between Emerson's means and the justifiable punishment for these latest violations.  Thus, the fine bears a reasonable relationship not only to the offense but also to the offender.  Consequently, it does not offend the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Double Jeopardy Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson alternatively seeks to invalidate the fine under the Double Jeopardy Clause, claiming that it constituted double punishment in light of the earlier administrative sanction of decertification.  There is no contention that the civil fine is not punitive;  the issue is the nature of the FAA penalty that preceded it.  If the certificate revocation is remedial, rather than punitive, the later fine is permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently have established that, in determining whether an administrative action constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes, a court must consider</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>the totality of the circumstances, including the source of the authority under which the debarment is imposable, the goals underpinning the authorizing statute, the order itself, the purposes it serves, and the circumstances attendant to its promulgation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 721 (1st Cir.1996) (administrative debarment by FDIC);  see also Allen v. Attorney General of State of Maine, 80 F.3d 569, 573 (1st Cir.1996) (driver's license suspension).  We have recognized that \"the force of a double jeopardy claim depends upon the particular circumstances of each individual case,\" id. at 576, and have identified \"[t]he pivotal question\" to be \"whether the sanction, as applied, exacts rough remedial justice,\" id. at 576-77 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thoroughly explored the double jeopardy question within this framework.  See Order of March 29, 1996.  We see no need to revisit its conclusion that the FAA's authority and goals are anchored in a concern for air safety.  See Order at 6-7;  see also, e.g., 49 U.S.C.A. &#167; 44701 (previously 49 U.S.C.App. &#167; 1421).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further examined whether the FAA's specific enforcement action in this case was tailored to the remedial goals of federal aviation law, and determined that it was.  The court noted that the FAA's investigation of Emerson revealed a number of unsafe and unlawful practices, and observed that the decision to limit the defendant's flying privileges was a \"logical[ ]\" response.  It further noted that Emerson was not subject to a monetary fine, which, in some instances, would suggest a punitive goal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analogizing the FAA's action here to the administrative decision in Allen to suspend the driver's license of an individual arrested for drunk driving, see 80 F.3d at 574, the district court noted our holding that the license suspension \" 'represents a reasonable effort to protect the public from motorists who have demonstrated a dangerous propensity to drink before they drive.' \"   It then continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>The safety concerns underlying federal aviation laws, no less than those which give rise to state motor vehicle laws, strongly suggest that \"[t]he sanction [of certificate or license revocation] therefore is principally in service to a remedial goal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We share the district court's perspective that the FAA's actions here were driven by its remedial responsibilities.  Indeed, the specific language of the agency's order reflects this focus on considerations of air safety rather than on punishment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>By reason of the foregoing facts and circumstances, the Administrator has determined that you are not qualified to hold an Airman Certification, in that you lack the required care, judgment, and responsibility.  Therefore, the Administrator finds that the safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest require the revocation of your Airman Certificate No. 2130849, with all its ratings and privileges.  Furthermore, the Administrator finds that an emergency exists and safety in air commerce or air transportation requires the immediate effectiveness of this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FAA's Emergency Order of Revocation at 5.  The \"facts and circumstances\" to which the order referred included both details of the current violations and a listing of prior violations.  Although it unquestionably is true that a governing authority might view this record of unlawful conduct as warranting punishment, the emphasis here is not on slapping Emerson's wrist but on preventing him from continuing to present a safety risk.  He is deprived of his Airman Certification not as punishment for bad conduct, but because he is \"not qualified.\"   The immediate implementation of the order further buttresses the judgment that it originated out of a concern for safety, not retribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson acknowledges that the language of the statute authorizing the license revocation, 49 U.S.C.A. &#167; 44701, suggests that the FAA's only purposes are non-punitive:  to ensure safety and competence in aviation. He contends, however, that the most severe of the available enforcement options--including decertification--are, in fact, punitive, and he cites in support a 1994 memorandum describing aspects of the FAA's \"Compliance and Enforcement Program.\"   See App. at 311-314.  The document notes that the FAA's program ranges from educational and remedial efforts to \"punitive legal enforcement remedies, including criminal sanctions.\"  Id. at 312.   He cites in particular a section of the memorandum that describes \"progressive discipline,\" starting with a letter of correction to a first-time violator and culminating in \"a punitive legal enforcement sanction, i.e., a civil penalty or certificate suspension,\" for offenders who fail to sustain compliance with the law.  Id. at 313-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of this memorandum, Emerson points out that the FAA Administrator plainly views his enforcement power to include punitive and deterrent measures, and he maintains that it was this punitive power that was used against him in the revocation order.  We addressed a somewhat similar argument in Allen, 80 F.3d at 574, where the petitioner contended that the increasing length of a driver's license suspension based on the number of offenses reflected a punitive aim.  We acknowledged there that tying the severity of a penalty to the number of offenses may indicate a retributive intent, but pointed out that it also may reflect a protective intent.  The escalating suspensions, we observed, reflected a desire to protect the public from those who, on average, present the greatest safety hazard--recidivist drunk drivers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, too, here.  Following the reference to \"punitive legal enforcement sanction[s]\" in the FAA memorandum stressed by Emerson, see id. at 314, the document states that, \"Repetitive violations by a certificate holder may even demonstrate a lack of qualification warranting certificate revocation.\"  (Emphasis added.)   This is precisely the basis given for revocation of Emerson's certificate.  See supra at 82 (\"[T]he Administrator has determined that you are not qualified to hold an Airman Certification, in that you lack the required care, judgment and responsibility.\").  Thus, making our conclusion even more compelling than in Allen, the remedial nature of the administrative sanction is explicit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Characterizing the sanction as primarily remedial does not, of course, mean that we must conclude that it has had neither deterrent nor punitive effect.  Unquestionably, the loss of his license has had a severe impact on Emerson and his aviation business.  It is equally apparent that the FAA's more serious enforcement measures are designed with deterrence at least partially in mind.  Yet, we previously have recognized that \"the fact that something akin to punishment occurs along with, and incidental to, a sanction's overriding remedial purpose will not transform a permissible civil penalty into a prohibited multiple punishment,\" Stoller, 78 F.3d at 724.   Likewise, the fact that deterrence is among the objectives underlying a civil sanction \"is merely one factor to be taken into account in the decisional calculus,\" Allen, 80 F.3d at 576 (citing Bae v. Shalala, 44 F.3d 489, 494 (7th Cir.1995)).  Indeed, deterrence should be an anticipated byproduct of aggressive safety enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, finally, Emerson's reliance on Pangburn v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 311 F.2d 349, 354-55 (1st Cir.1962), where we held that the Civil Aeronautics Board could order revocation as a sanction for \"disciplinary purposes,\" apart from the qualifications or competency of a pilot.  Having such authority does not mean, however, that it is wielded in every case of revocation.  Here, as we have explained, the evidence persuades us that the sanction \"displays colors more consistent with the remedial end of the spectrum,\" Stoller, 78 F.3d at 721.   Consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the civil action on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint in this case also was filed against Emerson d/b/a Emerson Aviation.  Emerson Aviation no longer exists as an enterprise, and we refer throughout this opinion to Emerson individually as the sole defendant/appellant.  We note, additionally, that a corporation named Emerson Aviation, Inc. was formed in 1994 after the violations at issue in this case.  The \"New Emerson\" acquired many of Emerson Aviation's operations, assets and liabilities, though no compensation passed from one entity to the other.  Appellant's wife is president of New Emerson, and he testified at trial that he is an employee without any role as officer or shareholder</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In May 1992, the FAA had revoked Emerson's \"Airman Certificate\" and Emerson Aviation's \"Air Taxi Certificate,\" both of which were required for appellant to operate charter flights.

It determined, inter alia, that Emerson had operated an aircraft that was not in airworthy condition, having failed to repair a crack that he knew about and that rendered the aircraft unairworthy.  The FAA found that an emergency in air safety existed, and it ordered an immediate revocation of both certificates.  On appeal, the National Transportation Safety Board upheld the revocations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Emerson argued before the district court that each roundtrip flight constituted only a single violation.

Reno, 55 F.3d 1517, 1523 (11th Cir.1995) (\"[C]hallenges under the Excessive Fines clause are ... generally not ripe until the actual, or impending, imposition of the challenged fine.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> At the time of Emerson's violations in 1992 and 1993, this provision was codified at 49 U.S.C.App. &#167; 1471</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The court felt that his explanations were based on \"convenient interpretations\" of federal regulations that \"strain[ed] reason and common sense\".  927 F.Supp. at 28</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Emerson testified at trial that New Emerson offers various aviation services to the public, including scenic flights, aircraft maintenance, hangar services, mechanic's work, and flight instruction.

Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1994, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order revoking Emerson's commercial pilot certificate.  The action was based on allegations that Emerson was responsible for more than thirty unlawful flights.  About a month later, on March 29, 1994, the United States filed the complaint that underlies this appeal, seeking civil penalties based on the same conduct that triggered the FAA order, namely, the operation of charter flights after FAA authorization to conduct such flights had been revoked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The complaint sought a $10,000 penalty for each alleged violation.  An amended complaint later increased the number of asserted violations to fifty-three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson filed several motions seeking to dismiss the complaint, arguing, inter alia, that requiring him to defend the same allegations in both the administrative and civil proceedings constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  He also claimed that the monetary penalties sought were in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause.  The district court denied the motions, finding that the FAA's administrative action was remedial in nature, rather than punitive, and that double jeopardy principles therefore were not implicated.  The court made no explicit ruling on the excessive fines issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Emerson and the United States stipulated to the district court that twenty-six of the flights alleged to be unlawful were operated in violation of applicable federal aviation law and regulations.  Eleven of those were round-trip flights, and thus were counted as two separate violations, bringing the total number of admitted violations to thirty-seven.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The stipulation left for trial only the issue of the appropriate penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A two-day bench trial was held in April 1996.  The court rejected Emerson's claim that he held a good-faith belief that the flights were lawful, and imposed a civil penalty of $5,000 per violation, for a total of $185,000, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>.   In reducing the penalty from that requested by the government (at that point, $8,500 per violation, or $314,500), the court noted Emerson's limited financial ability to pay the higher amount.  It also found, however, that a significant civil penalty was appropriate in light of the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of Emerson's violations, his knowledge or reckless disregard of the law, his extensive enforcement history, and the effect of a large penalty in deterring future violators and fostering respect for and compliance with the law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.  Emerson again asserts that imposition of the civil penalty subsequent to the FAA administrative action violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, and contends that the amount of that penalty transgresses the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

See 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46301(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We are persuaded that this penalty, though substantial, is constitutionally permissible.  Cf. United States v. Pilgrim Market Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567919\"><a href=\"/opinion/567919/united-states-v-pilgrim-market-corporation-united-states-v-arnold-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991) (upholding penalty against Eighth Amendment challenge where fine was less than half the statutory maximum and one-half of the government's recommendation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note initially that the district court thoroughly explored Emerson's explanation for the underlying violations, as well as his enforcement history, and found a pattern of persistent disregard of government regulation.  The court was unimpressed with Emerson's evidence that he held a good-faith belief that the flights were lawful,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and found \"particularly unpersuasive\" evidence of reliance on advice from counsel.  It further rejected Emerson's contention that the large number of admitted violations and the record of his past regulatory problems overstated the severity of his actual conduct:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>It is of no moment that many of the violations involved record-keeping or other technical functions and that none resulted in serious personal injury.  The federal aviation laws safeguard public safety as a collective whole and compliance with the entire regulatory scheme, and not just the rules governing matters that have an immediate and direct effect on life and limb, is presumed.  The maintenance of proper records and like tasks is a crucial component in the prevention of accidents and, as such, the failure to comply cannot be viewed as a benign violation simply because of the clerical or technical nature of the violated regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">927 F.Supp. at 28-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We detect no flaw in the court's reasoning that even technical air safety rules are important, and no clear error in its finding that Emerson did, in fact, engage in repeated, highly culpable conduct.  See Sullivan v. Young Bros. &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196901\"><a href=\"/opinion/196901/sullivan-v-vernay-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 246-47 (1st Cir.1996).  With this supportable foundation, the conclusion the court drew--that the latest series of violations warranted a significant penalty--is equally unassailable.  Moreover, the court recognized that a substantial penalty would be important as a deterrent to potential violators, since \"aviation safety rests in large part on voluntary compliance by those who, in all probability, will never face the regulatory scrutiny encountered by the defendants.\"  927 F.Supp. at 29 .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these conclusions inclining it toward a penalty at or near the magnitude requested by the government, the court did not order such a fine.  It gave offsetting effect to Emerson's limited financial resources.  Although he continues to earn income from an aviation business and has ownership interests in various real estate and airplanes, the evidence indicated that the properties are heavily mortgaged and that Emerson also owes a substantial tax debt.  Based on his economic circumstances alone, the court reduced the penalty from the government's proposed $8,500 per violation to $5,000 per violation, producing the total fine of $185,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are hardpressed to see the \"excessiveness\" in this thoughtfully levied fine.  First, as noted earlier, the \"touchstone\" is the value of the fine in relation to the particular offense, not the defendant's means.  Moreover, though Emerson appears at present not to have the resources to pay the entire penalty, he is employed and, still in his early 50s, should have longterm future earning potential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In addition, the continuing nature of the obligation has significance beyond the amount;  the fact that the debt will remain with Emerson for some time to come is a sobering reality that should discourage him (and deter others) from committing future violations.  Additionally, if Emerson's future prospects become more clearly limited, and the fine consequently becomes more clearly onerous, no barrier apparently exists to his seeking an amelioration from the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district court's judgment reflects a careful balance between Emerson's means and the justifiable punishment for these latest violations.  Thus, the fine bears a reasonable relationship not only to the offense but also to the offender.  Consequently, it does not offend the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Double Jeopardy Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson alternatively seeks to invalidate the fine under the Double Jeopardy Clause, claiming that it constituted double punishment in light of the earlier administrative sanction of decertification.  There is no contention that the civil fine is not punitive;  the issue is the nature of the FAA penalty that preceded it.  If the certificate revocation is remedial, rather than punitive, the later fine is permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently have established that, in determining whether an administrative action constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes, a court must consider</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>the totality of the circumstances, including the source of the authority under which the debarment is imposable, the goals underpinning the authorizing statute, the order itself, the purposes it serves, and the circumstances attendant to its promulgation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

We have recognized that \"the force of a double jeopardy claim depends upon the particular circumstances of each individual case,\" id. at 576, and have identified \"[t]he pivotal question\" to be \"whether the sanction, as applied, exacts rough remedial justice,\" id. at 576-77 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thoroughly explored the double jeopardy question within this framework.  See Order of March 29, 1996.  We see no need to revisit its conclusion that the FAA's authority and goals are anchored in a concern for air safety.  See Order at 6-7;  see also, e.g., 49 U.S.C.A. &#167; 44701 (previously 49 U.S.C.App. &#167; 1421).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further examined whether the FAA's specific enforcement action in this case was tailored to the remedial goals of federal aviation law, and determined that it was.  The court noted that the FAA's investigation of Emerson revealed a number of unsafe and unlawful practices, and observed that the decision to limit the defendant's flying privileges was a \"logical[ ]\" response.  It further noted that Emerson was not subject to a monetary fine, which, in some instances, would suggest a punitive goal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analogizing the FAA's action here to the administrative decision in Allen to suspend the driver's license of an individual arrested for drunk driving, see 80 F.3d at 574, the district court noted our holding that the license suspension \" 'represents a reasonable effort to protect the public from motorists who have demonstrated a dangerous propensity to drink before they drive.' \"   It then continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>The safety concerns underlying federal aviation laws, no less than those which give rise to state motor vehicle laws, strongly suggest that \"[t]he sanction [of certificate or license revocation] therefore is principally in service to a remedial goal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We share the district court's perspective that the FAA's actions here were driven by its remedial responsibilities.  Indeed, the specific language of the agency's order reflects this focus on considerations of air safety rather than on punishment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>By reason of the foregoing facts and circumstances, the Administrator has determined that you are not qualified to hold an Airman Certification, in that you lack the required care, judgment, and responsibility.  Therefore, the Administrator finds that the safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest require the revocation of your Airman Certificate No. 2130849, with all its ratings and privileges.  Furthermore, the Administrator finds that an emergency exists and safety in air commerce or air transportation requires the immediate effectiveness of this Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FAA's Emergency Order of Revocation at 5.  The \"facts and circumstances\" to which the order referred included both details of the current violations and a listing of prior violations.  Although it unquestionably is true that a governing authority might view this record of unlawful conduct as warranting punishment, the emphasis here is not on slapping Emerson's wrist but on preventing him from continuing to present a safety risk.  He is deprived of his Airman Certification not as punishment for bad conduct, but because he is \"not qualified.\"   The immediate implementation of the order further buttresses the judgment that it originated out of a concern for safety, not retribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Emerson acknowledges that the language of the statute authorizing the license revocation, 49 U.S.C.A. &#167; 44701, suggests that the FAA's only purposes are non-punitive:  to ensure safety and competence in aviation. He contends, however, that the most severe of the available enforcement options--including decertification--are, in fact, punitive, and he cites in support a 1994 memorandum describing aspects of the FAA's \"Compliance and Enforcement Program.\"   See App. at 311-314.  The document notes that the FAA's program ranges from educational and remedial efforts to \"punitive legal enforcement remedies, including criminal sanctions.\"  Id. at 312.   He cites in particular a section of the memorandum that describes \"progressive discipline,\" starting with a letter of correction to a first-time violator and culminating in \"a punitive legal enforcement sanction, i.e., a civil penalty or certificate suspension,\" for offenders who fail to sustain compliance with the law.  Id. at 313-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of this memorandum, Emerson points out that the FAA Administrator plainly views his enforcement power to include punitive and deterrent measures, and he maintains that it was this punitive power that was used against him in the revocation order.  We addressed a somewhat similar argument in Allen, 80 F.3d at 574, where the petitioner contended that the increasing length of a driver's license suspension based on the number of offenses reflected a punitive aim.  We acknowledged there that tying the severity of a penalty to the number of offenses may indicate a retributive intent, but pointed out that it also may reflect a protective intent.  The escalating suspensions, we observed, reflected a desire to protect the public from those who, on average, present the greatest safety hazard--recidivist drunk drivers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, too, here.  Following the reference to \"punitive legal enforcement sanction[s]\" in the FAA memorandum stressed by Emerson, see id. at 314, the document states that, \"Repetitive violations by a certificate holder may even demonstrate a lack of qualification warranting certificate revocation.\"  (Emphasis added.)   This is precisely the basis given for revocation of Emerson's certificate.  See supra at 82 (\"[T]he Administrator has determined that you are not qualified to hold an Airman Certification, in that you lack the required care, judgment and responsibility.\").  Thus, making our conclusion even more compelling than in Allen, the remedial nature of the administrative sanction is explicit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Characterizing the sanction as primarily remedial does not, of course, mean that we must conclude that it has had neither deterrent nor punitive effect.  Unquestionably, the loss of his license has had a severe impact on Emerson and his aviation business.  It is equally apparent that the FAA's more serious enforcement measures are designed with deterrence at least partially in mind.  Yet, we previously have recognized that \"the fact that something akin to punishment occurs along with, and incidental to, a sanction's overriding remedial purpose will not transform a permissible civil penalty into a prohibited multiple punishment,\" Stoller, 78 F.3d at 724.   Likewise, the fact that deterrence is among the objectives underlying a civil sanction \"is merely one factor to be taken into account in the decisional calculus,\" Allen, 80 F.3d at 576 (citing Bae v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686490\"><a href=\"/opinion/686490/kun-chae-bae-v-donna-e-shalala-secretary-of-the-united-states-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 494 (7th Cir.1995)).  Indeed, deterrence should be an anticipated byproduct of aggressive safety enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, finally, Emerson's reliance on Pangburn v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"259098\"><a href=\"/opinion/259098/sheldon-e-pangburn-v-civil-aeronautics-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, 354-55 (1st Cir.1962), where we held that the Civil Aeronautics Board could order revocation as a sanction for \"disciplinary purposes,\" apart from the qualifications or competency of a pilot.  Having such authority does not mean, however, that it is wielded in every case of revocation.  Here, as we have explained, the evidence persuades us that the sanction \"displays colors more consistent with the remedial end of the spectrum,\" Stoller, 78 F.3d at 721.   Consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the civil action on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The complaint in this case also was filed against Emerson d/b/a Emerson Aviation.  Emerson Aviation no longer exists as an enterprise, and we refer throughout this opinion to Emerson individually as the sole defendant/appellant.

The \"New Emerson\" acquired many of Emerson Aviation's operations, assets and liabilities, though no compensation passed from one entity to the other.

It determined, inter alia, that Emerson had operated an aircraft that was not in airworthy condition, having failed to repair a crack that he knew about and that rendered the aircraft unairworthy.  The FAA found that an emergency in air safety existed, and it ordered an immediate revocation of both certificates.
