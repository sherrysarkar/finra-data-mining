R.\nApp. P. 42(b). Although the dismissal of the second appeal\n\fprecludes our direct review of the denial of reconsideration,\nthere has been no suggestion that the dismissal affects our\nability to rely on the district court's written opinion --\nissued in connection with the second appeal -- as setting out\nthe court's reasons for granting the protective order in the\nfirst instance.\n\n     On page 12, line 19, strike the phrase “and later denial\nof reconsideration.”\n\n     On page 12, line 21, replace “these orders” with “this\norder” in both instances, and replace “were” with “was.”\n\n     On page 12, line 21, replace “'final decisions'” with “a\n'final decision.'”\n\f",
