Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we perceive no reason  to set aside the revocation of\r\n\nprobation or the sentence imposed.  The magistrate judge  and\r\n\ndistrict court adequately  explained the rulings, and  we add\r\n\nonly these comments:\r\n\n     1.   The findings, including the  finding that appellant\r\n\nwaived  a  preliminary  hearing  and  also  waived  appointed\r\n\ncounsel, are adequately supported by the record.  \r\n\n     2.   Essentially for the  reasons given by the  district\r\n\ncourt,  the FBI's request  that the probation  officer submit\r\n\nthe  petition for  revocation at  a particular  time did  not\r\n\ninvalidate the revocation.\r\n\n     3.   None of  the issues  raised in  appellant's pro  se\r\n\nsupplemental brief  present grounds  for reversal  here.   We\r\n\ndecline  to   consider  his  challenges  to   his  underlying\r\n\nconviction and sentence.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
