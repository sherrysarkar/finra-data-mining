A  United States Grand Jury for  the District\r                         \r\n\nof Massachusetts returned  an indictment charging defendants-\r\n\nappellants  Brian  Smith   (\"Smith\")  and  Gerald   Yanovitch\r\n\n(\"Yanovitch\")  with being  felons-in-possession of  a firearm\r\n\n(Count One)  and ammunition (Count  Two), in violation  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.     922(g) (1976  &amp; Supp. 1996),  2 (1969).   After  a\r\n\nfive-day trial, a jury convicted the defendants-appellants on\r\n\nboth counts  of the  indictment.   Prior  to sentencing,  the\r\n\ndistrict court, citing double jeopardy concerns, required the\r\n\ngovernment to elect between  counts, and the government chose\r\n\nto retain the conviction under Count Two.  The district court\r\n\nsentenced  Smith to  the statutory maximum  of 120  months in\r\n\nprison without  supervised release  or fine,  and with  a $50\r\n\nassessment.   The court sentenced  Yanovitch to 78  months in\r\n\nprison, with three  years supervised release,  no fine and  a\r\n\n$50  assessment.   Both  defendants filed  timely notices  of\r\n\nappeal.  We affirm. \r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          At  approximately  8:00  to 8:30  p.m.  on  Friday,\r\n\nDecember   2,   1994,  Mark   Duggan   was   in  Charlestown,\r\n\nMassachusetts to pick up a friend, Jonellen Ortiz.  As Duggan\r\n\ndrove to the  parking lot  in the rear  of Ortiz's  apartment\r\n\nbuilding,  he passed Smith.   Duggan pulled his  car into the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nparking  lot  and stopped.    Through his  rear  view mirror,\r\n\nDuggan saw Smith approaching his car from behind.  \r\n\n          Smith and  Duggan had had a  prior confrontation in\r\n\nCharlestown  approximately  two months  earlier  concerning a\r\n\nwoman,  Colleen King, who was  the mother of  Smith's son and\r\n\nDuggan's former girlfriend.  \r\n\n          Duggan  got out  of the  car, exchanged  words with\r\n\nSmith,  who was thirty to  forty feet away,  and then reached\r\n\nback  into the  car  and retrieved  a  baseball bat.    Smith\r\n\nreached  into his pants and pulled out a dark, small caliber,\r\n\nsemi-automatic  handgun and showed it to Duggan.  There was a\r\n\nstandoff, and Smith eventually left the area.  \r\n\n          After the encounter with Duggan, Smith and King met\r\n\nKing's   best  friend,   Melissa  Brown,   on  a   street  in\r\n\nCharlestown.   Brown had  known Smith for  approximately five\r\n\nyears, and was  the godmother of Smith's and King's son.  The\r\n\nthree of them  walked to  a liquor  store on  Main Street  in\r\n\nCharlestown, where  they purchased beer.  They, then, went to\r\n\nKing's apartment, located in  the same housing development in\r\n\nwhich Ortiz lived.  \r\n\n          Later  in  the  evening, Yanovitch  and  his  date,\r\n\nDanielle Scanlon, arrived at  King's apartment and joined the\r\n\nothers in drinking beer.   All of them left  King's apartment\r\n\nand got into the  large, dark-colored, four-door Lincoln Town\r\n\nCar in which  Yanovitch and Scanlon had arrived that evening.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nWith Yanovitch driving, they traveled to a bar named \"Kelly's\r\n\nCork  and Bull\" in South  Boston.  The  group arrived between\r\n\n11:30  p.m. and midnight, and stayed there about one and one-\r\n\nhalf or two hours.  \r\n\n          Near  closing  time,  Smith  and  Yanovitch  became\r\n\ninvolved in  a conversation  with Robert Viens,  Jr., Brown's\r\n\nformer boyfriend.   Smith and  Viens began to  argue about  a\r\n\ngun,  and the argument  spilled into the  street.  Yanovitch,\r\n\nKing and Brown, as well as Viens's friend, Walter Veneau, and\r\n\nthe latter's  girlfriend, Tammy Tetreault,  followed them out\r\n\nof the bar.   Once outside, Yanovitch, King and  Brown walked\r\n\nover to their Lincoln, which was parked nearby.\r\n\n          Smith and Viens continued to argue outside the bar.\r\n\nSmith said to  Viens that he wanted to speak  with him alone,\r\n\nand the two of them walked down the street together away from\r\n\nthe bar.  Smith,  then, reached inside his jacket,  and Viens\r\n\nresponded by throwing punches at Smith.  The fight moved back\r\n\ntowards the Lincoln, as people tried to break it up.   Veneau\r\n\npulled his friend Viens  back from Smith as Smith  was pulled\r\n\ninto the center of the Lincoln's back seat,  with King on one\r\n\nside of him and Scanlon on the other. \r\n\n          Yanovitch,  who  was  still  outside  the  Lincoln,\r\n\nexchanged words  with Viens,  and then partially  entered the\r\n\ncar  through the  driver's side  door.   From the  back seat,\r\n\nSmith  handed a handgun to  Yanovitch.  Yanovitch  got out of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe car  with the gun,  proceeded to fire one  round into the\r\n\nground, and  then shot Viens.  Viens ran and staggered up the\r\n\nstreet away from Yanovitch.   Yanovitch shot Viens again, and\r\n\nViens fell to the  ground.  From behind, Yanovitch  closed on\r\n\nViens,  pointed  the  gun  at  his  head,  and  fired  again.\r\n\nYanovitch,  then, ran  back  to the  Lincoln, got  behind the\r\n\nwheel and sped away with his friends.\r\n\n          After Yanovitch sped  away, Veneau went to  comfort\r\n\nViens,  who was lying  in the street.   The Boston Police and\r\n\nparamedics  in  an ambulance  responded  to the  scene.   The\r\n\nparamedics  found  Viens alive,  lying  on  his  back in  the\r\n\nstreet.  Viens had two small-caliber entry wounds and a third\r\n\nsmall-caliber exit wound.  One of the entry wounds was in his\r\n\nleft front chest, while the exit  wound was in the right side\r\n\nof his chest.   Viens was uncooperative, refused to  give his\r\n\nname, and even told  witnesses at the scene not  to cooperate\r\n\nwith  the  police.    The  paramedics  placed  Viens  in  the\r\n\nambulance and took him to Boston City Hospital.\r\n\n          A  friend  drove  Veneau to  Boston  City Hospital,\r\n\nwhere  he saw Viens's parents.  Although he initially refused\r\n\nto cooperate with  the police, Veneau changed  his mind after\r\n\nspeaking with  Viens's father.    Veneau, then,  gave a  tape\r\n\nrecorded interview to Boston Police Sergeant  Detective James\r\n\nWyse.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Without information from  the victim or  witnesses,\r\n\nthe police searched  the area of the shooting,  but initially\r\n\ndid not  find any ballistics  evidence.  After  speaking with\r\n\nVeneau concerning the exact  location of the shooting, police\r\n\nofficers returned to the crime  scene and recovered two spent\r\n\n.25  caliber shell  casings.   One of  the casings  was found\r\n\napproximately fifteen  to twenty-five  feet from  where Viens\r\n\nwas  lying when  the police  and paramedics  found him.   The\r\n\nother casing was recovered  an additional ten to twenty  feet\r\n\naway from the first casing.\r\n\n          Smith and Yanovitch were arrested on the basis of a\r\n\ncomplaint.  On  January 24,  1995, a grand  jury returned  an\r\n\nindictment charging Smith and Yanovitch with being felons-in-\r\n\npossession  of a  firearm (Count  One) and  ammunition (Count\r\n\nTwo),  in  violation of  18 U.S.C.      922(g) (1976  &amp; Supp.\r\n\n1996), 2 (1969).   At trial,  Smith and Yanovitch  stipulated\r\n\nthat they were convicted felons at the time of the shooting.\r\n\n          The   government   called   a  paramedic,   Michael\r\n\nSullivan, and  two police officers, Wyse  and Lieutenant Gary\r\n\nFrench,  who had responded to the scene.  After speaking with\r\n\nVeneau at Boston City Hospital,  French returned to the crime\r\n\nscene and recovered  the two shell  casings.  The  government\r\n\nalso called  Alcohol,  Tobacco and  Firearms (\"ATF\")  Special\r\n\nAgent, Allan  Offringa, who testified  on direct  examination\r\n\nthat the .25 caliber  shell casings were manufactured outside\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nMassachusetts,  and  that   the  only   .25  caliber   pistol\r\n\nmanufactured  in that  state  was manufactured  by a  company\r\n\nnamed  Harrington and  Richardson  (\"H &amp;  R\"), which  started\r\n\nmaking the gun in 1909 and stopped doing so before  World War\r\n\nII.   Boston  Police Ballistician,  Edward  Szalno, testified\r\n\nthat the marks found on the spent shell casings were not made\r\n\nby an H &amp; R pistol.\r\n\n          The government  obtained compulsion/immunity orders\r\n\nfor  two of  the women  who were  in the  car with  Smith and\r\n\nYanovitch.  Although these  women, Brown and Scanlon, claimed\r\n\nthat they did  not see  the shooting, they  did confirm  that\r\n\nthey were out with  Smith, Yanovitch and King on  the evening\r\n\nin question, and that Yanovitch got into the driver's seat of\r\n\nthe car shortly after they heard  gun shots.  Both women also\r\n\nconfirmed that Smith  was seated  in the middle  of the  back\r\n\nseat  of the  car.   Duggan was  called as  a witness  by the\r\n\ngovernment.    He  recounted  his  confrontation  with  Smith\r\n\nearlier  in the  evening in  question.  Veneau  and Tetreault\r\n\ntestified to having witnessed  the shooting.  They  said that\r\n\nthe man  in the middle  of the  back seat of  the car  handed\r\n\nYanovitch a gun, which the latter used to shoot Viens.\r\n\n          After  the  trial  and  conviction   of  Smith  and\r\n\nYanovitch  on   both  counts  of  the   indictment,  and  the\r\n\ngovernment's election of Count Two, the court sentenced Smith\r\n\nto  the  statutory maximum  of  120  months  in  prison,  and\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nYanovitch  to  78  months  in  prison, with  three  years  of\r\n\nsupervised release.      \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          On  appeal,   Smith  presents  a  host  of  issues,\r\n\nclaiming errors at trial and in sentencing.  As most of these\r\n\nissues were  not  raised  in the  district  court,  they  are\r\n\nreviewable  on  appeal  only  for  plain  error.    Yanovitch\r\n\nchallenges his  sentence and says that he adopts by reference\r\n\nany additional issues raised  by Smith which could materially\r\n\naffect his rights in this case.\r\n\nA.   The Nondisclosure of Test Results\r                                                  \r\n\n          At trial, Ballistician Edward Szalno testified that\r\n\nthe  two shell  casings that  were recovered  from the  crime\r\n\nscene were  fired from  a .25 caliber  semi-automatic weapon,\r\n\nbut that the weapon was not  a Harrington &amp; Richardson (\"H  &amp;\r\n\nR\")  pistol.  Since H  &amp; R is the only  company that has ever\r\n\nmanufactured a .25  caliber semi-automatic weapon  within the\r\n\nstate of Massachusetts, the  effect of this testimony  was to\r\n\nindicate  that  the  gun  used  had  traveled  in  interstate\r\n\ncommerce.   Prior to testifying, Szalno had test-fired an H &amp;\r\n\nR  .25 caliber  semi-automatic pistol,  and had  compared the\r\n\nshell  casings with  those found  at the  crime scene.   This\r\n\ncomparison confirmed his earlier conclusion that the  casings\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nrecovered  from the crime scene were not  fired from an H &amp; R\r\n\npistol.\r\n\n          Smith's counsel says he  first became aware of this\r\n\ntest-firing  during  his cross-examination  of  Szalno.   He,\r\n\nthen, moved to  strike Szalno's testimony on  the ground that\r\n\nthe  government had  violated  its  discovery obligations  by\r\n\nfailing  to inform the defense  of the test.   Counsel argued\r\n\nthat this discovery violation affected  his cross-examination\r\n\nand  prejudiced Smith's  defense.   The court ruled  that the\r\n\ngovernment  should have  provided  defense counsel  with  the\r\n\nobserved results  of the test-firing, even  though no written\r\n\nreport had  been generated.   The court refused,  however, to\r\n\nstrike Szalno's  testimony, noting  that defense  counsel had\r\n\nnot  sought a continuance to counter the evidence and had, in\r\n\neffect,  created  the problem  at  hand  by asking  questions\r\n\nwithout first determining the likely responses.\r\n\n          The  provisions that  might arguably  have required\r\n\nadvance disclosure of the  test-firing results are Rule 116.1\r\n\nof  the Local Rules of  the United States  District Court for\r\n\nthe District  of Massachusetts  and Federal Rule  of Criminal\r\n\nProcedure 16(a)(1)(D).  The  former states, in relevant part,\r\n\n\"The government  shall disclose,  and allow the  defendant to\r\n\ninspect,  copy  and  photograph,  all  written  materials  as\r\n\nfollows:  (3)  . . . all  scientific tests,  experiments  and\r\n\ncomparisons,  or copies  thereof, made  in connection  with a\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nparticular case.\"   D. Mass.  R. 116.1(a)(3).   As the  Local\r\n\nRule is expressly limited to written materials, of which none\r\n\nwere generated here, it was not violated.  \r\n\n          The  other  proviso  upon  which  Smith  relies  is\r\n\nFederal Rule  of Criminal  Procedure 16(a)(1)(D), which  does\r\n\nnot speak specifically of  written materials only.1  However,\r\n\nthe words \"inspect and  copy or photograph\" logically suggest\r\n\nthat  the  items to  be disclosed  be  tangible enough  to be\r\n\nsusceptible to inspection, copying or photographing.

Our circuit has expressly reserved decision on whether\r\n\nRule  16(a)(1)(D)  requires   the  disclosure  of  unrecorded\r\n\npersonal observations of tests and the like.  Compare  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

Johnson,  713 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n654,  659 (11th Cir. 1983)  (where no report  was prepared by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The relevant language of the Rule provides, \"Upon request\r\nof a defendant  the government shall permit  the defendant to\r\ninspect  and  copy  or  photograph  any  results  or  reports\r\n. . . of scientific  tests or experiments, or  copies therof,\r\nwhich are within  the possession, custody, or control  of the\r\ngovernment . . . .\"\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nexpert, no discovery obligation was incurred under the Rule).\r\n\nSee  also United States v.  Peters, 937 F.2d  1422, 1425 (9th\r                                              \r\n\nCir.  1991) (similar  language  in Rule  16(b)(1)(B), \"cannot\r\n\npertain to oral information\").  We think the above  decisions\r\n\nof the  Seventh, Eleventh  and Ninth Circuits  are consistent\r\n\nwith the  plain language of  Rule 16(a)(1)(D), and  hold that\r\n\nwhere  the test result in  question consisted of the expert's\r\n\nunrecorded comparison of  the test-firing casings with  those\r\n\nat  the crime  scene, Rule  16(a)(1)(D) did not  obligate the\r\n\ngovernment to  produce in advance  the expert's  conclusions.\r\n\nThis being  so, we find  no error  in the court's  refusal to\r\n\nstrike Szalno's testimony.2\r\n\n          While this ends the matter, we also agree with  the\r\n\ndistrict court  that there was  a total absence  of prejudice\r\n\nfrom the nonproduction of the expert's observations following\r\n\nthe  test-firing.   Smith  argues  that, had  he  known about\r\n\nSzalno's test-firing, he would not have cross-examined him in\r\n\nthe  manner he did, to his detriment.  However, before Szalno\r\n\ntook  the  stand,  ATF  Special Agent  Offringa  had  already\r\n\ntestified that he had test-fired an H &amp; R pistol, and that he\r\n\nhad  given  the  casings to  Szalno  for  a  comparison.   In\r\n\naddition, Szalno himself testified on direct examination that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The arguments on this appeal  do not involve the separate\r\nrequirements  of Rule 16(a)(1)(E)  on Expert Witnesses, which\r\nrequires  the  government,  on the  defendant's  request,  to\r\ndisclose  a summary of  the expert's opinions,  the bases and\r\nthe reasons therefor.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nhe  had examined two cartridge cases that had been fired from\r\n\nan  H  &amp; R  .25 caliber  semi-automatic  pistol and  had made\r\n\nreference  to the  FBI's  General Rifle  and  Characteristics\r\n\nbook.   Smith  was,  therefore,  on  notice prior  to  cross-\r\n\nexamination  that Szalno  had compared  the casings  from the\r\n\ncrime scene with  others that were test-fired  from an H &amp;  R\r\n\npistol.  The test-firing  of an H  &amp; R pistol was,  moreover,\r\n\nrelevant  only  to  the  interstate element  of  the  firearm\r\n\nconvictions,  which the government  later elected to dismiss.\r\n\nThe test-firing was irrelevant to the ammunition charges upon\r\n\nwhich  both  Smith and  Yanovitch  were  sentenced, it  being\r\n\nundisputed the casings had been manufactured in Arkansas.  As\r\n\nonly the  latter convictions  stand, the claimed  error would\r\n\nhave been harmless.\r\n\nB.   The   Admissibility   of  Evidence   Concerning  Smith's\r                                                                         \r\n     Possession of a Firearm Earlier on the Night in Question\r                                                                         \r\n\n          Duggan testified  that he had a  confrontation with\r\n\nSmith earlier  on the  evening  in question,  in which  Smith\r\n\ndisplayed a small,  semi-automatic handgun.   Smith  contends\r\n\nthat such testimony was admitted in violation of Federal Rule\r\n\nof Evidence 404(b) because it was evidence of a prior bad act\r\n\noffered solely to prove Smith's propensity to use guns.3  For\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   Rule 404(b) provides: \"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs,\r\nor acts is not admissible to  prove the character of a person\r\nin order to  show action  in conformity therewith.   It  may,\r\nhowever,  be admissible for other purposes,  such as proof of\r\nmotive,  opportunity,  intent, preparation,  plan, knowledge,\r\nidentity, or  absence of  mistake or accident,  provided that\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nevidence  of this sort to be  admissible, it must be shown to\r\n\nbear some special relevance to an aspect of the case at hand,\r\n\nother than  merely to  the defendant's  propensity to  do bad\r\n\nthings.  See United  States v. Cortijo-Diaz, 875 F.2d  13, 15\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1989).  Here,  Smith argues, the  testimony lacked\r\n\nsuch special relevance and was used by the  government simply\r\n\nas propensity evidence.\r\n\n          Smith did not, however, object at trial to Duggan's\r\n\ntestimony in this regard.4  Our review is, therefore, limited\r\n\nto plain error.   Under  that standard, the  burden falls  on\r\n\nappellants to show that there is  an error, that the error is\r\n\nclear  or obvious, and that the error affected the outcome of\r\n\nthe proceedings below.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\r                                                          \r\n\n732-34 (1993).   Because the challenged  testimony was proper\r\n\nevidence  of the  crimes  charged, the  court did  not commit\r\n\nerror, much less plain error.\r\n\n          Far from merely relating to \"other crimes,  wrongs,\r\n\nor acts,\"   Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b), Duggan's  testimony helped\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nupon request by  the accused, the  prosecution in a  criminal\r\ncase shall provide reasonable notice in advance of  trial, or\r\nduring trial  if the  court excuses pretrial  notice on  good\r\ncause  shown, of the general  nature of any  such evidence it\r\nintends to introduce at trial.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\r\n\n4.    Smith   had  objected   earlier   to  questions   about\r\nconversations  Duggan  might have  had  with  Smith regarding\r\nKing,  complaining that  such conversations  were irrelevant.\r\nAt sidebar,  the government  explained the relevance  of such\r\ntestimony.   Smith did not object thereafter.  Neither did he\r\nobject to  that portion of the  government's closing argument\r\nbased upon Duggan's testimony.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nestablish  that  Smith knowingly  possessed a  firearm (Count\r\n\nOne)  and ammunition (Count Two), as required under 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  922(g) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1996).  The decisions in United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Diaz-Martinez, 71  F.3d 946 (1st  Cir. 1995),  and United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

In Diaz-Martinez, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ndefendant, who  was charged with possession  of firearms with\r\n\nobliterated serial numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(k)\r\n\n(1976 &amp; Supp. 1996),  was involved in a shootout  immediately\r\n\nbefore  his  arrest,  at  which  time  police  recovered  the\r\n\nfirearms.     We  dismissed  defendant's  argument  that  the\r\n\ngovernment improperly referred to the shootout in its closing\r\n\nargument   stating,   \"[B]ecause   . . . the   shootout   was\r\n\nintegrally related  to the evidence  linking the guns  to the\r\n\ndefendant (the possession  charges), that evidence could  not\r\n\nhave  been barred by Rule 404(b).\"  Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n951 n.4.  The  Eighth Circuit reached the same  conclusion in\r\n\nKlein on comparable facts.  Klein, 13 F.3d at 1184.\r                                             \r\n\n          Even  assuming that  the possession  charge related\r\n\nonly  to  the weapon  with  which  Viens  was shot,  Duggan's\r\n\ntestimony that Smith  was in possession of  a similar handgun\r\n\nearlier that evening tended to establish that Smith possessed\r\n\nthe  same handgun  a  few hours  later,  at the  time of  the\r\n\nshooting.  The district  court did not commit plain  error in\r\n\nadmitting Duggan's testimony.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nC.   The   District   Court's  Control   of   Smith's  Cross-\r                                                                         \r\n     Examination\r                            \r\n\n          Smith  argues on  appeal  that  the district  court\r\n\nerroneously  restricted  his  cross-examination   of  Duggan.\r\n\nDuggan  first informed  police  of his  encounter with  Smith\r\n\nabout  two weeks before trial,  after he had  been taken into\r\n\ncustody  on unrelated charges.  Smith contends that he wanted\r\n\nto establish  on cross-examination that,  at the time  of his\r\n\ntestimony,  Duggan  had  pending  against  him  a  number  of\r\n\ncriminal  charges.    This  line of  questioning  would  have\r\n\nenabled Smith to argue that Duggan had slanted  his testimony\r\n\nto  gain  better  treatment   from  the  government.    Smith\r\n\ncomplains  that  the  district  court  severely  limited  his\r\n\nability in this regard.  \r\n\n          A  district  court's discretion  to  control cross-\r\n\nexamination,  while  broad, is  not  unlimited.   See  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Camuti, 78 F.3d 738, 742 (1st Cir. 1996).  However,\r                            \r\n\nwe find  little indication  that the court  restricted cross-\r\n\nexamination in  the asserted  manner.  Moreover,  counsel did\r\n\nnot at  the time complain to  the court of being  so limited,\r\n\nhence we review only for plain error, Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-\r                                                       \r\n\n34, a standard clearly not met on this record.  \r\n\n          During  the  initial  stages of  cross-examination,\r\n\nwhen counsel asked  Duggan if  he had  cases pending  against\r\n\nhim, the district court sustained the government's objection.\r\n\nDefense counsel then asked  whether the government had helped\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nhim with his pending cases.  Duggan answered in the negative.\r\n\nLater,  counsel asked whether Duggan was aware that Ortiz had\r\n\nfiled a complaint against him for threatening her with bodily\r\n\nharm.    The government  objected,  and  a sidebar  followed.\r\n\nDuring the sidebar, the district court stated, \"Perhaps I was\r\n\nprecipitant.\"   It allowed  counsel to pursue  the challenged\r\n\nline  of questioning.  Duggan then conceded that he was aware\r\n\nof  Ortiz's complaint at  the time  he contacted  the police.\r\n\nAfter counsel  finished questioning Duggan  regarding Ortiz's\r\n\ncomplaint, he did not proceed with similar questions relative\r\n\nto other pending matters nor ask the court to allow him to do\r\n\nso nor  indicate that he  felt unduly  limited.   We find  no\r\n\nmerit in Smith's argument on appeal that the court improperly\r\n\nrestricted his cross-examination of Duggan.\r\n\nD.   Duggan's Prison Reference and its Impact on the Trial\r                                                                      \r\n\n          Duggan mentioned during his direct examination that\r\n\nKing's \"ex-boyfriend\" had recently been released from prison,\r\n\nan  obvious  reference,  Smith  says, to  himself.    Smith's\r\n\ncounsel  promptly  objected,  and   the  court  ordered   the\r\n\nchallenged testimony  struck.5   Smith's counsel did  not ask\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.   Duggan made the  disputed reference during the following\r\nexchange:\r\n          Q:   And  how did  your  relationship  with  [King]\r\n               develop? \r\n          A:   Went on  through the  summer, the spring,  and\r\n               the summer  of '94  and stopped in  October of\r\n               '94.\r\n          Q:   And why did it stop on October of '94?\r\n          A:   Her reason was, ah, that it was --\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nfor  a mistrial at the time,  but, on appeal, now argues that\r\n\nthe court erred in not declaring a mistrial sua sponte.  \r                                                                  \r\n\n          Absent  a  request  for  a  mistrial,  this court's\r\n\nreview  of the  court's failure  to order  a mistrial  is for\r\n\nplain error only.  Olano, 507  U.S. at 733-34.  Smith  argues\r                                    \r\n\nthat,  since it  was  clear  to  the  jury  that  Duggan  was\r\n\nreferring to  Smith as  having been  released from jail,  the\r\n\nresponse  was so  prejudicial as  to necessitate  a mistrial.\r\n\nThe district court, however, took some curative measures.  It\r\n\nsustained Smith's  objection and struck Duggan's  remark.  As\r\n\ncounsel asked for no more at  the time, the trial court could\r\n\nreasonably assume  that Smith was  satisfied.  The  degree of\r\n\nprejudice was neither  so obvious  nor so clear  that only  a\r\n\nmistrial would have satisfied the needs of justice. \r\n\n          In United States v. Cresta, 825 F.2d 538  (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1987),  this  court   laid  out  the  factors  that  must  be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n                    Defense Counsel: Objection.\r\n                    The Court:  Sustained as to  anything she\r\n                    may have said.\r\n          Q:   Without saying what she said, why did you stop\r\n               seeing her in October?\r\n          A:   The   relationship   ended  because   her  ex-\r                                                                         \r\n               boyfriend got out of jail.\r                                                    \r\n                    Defense Counsel:  Objection.\r\n                    The  Court:   The objection  is sustained\r\n                    and  the  answer  is  stricken.

The\r\n                    answer is stricken; disregard it.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nconsidered in evaluating  an otherwise improper reference  to\r\n\nan  accused's prior  imprisonment:   whether  the remark  was\r\n\nisolated, whether  it was deliberate  or accidental,  whether\r\n\nthe  trial court's  instruction was sufficient  to counteract\r\n\nany prejudice  that might  have flowed  from the  remark, and\r\n\nwhether any  remaining prejudice could affect  the outcome of\r\n\nthe case.   Cresta,  825  F.2d at  550.   The  remark in  the\r                              \r\n\npresent  case, as the  government points  out, was  a single,\r\n\nisolated  and accidental  reference  by a  witness trying  to\r\n\nanswer  a  question  designed  to  address  defense counsel's\r\n\nhearsay objection.  Smith himself had already stipulated that\r\n\nhe  was a convicted felon.  The disputed remark added little,\r\n\ntherefore, to what the jury could already surmise.  We do not\r\n\nfind plain error in  the court's failure to order  a mistrial\r\n\nsua sponte.\r                      \r\n\nE.   The Questioning of Defense Witness Ortiz\r                                                         \r\n\n           On cross-examination, the government  was allowed,\r\n\nover Smith's unexplicated  objection, to ask  defense witness\r\n\nOrtiz whether she had  acted as a confidential  informant for\r\n\nthe Drug  Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and  whether, as\r\n\nsuch,  she had helped the DEA obtain a search warrant for the\r\n\napartment of her friend, Colleen King.  Smith now argues that\r\n\nthe  district  court  should  have  excluded these  questions\r\n\nbecause they were irrelevant and because    by  implying that\r\n\nSmith's girlfriend was the subject of a drug investigation   \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nthey  unduly prejudiced him and his case.  Smith also asserts\r\n\nthat  the  district  court   erred  in  preventing  him  from\r\n\nestablishing  that  the  DEA's  subsequent  search  of King's\r\n\napartment yielded  no evidence  of illegal drugs.   Eliciting\r\n\nsuch  evidence was  relevant,  Smith says,  to undermine  any\r\n\nconcerns about  the credibility of  the witness and  to rebut\r\n\nthe prejudicial characterization of Smith and his girlfriend.\r\n\nWe do not find plain error.\r\n\n          One problem  with  these arguments  is  that  Smith\r\n\nnever  advised  the  district court  of  the  reasons he  now\r\n\nadvances  on appeal  for excluding  the government's  line of\r\n\ninquiry.   Federal Rule of Evidence 103 states that error may\r\n\nnot  be  grounded  upon   an  evidentiary  ruling  \"unless  a\r\n\nsubstantial right  of the  party is affected,  and . . . [i]n\r\n\ncase the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection\r                                                               \r\n\nor  motion to strike appears  of record, stating the specific\r                                                                         \r\n\nground  of  objection  . . . .\"    Fed.  R.  Evid.  103(a)(1)\r\n\n(emphasis added).   Counsel had been informed in advance that\r\n\nthe government  planned to cross-examine Ortiz concerning her\r\n\nDEA connections, and while he objected, he did not argue that\r\n\nthe  information was  irrelevant nor  did he  claim prejudice\r\n\nunder  Rule 403.  And when the district court limited Smith's\r\n\nredirect examination of Ortiz, Smith  made no objection.  Our\r\n\nreview,  therefore, is only for plain error.  Olano, 507 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 733-34.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          The government contends that  its cross-examination\r\n\nwas designed to  impeach Ortiz,  and not to  smear Smith  and\r\n\nKing.6  Ortiz denied that  she had ever furnished information\r\n\nto the DEA, the government did not implicate Smith during its\r\n\ncross-examination of Ortiz, and the court instructed the jury\r\n\nthat counsel's  questions did not constitute  evidence.  Even\r\n\nassuming arguendo, it  was error to  allow the government  to\r\n\ncross-examine Ortiz as it did,  we conclude the error  caused\r\n\nslight, if any, damage  to Smith.  The limitation  of Smith's\r\n\nredirect  was likewise far short of plain error.  The subject\r\n\nmatter was  of border-line  relevance, hence well  within the\r\n\ndiscretion of the court to control, see Fed. R. Evid. 401.\r                                                   \r\n\nF.   The Government's Closing Argument\r                                                  \r\n\n          Smith claims  that  the prosecution  misstated  the\r\n\nevidence on four separate  occasions in its closing argument.\r\n\nThese alleged misstatements, according  to Smith, went to the\r\n\nheart of the case,  were not corrected by the  district court\r\n\nand, therefore,  warrant the reversal of his conviction.  The\r\n\nchallenged statements, and this court's reasons for rejecting\r\n\nSmith's present claims, are set forth below.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.    The government  says it sought  to establish  biases or\r\nmotives  to  lie  on the  part  of  Ortiz.    To do  so,  the\r\ngovernment claimed that Ortiz  and King had been in  the drug\r\nbusiness together, that information  provided by Ortiz to the\r\nDEA  contradicted her testimony at trial,  and that Ortiz was\r\ncapable  of  duplicitousness  (and,  thus, of  lying  on  the\r\nstand).\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n          Smith concedes that he  did not object at  trial to\r\n\nthe  challenged  statements.    Consequently,  we review  his\r\n\npresent claims  under the plain  error standard.   Olano, 507\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  at  733-34.   In  so doing,  we  consider  a number  of\r\n\nfactors, \"including the frequency  and deliberateness of  the\r\n\nprosecutor's comments, the strength  and clarity of the trial\r\n\njudge's instructions,  and the  strength of  the government's\r\n\ncase  against  the defendant.\"    United  States v.  Morales-\r                                                                         \r\n\nCartagena, 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1282 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r                               \r\n\n          The  first  disputed  statement,  that  Mark Duggan\r\n\ntestified that he saw Smith with a .22 or  .25 caliber pistol\r                                                                         \r\n\non  the night  in question, is  the only  characterization of\r\n\nevidence that can be termed a  misstatement.  We do not find,\r\n\nhowever, that the prosecutor's description strayed far enough\r\n\nfrom Duggan's actual testimony, \"a small caliber handgun,\" to\r\n\namount to plain error.  However described,  the small caliber\r\n\nhandgun mentioned in  Duggan's testimony was  consistent with\r\n\nthe .25 caliber  casings recovered after  the shooting.   The\r\n\nprosecutor's mistake was not so serious as to imply bad faith\r\n\nor deliberate  prevarication.   Also, the case  against Smith\r\n\nwas strong, and the court properly instructed the jury on the\r\n\neffect of the lawyer's statements.  The misstatement, such as\r\n\nit  was,  fell well  below the  plain  error threshold.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMorales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d at 854-55.\r                             \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          As for the three remaining  challenged remarks,7 at\r\n\nleast two were amply  supported by the record.   Statement #2\r\n\nrested on  Veneau's testimony that  the government  protected\r\n\nhim and helped him move out of South Boston, and  that he had\r\n\nnot gone to the police for fear of the defendants.  Statement\r\n\n#4 was a fair  inference from the testimony of  Boston Police\r\n\nLieutenant  French.  Statement #3  is more problematic but in\r\n\nno way amounts to  plain error.  The government argues in its\r\n\nbrief that the prosecutor referred to the jury as having \"sat\r                                                          \r\n\nup there\" and seen the witness's, Tetreault's, fear.  If this\r\n\nis what the prosecutor  said, the remark was unexceptionable,\r\n\nsince  the jury had observed Tetreault on the stand and could\r\n\ndetermine whether or not she exhibited fear.  The transcript,\r\n\nhowever,  indicates the  prosecutor as  actually having  said\r\n\nthat \"he sat up there\" and  saw fear in Tetreault's face.  If\r\n\nthe  \"he\"  referred  to  Veneau,  the  comment  was  arguably\r\n\ngarbled,  since by the time Veneau testified at the trial, he\r\n\nhad  already retracted  earlier misstatements to  police that\r\n\nTetreault had been  absent.  But,  even accepting the  latter\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Statement #2:   The government stated  that Walter Veneau\r\ncould not go back to South Boston after he testified.\r\n     Statement #3:  The  government stated that Walter Veneau\r\ndid not tell the  police his girlfriend was  at the scene  of\r\nthe shooting  because \"he sat up  there and saw the  fear\" on\r\nher face.\r\n     Statement  #4:   The government  stated that  the police\r\nfound the shells  where Walter Veneau told them  the shooting\r\nhad taken place.\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nversion, the  unobjected-to remark was harmless  and fell far\r\n\nshort of constituting plain error.\r\n\nG.   The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"\r                                            \r\n\n          Smith contends on  appeal that the  district court,\r\n\nthrough certain  unobjected-to instructions given to the jury\r\n\nwhile  the  trial  was  in process,  erroneously  directed  a\r\n\nverdict  in  the  government's   favor  on  the  elements  of\r\n\nammunition and interstate commerce.   According to Smith, the\r\n\ndistrict court wrongly told  the jury that the casings  which\r\n\nwere received into evidence were ammunition, and had traveled\r\n\nin interstate commerce.8  Such instructions, according to the\r\n\ndefense, had the effect of directing the jury to find against\r\n\nSmith on two essential  elements of the offense.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Argentine, 814  F.2d 783,  788-89 (1st  Cir. 1987)\r                                \r\n\n(quoting United  States v. Natale,  526 F.2d  1160, 1167  (2d\r                                             \r\n\nCir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 950 (1976)).  Smith, thus,\r                                    \r\n\nconcludes  that the  district  court committed  plain  error,\r\n\nrequiring the reversal of his conviction.\r\n\n          The district court made  the challenged remarks  in\r\n\nthe  course  of  certain   mid-trial  comments  to  the  jury\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.   Smith  challenges the  following statements made  by the\r\ncourt in the course of  remarks to the jury during  the trial\r\nrelative to evidence on the cartridge casings:  \"Despite what\r\nmay  have been raised in  the opening statements  to you, the\r\ncartridge  case, standing alone,  is ammunition under federal\r\nlaw.  So the cartridge case originally was made out of state,\r\nfound  its way  into Massachusetts.   Whether  or not  it was\r\nreloaded, it still moved in interstate commerce.\"  \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nintended,  among  other   things,  to   correct  an   earlier\r\n\nmisstatement  by   Yanovitch's   counsel  relative   to   the\r\n\ndefinition of  \"ammunition.\"   Counsel had stated  that shell\r\n\ncasings  were not  ammunition, an  assertion contrary  to the\r\n\ndefinition  set forth in 18 U.S.C.   921(17)(A) (1996):  \"The\r\n\nterm  'ammunition'   means  ammunition  or   cartridge  cases\r\n\n. . . .\"     Before  correcting  counsel,  the   trial  court\r\n\nindicated to the jury  that it was instructing them as to the\r\n\nlaw,  not   as  to   the  evidence.      If  counsel   wished\r\n\nclarification, he should have  asked for it at the  time.  In\r\n\nits  final charge  to the  jury,  the district  court clearly\r\n\ninformed the jury of the  government's burden to prove beyond\r\n\na reasonable  doubt defendants' possession of  ammunition and\r\n\nof  the movement  of  the ammunition  in  commerce, and  gave\r\n\naccurate, extensive  and clear instructions on  each of these\r\n\npoints.  We do not find plain error.9     \r\n\nH.   The Meaning of \"In or Affecting Commerce\"\r                                                          \r\n\n          Smith challenges the  accuracy of the  court's jury\r\n\ninstruction on the  meaning of  the phrase  \"in or  affecting\r\n\ncommerce.\"   As  he did  not object  to the  instruction, our\r\n\nreview is for plain  error only.  Olano, 507  U.S. at 733-34.\r                                                   \r\n\nAfter considering the  instruction, and  the prevailing  case\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  As noted previously, there was uncontested  evidence that\r\nthe  cartridge  casings  found  at  the  scene  were made  in\r\nArkansas,  permitting the  inference  that they  had traveled\r\ninterstate.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nlaw, we conclude that  the court did not commit  error, plain\r\n\nor otherwise.10 \r\n\n          As part  of its case,  the government had  to prove\r\n\nthat  possession  of  the  ammunition was  \"in  or  affecting\r\n\ncommerce.\"    18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1976).  The\r\n\nSupreme Court in Scarborough v. United States, 431  U.S. 563,\r                                                         \r\n\n575  (1977), held  that evidence  showing that  a  weapon had\r\n\ncrossed  state lines  is legally  sufficient to  satisfy this\r\n\nelement  of the  statute.   Smith,  while  not disputing  the\r\n\nabove, contends that it  should have been left solely  to the\r\n\njury  to decide  whether the  ammunition's crossing  of state\r\n\nlines could  establish that  possession was \"in  or affecting\r\n\ncommerce.\"\r\n\n          This argument  runs counter  to the  principle that\r\n\nthe court,  not the jury,  is responsible  for declaring  the\r\n\nlaw.    Here,  the   court's  instruction  finds  support  in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.    The court  instructed the  jury as  follows:   \"So the\r\ngovernment  has to prove  beyond a reasonable  doubt that the\r\nfirearm,  taking  the  firearm charge,  and  the  ammunition,\r\ntaking the ammunition charge, was  in commerce.  That doesn't\r\nmean  that  they have  to prove  Mr.  Yanovitch or  Mr. Smith\r\ncarried  the items across a  state line.   But the government\r\ndoes have to  prove beyond  a reasonable doubt  that at  some\r\ntime  after the  firearm or  ammunition was  manufactured, up\r\ntill the  time when  the person you're  considering possessed\r\nit, if you find that one or both of them did possess it, that\r\nthe  item,  the firearm,  or  ammunition,  or  both, were  in\r\ncommerce, which means it went across a state line . . . .\"\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nScarborough    and   in   circuit   precedents   spawned   by\r                       \r\n\nScarborough.11  The court properly instructed the jury on the\r                       \r\n\nmeaning of the phrase \"in or affecting commerce.\"\r\n\n          Smith  also  claims  that  the  court  should  have\r\n\nrequired  the   jury  to  find  a   \"substantial\"  effect  on\r\n\ninterstate commerce,  in light of the  Supreme Court's recent\r\n\ndecision  in United States v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 1629-30\r                                               \r\n\n(1995).   In Lopez, the Court struck down the Gun-Free School\r                              \r\n\nZones Act,  18 U.S.C.   922(q) (Supp. 1996), which prohibited\r\n\na person from possessing  a gun while in a  \"school zone,\" on\r\n\nthe  grounds that  it  exceeded Congress's  powers under  the\r\n\nCommerce  Clause.   Lopez,  115 S.  Ct.  at 1630-31.    Smith\r                                     \r\n\nalleges that the Court's opinion in the Lopez case undermines\r                                                         \r\n\nthe proposition, stated in  Scarborough and its progeny, that\r                                                   \r\n\nCongress intended  nothing more  than a minimal  contact with\r\n\ninterstate commerce.  Consequently, Smith concludes  that the\r\n\ndistrict court committed error when it failed to instruct the\r\n\njury that the government  had the burden of proving  that the\r\n\nammunition   at   issue  substantially   affected  interstate\r\n\ncommerce.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.

Where,\r\n\nas  here,   the  jurisdictional   element  is   present,  the\r\n\ngovernment need  only prove  the minimal nexus  to interstate\r\n\ncommerce identified in  Scarborough.   See Diaz-Martinez,  71\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d at 953.  Smith's argument is without merit.\r\n\nI.   The Sufficiency of the Government's Evidence\r                                                             \r\n\n          Smith  argues   that   his  conviction   rests   on\r\n\ninsufficient  evidence.   In  reviewing this  claim, we  must\r\n\ndetermine  whether,  after  viewing  the  evidence,  and  all\r\n\nreasonable  inferences drawn  therefrom,  in  the light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to  the government's  case, a  rational factfinder\r\n\ncould find,  beyond a reasonable doubt,  that the prosecution\r\n\nhas  proved the essential  elements of  the offense.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. O'Brien,  14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.  1994).  In so\r                             \r\n\ndoing,  this court defers to  the jury as  to all credibility\r\n\njudgments, and need conclude only that the evidence, taken in\r\n\nits  entirety,  supports  a  judgment  of  conviction.    Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nBecause the evidence  in this case  was more than  sufficient\r\n\nunder this standard, Smith's claims are without merit.\r\n\n          Smith argues that there was no evidence  indicating\r\n\nthat he possessed a handgun on the evening in question, hence\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nno  proof that he possessed ammunition as well.  Smith points\r\n\nto the fact  that, while Veneau and Tetreault  both testified\r\n\nthat the man  in the back seat handed an  object to Yanovitch\r\n\nand that the latter proceeded to shoot Viens, they did not go\r\n\nso far as  to state that Smith passed a firearm to Yanovitch.\r\n\n          However,  the  testimony of  Veneau  and Tetreault,\r\n\ntogether  with the  reasonable inferences  that can  be drawn\r\n\ntherefrom and  from the other evidence, is ample to establish\r\n\nSmith's involvement.   Veneau said  that he  never saw  Brian\r\n\nSmith with a gun, but that was because he did not know anyone\r\n\nnamed  Brian Smith.  Veneau's  assertion that the  man in the\r\n\nmiddle  passed what Veneau believed to be a gun to Yanovitch,\r\n\nwhen  coupled with  evidence that  Smith was  the man  in the\r\n\nmiddle, supports the  conviction.   Tetreault testified  that\r\n\nshe did not recognize the object while it was being passed to\r\n\nYanovitch, but noted  that she  saw that  it was  a gun  when\r\n\nYanovitch  got out of  the car with  it.  This  testimony, in\r\n\nconjunction with  all the  other evidence at  hand, including\r\n\nthe subsequent  shooting and  Duggan's testimony that  he had\r\n\nseen Smith with a handgun  earlier, was adequate to establish\r\n\nSmith's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\nJ.   Four-Level  Increase  in  Smith's  Guideline  Sentencing\r                                                                         \r\n     Range \r                       \r\n\n          On  appeal, Smith  challenges the  factual findings\r\n\nthat served as the  foundation for the four-level enhancement\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nof  his Guideline  Sentencing Range  (\"GSR\").   Since Smith's\r\n\ncounsel properly objected to these findings at the sentencing\r\n\nhearing,  this  court's review  is  limited  to clear  error.\r\n\nUnited  States v. Powell, 50 F.3d 94, 102-03 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                    \r\n\nUnder  the  circumstances, \"we  ask  only  whether the  court\r\n\nclearly  erred  in finding  that  the  government proved  the\r\n\ndisputed  fact by a preponderance  of the evidence.\"   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n103.   We hold that the factual findings were amply supported\r\n\non the record and that  the court did not commit clear  error\r\n\nin assessing a four-level increase to Smith's GSR.\r\n\n          Smith alleges that the district court clearly erred\r\n\nwhen  it increased  his GSR  based upon  its finding  that he\r\n\ntransferred  the  firearm  to Yanovitch  in  connection  with\r\n\nanother felony offense.  United States Sentencing Commission,\r\n\nGuidelines Manual,   2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1995).12  Smith claims\r                             \r\n\nthat  the  evidence  presented  at  trial  was  insufficient,\r\n\nespecially as there was  an absence of proof that  Smith knew\r\n\nthat Yanovitch intended to use the gun to shoot Viens.  \r\n\n          The evidence  at trial was sufficient  to show that\r\n\nSmith  and Viens became involved in a dispute about a firearm\r\n\nat  a Boston  bar; that  the two men  left the  bar together;\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.    U.S.S.G.    2K2.1(b)(5) provides:   \"If  the defendant\r\nused  or possessed  any firearm  or ammunition  in connection\r\nwith another felony offense;  or possessed or transferred any\r\nfirearm or  ammunition with  knowledge, intent, or  reason to\r\nbelieve  that it  would be  used  in connection  with another\r\nfelony offense, increase by 4 levels . . . .\"\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nthat,  when Smith  reached inside  his jacket,  Viens punched\r\n\nhim; and that Smith was pulled into the back seat of the car,\r\n\nfrom where he  handed a  gun to Yanovitch,  who proceeded  to\r\n\nshoot Viens.  From  this, it was reasonable for  the district\r\n\ncourt  to infer  that  Smith gave  his  handgun to  Yanovitch\r\n\nintending and expecting the latter to use it against Viens.13\r\n\nAs this  was a reasonable and  permissible interpretation, it\r\n\njustified the four-level enhancement of Smith's GSR.\r\n\nK.   The Attachment of the Sentencing Hearing  Transcripts to\r                                                                         \r\n     Smith's Presentence Report\r                                           \r\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, Smith asked the district\r\n\ncourt  to order  deleted from  the PSR  reference  to certain\r\n\nstate convictions.  These  convictions had been vacated prior\r\n\nto the hearing, and,  as a result, Smith  no longer could  be\r\n\nsentenced  as  an  armed career  criminal,  see  18 U.S.C.   \r                                                           \r\n\n924(e)(1) (Supp. 1996), although  he could still be sentenced\r\n\nas a felon-in-possession.   The district court  stated on the\r\n\nrecord  during the  sentencing  hearing  that the  challenged\r\n\nconvictions  had been  set aside  and ordered  the transcript\r\n\ncontaining  its remarks  to  be attached  to  the PSR  as  an\r\n\nindication  that  these  convictions  were  no  longer valid.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.    The district court  held as follows:   \"I rule  on the\r\ntotality  of  the trial  record  . . . that  the evidence  is\r\nsufficient to  warrant a finding  that when Mr.  Smith passed\r\nthe weapon to  Mr. Yanovitch,  he well knew  and he  intended\r\nthat it be used to assault Mr. Viennes [sic].   Not any self-\r\ndefense, but in furtherance of the altercation.  I find  by a\r\nfair preponderance  of the  evidence that that  was precisely\r\nwhat was in Mr. Smith's mind, and I add four levels . . . .\" \r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nDeeming  attachment  of  the  transcript to  be  an  adequate\r\n\ncorrective, the court refused to direct the probation officer\r\n\nto revise the PSR itself.\r\n\n          Smith did  not object  to the court's  procedure at\r\n\nthe  time, but on appeal complains that the Bureau of Prisons\r\n\nuses  these PSRs to allocate the  prison population among its\r\n\ninstitutions and programs.   According to Smith, the Bureau's\r\n\npersonnel  is not likely  to pay attention  to the sentencing\r\n\nhearing transcript.   Consequently, Smith argues  that he has\r\n\nbeen unduly prejudiced  by the  district court's  order.   He\r\n\nasks us to order proper corrections to be made to his PSR.\r\n\n          Federal   Rule   of  Criminal   Procedure  32(c)(1)\r\n\nrequires a  sentencing court to address  each relevant matter\r\n\nin the PSR which is controverted by the parties.14  The court\r\n\nmust  make either a finding  or a determination  that none is\r\n\nnecessary.   Not  intended as  an \"onerous\"  requirement, the\r\n\nsentencing court's determinations \"can be simply entered onto\r\n\na  form  which is  then appended  to  the report.\"   Advisory\r\n\nCommittee  Notes  to  Fed.

The relevant text of Rule 32(c)(1) is as follows:  \"For\r\neach  matter  controverted,  the  court must  make  either  a\r\nfinding on the allegation or a determination that no  finding\r\nis  necessary because  the  controverted matter  will not  be\r\ntaken into account  in, or  will not affect,  sentencing.

Smith does  not here\r\n\ncomplain that  the district  court mishandled or  misread the\r\n\nvacated convictions so  as to sentence him improperly in this\r\n\ncase.  Rather, he fears that appending the transcript, rather\r\n\nthan physically revising the  PSR, is an insufficient way  to\r\n\nalert future prison  authorities to  the true  status of  the\r\n\nprior convictions.  Whether  or not this is a  realistic fear\r\n\nwe  cannot say.  Smith did  not raise this concern before the\r\n\ndistrict  judge,  who  was  best  situated  to  pass  on  it.\r\n\nPrecedent  indicates   that  the   appending  of   a  hearing\r\n\ntranscript  will comply with the Rule.15  If, in a particular\r\n\ncase,  there are  practical reasons  to do  more, we  have no\r\n\ndoubt  that the district court, if asked, would look into the\r\n\nmatter, with the  help of the probation officer.   As we say,\r\n\nSmith did not raise  the issue below; absent his  having done\r\n\nso, we can find no  error cognizable on appeal.  We  add that\r\n\nit  is still not too late for Smith's concerns to be attended\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.

Yanovitch's Sentence\r                                     \r\n\n          Yanovitch  challenges the factual  findings made by\r\n\nthe  district court as  a basis for his  sentence.  We review\r\n\nhis  claims for clear error.  Powell,  50 F.3d at 102-03.  We\r                                                \r\n\nare  satisfied  that  the  record below  amply  supports  the\r\n\nsentencing  court's  factual  findings and  that  Yanovitch's\r\n\nallegations are baseless.\r\n\n          Yanovitch contends  that the evidence at  trial was\r\n\ninsufficient to establish that he attempted to shoot Viens in\r\n\nthe  head,  and that  he  had the  intent  to kill  him.   If\r\n\nanything,   Yanovitch   argues,   the   evidence   at   trial\r\n\ndemonstrated that he acted in the heat of passion and in  the\r\n\nabsence  of  malice  aforethought; there  was  no indication,\r\n\naccording  to Yanovitch, that  he had the  necessary state of\r\n\nmind for attempted murder.   Nevertheless, the district court\r\n\nfound  that Yanovitch's  conduct conformed  to the  charge of\r\n\nassault with intent to murder,  and, based upon that finding,\r\n\nsentenced  him under U.S.S.G.   2A2.1.   On appeal, Yanovitch\r\n\nargues  that  a reasonable  person  would  conclude that  the\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nincident in question was  an aggravated assault or,  at most,\r\n\nan  assault with an attempt to commit manslaughter, either of\r\n\nwhich would require application of U.S.S.G.   2A2.2.16\r\n\n          Yanovitch's  argument  merits little  discussion in\r\n\nlight of the evidence  at trial which was also  summarized in\r\n\nhis PSR,  and the tape  recording of Veneau's  interview with\r\n\nBoston  Police.17    This  evidence  obviously  supports  the\r\n\nsentencing  court's determination  that Yanovitch  shot Viens\r\n\nwith the intent  to kill him.  The court  did not clearly err\r\n\nwhen it sentenced Yanovitch pursuant to U.S.S.G.   2A2.1.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.   While    2A2.1 (Assault with  Intent to Commit  Murder;\r\nAttempted Murder) has  a base  offense level of  22,    2A2.2\r\n(Aggravated Assault) has a base offense level of 15.\r\n\n17.   The PSR stated, in relevant part: \"Yanovitch got out of\r\nthe car, fired  one round into the ground, then  walked up to\r\nViens and shot at Viens at least  twice, striking him once in\r\nthe  abdomen and  once in  the upper  thigh.   Yanovitch then\r\npursued  Viens up the  street, put the  gun 2 to  3 feet from\r\nViens' head, fired again, but missed.\"\r\n     Veneau  stated,  in  pertinent  part:   \"  . . . when  I\r\nlooking back I see Gerry Yanovitch 'bout three feet, two-and-\r\nhalf  feet behind  Bobby [Viens]  pointing a,  something that\r\nlooks like  a small calibre  handgun towards Bobby's  head, I\r\nhear another one, bang.

They, then, went to King's apartment, located in the same housing development in which Ortiz lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the evening, Yanovitch and his date, Danielle Scanlon, arrived at King's apartment and joined the others in drinking beer.  All of them left King's apartment and got into the large, dark-colored, four-door Lincoln Town Car in which Yanovitch and Scanlon had arrived that evening.  With Yanovitch driving, they traveled to a bar named \"Kelly's Cork and Bull\" in South Boston.  The group arrived between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, and stayed there about one and one-half or two hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near closing time, Smith and Yanovitch became involved in a conversation with Robert Viens, Jr., Brown's former boyfriend.  Smith and Viens began to argue about a gun, and the argument spilled into the street.  Yanovitch, King and Brown, as well as Viens's friend, Walter Veneau, and the latter's girlfriend, Tammy Tetreault, followed them out of the bar.  Once outside, Yanovitch, King and Brown walked over to their Lincoln, which was parked nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Viens continued to argue outside the bar.  Smith said to Viens that he wanted to speak with him alone, and the two of them walked down the street together away from the bar.  Smith, then, reached inside his jacket, and Viens responded by throwing punches at Smith.  The fight moved back towards the Lincoln, as people tried to break it up.  Veneau pulled his friend Viens back from Smith as Smith was pulled into the center of the Lincoln's back seat, with King on one side of him and Scanlon on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yanovitch, who was still outside the Lincoln, exchanged words with Viens, and then partially entered the car through the driver's side door.  From the back seat, Smith handed a handgun to Yanovitch.  Yanovitch got out of the car with the gun, proceeded to fire one round into the ground, and then shot Viens.  Viens ran and staggered up the street away from Yanovitch.  Yanovitch shot Viens again, and Viens fell to the ground.  From behind, Yanovitch closed on Viens, pointed the gun at his head, and fired again.  Yanovitch, then, ran back to the Lincoln, got behind the wheel and sped away with his friends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Yanovitch sped away, Veneau went to comfort Viens, who was lying in the street.  The Boston Police and paramedics in an ambulance responded to the scene.  The paramedics found Viens alive, lying on his back in the street.  Viens had two small-caliber entry wounds and a third small-caliber exit wound.  One of the entry wounds was in his left front chest, while the exit wound was in the right side of his chest.  Viens was uncooperative, refused to give his name, and even told witnesses at the scene not to cooperate with the police.  The paramedics placed Viens in the ambulance and took him to Boston City Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A friend drove Veneau to Boston City Hospital, where he saw Viens's parents.  Although he initially refused to cooperate with the police, Veneau changed his mind after speaking with Viens's father.  Veneau, then, gave a tape recorded interview to Boston Police Sergeant Detective James Wyse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without information from the victim or witnesses, the police searched the area of the shooting, but initially did not find any ballistics evidence.  After speaking with Veneau concerning the exact location of the shooting, police officers returned to the crime scene and recovered two spent .25 caliber shell casings.  One of the casings was found approximately fifteen to twenty-five feet from where Viens was lying when the police and paramedics found him.  The other casing was recovered an additional ten to twenty feet away from the first casing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Yanovitch were arrested on the basis of a complaint.  On January 24, 1995, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Smith and Yanovitch with being felons-in-possession of a firearm (Count One) and ammunition (Count Two), in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996), 2 (1969).  At trial, Smith and Yanovitch stipulated that they were convicted felons at the time of the shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government called a paramedic, Michael Sullivan, and two police officers, Wyse and Lieutenant Gary French, who had responded to the scene.  After speaking with Veneau at Boston City Hospital, French returned to the crime scene and recovered the two shell casings.  The government also called Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\") Special Agent, Allan Offringa, who testified on direct examination that the .25 caliber shell casings were manufactured outside Massachusetts, and that the only .25 caliber pistol manufactured in that state was manufactured by a company named Harrington and Richardson (\"H &amp; R\"), which started making the gun in 1909 and stopped doing so before World War II.  Boston Police Ballistician, Edward Szalno, testified that the marks found on the spent shell casings were not made by an H &amp; R pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government obtained compulsion/immunity orders for two of the women who were in the car with Smith and Yanovitch.  Although these women, Brown and Scanlon, claimed that they did not see the shooting, they did confirm that they were out with Smith, Yanovitch and King on the evening in question, and that Yanovitch got into the driver's seat of the car shortly after they heard gun shots.  Both women also confirmed that Smith was seated in the middle of the back seat of the car.  Duggan was called as a witness by the government.  He recounted his confrontation with Smith earlier in the evening in question.  Veneau and Tetreault testified to having witnessed the shooting.  They said that the man in the middle of the back seat of the car handed Yanovitch a gun, which the latter used to shoot Viens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial and conviction of Smith and Yanovitch on both counts of the indictment, and the government's election of Count Two, the court sentenced Smith to the statutory maximum of 120 months in prison, and Yanovitch to 78 months in prison, with three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Smith presents a host of issues, claiming errors at trial and in sentencing.  As most of these issues were not raised in the district court, they are reviewable on appeal only for plain error.  Yanovitch challenges his sentence and says that he adopts by reference any additional issues raised by Smith which could materially affect his rights in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Nondisclosure of Test Results</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Ballistician Edward Szalno testified that the two shell casings that were recovered from the crime scene were fired from a .25 caliber semi-automatic weapon, but that the weapon was not a Harrington &amp; Richardson (\"H &amp; R\") pistol.  Since H &amp; R is the only company that has ever manufactured a .25 caliber semi-automatic weapon within the state of Massachusetts, the effect of this testimony was to indicate that the gun used had traveled in interstate commerce.  Prior to testifying, Szalno had test-fired an H &amp; R .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, and had compared the shell casings with those found at the crime scene.  This comparison confirmed his earlier conclusion that the casings recovered from the crime scene were not fired from an H &amp; R pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's counsel says he first became aware of this test-firing during his cross-examination of Szalno.  He, then, moved to strike Szalno's testimony on the ground that the government had violated its discovery obligations by failing to inform the defense of the test.  Counsel argued that this discovery violation affected his cross-examination and prejudiced Smith's defense.  The court ruled that the government should have provided defense counsel with the observed results of the test-firing, even though no written report had been generated.  The court refused, however, to strike Szalno's testimony, noting that defense counsel had not sought a continuance to counter the evidence and had, in effect, created the problem at hand by asking questions without first determining the likely responses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions that might arguably have required advance disclosure of the test-firing results are Rule 116.1 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(D).  The former states, in relevant part, \"The government shall disclose, and allow the defendant to inspect, copy and photograph, all written materials as follows:  (3) ... all scientific tests, experiments and comparisons, or copies thereof, made in connection with a particular case.\"   D.Mass.R. 116.1(a)(3).  As the Local Rule is expressly limited to written materials, of which none were generated here, it was not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other proviso upon which Smith relies is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(D), which does not speak specifically of written materials only.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, the words \"inspect and copy or photograph\" logically suggest that the items to be disclosed be tangible enough to be susceptible to inspection, copying or photographing.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(D);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A), (C).  Our circuit has expressly reserved decision on whether Rule 16(a)(1)(D) requires the disclosure of unrecorded personal observations of tests and the like.  Compare United States v. Veilleux, 40 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.1994), with United States v. Tejada, 886 F.2d 483 (1st Cir.1989).  Other circuits, however, have held that such unrecorded information is not covered by Rule 16(a)(1)(D).  United States v. Shue, 766 F.2d 1122, 1135 (7th Cir.1985) (the Rule does not require disclosure of expert's oral statements made after comparing photographs);  United States v. Johnson, 713 F.2d 654, 659 (11th Cir.1983) (where no report was prepared by expert, no discovery obligation was incurred under the Rule).  See also United States v. Peters, 937 F.2d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir.1991) (similar language in Rule 16(b)(1)(B), \"cannot pertain to oral information\").  We think the above decisions of the Seventh, Eleventh and Ninth Circuits are consistent with the plain language of Rule 16(a)(1)(D), and hold that where the test result in question consisted of the expert's unrecorded comparison of the test-firing casings with those at the crime scene, Rule 16(a)(1)(D) did not obligate the government to produce in advance the expert's conclusions.  This being so, we find no error in the court's refusal to strike Szalno's testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this ends the matter, we also agree with the district court that there was a total absence of prejudice from the nonproduction of the expert's observations following the test-firing.  Smith argues that, had he known about Szalno's test-firing, he would not have cross-examined him in the manner he did, to his detriment.  However, before Szalno took the stand, ATF Special Agent Offringa had already testified that he had test-fired an H &amp; R pistol, and that he had given the casings to Szalno for a comparison.  In addition, Szalno himself testified on direct examination that he had examined two cartridge cases that had been fired from an H &amp; R .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol and had made reference to the FBI's General Rifle and Characteristics book.  Smith was, therefore, on notice prior to cross-examination that Szalno had compared the casings from the crime scene with others that were test-fired from an H &amp; R pistol.  The test-firing of an H &amp; R pistol was, moreover, relevant only to the interstate element of the firearm convictions, which the government later elected to dismiss.  The test-firing was irrelevant to the ammunition charges upon which both Smith and Yanovitch were sentenced, it being undisputed the casings had been manufactured in Arkansas.  As only the latter convictions stand, the claimed error would have been harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>B. The Admissibility of Evidence Concerning Smith's Possession of a Firearm Earlier on the Night in Question</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duggan testified that he had a confrontation with Smith earlier on the evening in question, in which Smith displayed a small, semi-automatic handgun.  Smith contends that such testimony was admitted in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) because it was evidence of a prior bad act offered solely to prove Smith's propensity to use guns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  For evidence of this sort to be admissible, it must be shown to bear some special relevance to an aspect of the case at hand, other than merely to the defendant's propensity to do bad things.  See United States v. Cortijo-Diaz, 875 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir.1989).  Here, Smith argues, the testimony lacked such special relevance and was used by the government simply as propensity evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith did not, however, object at trial to Duggan's testimony in this regard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Our review is, therefore, limited to plain error.  Under that standard, the burden falls on appellants to show that there is an error, that the error is clear or obvious, and that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings below.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  Because the challenged testimony was proper evidence of the crimes charged, the court did not commit error, much less plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Far from merely relating to \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts,\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), Duggan's testimony helped establish that Smith knowingly possessed a firearm (Count One) and ammunition (Count Two), as required under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996).  The decisions in United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946 (1st Cir.1995), and United States v. Klein, 13 F.3d 1182 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 52 U.S. 1226, 114 S.Ct. 2722, 129 L.Ed.2d 846 (1994), are instructive.  In Diaz-Martinez, the defendant, who was charged with possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996), was involved in a shootout immediately before his arrest, at which time police recovered the firearms.  We dismissed defendant's argument that the government improperly referred to the shootout in its closing argument stating, \"[B]ecause ... the shootout was integrally related to the evidence linking the guns to the defendant (the possession charges), that evidence could not have been barred by Rule 404(b).\"  Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 951 n. 4.   The Eighth Circuit reached the same conclusion in Klein on comparable facts.  Klein, 13 F.3d at 1184.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that the possession charge related only to the weapon with which Viens was shot, Duggan's testimony that Smith was in possession of a similar handgun earlier that evening tended to establish that Smith possessed the same handgun a few hours later, at the time of the shooting.  The district court did not commit plain error in admitting Duggan's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>C. The District Court's Control of Smith's Cross-Examination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith argues on appeal that the district court erroneously restricted his cross-examination of Duggan.  Duggan first informed police of his encounter with Smith about two weeks before trial, after he had been taken into custody on unrelated charges.  Smith contends that he wanted to establish on cross-examination that, at the time of his testimony, Duggan had pending against him a number of criminal charges.  This line of questioning would have enabled Smith to argue that Duggan had slanted his testimony to gain better treatment from the government.  Smith complains that the district court severely limited his ability in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's discretion to control cross-examination, while broad, is not unlimited.  See United States v. Camuti, 78 F.3d 738, 742 (1st Cir.1996).  However, we find little indication that the court restricted cross-examination in the asserted manner.  Moreover, counsel did not at the time complain to the court of being so limited, hence we review only for plain error, Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78, a standard clearly not met on this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the initial stages of cross-examination, when counsel asked Duggan if he had cases pending against him, the district court sustained the government's objection.  Defense counsel then asked whether the government had helped him with his pending cases.  Duggan answered in the negative.  Later, counsel asked whether Duggan was aware that Ortiz had filed a complaint against him for threatening her with bodily harm.  The government objected, and a sidebar followed.  During the sidebar, the district court stated, \"Perhaps I was precipitant.\"   It allowed counsel to pursue the challenged line of questioning.  Duggan then conceded that he was aware of Ortiz's complaint at the time he contacted the police.  After counsel finished questioning Duggan regarding Ortiz's complaint, he did not proceed with similar questions relative to other pending matters nor ask the court to allow him to do so nor indicate that he felt unduly limited.  We find no merit in Smith's argument on appeal that the court improperly restricted his cross-examination of Duggan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>D. Duggan's Prison Reference and its Impact on the Trial</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duggan mentioned during his direct examination that King's \"ex-boyfriend\" had recently been released from prison, an obvious reference, Smith says, to himself.  Smith's counsel promptly objected, and the court ordered the challenged testimony struck.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Smith's counsel did not ask for a mistrial at the time, but, on appeal, now argues that the court erred in not declaring a mistrial sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a request for a mistrial, this court's review of the court's failure to order a mistrial is for plain error only.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Smith argues that, since it was clear to the jury that Duggan was referring to Smith as having been released from jail, the response was so prejudicial as to necessitate a mistrial.  The district court, however, took some curative measures.  It sustained Smith's objection and struck Duggan's remark.  As counsel asked for no more at the time, the trial court could reasonably assume that Smith was satisfied.  The degree of prejudice was neither so obvious nor so clear that only a mistrial would have satisfied the needs of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Cresta, 825 F.2d 538 (1st Cir.1987), this court laid out the factors that must be considered in evaluating an otherwise improper reference to an accused's prior imprisonment:  whether the remark was isolated, whether it was deliberate or accidental, whether the trial court's instruction was sufficient to counteract any prejudice that might have flowed from the remark, and whether any remaining prejudice could affect the outcome of the case.  Cresta, 825 F.2d at 550.   The remark in the present case, as the government points out, was a single, isolated and accidental reference by a witness trying to answer a question designed to address defense counsel's hearsay objection.  Smith himself had already stipulated that he was a convicted felon.  The disputed remark added little, therefore, to what the jury could already surmise.  We do not find plain error in the court's failure to order a mistrial sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. The Questioning of Defense Witness Ortiz</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, the government was allowed, over Smith's unexplicated objection, to ask defense witness Ortiz whether she had acted as a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and whether, as such, she had helped the DEA obtain a search warrant for the apartment of her friend, Colleen King.  Smith now argues that the district court should have excluded these questions because they were irrelevant and because--by implying that Smith's girlfriend was the subject of a drug investigation--they unduly prejudiced him and his case.  Smith also asserts that the district court erred in preventing him from establishing that the DEA's subsequent search of King's apartment yielded no evidence of illegal drugs.  Eliciting such evidence was relevant, Smith says, to undermine any concerns about the credibility of the witness and to rebut the prejudicial characterization of Smith and his girlfriend.  We do not find plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One problem with these arguments is that Smith never advised the district court of the reasons he now advances on appeal for excluding the government's line of inquiry.  Federal Rule of Evidence 103 states that error may not be grounded upon an evidentiary ruling \"unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and ... [i]n case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection....\"  Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Counsel had been informed in advance that the government planned to cross-examine Ortiz concerning her DEA connections, and while he objected, he did not argue that the information was irrelevant nor did he claim prejudice under Rule 403.  And when the district court limited Smith's redirect examination of Ortiz, Smith made no objection.  Our review, therefore, is only for plain error.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that its cross-examination was designed to impeach Ortiz, and not to smear Smith and King.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Ortiz denied that she had ever furnished information to the DEA, the government did not implicate Smith during its cross-examination of Ortiz, and the court instructed the jury that counsel's questions did not constitute evidence.  Even assuming arguendo, it was error to allow the government to cross-examine Ortiz as it did, we conclude the error caused slight, if any, damage to Smith.  The limitation of Smith's redirect was likewise far short of plain error.  The subject matter was of border-line relevance, hence well within the discretion of the court to control, see Fed.R.Evid. 401.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F. The Government's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith claims that the prosecution misstated the evidence on four separate occasions in its closing argument.  These alleged misstatements, according to Smith, went to the heart of the case, were not corrected by the district court and, therefore, warrant the reversal of his conviction.  The challenged statements, and this court's reasons for rejecting Smith's present claims, are set forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith concedes that he did not object at trial to the challenged statements.  Consequently, we review his present claims under the plain error standard.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   In so doing, we consider a number of factors, \"including the frequency and deliberateness of the prosecutor's comments, the strength and clarity of the trial judge's instructions, and the strength of the government's case against the defendant.\"  United States v. Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1282 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first disputed statement, that Mark Duggan testified that he saw Smith with a .22 or .25 caliber pistol on the night in question, is the only characterization of evidence that can be termed a misstatement.  We do not find, however, that the prosecutor's description strayed far enough from Duggan's actual testimony, \"a small caliber handgun,\" to amount to plain error.  However described, the small caliber handgun mentioned in Duggan's testimony was consistent with the .25 caliber casings recovered after the shooting.  The prosecutor's mistake was not so serious as to imply bad faith or deliberate prevarication.  Also, the case against Smith was strong, and the court properly instructed the jury on the effect of the lawyer's statements.

Statement # 2 rested on Veneau's testimony that the government protected him and helped him move out of South Boston, and that he had not gone to the police for fear of the defendants.  Statement # 4 was a fair inference from the testimony of Boston Police Lieutenant French.  Statement # 3 is more problematic but in no way amounts to plain error.  The government argues in its brief that the prosecutor referred to the jury as having \"sat up there\" and seen the witness's, Tetreault's, fear.  If this is what the prosecutor said, the remark was unexceptionable, since the jury had observed Tetreault on the stand and could determine whether or not she exhibited fear.  The transcript, however, indicates the prosecutor as actually having said that \"he sat up there\" and saw fear in Tetreault's face.  If the \"he\" referred to Veneau, the comment was arguably garbled, since by the time Veneau testified at the trial, he had already retracted earlier misstatements to police that Tetreault had been absent.  But, even accepting the latter version, the unobjected-to remark was harmless and fell far short of constituting plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>G. The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith contends on appeal that the district court, through certain unobjected-to instructions given to the jury while the trial was in process, erroneously directed a verdict in the government's favor on the elements of ammunition and interstate commerce.  According to Smith, the district court wrongly told the jury that the casings which were received into evidence were ammunition, and had traveled in interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Such instructions, according to the defense, had the effect of directing the jury to find against Smith on two essential elements of the offense.  See United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 788-89 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d 1160, 1167 (2d Cir.1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 1724, 48 L.Ed.2d 193 (1976)).  Smith, thus, concludes that the district court committed plain error, requiring the reversal of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made the challenged remarks in the course of certain mid-trial comments to the jury intended, among other things, to correct an earlier misstatement by Yanovitch's counsel relative to the definition of \"ammunition.\"   Counsel had stated that shell casings were not ammunition, an assertion contrary to the definition set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(17)(A) (1996):  \"The term 'ammunition' means ammunition or cartridge cases....\"  Before correcting counsel, the trial court indicated to the jury that it was instructing them as to the law, not as to the evidence.  If counsel wished clarification, he should have asked for it at the time.  In its final charge to the jury, the district court clearly informed the jury of the government's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt defendants' possession of ammunition and of the movement of the ammunition in commerce, and gave accurate, extensive and clear instructions on each of these points.  We do not find plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>H.

Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   After considering the instruction, and the prevailing case law, we conclude that the court did not commit error, plain or otherwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its case, the government had to prove that possession of the ammunition was \"in or affecting commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (1976 &amp; Supp.1976).  The Supreme Court in Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 1969, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977), held that evidence showing that a weapon had crossed state lines is legally sufficient to satisfy this element of the statute.  Smith, while not disputing the above, contends that it should have been left solely to the jury to decide whether the ammunition's crossing of state lines could establish that possession was \"in or affecting commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument runs counter to the principle that the court, not the jury, is responsible for declaring the law.  Here, the court's instruction finds support in Scarborough and in circuit precedents spawned by Scarborough.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The court properly instructed the jury on the meaning of the phrase \"in or affecting commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith also claims that the court should have required the jury to find a \"substantial\" effect on interstate commerce, in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 1629-30, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995).  In Lopez, the Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) (Supp.1996), which prohibited a person from possessing a gun while in a \"school zone,\" on the grounds that it exceeded Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause.  Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.   Smith alleges that the Court's opinion in the Lopez case undermines the proposition, stated in Scarborough and its progeny, that Congress intended nothing more than a minimal contact with interstate commerce.  Consequently, Smith concludes that the district court committed error when it failed to instruct the jury that the government had the burden of proving that the ammunition at issue substantially affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's reliance on Lopez is misplaced.  Unlike the statute at issue in Lopez, Section 922(g)(1) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996) contains a specific jurisdictional element which ensures, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce.  Where, as here, the jurisdictional element is present, the government need only prove the minimal nexus to interstate commerce identified in Scarborough.   See Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953.   Smith's argument is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>I.

In reviewing this claim, we must determine whether, after viewing the evidence, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government's case, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution has proved the essential elements of the offense.   United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  In so doing, this court defers to the jury as to all credibility judgments, and need conclude only that the evidence, taken in its entirety, supports a judgment of conviction.  Id.  Because the evidence in this case was more than sufficient under this standard, Smith's claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith argues that there was no evidence indicating that he possessed a handgun on the evening in question, hence no proof that he possessed ammunition as well.  Smith points to the fact that, while Veneau and Tetreault both testified that the man in the back seat handed an object to Yanovitch and that the latter proceeded to shoot Viens, they did not go so far as to state that Smith passed a firearm to Yanovitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the testimony of Veneau and Tetreault, together with the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom and from the other evidence, is ample to establish Smith's involvement.  Veneau said that he never saw Brian Smith with a gun, but that was because he did not know anyone named Brian Smith.  Veneau's assertion that the man in the middle passed what Veneau believed to be a gun to Yanovitch, when coupled with evidence that Smith was the man in the middle, supports the conviction.  Tetreault testified that she did not recognize the object while it was being passed to Yanovitch, but noted that she saw that it was a gun when Yanovitch got out of the car with it.  This testimony, in conjunction with all the other evidence at hand, including the subsequent shooting and Duggan's testimony that he had seen Smith with a handgun earlier, was adequate to establish Smith's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>J.

Since Smith's counsel properly objected to these findings at the sentencing hearing, this court's review is limited to clear error.  United States v. Powell, 50 F.3d 94, 102-03 (1st Cir.1995).  Under the circumstances, \"we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Id. at 103.   We hold that the factual findings were amply supported on the record and that the court did not commit clear error in assessing a four-level increase to Smith's GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith alleges that the district court clearly erred when it increased his GSR based upon its finding that he transferred the firearm to Yanovitch in connection with another felony offense.  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov.1995).<sup>12</sup>  Smith claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient, especially as there was an absence of proof that Smith knew that Yanovitch intended to use the gun to shoot Viens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence at trial was sufficient to show that Smith and Viens became involved in a dispute about a firearm at a Boston bar;  that the two men left the bar together;  that, when Smith reached inside his jacket, Viens punched him;  and that Smith was pulled into the back seat of the car, from where he handed a gun to Yanovitch, who proceeded to shoot Viens.  From this, it was reasonable for the district court to infer that Smith gave his handgun to Yanovitch intending and expecting the latter to use it against Viens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  As this was a reasonable and permissible interpretation, it justified the four-level enhancement of Smith's GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>K.

These convictions had been vacated prior to the hearing, and, as a result, Smith no longer could be sentenced as an armed career criminal, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) (Supp.1996), although he could still be sentenced as a felon-in-possession.  The district court stated on the record during the sentencing hearing that the challenged convictions had been set aside and ordered the transcript containing its remarks to be attached to the PSR as an indication that these convictions were no longer valid.  Deeming attachment of the transcript to be an adequate corrective, the court refused to direct the probation officer to revise the PSR itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith did not object to the court's procedure at the time, but on appeal complains that the Bureau of Prisons uses these PSRs to allocate the prison population among its institutions and programs.  According to Smith, the Bureau's personnel is not likely to pay attention to the sentencing hearing transcript.  Consequently, Smith argues that he has been unduly prejudiced by the district court's order.  He asks us to order proper corrections to be made to his PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c)(1) requires a sentencing court to address each relevant matter in the PSR which is controverted by the parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  The court must make either a finding or a determination that none is necessary.  Not intended as an \"onerous\" requirement, the sentencing court's determinations \"can be simply entered onto a form which is then appended to the report.\"   Advisory Committee Notes to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(3)(D) (the predecessor of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1)), 1983 Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Bruckman, 874 F.2d 57, 63-64 (1st Cir.1989), this court noted that the purpose behind the Rule's writing requirement is to protect the defendant's due process rights and to provide the reviewing court with a clear record of the disposition below.  Smith does not here complain that the district court mishandled or misread the vacated convictions so as to sentence him improperly in this case.  Rather, he fears that appending the transcript, rather than physically revising the PSR, is an insufficient way to alert future prison authorities to the true status of the prior convictions.  Whether or not this is a realistic fear we cannot say.  Smith did not raise this concern before the district judge, who was best situated to pass on it.  Precedent indicates that the appending of a hearing transcript will comply with the Rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  If, in a particular case, there are practical reasons to do more, we have no doubt that the district court, if asked, would look into the matter, with the help of the probation officer.  As we say, Smith did not raise the issue below;  absent his having done so, we can find no error cognizable on appeal.  We add that it is still not too late for Smith's concerns to be attended to administratively--assuming they have any legitimacy, which we cannot ascertain from the record before us--by simply appending a suitable notation to the PSR updating the status of the prior convictions.  Whether this or some other measure is necessary we leave entirely to the appropriate authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>L.

If anything, Yanovitch argues, the evidence at trial demonstrated that he acted in the heat of passion and in the absence of malice aforethought;  there was no indication, according to Yanovitch, that he had the necessary state of mind for attempted murder.  Nevertheless, the district court found that Yanovitch's conduct conformed to the charge of assault with intent to murder, and, based upon that finding, sentenced him under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.1.  On appeal, Yanovitch argues that a reasonable person would conclude that the incident in question was an aggravated assault or, at most, an assault with an attempt to commit manslaughter, either of which would require application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yanovitch's argument merits little discussion in light of the evidence at trial which was also summarized in his PSR, and the tape recording of Veneau's interview with Boston Police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  This evidence obviously supports the sentencing court's determination that Yanovitch shot Viens with the intent to kill him.

After a five-day trial, a jury convicted the defendants-appellants on both counts of the indictment.  Prior to sentencing, the district court, citing double jeopardy concerns, required the government to elect between counts, and the government chose to retain the conviction under Count Two.  The district court sentenced Smith to the statutory maximum of 120 months in prison without supervised release or fine, and with a $50 assessment.  The court sentenced Yanovitch to 78 months in prison, with three years supervised release, no fine and a $50 assessment.  Both defendants filed timely notices of appeal.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 8:00 to 8:30 p.m. on Friday, December 2, 1994, Mark Duggan was in Charlestown, Massachusetts to pick up a friend, Jonellen Ortiz.  As Duggan drove to the parking lot in the rear of Ortiz's apartment building, he passed Smith.  Duggan pulled his car into the parking lot and stopped.  Through his rear view mirror, Duggan saw Smith approaching his car from behind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Duggan had had a prior confrontation in Charlestown approximately two months earlier concerning a woman, Colleen King, who was the mother of Smith's son and Duggan's former girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duggan got out of the car, exchanged words with Smith, who was thirty to forty feet away, and then reached back into the car and retrieved a baseball bat.  Smith reached into his pants and pulled out a dark, small caliber, semi-automatic handgun and showed it to Duggan.  There was a standoff, and Smith eventually left the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the encounter with Duggan, Smith and King met King's best friend, Melissa Brown, on a street in Charlestown.  Brown had known Smith for approximately five years, and was the godmother of Smith's and King's son.  The three of them walked to a liquor store on Main Street in Charlestown, where they purchased beer.  They, then, went to King's apartment, located in the same housing development in which Ortiz lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in the evening, Yanovitch and his date, Danielle Scanlon, arrived at King's apartment and joined the others in drinking beer.  All of them left King's apartment and got into the large, dark-colored, four-door Lincoln Town Car in which Yanovitch and Scanlon had arrived that evening.  With Yanovitch driving, they traveled to a bar named \"Kelly's Cork and Bull\" in South Boston.  The group arrived between 11:30 p.m. and midnight, and stayed there about one and one-half or two hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Near closing time, Smith and Yanovitch became involved in a conversation with Robert Viens, Jr., Brown's former boyfriend.  Smith and Viens began to argue about a gun, and the argument spilled into the street.  Yanovitch, King and Brown, as well as Viens's friend, Walter Veneau, and the latter's girlfriend, Tammy Tetreault, followed them out of the bar.  Once outside, Yanovitch, King and Brown walked over to their Lincoln, which was parked nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Viens continued to argue outside the bar.  Smith said to Viens that he wanted to speak with him alone, and the two of them walked down the street together away from the bar.  Smith, then, reached inside his jacket, and Viens responded by throwing punches at Smith.  The fight moved back towards the Lincoln, as people tried to break it up.  Veneau pulled his friend Viens back from Smith as Smith was pulled into the center of the Lincoln's back seat, with King on one side of him and Scanlon on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yanovitch, who was still outside the Lincoln, exchanged words with Viens, and then partially entered the car through the driver's side door.  From the back seat, Smith handed a handgun to Yanovitch.  Yanovitch got out of the car with the gun, proceeded to fire one round into the ground, and then shot Viens.  Viens ran and staggered up the street away from Yanovitch.  Yanovitch shot Viens again, and Viens fell to the ground.  From behind, Yanovitch closed on Viens, pointed the gun at his head, and fired again.  Yanovitch, then, ran back to the Lincoln, got behind the wheel and sped away with his friends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Yanovitch sped away, Veneau went to comfort Viens, who was lying in the street.  The Boston Police and paramedics in an ambulance responded to the scene.  The paramedics found Viens alive, lying on his back in the street.  Viens had two small-caliber entry wounds and a third small-caliber exit wound.  One of the entry wounds was in his left front chest, while the exit wound was in the right side of his chest.  Viens was uncooperative, refused to give his name, and even told witnesses at the scene not to cooperate with the police.  The paramedics placed Viens in the ambulance and took him to Boston City Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A friend drove Veneau to Boston City Hospital, where he saw Viens's parents.  Although he initially refused to cooperate with the police, Veneau changed his mind after speaking with Viens's father.  Veneau, then, gave a tape recorded interview to Boston Police Sergeant Detective James Wyse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without information from the victim or witnesses, the police searched the area of the shooting, but initially did not find any ballistics evidence.  After speaking with Veneau concerning the exact location of the shooting, police officers returned to the crime scene and recovered two spent .25 caliber shell casings.  One of the casings was found approximately fifteen to twenty-five feet from where Viens was lying when the police and paramedics found him.  The other casing was recovered an additional ten to twenty feet away from the first casing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith and Yanovitch were arrested on the basis of a complaint.  On January 24, 1995, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Smith and Yanovitch with being felons-in-possession of a firearm (Count One) and ammunition (Count Two), in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996), 2 (1969).  At trial, Smith and Yanovitch stipulated that they were convicted felons at the time of the shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government called a paramedic, Michael Sullivan, and two police officers, Wyse and Lieutenant Gary French, who had responded to the scene.  After speaking with Veneau at Boston City Hospital, French returned to the crime scene and recovered the two shell casings.  The government also called Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\") Special Agent, Allan Offringa, who testified on direct examination that the .25 caliber shell casings were manufactured outside Massachusetts, and that the only .25 caliber pistol manufactured in that state was manufactured by a company named Harrington and Richardson (\"H &amp; R\"), which started making the gun in 1909 and stopped doing so before World War II.  Boston Police Ballistician, Edward Szalno, testified that the marks found on the spent shell casings were not made by an H &amp; R pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government obtained compulsion/immunity orders for two of the women who were in the car with Smith and Yanovitch.  Although these women, Brown and Scanlon, claimed that they did not see the shooting, they did confirm that they were out with Smith, Yanovitch and King on the evening in question, and that Yanovitch got into the driver's seat of the car shortly after they heard gun shots.  Both women also confirmed that Smith was seated in the middle of the back seat of the car.  Duggan was called as a witness by the government.  He recounted his confrontation with Smith earlier in the evening in question.  Veneau and Tetreault testified to having witnessed the shooting.  They said that the man in the middle of the back seat of the car handed Yanovitch a gun, which the latter used to shoot Viens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the trial and conviction of Smith and Yanovitch on both counts of the indictment, and the government's election of Count Two, the court sentenced Smith to the statutory maximum of 120 months in prison, and Yanovitch to 78 months in prison, with three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Smith presents a host of issues, claiming errors at trial and in sentencing.  As most of these issues were not raised in the district court, they are reviewable on appeal only for plain error.  Yanovitch challenges his sentence and says that he adopts by reference any additional issues raised by Smith which could materially affect his rights in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Nondisclosure of Test Results</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Ballistician Edward Szalno testified that the two shell casings that were recovered from the crime scene were fired from a .25 caliber semi-automatic weapon, but that the weapon was not a Harrington &amp; Richardson (\"H &amp; R\") pistol.  Since H &amp; R is the only company that has ever manufactured a .25 caliber semi-automatic weapon within the state of Massachusetts, the effect of this testimony was to indicate that the gun used had traveled in interstate commerce.  Prior to testifying, Szalno had test-fired an H &amp; R .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol, and had compared the shell casings with those found at the crime scene.  This comparison confirmed his earlier conclusion that the casings recovered from the crime scene were not fired from an H &amp; R pistol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's counsel says he first became aware of this test-firing during his cross-examination of Szalno.  He, then, moved to strike Szalno's testimony on the ground that the government had violated its discovery obligations by failing to inform the defense of the test.  Counsel argued that this discovery violation affected his cross-examination and prejudiced Smith's defense.  The court ruled that the government should have provided defense counsel with the observed results of the test-firing, even though no written report had been generated.  The court refused, however, to strike Szalno's testimony, noting that defense counsel had not sought a continuance to counter the evidence and had, in effect, created the problem at hand by asking questions without first determining the likely responses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions that might arguably have required advance disclosure of the test-firing results are Rule 116.1 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(D).  The former states, in relevant part, \"The government shall disclose, and allow the defendant to inspect, copy and photograph, all written materials as follows:  (3) ... all scientific tests, experiments and comparisons, or copies thereof, made in connection with a particular case.\"   D.Mass.R. 116.1(a)(3).  As the Local Rule is expressly limited to written materials, of which none were generated here, it was not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other proviso upon which Smith relies is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(D), which does not speak specifically of written materials only.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, the words \"inspect and copy or photograph\" logically suggest that the items to be disclosed be tangible enough to be susceptible to inspection, copying or photographing.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(D);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A), (C).  Our circuit has expressly reserved decision on whether Rule 16(a)(1)(D) requires the disclosure of unrecorded personal observations of tests and the like.  Compare United States v. Veilleux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195732\"><a href=\"/opinion/195732/united-states-v-veilleux/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), with United States v.

Other circuits, however, have held that such unrecorded information is not covered by Rule 16(a)(1)(D).  United States v. Shue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454720\"><a href=\"/opinion/454720/united-states-v-charles-shue/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span>, 1135 (7th Cir.1985) (the Rule does not require disclosure of expert's oral statements made after comparing photographs);  United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422167\"><a href=\"/opinion/422167/united-states-v-marvin-percival-johnson-kathleen-m-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 659 (11th Cir.1983) (where no report was prepared by expert, no discovery obligation was incurred under the Rule).  See also United States v. Peters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564393\"><a href=\"/opinion/564393/united-states-v-bruce-wayne-peters/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1422</span></a></span>, 1425 (9th Cir.1991) (similar language in Rule 16(b)(1)(B), \"cannot pertain to oral information\").  We think the above decisions of the Seventh, Eleventh and Ninth Circuits are consistent with the plain language of Rule 16(a)(1)(D), and hold that where the test result in question consisted of the expert's unrecorded comparison of the test-firing casings with those at the crime scene, Rule 16(a)(1)(D) did not obligate the government to produce in advance the expert's conclusions.  This being so, we find no error in the court's refusal to strike Szalno's testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this ends the matter, we also agree with the district court that there was a total absence of prejudice from the nonproduction of the expert's observations following the test-firing.  Smith argues that, had he known about Szalno's test-firing, he would not have cross-examined him in the manner he did, to his detriment.  However, before Szalno took the stand, ATF Special Agent Offringa had already testified that he had test-fired an H &amp; R pistol, and that he had given the casings to Szalno for a comparison.  In addition, Szalno himself testified on direct examination that he had examined two cartridge cases that had been fired from an H &amp; R .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol and had made reference to the FBI's General Rifle and Characteristics book.  Smith was, therefore, on notice prior to cross-examination that Szalno had compared the casings from the crime scene with others that were test-fired from an H &amp; R pistol.  The test-firing of an H &amp; R pistol was, moreover, relevant only to the interstate element of the firearm convictions, which the government later elected to dismiss.  The test-firing was irrelevant to the ammunition charges upon which both Smith and Yanovitch were sentenced, it being undisputed the casings had been manufactured in Arkansas.  As only the latter convictions stand, the claimed error would have been harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>B. The Admissibility of Evidence Concerning Smith's Possession of a Firearm Earlier on the Night in Question</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Duggan testified that he had a confrontation with Smith earlier on the evening in question, in which Smith displayed a small, semi-automatic handgun.  Smith contends that such testimony was admitted in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) because it was evidence of a prior bad act offered solely to prove Smith's propensity to use guns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  For evidence of this sort to be admissible, it must be shown to bear some special relevance to an aspect of the case at hand, other than merely to the defendant's propensity to do bad things.  See United States v. Cortijo-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523231\"><a href=\"/opinion/523231/united-states-v-eleuterio-cortijo-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1989).  Here, Smith argues, the testimony lacked such special relevance and was used by the government simply as propensity evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith did not, however, object at trial to Duggan's testimony in this regard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Our review is, therefore, limited to plain error.  Under that standard, the burden falls on appellants to show that there is an error, that the error is clear or obvious, and that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings below.

Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732-34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Diaz-Martinez, the defendant, who was charged with possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996), was involved in a shootout immediately before his arrest, at which time police recovered the firearms.  We dismissed defendant's argument that the government improperly referred to the shootout in its closing argument stating, \"[B]ecause ... the shootout was integrally related to the evidence linking the guns to the defendant (the possession charges), that evidence could not have been barred by Rule 404(b).\"  Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 951 n. 4.   The Eighth Circuit reached the same conclusion in Klein on comparable facts.

The district court did not commit plain error in admitting Duggan's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>C. The District Court's Control of Smith's Cross-Examination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith argues on appeal that the district court erroneously restricted his cross-examination of Duggan.  Duggan first informed police of his encounter with Smith about two weeks before trial, after he had been taken into custody on unrelated charges.  Smith contends that he wanted to establish on cross-examination that, at the time of his testimony, Duggan had pending against him a number of criminal charges.  This line of questioning would have enabled Smith to argue that Duggan had slanted his testimony to gain better treatment from the government.  Smith complains that the district court severely limited his ability in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's discretion to control cross-examination, while broad, is not unlimited.

However, we find little indication that the court restricted cross-examination in the asserted manner.  Moreover, counsel did not at the time complain to the court of being so limited, hence we review only for plain error, Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78, a standard clearly not met on this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the initial stages of cross-examination, when counsel asked Duggan if he had cases pending against him, the district court sustained the government's objection.  Defense counsel then asked whether the government had helped him with his pending cases.  Duggan answered in the negative.  Later, counsel asked whether Duggan was aware that Ortiz had filed a complaint against him for threatening her with bodily harm.  The government objected, and a sidebar followed.  During the sidebar, the district court stated, \"Perhaps I was precipitant.\"   It allowed counsel to pursue the challenged line of questioning.  Duggan then conceded that he was aware of Ortiz's complaint at the time he contacted the police.  After counsel finished questioning Duggan regarding Ortiz's complaint, he did not proceed with similar questions relative to other pending matters nor ask the court to allow him to do so nor indicate that he felt unduly limited.  We find no merit in Smith's argument on appeal that the court improperly restricted his cross-examination of Duggan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>D.

Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Smith argues that, since it was clear to the jury that Duggan was referring to Smith as having been released from jail, the response was so prejudicial as to necessitate a mistrial.  The district court, however, took some curative measures.  It sustained Smith's objection and struck Duggan's remark.  As counsel asked for no more at the time, the trial court could reasonably assume that Smith was satisfied.  The degree of prejudice was neither so obvious nor so clear that only a mistrial would have satisfied the needs of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

Cresta, 825 F.2d at 550.   The remark in the present case, as the government points out, was a single, isolated and accidental reference by a witness trying to answer a question designed to address defense counsel's hearsay objection.  Smith himself had already stipulated that he was a convicted felon.  The disputed remark added little, therefore, to what the jury could already surmise.  We do not find plain error in the court's failure to order a mistrial sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. The Questioning of Defense Witness Ortiz</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, the government was allowed, over Smith's unexplicated objection, to ask defense witness Ortiz whether she had acted as a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and whether, as such, she had helped the DEA obtain a search warrant for the apartment of her friend, Colleen King.  Smith now argues that the district court should have excluded these questions because they were irrelevant and because--by implying that Smith's girlfriend was the subject of a drug investigation--they unduly prejudiced him and his case.  Smith also asserts that the district court erred in preventing him from establishing that the DEA's subsequent search of King's apartment yielded no evidence of illegal drugs.  Eliciting such evidence was relevant, Smith says, to undermine any concerns about the credibility of the witness and to rebut the prejudicial characterization of Smith and his girlfriend.  We do not find plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One problem with these arguments is that Smith never advised the district court of the reasons he now advances on appeal for excluding the government's line of inquiry.  Federal Rule of Evidence 103 states that error may not be grounded upon an evidentiary ruling \"unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and ... [i]n case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection....\"  Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Counsel had been informed in advance that the government planned to cross-examine Ortiz concerning her DEA connections, and while he objected, he did not argue that the information was irrelevant nor did he claim prejudice under Rule 403.  And when the district court limited Smith's redirect examination of Ortiz, Smith made no objection.  Our review, therefore, is only for plain error.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that its cross-examination was designed to impeach Ortiz, and not to smear Smith and King.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Ortiz denied that she had ever furnished information to the DEA, the government did not implicate Smith during its cross-examination of Ortiz, and the court instructed the jury that counsel's questions did not constitute evidence.  Even assuming arguendo, it was error to allow the government to cross-examine Ortiz as it did, we conclude the error caused slight, if any, damage to Smith.  The limitation of Smith's redirect was likewise far short of plain error.  The subject matter was of border-line relevance, hence well within the discretion of the court to control, see Fed.R.Evid. 401.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F. The Government's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith claims that the prosecution misstated the evidence on four separate occasions in its closing argument.  These alleged misstatements, according to Smith, went to the heart of the case, were not corrected by the district court and, therefore, warrant the reversal of his conviction.  The challenged statements, and this court's reasons for rejecting Smith's present claims, are set forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith concedes that he did not object at trial to the challenged statements.  Consequently, we review his present claims under the plain error standard.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   In so doing, we consider a number of factors, \"including the frequency and deliberateness of the prosecutor's comments, the strength and clarity of the trial judge's instructions, and the strength of the government's case against the defendant.\"  United States v.

We do not find, however, that the prosecutor's description strayed far enough from Duggan's actual testimony, \"a small caliber handgun,\" to amount to plain error.  However described, the small caliber handgun mentioned in Duggan's testimony was consistent with the .25 caliber casings recovered after the shooting.  The prosecutor's mistake was not so serious as to imply bad faith or deliberate prevarication.  Also, the case against Smith was strong, and the court properly instructed the jury on the effect of the lawyer's statements.  The misstatement, such as it was, fell well below the plain error threshold.  See Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d at 854-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the three remaining challenged remarks,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> at least two were amply supported by the record.  Statement # 2 rested on Veneau's testimony that the government protected him and helped him move out of South Boston, and that he had not gone to the police for fear of the defendants.  Statement # 4 was a fair inference from the testimony of Boston Police Lieutenant French.  Statement # 3 is more problematic but in no way amounts to plain error.  The government argues in its brief that the prosecutor referred to the jury as having \"sat up there\" and seen the witness's, Tetreault's, fear.  If this is what the prosecutor said, the remark was unexceptionable, since the jury had observed Tetreault on the stand and could determine whether or not she exhibited fear.  The transcript, however, indicates the prosecutor as actually having said that \"he sat up there\" and saw fear in Tetreault's face.  If the \"he\" referred to Veneau, the comment was arguably garbled, since by the time Veneau testified at the trial, he had already retracted earlier misstatements to police that Tetreault had been absent.  But, even accepting the latter version, the unobjected-to remark was harmless and fell far short of constituting plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>G. The Meaning of \"Ammunition\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith contends on appeal that the district court, through certain unobjected-to instructions given to the jury while the trial was in process, erroneously directed a verdict in the government's favor on the elements of ammunition and interstate commerce.  According to Smith, the district court wrongly told the jury that the casings which were received into evidence were ammunition, and had traveled in interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Such instructions, according to the defense, had the effect of directing the jury to find against Smith on two essential elements of the offense.

If counsel wished clarification, he should have asked for it at the time.  In its final charge to the jury, the district court clearly informed the jury of the government's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt defendants' possession of ammunition and of the movement of the ammunition in commerce, and gave accurate, extensive and clear instructions on each of these points.

In Lopez, the Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) (Supp.1996), which prohibited a person from possessing a gun while in a \"school zone,\" on the grounds that it exceeded Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause.  Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.   Smith alleges that the Court's opinion in the Lopez case undermines the proposition, stated in Scarborough and its progeny, that Congress intended nothing more than a minimal contact with interstate commerce.  Consequently, Smith concludes that the district court committed error when it failed to instruct the jury that the government had the burden of proving that the ammunition at issue substantially affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's reliance on Lopez is misplaced.  Unlike the statute at issue in Lopez, Section 922(g)(1) (1976 &amp; Supp.1996) contains a specific jurisdictional element which ensures, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce.  Where, as here, the jurisdictional element is present, the government need only prove the minimal nexus to interstate commerce identified in Scarborough.   See Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953.

In reviewing this claim, we must determine whether, after viewing the evidence, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government's case, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution has proved the essential elements of the offense.   United States v.

In so doing, this court defers to the jury as to all credibility judgments, and need conclude only that the evidence, taken in its entirety, supports a judgment of conviction.  Id.  Because the evidence in this case was more than sufficient under this standard, Smith's claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith argues that there was no evidence indicating that he possessed a handgun on the evening in question, hence no proof that he possessed ammunition as well.  Smith points to the fact that, while Veneau and Tetreault both testified that the man in the back seat handed an object to Yanovitch and that the latter proceeded to shoot Viens, they did not go so far as to state that Smith passed a firearm to Yanovitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the testimony of Veneau and Tetreault, together with the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom and from the other evidence, is ample to establish Smith's involvement.  Veneau said that he never saw Brian Smith with a gun, but that was because he did not know anyone named Brian Smith.  Veneau's assertion that the man in the middle passed what Veneau believed to be a gun to Yanovitch, when coupled with evidence that Smith was the man in the middle, supports the conviction.  Tetreault testified that she did not recognize the object while it was being passed to Yanovitch, but noted that she saw that it was a gun when Yanovitch got out of the car with it.  This testimony, in conjunction with all the other evidence at hand, including the subsequent shooting and Duggan's testimony that he had seen Smith with a handgun earlier, was adequate to establish Smith's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>J.

Under the circumstances, \"we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Id. at 103.

From this, it was reasonable for the district court to infer that Smith gave his handgun to Yanovitch intending and expecting the latter to use it against Viens.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  As this was a reasonable and permissible interpretation, it justified the four-level enhancement of Smith's GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>K.

These convictions had been vacated prior to the hearing, and, as a result, Smith no longer could be sentenced as an armed career criminal, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) (Supp.1996), although he could still be sentenced as a felon-in-possession.  The district court stated on the record during the sentencing hearing that the challenged convictions had been set aside and ordered the transcript containing its remarks to be attached to the PSR as an indication that these convictions were no longer valid.  Deeming attachment of the transcript to be an adequate corrective, the court refused to direct the probation officer to revise the PSR itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith did not object to the court's procedure at the time, but on appeal complains that the Bureau of Prisons uses these PSRs to allocate the prison population among its institutions and programs.

Bruckman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522867\"><a href=\"/opinion/522867/united-states-v-neal-r-bruckman/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 63-64 (1st Cir.1989), this court noted that the purpose behind the Rule's writing requirement is to protect the defendant's due process rights and to provide the reviewing court with a clear record of the disposition below.  Smith does not here complain that the district court mishandled or misread the vacated convictions so as to sentence him improperly in this case.  Rather, he fears that appending the transcript, rather than physically revising the PSR, is an insufficient way to alert future prison authorities to the true status of the prior convictions.  Whether or not this is a realistic fear we cannot say.  Smith did not raise this concern before the district judge, who was best situated to pass on it.  Precedent indicates that the appending of a hearing transcript will comply with the Rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  If, in a particular case, there are practical reasons to do more, we have no doubt that the district court, if asked, would look into the matter, with the help of the probation officer.  As we say, Smith did not raise the issue below;  absent his having done so, we can find no error cognizable on appeal.  We add that it is still not too late for Smith's concerns to be attended to administratively--assuming they have any legitimacy, which we cannot ascertain from the record before us--by simply appending a suitable notation to the PSR updating the status of the prior convictions.  Whether this or some other measure is necessary we leave entirely to the appropriate authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>L.

We review his claims for clear error.  Powell, 50 F.3d at 102-03.   We are satisfied that the record below amply supports the sentencing court's factual findings and that Yanovitch's allegations are baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yanovitch contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that he attempted to shoot Viens in the head, and that he had the intent to kill him.  If anything, Yanovitch argues, the evidence at trial demonstrated that he acted in the heat of passion and in the absence of malice aforethought;  there was no indication, according to Yanovitch, that he had the necessary state of mind for attempted murder.  Nevertheless, the district court found that Yanovitch's conduct conformed to the charge of assault with intent to murder, and, based upon that finding, sentenced him under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.1.  On appeal, Yanovitch argues that a reasonable person would conclude that the incident in question was an aggravated assault or, at most, an assault with an attempt to commit manslaughter, either of which would require application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yanovitch's argument merits little discussion in light of the evidence at trial which was also summarized in his PSR, and the tape recording of Veneau's interview with Boston Police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  This evidence obviously supports the sentencing court's determination that Yanovitch shot Viens with the intent to kill him.
