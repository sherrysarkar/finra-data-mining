Plaintiffs are  fifty-one\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nformer  \"transitory\"   or  non-permanent  employees   of  the\r\n\nmunicipality of Canovanas, Puerto Rico.  A jury found against\r\n\ntheir  claims that the  incoming New Progressive  Party (NPP)\r\n\nadministration  failed to renew their contracts of employment\r\n\nin various municipal jobs because they were supporters of the\r\n\nprior Popular  Democratic Party  (PDP) administration  and so\r\n\nviolated their rights under the First Amendment.1\r\n\n          The  important  question  raised  by this  case  is\r\n\nwhether the district  court committed error in  admitting the\r\n\ntestimony of an expert witness.   The witness testified as to\r\n\nwhat the law required and that her examination of plaintiffs'\r\n\npersonnel records led  to the conclusion that  plaintiffs had\r\n\nbeen   improperly  hired  or  renewed  in  the  first  place.\r\n\nDefendants did not testify this  was their reason at the time\r\n\nof  their  decision  not  to   renew  plaintiffs'  contracts.\r\n\nAlthough   such  expert  testimony   should  not   have  been\r\n\npermitted,  we  consider any  alleged error  in light  of the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  This  court has  reviewed  numerous  claims of  political\r\nfirings or demotions from Puerto  Rico.  In November of 1984,\r\nthe  PDP won  the  gubernatorial  election  in  Puerto  Rico.\r\nBefore that,  the governor's office  was held by a  member of\r\nthe NPP.  A first wave of cases involved outright dismissals;\r\nthe second wave  involved adverse actions less  than outright\r\ndismissals.   That history is  recited in Agosto-de-Feliciano\r                                                                         \r\nv. Aponte-Roque,  889 F.2d  1209 (1st Cir.  1989).   In 1992,\r                           \r\ncontrol   of  the  governor's   office  and  of   some  local\r\ngovernments switched, and  the NPP came back to  power.  Now,\r\nthis  court  is faced  with  another wave  of  litigation (we\r\nhesitate to count  which wave this is), brought  this time by\r\nPDP members.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nevidence as a whole, and particularly in light of the judge's\r\n\ninstructions to the jury.  In the circumstances of this case,\r\n\nwe consider  the alleged errors harmless and  affirm the jury\r\n\nverdicts.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  sued,  inter alios,2  Jose  Soto-Rivera\r\n\n(\"Soto\") and the Municipality of Canovanas under  42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1983, alleging  that they  had been  dismissed  due to  their\r\n\npolitical  beliefs  and  in violation  of  their  due process\r\n\nrights.    The  complaint  sought  reinstatement,  injunctive\r\n\nrelief,  compensatory and  punitive  damages, and  attorney's\r\n\nfees.\r\n\n          On  defendants' motion  for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  dismissed  plaintiffs'  due  process  claims,\r\n\nnoting  that, under First  Circuit precedent and  Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw,  transitory employees generally  do not have  a property\r\n\ninterest in continued employment beyond their yearly terms of\r\n\nappointment.  See Caro v.  Aponte-Roque, 878 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1989); see  also Mel ndez  v.  Municipio de  Arroyo, 96\r                                                                     \r\n\nJ.T.S. Case No. 68, at p.  1077 (P.R. Sup. Ct. May 15,  1996)\r\n\n(reaffirming that, as a matter of Puerto Rico law, transitory\r\n\nemployees  generally have  no \"legitimate  expectation\" to  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The district  court dismissed plaintiffs'  claims against\r\nthe other municipal defendants prior to trial.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nrenewal  of   their  contracts);  Departamento   de  Recursos\r                                                                         \r\n\nNaturales v. Correa, 118 D.P.R. 689, 697 (1987) (same).3\r                               \r\n\n          Before trial,  defendants retained  Blanca Santiago\r\n\nas an expert in governmental personnel matters to examine the\r\n\nplaintiffs' personnel  records.  Santiago's  report concluded\r\n\nthat  plaintiffs' initial  appointments and,  in  some cases,\r\n\nrenewal appointments  were contrary to Puerto  Rico municipal\r\n\nlaw,  and that  the previous  administration  had employed  a\r\n\n\"subterfuge\"  to  renew the  plaintiffs' appointments  and to\r\n\nevade  a prohibition on making personnel decisions within two\r\n\nmonths of  a general election.   The report also  opined that\r\n\nplaintiffs  did  not   have  \"a  legitimate   expectation  of\r\n\nretaining employment.\"  Finally,  the report concluded  that,\r\n\nunder the law of Puerto Rico, \"the Municipality  of Canovanas\r\n\ncould not continue extending said transitory appointments.\"\r\n\n          Upon receiving Santiago's report, plaintiffs made a\r\n\nmotion   in   limine   to   exclude   Santiago's   testimony.\r\n\nPlaintiffs' principal objection was that the expert witness's\r\n\nopinion concerning the  propriety of plaintiffs' appointments\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Defendants also moved  for summary judgment on the claims\r\nfor  damages on  qualified immunity grounds.     The district\r\ncourt  denied defendants'  motion,  holding  that before  the\r\nevents in  1993, the  First Circuit  had clearly  established\r\nthat First  Amendment protection  extended to  political non-\r\nrenewals of employment.  See  Caro, 878 F.2d at 2-4; Figueroa\r                                                                         \r\nv.  Aponte-Roque, 864  F.2d 947,  951 (1st  Cir. 1989).   The\r                            \r\ndistrict  court determined that there existed a genuine issue\r\nof material fact concerning defendants' motives  in declining\r\nto renew plaintiffs' transitory appointments.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nwas not relevant  to liability.  Defendants did  not maintain\r\n\nthat  Soto  did  not renew  plaintiffs'  appointments  due to\r\n\nirregularities  in how  they were  appointed.   The  district\r\n\ncourt denied plaintiffs' motion.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II\r\n\n          We state  the facts  as the  jury could have  found\r\n\nthem,  in  the context  of  the  evidence  as a  whole,  with\r\n\nparticular  emphasis on  the evidence  allegedly admitted  in\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs said they were affiliated with  the PDP,\r\n\none of Puerto Rico's major  political parties.  In 1992, Soto\r\n\nwas elected Mayor  of Canovanas as the candidate  of the NPP,\r\n\nthe main rival of the PDP.  Soto was the first  NPP candidate\r\n\nelected as Mayor of Canovanas in several decades.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  had been  appointed  by  the prior  PDP\r\n\nmayor, Esteban Melendez-Rivera, to various  municipal jobs as\r\n\ntransitory  employees.  Those  jobs included manual  labor in\r\n\nthe  Public Works  Department,  janitorial work  in municipal\r\n\noffices,  clerical  work,  and other  lower  level  jobs with\r\n\nminimal   salaries.      Under   Puerto   Rico's   Autonomous\r\n\nMunicipalities Act, 21 L.P.R.A.    4554, transitory employees\r\n\nmay be appointed for a  limited term, generally not to exceed\r\n\none year.   Although plaintiffs, unlike other  civil servants\r\n\nin Puerto Rico, had no  formal tenure in their jobs following\r\n\nthe  expiration of their contracts, many had been reappointed\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nfor  several one-year  terms as  a matter  of course.   Other\r\n\nplaintiffs were in their first annual term of employment.\r\n\n          On January 15, 1993, three days after taking office\r\n\nas Mayor of  Canovanas, Soto informed most  of the plaintiffs\r\n\nthat  their positions as transitory employees had expired and\r\n\nthat he would  not renew their  appointments.  The  remaining\r\n\nplaintiffs'  appointments  were   temporarily  extended,  but\r\n\neventually their appointments expired as well.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  testified  that   they  campaigned  for\r\n\nEsteban   Melendez-Rivera,  the PDP  candidate,  in the  1992\r\n\nmayoral election.  Plaintiffs testified that they had engaged\r\n\nin  various PDP political  activities on behalf  of Melendez,\r\n\nincluding  attending political meetings or taking part in the\r\n\ncampaign  rallies known  as caravanas  (\"caravans\") that  are\r                                                 \r\n\ntypical of mayoral campaigning in  Puerto Rico.  Many of them\r\n\ntestified that Soto  solicited their support, and,  when they\r\n\nsaid they would support the incumbent PDP mayor instead, Soto\r\n\nthreatened  to  leave  them  without  employment  after   the\r\n\nelection.  Many plaintiffs also testified that they observed,\r\n\nafter their non-renewals, NPP  members performing the  duties\r\n\nof the jobs they had performed as transitory employees.\r\n\n          In  support   of  their  First   Amendment  claims,\r\n\nplaintiffs  put  in evidence  their personnel  files, arguing\r\n\nthat  there  was nothing  in  them that  would  indicate poor\r\n\nperformance.   Plaintiffs also presented an expert witness in\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\npersonnel administration to bolster their claims of political\r\n\ndiscrimination.4\r\n\n          Defendants'  position   was  that   Soto  had   not\r\n\nconsidered plaintiffs' political  affiliation in his decision\r\n\nto allow  their contracts to  expire.   They presented  three\r\n\nwitnesses:  Mayor  Soto,  Vice-Mayor  Miguel  Jimenez-Carrion\r\n\n(\"Jimenez\"),  and Blanca  Santiago, their  expert witness  on\r\n\ngovernment  personnel  administration.    Soto  categorically\r\n\ndenied  the  plaintiffs' allegations  that he  had threatened\r\n\ntheir jobs if they supported the incumbent.  He noted that he\r\n\nhad  retained or  hired PDP  members to  municipal jobs.   He\r\n\ntestified that he had allowed plaintiffs' contracts to expire\r\n\nbecause their services  were no longer needed.   Jimenez gave\r\n\nessentially  the same version  of events.   Neither testified\r\n\nthat they had  not renewed the contracts  because plaintiffs'\r\n\nappointments had been irregular.\r\n\nDefendants' Expert\r                              \r\n\n          Defendants'   expert   witness,   Blanca  Santiago,\r\n\ntestified that the plaintiffs' personnel records demonstrated\r\n\nthat,  in many  cases, their  appointments  were contrary  to\r\n\nPuerto Rico law.  In particular, Santiago testified that many\r\n\nemployees  had been  on the  payroll in  excess of  one year,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.   The  plaintiffs did  not  order the  transcript of  that\r\nportion of  the trial  that included  their expert  witness's\r\ntestimony.   That omission  complicates our  analysis, as  we\r\nexplain below.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsometimes  without any  documented reappointment,  and opined\r\n\nthat this violated  the Autonomous Municipalities Act,  which\r\n\nprovides  that  the  appointment  of \"[t]ransitory  employees\r\n\nshall not  exceed  one  (1) year  . . .  .\"   21  L.P.R.A.   \r\n\n4554(c).  Santiago also testified that many of the plaintiffs\r\n\nhad  been illegally appointed within  two months of a general\r\n\nelection,  in  violation  of a  prophylactic  prohibition  on\r\n\ngovernment  personnel   decisions  commonly   known  as   the\r\n\n\"electoral ban.\"  See 21 L.P.R.A.   4564; 3 L.P.R.A.    1337.\r                                 \r\n\nSantiago testified further that, in some cases, the personnel\r\n\nrecords had been manipulated in  order to make it appear that\r\n\nplaintiffs'  appointments were  not within the  electoral ban\r\n\nperiod.\r\n\n          Defense counsel then questioned Santiago to  elicit\r\n\ntestimony to the effect that courts have held that transitory\r\n\nemployees  do  not have  a  right  to  the renewal  of  their\r\n\ncontracts.   Defense counsel  accomplished this  objective by\r\n\nreading passages from court decisions holding that transitory\r\n\nemployees in  Puerto Rico  have no  reasonable or  legitimate\r\n\nexpectation  of  continued  renewal of  their  contracts that\r\n\nwould entitle them to  administrative due process protections\r\n\nbefore  allowing their contracts  to expire, and  then asking\r\n\nSantiago to comment.  This  was done although the due process\r\n\nclaims had been dismissed.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Santiago  testified  that, under  court  decisions,\r\n\n\"[o]nce  [a  transitory  employee's]  appointment  ends   the\r\n\ntransitory employee . . . doesn't have any . . . other right,\r\n\nregardless of the fact that his appointment has been extended\r\n\nfor a  period of time  that we may call  'excessively long.'\"\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  counsel objected to this testimony on the ground\r\n\nthat it misstated the law.  That objection was overruled.\r\n\n          Soon   afterwards,   defense    counsel   continued\r\n\nquestioning  Santiago  on  the  legal  status  of  transitory\r\n\nemployees:\r\n\n          Q. I am going to review . . . the case of\r\n          Fermin  Orta  et   al.  versus  Pedro  A.\r                                                               \r\n          Padilla, Municipality of  Trujillio Alto,\r                                                               \r\n          et al. .  . . .  I'm going to read to you\r                            \r\n          from  the  translation  of  that  opinion\r\n          . . . .\r\n\nAt this  point, plaintiffs  again objected,  noting that  the\r\n\ncase   concerned  the   due  process  rights   of  transitory\r\n\nemployees, and  that the  sole claim on  trial was  the First\r\n\nAmendment  claim.    Again,   the  district  court  overruled\r\n\nplaintiffs' objection.   Defendants  resumed questioning  the\r\n\nwitness about the  law articulated in that case.5  Plaintiffs\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.   Defense  Counsel:   \"[I]t  says, the  opinion:   After a\r\ncareful examination of the service and  appointment contracts\r\nof  these 23  appellees,  we  find  that  the  only  contract\r\nterminated before the expiration date was that of Juana Cruz.\r\nThe other 22 employees were notified that the contracts would\r\nbe terminated at the expiration  date of the same.  In  light\r\nof  the  prevailing  principles, we  must  conclude  that the\r\ntermination  of the contract of those 22 transitory employees\r\nwas valid  at law  because the municipality  did not  have to\r\nprovide them with the  regulatory guarantees mentioned above.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nobjected  again,  noting,  \"She's testifying  [to]  what  are\r\n\nbasically jury  instructions.\" The  district court  initially\r\n\nsustained plaintiffs' objection,  but then permitted  defense\r\n\ncounsel to continue  questioning the witness in  this manner.\r\n\nDefense counsel proceeded  to read excerpts from  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt  of Puerto  Rico's decision  in Correa,  and  from this\r                                                        \r\n\ncourt's decision in  Cheveras-Pacheco v. Rivera-Gonzalez, 809\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  125, 129  (1st  Cir.  1987)  (holding  that  transitory\r\n\nemployees  do not  have  a  property  interest  in  continued\r\n\nemployment).   Plaintiffs'  counsel again  protested,  and  a\r\n\nconference  was  held  outside  the  presence  of  the  jury.\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  counsel  asked the  judge  to strike  Santiago's\r\n\ntestimony or  give a curative instruction, stating explicitly\r\n\nthat it is against the law for a  municipal government to let\r\n\na transitory employee's contract expire if the primary reason\r\n\nis  the employee's political affiliation.  The district court\r\n\nrefused, saying plaintiffs had opened the door with their own\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nThe trial  court erred  in  ruling that  the termination  was\r\nunlawful.\"\r\n    Santiago:  \"The interesting thing about that case is that\r\nthere  were --  there  were  22  transitory  employees  whose\r\nappointments  were to  end,  and there  was another  group of\r\nemployees  in  which  --  in  which  case  the  decision  was\r\ndifferent,  and the  matter of  discrimination  was approved.\r\nBut in the case of the transitory ones their appointments had\r\nended.\"\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nexpert  witness and that they could cross-examine Santiago on\r\n\nthe illegality of firing employees for political reasons.6\r\n\n          On  cross-examination,  Santiago  stated  that  the\r\n\nlegal opinions she provided on direct examination  concerning\r\n\nthe  status   of  transitory   employees   and  the   alleged\r\n\nillegalities in plaintiffs' original  appointments were based\r\n\nsolely on Commonwealth law, not federal law.  When questioned\r\n\nabout  the case  law  of this  court which  has  held that  a\r\n\ndecision  not to renew  a transitory employees'  contract may\r\n\nnot be  primarily based  on political  affiliation under  the\r\n\nFirst  Amendment,  the  witness was  evasive.    Although she\r\n\nagreed  that transitory employees could not be discharged for\r\n\npolitical reasons, she insisted that  this did not apply when\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The  Court:  \"Counsel, the  problem with you is  that you\r\ndon't   make  a  distinction  between  the  --  the  witness'\r\ncredibility  and  what  is  admissible.    She --  Mr.  Pagan\r\n[defense  counsel]  read  to her  certain  passages  of cases\r\nsaying  that -- concerning transitory employees.  I'm certain\r\nyou're  going  to  read  her a  part  saying  if  you  take a\r\ntransitory employee  and discharge him for  political reasons\r\nit's illegal, and she has to  agree with that.  See?   That's\r\nthe way you neutralize that.  I'm not going to teach  you how\r\nto practice  law.\"   (At oral  argument, plaintiff's  counsel\r\nargued that this last sentence  was particularly prejudicial.\r\nHowever, as this admonition did  not occur in the presence of\r\nthe jury, we examine only  the impact of the district court's\r\nruling itself.)  \r\n     The judge continued,  \"[T]he Orta case was  brought [in]\r                                                  \r\nby  your  [expert]  witness, and  that  opened  the door  for\r\n[defense counsel] to bring [in] the Orta case. . . .

I will instruct\r\nthe jury on  the law  at the  proper time, and  they have  to\r\nfollow the law as I tell them, not as what counsel tells them\r\nthe law is.\"\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\na  contract expired because,  she said, such  an employee was\r\n\nnot discharged.\r\n\nClosing Arguments\r                             \r\n\n          In  closing arguments,  plaintiffs' counsel  argued\r\n\nthat the  witnesses' testimony, principally  the plaintiffs',\r\n\nestablished that the incoming NPP administration's motive for\r\n\nrefusing  to renew  plaintiffs'  contracts  was reprisal  for\r\n\ntheir  support of  the previous  PDP mayor.   Defense counsel\r\n\nstrongly contested  the plaintiffs'  credibility, and  argued\r\n\nthat Soto never  considered plaintiffs' political affiliation\r\n\nin his decision not to renew plaintiffs' contracts.\r\n\n          Defense counsel also  made reference to  Santiago's\r\n\ntestimony,  arguing that  the employees  were  transitory and\r\n\nthat their appointments had been in violation of  Puerto Rico\r\n\nmunicipal law.    Defense counsel also argued  that the Mayor\r\n\nwould have  been in violation of  that law if he  had renewed\r\n\ntheir  appointments.    Defense  counsel  made  reference  to\r\n\nSantiago's  testimony that transitory employees do not have a\r\n\nreasonable  expectation of  retaining their jobs  after their\r\n\ncontracts  expire,   arguing  that  plaintiffs'   expert  had\r\n\ndistorted the law  in suggesting otherwise.   Defense counsel\r\n\nasked  rhetorically, \"[A]fter  the appointment  expired . . .\r\n\nwhat are  their [sic]  rights of those  employees?   And that\r                                \r\n\nYour Honor is  going to tell you, see,  in the instructions.\"\r\n\nDefense  counsel   noted  that,  unlike   plaintiffs'  expert\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nwitness,   \"She  never  . . .  tell  [sic]  us  whether  [the\r                                                     \r\n\nplaintiffs]   were    dismissed   or   not    for   political\r\n\ndiscriminatory reasons.  That is for you to decide.\"  Defense\r\n\ncounsel did not  argue that the reasons  for the non-renewals\r\n\nwere that plaintiffs' appointments were irregular.\r\n\nInstructions\r                        \r\n\n          The judge instructed the jury that its duty was \"to\r\n\nfollow the law as I shall state it to you\" and that it should\r\n\nnot \"base  [its] verdict upon any view  of the law other than\r\n\nthat given in  the instructions of the Court.\"  The court did\r\n\nnot otherwise specifically instruct the jury to disregard the\r\n\nexpert witnesses' opinions concerning the applicable law, but\r\n\nrather  said expert  testimony  should  be  treated  just  as\r\n\ntestimony from any other witness.\r\n\n          Significantly,  however, the  judge instructed  the\r\n\njury  that  any  irregularities in  the  appointments  of the\r\n\nplaintiffs could not be used as a pretext for violating their\r\n\nFirst Amendment rights:\r\n\n               Now, conduct purportedly  engaged in\r\n          consonance   with    the   Puerto    Rico\r\n          personnel's law and regulation [sic] does\r                                                         \r\n          not control a  claim alleging a violation\r\n          of the  employees' First  Amendment right\r\n          of political affiliation.\r\n               A new administration  cannot use the\r\n          doctrine of compliance with  state law or\r\n          nullity under state  law as  a cover  for\r\n          discharges, transfers  and discrimination\r\n          based solely on political affiliation.\r\n               Similarly,   a  new   administration\r\n          cannot use the  fact that plaintiffs were\r\n          hired  during  the  electoral prohibition\r\n\n                         13  -13-\r\r\n\n          period  or   \"veda\"  as  a   pretext  for\r                                        \r\n          political discrimination.   In  the final\r\n          analysis, the question of motivation is a\r\n          question of fact.\r\n\nThe court also instructed:\r\n\n               If   you   find   that   plaintiffs'\r\n          political affiliation was  the motivating\r\n          factor  for  the   non-renewal  of  their\r\n          appointments, then you  may find for  the\r\n          plaintiffs.\r\n\nThe court also gave this instruction:\r\n\n               However,    if    you    find   that\r\n          plaintiffs' appointments were not renewed\r\n          because they  had been  appointed by  the\r\n          former administration in violation of the\r\n          personnel  and  electoral  laws  and  not\r\n          because    of    plaintiffs'    political\r\n          affiliation,  then you  may find  for the\r\n          defendants.\r\n\nThe  judge  further   instructed  that,  although  transitory\r\n\nemployees  do not have tenure in  their jobs, their contracts\r\n\nmay   not  be  allowed  to  expire  for  political  reasons.7\r\nFinally,  in response to  a request from  plaintiffs' counsel\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  Court: \"Transitory -- the plaintiffs  in this action\r\nwere  transitory employees of  the Municipality of Canovanas.\r\nPuerto  Rico   law  permits  the  employment   of  transitory\r\nemployees appointed for  a fixed term.

Hence, even if\r                                        \r\n\nthe  decision  not  to renew  a  transitory  appointment10 is\r\n\nconsidered a hiring decision rather than a  discharge,  Rutan\r                                                                         \r\n\nreinforces our rule announced in Cheveras-Pacheco.  \r                                                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.   As a practical  matter, given the Commonwealth's merit-\r\nbased  system  for  hiring  and   discharging  civil  service\r\nemployees, the risk is greater that transitory employees, who\r\nmay be more  easily hired and fired, may  suffer from the use\r\nof unlawful patronage practices.

To state\r\n\nthe general  rule is not  to decide the far  more complicated\r\n\nand measured question of when there is a transgression of the\r\n\nrule.   We outline some  of the  considerations and  conclude\r\n\nthat the rule has been transgressed here.  We leave to future\r\n\ncases  the defining of  the contours  of application  of this\r\n\nrule.\r\n\n          In  our legal  system,  purely legal  questions and\r\n\ninstructions to  the jury  on the  law to  be applied  to the\r\n\nresolution  of the  dispute before  them  is exclusively  the\r\n\ndomain of  the judge.  Accordingly, expert  testimony on such\r\n\npurely  legal issues  is rarely  admissible.   As the  Second\r\n\nCircuit has  noted, \"The  danger is that  the jury  may think\r\n\nthat the 'expert'  in the particular branch of  the law knows\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nmore than the judge   -- surely an impermissible inference in\r\n\nour system of law.\"  Marx &amp; Co., 550 F.2d at 512.\r                                           \r\n\n          The one well-recognized exception  is for questions\r\n\nof  foreign law, where the judge may be aided by the expert's\r\n\nassistance.   See Adalman, 807 F.2d  at 366; Marx &amp;  Co., 550\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 510;  1 McCormick on  Evidence   12,  at 50 (John  W.\r                                                  \r\n\nStrong,  ed., 4th  ed. 1992);  7 Wigmore  on Evidence    1953\r                                                                 \r\n\n(Chadbourne rev.  1978).   Even in the  case of  foreign law,\r\n\nunder modern practice the testimony is generally given to the\r\n\njudge, outside of the presence of  the jury, and is meant  to\r\n\nassist the judge in determining the appropriate instructions.\r\n\nSee Adalman, 807 F.2d  at 366; 9  Wigmore on Evidence    2558\r                                                                 \r\n\n(Chadbourne rev. 1978).  Here,  the testimony was plainly not\r\n\noffered to assist the judge,  who has presided over many such\r\n\npolitical discharge cases, and was presented to the jury.\r\n\n          Because  the  jury   does  not  decide  such   pure\r\n\nquestions of law,  such testimony is not helpful  to the jury\r\n\nand so  does not  fall within  the literal terms  of Fed.  R.\r\n\nEvid.  702, which  allows expert testimony  \"[i]f scientific,\r\n\ntechnical  or  other  specialized knowledge  will  assist the\r\n\ntrier of  fact to understand  the evidence or to  determine a\r\n\nfact in  issue . . . .\"   As the D.C.

See Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1213 (\"Each courtroom\r                                      \r\n\ncomes equipped with a 'legal  expert,' called a judge, and it\r\n\nis his  or her province  alone to  instruct the  jury on  the\r\n\nrelevant legal  standards.\"); 7  Wigmore on  Evidence    1952\r                                                                 \r\n\n(Chadbourne rev.  1978) (\"It is  not the common  knowledge of\r\n\nthe  jury which renders the witness' opinion unnecessary, but\r\n\nthe special legal knowledge of the judge.\")\r\n\n          Similarly, Fed. R. Evid. 704(a), which removes  the\r\n\ncommon-law  bar  on  \"otherwise  admissible\"  testimony  that\r\n\n\"embraces an  ultimate issue  to be decided  by the  trier of\r\n\nfact,\" does  not vitiate the  rule against expert  opinion on\r\n\nquestions of  law.  The  common law did  not allow an  expert\r\n\nwitness to inform  the jury of his or  her factual conclusion\r\n\nconcerning the \"ultimate issue\" in the case, because this was\r\n\nthought to invade the province of the jury.  The abolition in\r\n\nRule 704(a) of  this \"ultimate issue\" rule allows  the expert\r\n\nwitness to  offer his or  her factual conclusion in  order to\r\n\naid the jury,  which properly can choose to  accept or reject\r\n\nit.  However, questions of law are not \"to be decided  by the\r\n\ntrier of fact\";  rather it is for the  judge, not the lawyers\r\n\nor the witnesses, to inform the jury of the law applicable in\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nthe case and  to decide any purely legal  issue.11  Recently,\r\n\nthis court  has cautioned that  the abolition of the  \"bar on\r\n\n'ultimate issue' opinions  . . . is not  a carte blanche  for\r\n\nexperts.\" Dincov.

See, e.g., In re Air Disaster at Lockerbie,\r                                                                         \r\n\nScotland on December  21, 1998, 37 F.3d 804,  826-27 (2d Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1994) (regarding  expert's testimony that  defendants engaged\r\n\nin \"fraud\"  and \"deceit\"  admissible because  the terms  were\r\n\nused  in layman's  sense, while  finding  expert's conclusion\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.   For similar  reasons, the question  of whether  a legal\r\nrule  has  been clearly  established,  in  the  context of  a\r\nqualified immunity defense to a    1983 action, is a question\r\ndecided by the  court, not the jury.  See St. Hilaire v. City\r                                                                         \r\nof Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1995).  Thus, the Eighth\r                      \r\nCircuit  found  reversible  error in  allowing  a  witness to\r\nespouse views concerning the  reasonableness of an  officer's\r\nconduct in light of prevailing \"Fourth  Amendment standards.\"\r\nPeterson  v. City  of Plymouth,  60 F.3d  469, 475  (8th Cir.\r                                          \r\n1995).   The jury's role  was only to  decide what facts were\r\nknown to the  officer at the time of the arrest, not whether,\r\nin light of those facts, the officer's conduct was reasonable\r\nunder the applicable  legal standard and therefore  protected\r\nby qualified immunity.  See id.  \r                                           \r\n\n12.

Because  there  was  no  objection  to  such\r\nconclusions,   our  review  is  for  plain  error,  a  burden\r\nplaintiffs  cannot  sustain  in  light  of  our  harmlessness\r\nanalysis.\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nthat  defendants  violated   FAA  regulations  inadmissible);\r\n\nSpecht,  853  F.2d  805,  809 (discussing  the  distinction).\r                  \r\n\nIndeed, the definition of what is law and what is application\r\n\nor  practice may  be difficult  to  ascertain.   This may  be\r\n\nparticularly so   when the issues involve not  only a statute\r\n\nand formally  promulgated regulations,  but also  guidelines,\r\n\nhandbooks, advisory rulings,  interpretive bulletins, general\r\n\ncounsel's letter opinions, informational notices and  similar\r\n\naccoutrements  of  the modern  bureaucratic state.   Further,\r\n\nthere   may  be  particular  areas  of  law,  such  as  legal\r\n\nmalpractice,  where  expert  testimony  on  legal  matters is\r\n\nadmissible where it would normally  be excluded.  We can also\r\n\nhypothesize instances in rare,  highly complex and  technical\r\n\nmatters where a trial judge, utilizing limited and controlled\r\n\nmechanisms, and as a matter of trial management, permits some\r\n\ntestimony seemingly at variance with the general rule.13  But\r\n\nnone of  those instances  are before us.   The  issues raised\r\n\nhere  are  routinely  before  the  federal  courts,  are  not\r\n\ncomplex, and the use of such testimony was egregious.\r\n\nTestimony Re After-Acquired Evidence\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.

See id.  at 882.\r                                                               \r\n\nThe Supreme Court held that such evidence was not relevant to\r                                                             \r\n\nthe employer's liability for age discrimination, but would be\r\n\nrelevant in determining what remedy was appropriate.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat  885.  If  the evidence would  have led  to the employee's\r\n\ndischarge  at some later date,  that would affect the measure\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.    A question  may  be  raised  whether the  evidence  of\r\nirregularities that Santiago  described meets the  definition\r\nof after-acquired evidence under McKennon v. Nashville Banner\r                                                                         \r\nPubl'g  Co.,  116 S.  Ct.  879  (1995).   McKennon  concerned\r                                                              \r\nemployee wrongdoing that would  normally cause termination of\r\nemployment.  We do not  know if the irregularities alleged in\r\nthis case would in fact  normally lead to termination or non-\r\nrenewal of  employment.    In  addition,  McKennon  expressly\r                                                              \r\nconsidered  the  equitable  doctrine  of   unclean  hands  in\r\ndetermining  that \"the  employee's wrongdoing  must  be taken\r\ninto account,  lest  the employer's  legitimate  concerns  be\r\nignored.\"   Id. at 360.  Here, as the evidence was presented,\r                           \r\nit  was   apparently  the  former   administration,  not  the\r\nemployees, who made the appointments allegedly against normal\r\nprocedures.   If  the  employees were  blameless,  it may  be\r\ndifficult to import  wholesale the McKennon doctrine.   Given\r                                                       \r\nthe desultory treatment  of this aspect of the McKennon issue\r                                                                   \r\nby the parties and our disposition  of the case, we think  it\r\nwiser to address the issue in some future case.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nof  damages  and  the  appropriateness  of  reinstatement  as\r\n\nequitable relief.  See id. at 885-86.  In Umbehr, the Supreme\r                                                            \r\n\nCourt adopted the McKennon approach in First Amendment claims\r                                      \r\n\nbrought by public employees or  contractors.  See Umbehr, 116\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct.  at 2352  (\"[I]f [plaintiff]  prevails, evidence  that\r\n\n[defendants] discovered  facts after  termination that  would\r\n\nhave  led  to  a  later  termination  anyway . . .  would  be\r\n\nrelevant in assessing what remedy is appropriate.\").\r\n\n          Thus,  such  after-acquired  evidence  is  normally\r\n\nadmissible  only as  to remedy,  and not  on liability.   Yet\r\n\nhere,  it was seemingly offered, over objection, as pertinent\r\n\nto  liability.   Those  portions  of    Santiago's  testimony\r\n\nconcerning  the  irregularities in  plaintiffs'  appointments\r\n\nwhich  did not  consist of  legal  conclusions were  arguably\r\n\nrelevant  to damages,  but normally,  not to  liability.   On\r\n\nappeal, plaintiffs only argue the issue of admissibility, and\r\n\nthe evidence was arguably admissible on damages.15\r\n\n          To   prevail,   plaintiffs  must   show   abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  in  admission of  the  evidence.    Any abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  analysis is  complicated by  the  actions of  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  The trial  court erred in  failing to instruct the  jury\r\nthat  Santiago's testimony  was not  relevant in  determining\r\nliability.  Although  the judge properly instructed  the jury\r\nthat it should not consider  evidence that it did not believe\r\nwas before  the decision maker  at the time of  the decision,\r\nthe risk  of prejudice  was such that  the judge  should have\r\nstated  explicitly   that  Santiago's   testimony  concerning\r\nirregularities was  not to  be considered in  any way  on the\r\nquestion of liability.\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nparties  here.    While much  of  Santiago's  testimony would\r\n\nnormally  be   inadmissible,  plaintiffs  may   have  invited\r\n\ndefendants to respond in kind.  It was apparently  plaintiffs\r\n\nwho first  introduced the  topic of  legal conclusions  to be\r\n\ndrawn  from review of plaintiffs' personnel  files and of the\r\n\nlaw about rights of public employees.  Plaintiffs argued that\r\n\nthe files showed no disciplinary warnings or other actions by\r\n\nthe employers which  provided cause for termination  of their\r\n\nemployment,   and   their   expert   may  have   engaged   in\r\n\ninappropriate legal commentary. Defendants apparently did not\r\n\nobject, perhaps because they wanted to respond in kind.\r\n\n          The trial judge evidently felt that this opened the\r\n\ndoor to  the defendants'  expert.  \"Opening  the door\"  is an\r\n\nevidentiary concept  which requires  careful weighing  of the\r\n\nunfairness of allowing one  party's objectionable evidence to\r\n\nremain  unanswered  against  the  danger of  compounding  the\r\n\nproblem with further inadmissible and potentially prejudicial\r\n\ntestimony.  See 1 McCormack on Evidence   57 (John W. Strong,\r                                                   \r\n\ned.,  4th ed.  1992).   The  judge may  well  have felt  that\r\n\nplaintiffs created the problem about which they now complain.\r\n\nAs plaintiffs did not provide this court with a transcript of\r\n\ntheir own expert's testimony, we do not reach the question of\r\n\nwhether  the  judge   abused  his   discretion  in   allowing\r\n\nSantiago's problematic testimony under an \"opening  the door\"\r\n\ntheory.\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n          To overcome the jury  verdict, plaintiffs must show\r\n\nnot only that there were errors under the abuse of discretion\r\n\nstandard,  but also  that the  district  court's errors  were\r\n\nharmful.  \"Only  if we answer both questions  in the positive\r\n\nwill [plaintiffs']  argument on  appeal prevail.\"   Ahern  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nScholz, 85 F.3d 774, 786 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                  \r\n\nHarmless Error\r                          \r\n\n          In  a civil case,  the party asserting  error bears\r\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful, i.e.,\r\n\nthat it affected  that party's substantial rights.

Ultimately, if we are in\r\n\n\"grave doubt\"  concerning the likely  effect of the  error on\r\n\nthe verdict,  we treat the  error as if  it had  affected the\r\n\nverdict.  See id.\r                             \r\n\n          Although normally  testimony such as  Santiago's as\r\n\nto legal conclusions is  clearly wrong and such  testimony as\r\n\nwas proper  is limited,  at best, to  damages, we  cannot say\r\n\nthat the  testimony affected  the outcome  of the  trial, and\r\n\ntherefore, we consider it harmless.16 \r\n\n          The  district court's  instructions here  reinforce\r\n\nthe  conclusion that Santiago's testimony was not central nor\r\n\ndid it  actually prejudice  the jury's  decision.  The  judge\r\n\nproperly  instructed  that  \"once  a  transitory  appointment\r\n\nexpires, defendant  may  terminate  the  transitory  employee\r\n\n. . .  for any  reason  except  if that  reason  is based  on\r                                                                         \r\n\npolitical   affiliation.\"  (emphasis   added)     The   judge\r                                   \r\n\ninstructed,  not once  but several  times,  that the  central\r\n\nissue  for the  jury to  decide  was whether  the motive  for\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  That plaintiffs  apparently  opened  the  door  to  such\r\ntestimony also bears  on the  harmless error  analysis.   The\r\njury may have had two  \"experts\" each opining on the law  and\r\nmay have disregarded  both experts as not helpful  on the key\r\nquestion of motive.  In this case, the question of motive was\r\na straightforward  question of  whom the  jury believed,  the\r\nMayor or the plaintiffs.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nplaintiffs'  non-renewals  was their  political  affiliation.\r\n\nFinally, the verdict form itself  posed the question, \"Do you\r\n\nfind by  a preponderance of the evidence  that the motivating\r\n\nfactor  for not renewing  the appointment of  [plaintiff] was\r\n\n[his or her] political affiliation?\"\r\n\n          The judge did  expressly caution the jury  that the\r\n\nmunicipal  defendants could not use compliance with state law\r\n\nas  a pretext  for political  discrimination.   The  district\r\n\ncourt instructed the jury that  they were not to consider any\r\n\nfacts that were not known  to the relevant decision makers at\r\n\nthe  time plaintiffs'  contracts were  allowed  to expire  in\r\n\ndeciding  whether  Soto's  administration  let plaintiffs  go\r\n\nbecause  of their political  affiliation.17  As  the district\r\n\ncourt explained, \"if  the irregularity or misconduct  was not\r\n\ndiscovered  until  after  the  employee's  contract  was  not\r\n\nrenewed,  the employer  could  not  have  been  motivated  by\r\n\nknowledge of it, and he  cannot now claim that the employee's\r\n\ncontract was not renewed for that reason.\"\r\n\n          Thus,  we do not find it likely, despite Santiago's\r\n\ntestimony, that  the jury  was confused  about the  rights of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.   In  finding  any  error harmless,  we  need not  decide\r\nwhether the  admission of the  evidence was erroneous  in the\r\nfirst  instance.   Plaintiffs  themselves represented  to the\r\ncourt that Soto's knowledge of the  illegalities was a viable\r\nfactual  issue  for  the  jury.    Plaintiffs  asked for  and\r\nreceived  an instruction, which they said \"would be curative\"\r\nof  the McKennon problem, that  the jury should disregard the\r                            \r\nillegality evidence \"if they believed that [the illegalities]\r\nwere discovered after the fact.\"  \r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\ntransitory  employees under the First Amendment.  As in Caro,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe  issue in  this  case  was \"the  factual  matter of  [the\r\n\nmunicipality's]  reason for dismissing  the plaintiffs.   Was\r\n\n[its]  motive political?\"   Caro,  878 F.2d at  2.   The jury\r                                            \r\n\nanswered that question.   As we harbor no  \"grave doubt,\" the\r\n\njudgment  of  the district  court  is  affirmed.

The report also opined that plaintiffs did not have \"a legitimate expectation of retaining employment.\"   Finally, the report concluded that, under the law of Puerto Rico, \"the Municipality of Canovanas could not continue extending said transitory appointments.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon receiving Santiago's report, plaintiffs made a motion in limine to exclude Santiago's testimony.

Under Puerto Rico's Autonomous Municipalities Act, 21 L.P.R.A. &#167; 4554, transitory employees may be appointed for a limited term, generally not to exceed one year.  Although plaintiffs, unlike other civil servants in Puerto Rico, had no formal tenure in their jobs following the expiration of their contracts, many had been reappointed for several one-year terms as a matter of course.  Other plaintiffs were in their first annual term of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 1993, three days after taking office as Mayor of Canovanas, Soto informed most of the plaintiffs that their positions as transitory employees had expired and that he would not renew their appointments.  The remaining plaintiffs' appointments were temporarily extended, but eventually their appointments expired as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs testified that they campaigned for Esteban Melendez-Rivera, the PDP candidate, in the 1992 mayoral election.  Plaintiffs testified that they had engaged in various PDP political activities on behalf of Melendez, including attending political meetings or taking part in the campaign rallies known as caravanas (\"caravans\") that are typical of mayoral campaigning in Puerto Rico.  Many of them testified that Soto solicited their support, and, when they said they would support the incumbent PDP mayor instead, Soto threatened to leave them without employment after the election.  Many plaintiffs also testified that they observed, after their non-renewals, NPP members performing the duties of the jobs they had performed as transitory employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their First Amendment claims, plaintiffs put in evidence their personnel files, arguing that there was nothing in them that would indicate poor performance.  Plaintiffs also presented an expert witness in personnel administration to bolster their claims of political discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' position was that Soto had not considered plaintiffs' political affiliation in his decision to allow their contracts to expire.  They presented three witnesses:  Mayor Soto, Vice-Mayor Miguel Jimenez-Carrion (\"Jimenez\"), and Blanca Santiago, their expert witness on government personnel administration.  Soto categorically denied the plaintiffs' allegations that he had threatened their jobs if they supported the incumbent.  He noted that he had retained or hired PDP members to municipal jobs.  He testified that he had allowed plaintiffs' contracts to expire because their services were no longer needed.  Jimenez gave essentially the same version of events.  Neither testified that they had not renewed the contracts because plaintiffs' appointments had been irregular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Defendants' Expert</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' expert witness, Blanca Santiago, testified that the plaintiffs' personnel records demonstrated that, in many cases, their appointments were contrary to Puerto Rico law.  In particular, Santiago testified that many employees had been on the payroll in excess of one year, sometimes without any documented reappointment, and opined that this violated the Autonomous Municipalities Act, which provides that the appointment of \"[t]ransitory employees shall not exceed one (1) year....\"  21 L.P.R.A. &#167; 4554(c).  Santiago also testified that many of the plaintiffs had been illegally appointed within two months of a general election, in violation of a prophylactic prohibition on government personnel decisions commonly known as the \"electoral ban.\"   See 21 L.P.R.A. &#167; 4564;  3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1337.  Santiago testified further that, in some cases, the personnel records had been manipulated in order to make it appear that plaintiffs' appointments were not within the electoral ban period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then questioned Santiago to elicit testimony to the effect that courts have held that transitory employees do not have a right to the renewal of their contracts.  Defense counsel accomplished this objective by reading passages from court decisions holding that transitory employees in Puerto Rico have no reasonable or legitimate expectation of continued renewal of their contracts that would entitle them to administrative due process protections before allowing their contracts to expire, and then asking Santiago to comment.  This was done although the due process claims had been dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago testified that, under court decisions, \"[o]nce [a transitory employee's] appointment ends the transitory employee ... doesn't have any ... other right, regardless of the fact that his appointment has been extended for a period of time that we may call 'excessively long.' \"   Plaintiffs' counsel objected to this testimony on the ground that it misstated the law.  That objection was overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon afterwards, defense counsel continued questioning Santiago on the legal status of transitory employees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Q. I am going to review ... the case of Fermin Orta et al. versus Pedro A. Padilla, Municipality of Trujillio Alto, et al.....  I'm going to read to you from the translation of that opinion....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, plaintiffs again objected, noting that the case concerned the due process rights of transitory employees, and that the sole claim on trial was the First Amendment claim.  Again, the district court overruled plaintiffs' objection.  Defendants resumed questioning the witness about the law articulated in that case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Plaintiffs objected again, noting, \"She's testifying [to] what are basically jury instructions.\"   The district court initially sustained plaintiffs' objection, but then permitted defense counsel to continue questioning the witness in this manner.  Defense counsel proceeded to read excerpts from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in Correa, and from this court's decision in Cheveras Pacheco v. Rivera Gonzalez, 809 F.2d 125, 129 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that transitory employees do not have a property interest in continued employment).  Plaintiffs' counsel again protested, and a conference was held outside the presence of the jury.  Plaintiffs' counsel asked the judge to strike Santiago's testimony or give a curative instruction, stating explicitly that it is against the law for a municipal government to let a transitory employee's contract expire if the primary reason is the employee's political affiliation.  The district court refused, saying plaintiffs had opened the door with their own expert witness and that they could cross-examine Santiago on the illegality of firing employees for political reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago stated that the legal opinions she provided on direct examination concerning the status of transitory employees and the alleged illegalities in plaintiffs' original appointments were based solely on Commonwealth law, not federal law.  When questioned about the case law of this court which has held that a decision not to renew a transitory employees' contract may not be primarily based on political affiliation under the First Amendment, the witness was evasive.  Although she agreed that transitory employees could not be discharged for political reasons, she insisted that this did not apply when a contract expired because, she said, such an employee was not discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing arguments, plaintiffs' counsel argued that the witnesses' testimony, principally the plaintiffs', established that the incoming NPP administration's motive for refusing to renew plaintiffs' contracts was reprisal for their support of the previous PDP mayor.  Defense counsel strongly contested the plaintiffs' credibility, and argued that Soto never considered plaintiffs' political affiliation in his decision not to renew plaintiffs' contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel also made reference to Santiago's testimony, arguing that the employees were transitory and that their appointments had been in violation of Puerto Rico municipal law.  Defense counsel also argued that the Mayor would have been in violation of that law if he had renewed their appointments.  Defense counsel made reference to Santiago's testimony that transitory employees do not have a reasonable expectation of retaining their jobs after their contracts expire, arguing that plaintiffs' expert had distorted the law in suggesting otherwise.  Defense counsel asked rhetorically, \"[A]fter the appointment expired ... what are their [sic ] rights of those employees?   And that Your Honor is going to tell you, see, in the instructions.\"   Defense counsel noted that, unlike plaintiffs' expert witness, \"She never ... tell [sic ] us whether [the plaintiffs] were dismissed or not for political discriminatory reasons.  That is for you to decide.\"   Defense counsel did not argue that the reasons for the non-renewals were that plaintiffs' appointments were irregular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge instructed the jury that its duty was \"to follow the law as I shall state it to you\" and that it should not \"base [its] verdict upon any view of the law other than that given in the instructions of the Court.\"   The court did not otherwise specifically instruct the jury to disregard the expert witnesses' opinions concerning the applicable law, but rather said expert testimony should be treated just as testimony from any other witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, however, the judge instructed the jury that any irregularities in the appointments of the plaintiffs could not be used as a pretext for violating their First Amendment rights:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, conduct purportedly engaged in consonance with the Puerto Rico personnel's law and regulation [sic ] does not control a claim alleging a violation of the employees' First Amendment right of political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new administration cannot use the doctrine of compliance with state law or nullity under state law as a cover for discharges, transfers and discrimination based solely on political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, a new administration cannot use the fact that plaintiffs were hired during the electoral prohibition period or \"veda \" as a pretext for political discrimination.  In the final analysis, the question of motivation is a question of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court also instructed:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that plaintiffs' political affiliation was the motivating factor for the non-renewal of their appointments, then you may find for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court also gave this instruction:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if you find that plaintiffs' appointments were not renewed because they had been appointed by the former administration in violation of the personnel and electoral laws and not because of plaintiffs' political affiliation, then you may find for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge further instructed that, although transitory employees do not have tenure in their jobs, their contracts may not be allowed to expire for political reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Finally, in response to a request from plaintiffs' counsel for a curative instruction, the judge instructed that the jury was to consider only evidence that they believed was known to the decisionmakers at the time plaintiffs' contracts were not renewed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Verdict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict form asked, as to each of the plaintiffs, \"Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the motivating factor for not renewing the appointment of [plaintiff] was [his or her] political affiliation?\"   The jury answered no in each case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.  See General Electric Co. v. Joiner, --- U.S. ----, ----, 118 S.Ct. 512, 516, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (U.S.1997);  Knowlton v. Deseret Med.  Inc., 930 F.2d 116, 124 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Legal Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the parties exhibit some confusion over long-established legal principles in this area, we repeat them.  In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), a divided Supreme Court granted some First Amendment protection to employees terminated because of their political affiliation where political affiliation was not a reasonably appropriate requirement for the job.  See id. at 359 (plurality opinion).  As Justice Stewart, concurring, said, a \"nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential government employee [cannot] be discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that he is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs.\"  Id. at 375, 96 S.Ct. at 2690 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment).  In Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), the Supreme Court reaffirmed Elrod, and explained that the First Amendment prohibits termination of public employees because of their political affiliation unless \"the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.\"  Branti, 445 U.S. at 518, 100 S.Ct. at 1295.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that the Elrod-Branti doctrine applies to a local government's decision whether to renew the contract of a transitory employee.  See Cheveras Pacheco v. Rivera Gonzalez, 809 F.2d 125 (1st Cir.1987).  A municipality may not allow transitory employees' contracts to expire if the primary motive is to punish them for their political affiliation.  See id. at 127-29.   This is true regardless of whether the employees have been renewed on a regular basis prior to their dismissal or, as is true of some of plaintiffs here, have served only one term.  See Figueroa v. Aponte-Roque, 864 F.2d 947, 951 (1st Cir.1989).  Thus, the fact that a transitory employee does not have a reasonable expectation of renewal in his or her employment that would require due process protections does not defeat a First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990), the Supreme Court held that the Elrod-Branti prohibition against political affiliation discrimination applied not only to discharges, but also to significant personnel decisions such as whether to hire or promote a public employee.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. at 2739-40.   Hence, even if the decision not to renew a transitory appointment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> is considered a hiring decision rather than a discharge, Rutan reinforces our rule announced in Cheveras Pacheco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And the Elrod-Branti-Rutan principle has been reinforced recently by the Supreme Court.  In Board of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996) and O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 116 S.Ct. 2353, 135 L.Ed.2d 874 (1996), the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment provides protection to independent contractors similar to those afforded government employees.  See Umbehr, 518 U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2345-46 (termination of a contract in reprisal for contractor's criticism of county government);  O'Hare, 518 U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2355-56 (removal of an independent contractor from a list of towing services employed by the city in retaliation for supporting opposing political party).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Expert Testimony on the Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aspects of Santiago's testimony are very troubling.  Certain parts of her testimony--for example, concerning actual personnel practices, the various categories of public employees and the like--are unobjectionable.  But Santiago also testified as to the holdings of various opinions of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and by reference, of this court (over objection), and to the legal conclusion that these appointments were in violation of law (without objection).  To exacerbate matters, her testimony may be charitably described as misleading at best as to the rights of transitory employees as a matter of federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is black-letter law that \"[i]t is not for witnesses to instruct the jury as to applicable principles of law, but for the judge.\"  United States v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Marx &amp; Co. v. Diners' Club, Inc., 550 F.2d 505, 512 (2d Cir.1977)).  At least seven circuit courts have held that the Federal Rules of Evidence prohibit such testimony, and we now join them as to the general rule.  See Burkhart v. Washington Metro.  Area Transit Auth., 112 F.3d 1207, 1212-14 (D.C.Cir.1997) (reversible error to allow an expert in police practices to opine on whether police officers' efforts in communicating with a deaf plaintiff were enough to satisfy federal disability statutes);  Snap-Drape, Inc. v. Commissioner, 98 F.3d 194, 197-98 (5th Cir.1996) (trial court properly excluded taxpayer's expert reports as containing nothing more than legal arguments concerning the tax treatment of certain dividends);  Berry v. City of Detroit, 25 F.3d 1342, 1353-54 (6th Cir.1994) (finding inadmissible the comments of an expert in police practices on the meaning of the legal term \"deliberate indifference\" in a civil rights case);  Aguilar v. International Longshoremen's Union, Local # 10, 966 F.2d 443, 447 (9th Cir.1992) (testimony of purported expert that workers reasonably and foreseeably relied on defendants' promises addressed \"matters of law for the court's determination\" that were \"inappropriate subjects for expert testimony\");  Specht v. Jensen, 853 F.2d 805 (10th Cir.1988) (en banc) (reversible error to allow an expert witness who was an attorney to give his opinions on what was required to make consent to a search effective);  Adalman v. Baker, Watts &amp; Co., 807 F.2d 359, 366 (4th Cir.1986) (finding inadmissible proffered expert opinion concerning whether, under securities laws, disclosure of a particular fact was required in the course of negotiating a transaction);  Marx &amp; Co. v. Diners' Club, Inc., 550 F.2d 505 (2d Cir.1977) (securities lawyer, called as an expert, could not testify to the legal obligations created under a contract).  To state the general rule is not to decide the far more complicated and measured question of when there is a transgression of the rule.  We outline some of the considerations and conclude that the rule has been transgressed here.  We leave to future cases the defining of the contours of application of this rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our legal system, purely legal questions and instructions to the jury on the law to be applied to the resolution of the dispute before them is exclusively the domain of the judge.  Accordingly, expert testimony on such purely legal issues is rarely admissible.  As the Second Circuit has noted, \"The danger is that the jury may think that the 'expert' in the particular branch of the law knows more than the judge--surely an impermissible inference in our system of law.\"  Marx &amp; Co., 550 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one well-recognized exception is for questions of foreign law, where the judge may be aided by the expert's assistance.  See Adalman, 807 F.2d at 366;  Marx &amp; Co., 550 F.2d at 510;  1 McCormick on Evidence &#167; 12, at 50 (John W. Strong, ed., 4th ed.1992);  7 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1953 (Chadbourne rev.1978).  Even in the case of foreign law, under modern practice the testimony is generally given to the judge, outside of the presence of the jury, and is meant to assist the judge in determining the appropriate instructions.  See Adalman, 807 F.2d at 366;  9 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 2558 (Chadbourne rev.1978).  Here, the testimony was plainly not offered to assist the judge, who has presided over many such political discharge cases, and was presented to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury does not decide such pure questions of law, such testimony is not helpful to the jury and so does not fall within the literal terms of Fed.R.Evid. 702, which allows expert testimony \"[i]f scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\"  As the D.C. Circuit noted, \"Expert testimony that consists of legal conclusions cannot properly assist the trier of fact in either respect....\"  Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1212;  see also Aguilar, 966 F.2d at 447 (expert legal opinion does not assist the factfinder under Rule 702).  This is because the judge's expert knowledge of the law makes any such assistance at best cumulative, and at worst prejudicial.  See Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1213 (\"Each courtroom comes equipped with a 'legal expert,' called a judge, and it is his or her province alone to instruct the jury on the relevant legal standards.\");  7 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1952 (Chadbourne rev.  1978) (\"It is not the common knowledge of the jury which renders the witness' opinion unnecessary, but the special legal knowledge of the judge.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Fed.R.Evid. 704(a), which removes the common-law bar on \"otherwise admissible\" testimony that \"embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact,\" does not vitiate the rule against expert opinion on questions of law.  The common law did not allow an expert witness to inform the jury of his or her factual conclusion concerning the \"ultimate issue\" in the case, because this was thought to invade the province of the jury.  The abolition in Rule 704(a) of this \"ultimate issue\" rule allows the expert witness to offer his or her factual conclusion in order to aid the jury, which properly can choose to accept or reject it.  However, questions of law are not \"to be decided by the trier of fact\";  rather it is for the judge, not the lawyers or the witnesses, to inform the jury of the law applicable in the case and to decide any purely legal issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Recently, this court has cautioned that the abolition of the \"bar on 'ultimate issue' opinions ... is not a carte blanche for experts.\"  Dinco v. Dylex, Ltd., 111 F.3d 964, 973 (1st Cir.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the testimony by Santiago described above clearly transgressed the general rule, we acknowledge that it is often difficult to draw the line between what are questions of law, what are questions of fact, and what are mixed questions.  See, e.g., In re Air Disaster at Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988, 37 F.3d 804, 826-27 (2d Cir.1994) (regarding expert's testimony that defendants engaged in \"fraud\" and \"deceit\" admissible because the terms were used in layman's sense, while finding expert's conclusion that defendants violated FAA regulations inadmissible);  Specht, 853 F.2d 805, 809 (discussing the distinction).  Indeed, the definition of what is law and what is application or practice may be difficult to ascertain.  This may be particularly so when the issues involve not only a statute and formally promulgated regulations, but also guidelines, handbooks, advisory rulings, interpretive bulletins, general counsel's letter opinions, informational notices and similar accoutrements of the modern bureaucratic state.  Further, there may be particular areas of law, such as legal malpractice, where expert testimony on legal matters is admissible where it would normally be excluded.  We can also hypothesize instances in rare, highly complex and technical matters where a trial judge, utilizing limited and controlled mechanisms, and as a matter of trial management, permits some testimony seemingly at variance with the general rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  But none of those instances are before us.  The issues raised here are routinely before the federal courts, are not complex, and the use of such testimony was egregious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Testimony Re After-Acquired Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second reason the admission of Santiago's testimony is very troubling.  That has to do with application of the after-acquired evidence doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  In McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co., 513 U.S. 352, 115 S.Ct. 879, 130 L.Ed.2d 852 (1995), the Supreme Court considered whether an employee's wrongdoing, discovered after the termination of employment, which would have been sufficient to justify the decision, but which was not known to the employer at the time of the decision and so could not have motivated the decision, foreclosed a claim of age discrimination.  See id. at 352-54, 115 S.Ct. at 882.   The Supreme Court held that such evidence was not relevant to the employer's liability for age discrimination, but would be relevant in determining what remedy was appropriate.  See id. at 358-60, 115 S.Ct. at 885.   If the evidence would have led to the employee's discharge at some later date, that would affect the measure of damages and the appropriateness of reinstatement as equitable relief.  See id. at 358-63, 115 S.Ct. at 885-86.   In Umbehr, the Supreme Court adopted the McKennon approach in First Amendment claims brought by public employees or contractors.  See Umbehr, 518 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2352 (\"[I]f [plaintiff] prevails, evidence that [defendants] discovered facts after termination that would have led to a later termination anyway ... would be relevant in assessing what remedy is appropriate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, such after-acquired evidence is normally admissible only as to remedy, and not on liability.  Yet here, it was seemingly offered, over objection, as pertinent to liability.  Those portions of Santiago's testimony concerning the irregularities in plaintiffs' appointments which did not consist of legal conclusions were arguably relevant to damages, but normally, not to liability.  On appeal, plaintiffs only argue the issue of admissibility, and the evidence was arguably admissible on damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail, plaintiffs must show abuse of discretion in admission of the evidence.  Any abuse of discretion analysis is complicated by the actions of the parties here.  While much of Santiago's testimony would normally be inadmissible, plaintiffs may have invited defendants to respond in kind.  It was apparently plaintiffs who first introduced the topic of legal conclusions to be drawn from review of plaintiffs' personnel files and of the law about rights of public employees.  Plaintiffs argued that the files showed no disciplinary warnings or other actions by the employers which provided cause for termination of their employment, and their expert may have engaged in inappropriate legal commentary.  Defendants apparently did not object, perhaps because they wanted to respond in kind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge evidently felt that this opened the door to the defendants' expert.  \"Opening the door\" is an evidentiary concept which requires careful weighing of the unfairness of allowing one party's objectionable evidence to remain unanswered against the danger of compounding the problem with further inadmissible and potentially prejudicial testimony.  See 1 McCormack on Evidence &#167; 57 (John W. Strong, ed., 4th ed.1992).  The judge may well have felt that plaintiffs created the problem about which they now complain.  As plaintiffs did not provide this court with a transcript of their own expert's testimony, we do not reach the question of whether the judge abused his discretion in allowing Santiago's problematic testimony under an \"opening the door\" theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To overcome the jury verdict, plaintiffs must show not only that there were errors under the abuse of discretion standard, but also that the district court's errors were harmful.  \"Only if we answer both questions in the positive will [plaintiffs'] argument on appeal prevail.\"  Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 786 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Harmless Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a civil case, the party asserting error bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful, i.e., that it affected that party's substantial rights.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 61;  Fed.R.Evid. 103;  Federico v. Order of St. Benedict in R.I., 64 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995) (burden of showing harmful error in a civil case is on party asserting error);  Hygh v. Jacobs, 961 F.2d 359, 364-65 (2d Cir.1992) (holding that objecting party had not met burden of showing that admission of improper legal opinion testimony had prejudicial effect).  \"In determining whether an error affected a party's substantial right[s], the central question is whether this court can say with fair assurance ... that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\"  Ahern, 85 F.3d at 786 (citations, internal quotation marks and original alterations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factors considered in determining the likelihood that the jury's verdict was substantially swayed by the evidentiary error include both the centrality of the evidence and the prejudicial effect of its inclusion or exclusion.  See id.  \"We weigh these factors in the context of the case as gleaned from the record as a whole.\"  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Ultimately, if we are in \"grave doubt\" concerning the likely effect of the error on the verdict, we treat the error as if it had affected the verdict.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although normally testimony such as Santiago's as to legal conclusions is clearly wrong and such testimony as was proper is limited, at best, to damages, we cannot say that the testimony affected the outcome of the trial, and therefore, we consider it harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instructions here reinforce the conclusion that Santiago's testimony was not central nor did it actually prejudice the jury's decision.  The judge properly instructed that \"once a transitory appointment expires, defendant may terminate the transitory employee ... for any reason except if that reason is based on political affiliation.\"  (emphasis added) The judge instructed, not once but several times, that the central issue for the jury to decide was whether the motive for plaintiffs' non-renewals was their political affiliation.  Finally, the verdict form itself posed the question, \"Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the motivating factor for not renewing the appointment of [plaintiff] was [his or her] political affiliation?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge did expressly caution the jury that the municipal defendants could not use compliance with state law as a pretext for political discrimination.  The district court instructed the jury that they were not to consider any facts that were not known to the relevant decision makers at the time plaintiffs' contracts were allowed to expire in deciding whether Soto's administration let plaintiffs go because of their political affiliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  As the district court explained, \"if the irregularity or misconduct was not discovered until after the employee's contract was not renewed, the employer could not have been motivated by knowledge of it, and he cannot now claim that the employee's contract was not renewed for that reason.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we do not find it likely, despite Santiago's testimony, that the jury was confused about the rights of transitory employees under the First Amendment.  As in Caro, the issue in this case was \"the factual matter of [the municipality's] reason for dismissing the plaintiffs.  Was [its] motive political?\"  Caro, 878 F.2d at 2. The jury answered that question.  As we harbor no \"grave doubt,\" the judgment of the district court is affirmed.   Costs to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This court has reviewed numerous claims of political firings or demotions from Puerto Rico.

A first wave of cases involved outright dismissals;  the second wave involved adverse actions less than outright dismissals.  That history is recited in Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209 (1st Cir.1989).  In 1992, control of the governor's office and of some local governments switched, and the NPP came back to power.

See Caro, 878 F.2d at 2-4;  Figueroa v. Aponte-Roque, 864 F.2d 947, 951 (1st Cir.1989).

The trial court erred in ruling that the termination was unlawful.\"</p>\n        <p>Santiago:  \"The interesting thing about that case is that there were--there were 22 transitory employees whose appointments were to end, and there was another group of employees in which--in which case the decision was different, and the matter of discrimination was approved.

See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995).  Thus, the Eighth Circuit found reversible error in allowing a witness to espouse views concerning the reasonableness of an officer's conduct in light of prevailing \"Fourth Amendment standards.\"  Peterson v. City of Plymouth, 60 F.3d 469, 475 (8th Cir.1995).  The jury's role was only to decide what facts were known to the officer at the time of the arrest, not whether, in light of those facts, the officer's conduct was reasonable under the applicable legal standard and therefore protected by qualified immunity.

We do not know if the irregularities alleged in this case would in fact normally lead to termination or non-renewal of employment.  In addition, McKennon expressly considered the equitable doctrine of unclean hands in determining that \"the employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account, lest the employer's legitimate concerns be ignored.\"  Id. at 361, 115 S.Ct. at 886.   Here, as the evidence was presented, it was apparently the former administration, not the employees, who made the appointments allegedly against normal procedures.  If the employees were blameless, it may be difficult to import wholesale the McKennon doctrine.  Given the desultory treatment of this aspect of the McKennon issue by the parties and our disposition of the case, we think it wiser to address the issue in some future case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that Santiago's testimony was not relevant in determining liability.

Under Puerto Rico's Autonomous Municipalities Act, 21 L.P.R.A. &#167; 4554, transitory employees may be appointed for a limited term, generally not to exceed one year.

Many of them testified that Soto solicited their support, and, when they said they would support the incumbent PDP mayor instead, Soto threatened to leave them without employment after the election.

Plaintiffs also presented an expert witness in personnel administration to bolster their claims of political discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' position was that Soto had not considered plaintiffs' political affiliation in his decision to allow their contracts to expire.  They presented three witnesses:  Mayor Soto, Vice-Mayor Miguel Jimenez-Carrion (\"Jimenez\"), and Blanca Santiago, their expert witness on government personnel administration.  Soto categorically denied the plaintiffs' allegations that he had threatened their jobs if they supported the incumbent.  He noted that he had retained or hired PDP members to municipal jobs.  He testified that he had allowed plaintiffs' contracts to expire because their services were no longer needed.  Jimenez gave essentially the same version of events.  Neither testified that they had not renewed the contracts because plaintiffs' appointments had been irregular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Defendants' Expert</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' expert witness, Blanca Santiago, testified that the plaintiffs' personnel records demonstrated that, in many cases, their appointments were contrary to Puerto Rico law.  In particular, Santiago testified that many employees had been on the payroll in excess of one year, sometimes without any documented reappointment, and opined that this violated the Autonomous Municipalities Act, which provides that the appointment of \"[t]ransitory employees shall not exceed one (1) year....\"  21 L.P.R.A. &#167; 4554(c).  Santiago also testified that many of the plaintiffs had been illegally appointed within two months of a general election, in violation of a prophylactic prohibition on government personnel decisions commonly known as the \"electoral ban.\"   See 21 L.P.R.A. &#167; 4564;  3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1337.  Santiago testified further that, in some cases, the personnel records had been manipulated in order to make it appear that plaintiffs' appointments were not within the electoral ban period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then questioned Santiago to elicit testimony to the effect that courts have held that transitory employees do not have a right to the renewal of their contracts.  Defense counsel accomplished this objective by reading passages from court decisions holding that transitory employees in Puerto Rico have no reasonable or legitimate expectation of continued renewal of their contracts that would entitle them to administrative due process protections before allowing their contracts to expire, and then asking Santiago to comment.  This was done although the due process claims had been dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago testified that, under court decisions, \"[o]nce [a transitory employee's] appointment ends the transitory employee ... doesn't have any ... other right, regardless of the fact that his appointment has been extended for a period of time that we may call 'excessively long.' \"   Plaintiffs' counsel objected to this testimony on the ground that it misstated the law.  That objection was overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon afterwards, defense counsel continued questioning Santiago on the legal status of transitory employees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>Q. I am going to review ... the case of Fermin Orta et al. versus Pedro A. Padilla, Municipality of Trujillio Alto, et al.....

Again, the district court overruled plaintiffs' objection.  Defendants resumed questioning the witness about the law articulated in that case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Plaintiffs objected again, noting, \"She's testifying [to] what are basically jury instructions.\"   The district court initially sustained plaintiffs' objection, but then permitted defense counsel to continue questioning the witness in this manner.  Defense counsel proceeded to read excerpts from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's decision in Correa, and from this court's decision in Cheveras Pacheco v. Rivera Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481635\"><a href=\"/opinion/481635/francisco-cheveras-pacheco-v-juan-m-rivera-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 129 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that transitory employees do not have a property interest in continued employment).  Plaintiffs' counsel again protested, and a conference was held outside the presence of the jury.  Plaintiffs' counsel asked the judge to strike Santiago's testimony or give a curative instruction, stating explicitly that it is against the law for a municipal government to let a transitory employee's contract expire if the primary reason is the employee's political affiliation.  The district court refused, saying plaintiffs had opened the door with their own expert witness and that they could cross-examine Santiago on the illegality of firing employees for political reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Santiago stated that the legal opinions she provided on direct examination concerning the status of transitory employees and the alleged illegalities in plaintiffs' original appointments were based solely on Commonwealth law, not federal law.  When questioned about the case law of this court which has held that a decision not to renew a transitory employees' contract may not be primarily based on political affiliation under the First Amendment, the witness was evasive.  Although she agreed that transitory employees could not be discharged for political reasons, she insisted that this did not apply when a contract expired because, she said, such an employee was not discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing arguments, plaintiffs' counsel argued that the witnesses' testimony, principally the plaintiffs', established that the incoming NPP administration's motive for refusing to renew plaintiffs' contracts was reprisal for their support of the previous PDP mayor.  Defense counsel strongly contested the plaintiffs' credibility, and argued that Soto never considered plaintiffs' political affiliation in his decision not to renew plaintiffs' contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel also made reference to Santiago's testimony, arguing that the employees were transitory and that their appointments had been in violation of Puerto Rico municipal law.  Defense counsel also argued that the Mayor would have been in violation of that law if he had renewed their appointments.  Defense counsel made reference to Santiago's testimony that transitory employees do not have a reasonable expectation of retaining their jobs after their contracts expire, arguing that plaintiffs' expert had distorted the law in suggesting otherwise.  Defense counsel asked rhetorically, \"[A]fter the appointment expired ... what are their [sic ] rights of those employees?   And that Your Honor is going to tell you, see, in the instructions.\"   Defense counsel noted that, unlike plaintiffs' expert witness, \"She never ... tell [sic ] us whether [the plaintiffs] were dismissed or not for political discriminatory reasons.  That is for you to decide.\"   Defense counsel did not argue that the reasons for the non-renewals were that plaintiffs' appointments were irregular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge instructed the jury that its duty was \"to follow the law as I shall state it to you\" and that it should not \"base [its] verdict upon any view of the law other than that given in the instructions of the Court.\"   The court did not otherwise specifically instruct the jury to disregard the expert witnesses' opinions concerning the applicable law, but rather said expert testimony should be treated just as testimony from any other witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, however, the judge instructed the jury that any irregularities in the appointments of the plaintiffs could not be used as a pretext for violating their First Amendment rights:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, conduct purportedly engaged in consonance with the Puerto Rico personnel's law and regulation [sic ] does not control a claim alleging a violation of the employees' First Amendment right of political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new administration cannot use the doctrine of compliance with state law or nullity under state law as a cover for discharges, transfers and discrimination based solely on political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, a new administration cannot use the fact that plaintiffs were hired during the electoral prohibition period or \"veda \" as a pretext for political discrimination.  In the final analysis, the question of motivation is a question of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court also instructed:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that plaintiffs' political affiliation was the motivating factor for the non-renewal of their appointments, then you may find for the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court also gave this instruction:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if you find that plaintiffs' appointments were not renewed because they had been appointed by the former administration in violation of the personnel and electoral laws and not because of plaintiffs' political affiliation, then you may find for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge further instructed that, although transitory employees do not have tenure in their jobs, their contracts may not be allowed to expire for political reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Finally, in response to a request from plaintiffs' counsel for a curative instruction, the judge instructed that the jury was to consider only evidence that they believed was known to the decisionmakers at the time plaintiffs' contracts were not renewed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Verdict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict form asked, as to each of the plaintiffs, \"Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the motivating factor for not renewing the appointment of [plaintiff] was [his or her] political affiliation?\"   The jury answered no in each case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.

As the Second Circuit has noted, \"The danger is that the jury may think that the 'expert' in the particular branch of the law knows more than the judge--surely an impermissible inference in our system of law.\"  Marx &amp; Co., 550 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one well-recognized exception is for questions of foreign law, where the judge may be aided by the expert's assistance.  See Adalman, 807 F.2d at 366;  Marx &amp; Co., 550 F.2d at 510;  1 McCormick on Evidence &#167; 12, at 50 (John W. Strong, ed., 4th ed.1992);  7 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1953 (Chadbourne rev.1978).  Even in the case of foreign law, under modern practice the testimony is generally given to the judge, outside of the presence of the jury, and is meant to assist the judge in determining the appropriate instructions.  See Adalman, 807 F.2d at 366;  9 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 2558 (Chadbourne rev.1978).  Here, the testimony was plainly not offered to assist the judge, who has presided over many such political discharge cases, and was presented to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the jury does not decide such pure questions of law, such testimony is not helpful to the jury and so does not fall within the literal terms of Fed.R.Evid. 702, which allows expert testimony \"[i]f scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\"  As the D.C. Circuit noted, \"Expert testimony that consists of legal conclusions cannot properly assist the trier of fact in either respect....\"  Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1212;  see also Aguilar, 966 F.2d at 447 (expert legal opinion does not assist the factfinder under Rule 702).  This is because the judge's expert knowledge of the law makes any such assistance at best cumulative, and at worst prejudicial.  See Burkhart, 112 F.3d at 1213 (\"Each courtroom comes equipped with a 'legal expert,' called a judge, and it is his or her province alone to instruct the jury on the relevant legal standards.\");  7 Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1952 (Chadbourne rev.  1978) (\"It is not the common knowledge of the jury which renders the witness' opinion unnecessary, but the special legal knowledge of the judge.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Fed.R.Evid. 704(a), which removes the common-law bar on \"otherwise admissible\" testimony that \"embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact,\" does not vitiate the rule against expert opinion on questions of law.  The common law did not allow an expert witness to inform the jury of his or her factual conclusion concerning the \"ultimate issue\" in the case, because this was thought to invade the province of the jury.  The abolition in Rule 704(a) of this \"ultimate issue\" rule allows the expert witness to offer his or her factual conclusion in order to aid the jury, which properly can choose to accept or reject it.  However, questions of law are not \"to be decided by the trier of fact\";  rather it is for the judge, not the lawyers or the witnesses, to inform the jury of the law applicable in the case and to decide any purely legal issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Recently, this court has cautioned that the abolition of the \"bar on 'ultimate issue' opinions ... is not a carte blanche for experts.\"  Dinco v.

See, e.g., In re Air Disaster at Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679962\"><a href=\"/opinion/679962/in-re-air-disaster-at-lockerbie-scotland-on-december-21-1988-judith-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 826-27 (2d Cir.1994) (regarding expert's testimony that defendants engaged in \"fraud\" and \"deceit\" admissible because the terms were used in layman's sense, while finding expert's conclusion that defendants violated FAA regulations inadmissible);  Specht, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509655\"><a href=\"/opinion/509655/o-george-specht-jr-and-june-b-specht-v-roger-jensen-doug-martin-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 809 (discussing the distinction).  Indeed, the definition of what is law and what is application or practice may be difficult to ascertain.  This may be particularly so when the issues involve not only a statute and formally promulgated regulations, but also guidelines, handbooks, advisory rulings, interpretive bulletins, general counsel's letter opinions, informational notices and similar accoutrements of the modern bureaucratic state.  Further, there may be particular areas of law, such as legal malpractice, where expert testimony on legal matters is admissible where it would normally be excluded.  We can also hypothesize instances in rare, highly complex and technical matters where a trial judge, utilizing limited and controlled mechanisms, and as a matter of trial management, permits some testimony seemingly at variance with the general rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  But none of those instances are before us.  The issues raised here are routinely before the federal courts, are not complex, and the use of such testimony was egregious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Testimony Re After-Acquired Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a second reason the admission of Santiago's testimony is very troubling.  That has to do with application of the after-acquired evidence doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  In McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ'g Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117894\"><a href=\"/opinion/117894/mckennon-v-nashville-banner-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span> (1995), the Supreme Court considered whether an employee's wrongdoing, discovered after the termination of employment, which would have been sufficient to justify the decision, but which was not known to the employer at the time of the decision and so could not have motivated the decision, foreclosed a claim of age discrimination.  See id. at 352-54, 115 S.Ct. at 882.   The Supreme Court held that such evidence was not relevant to the employer's liability for age discrimination, but would be relevant in determining what remedy was appropriate.  See id. at 358-60, 115 S.Ct. at 885.   If the evidence would have led to the employee's discharge at some later date, that would affect the measure of damages and the appropriateness of reinstatement as equitable relief.  See id. at 358-63, 115 S.Ct. at 885-86.   In Umbehr, the Supreme Court adopted the McKennon approach in First Amendment claims brought by public employees or contractors.  See Umbehr, 518 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2352 (\"[I]f [plaintiff] prevails, evidence that [defendants] discovered facts after termination that would have led to a later termination anyway ... would be relevant in assessing what remedy is appropriate.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, such after-acquired evidence is normally admissible only as to remedy, and not on liability.  Yet here, it was seemingly offered, over objection, as pertinent to liability.  Those portions of Santiago's testimony concerning the irregularities in plaintiffs' appointments which did not consist of legal conclusions were arguably relevant to damages, but normally, not to liability.  On appeal, plaintiffs only argue the issue of admissibility, and the evidence was arguably admissible on damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail, plaintiffs must show abuse of discretion in admission of the evidence.  Any abuse of discretion analysis is complicated by the actions of the parties here.  While much of Santiago's testimony would normally be inadmissible, plaintiffs may have invited defendants to respond in kind.  It was apparently plaintiffs who first introduced the topic of legal conclusions to be drawn from review of plaintiffs' personnel files and of the law about rights of public employees.  Plaintiffs argued that the files showed no disciplinary warnings or other actions by the employers which provided cause for termination of their employment, and their expert may have engaged in inappropriate legal commentary.  Defendants apparently did not object, perhaps because they wanted to respond in kind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge evidently felt that this opened the door to the defendants' expert.  \"Opening the door\" is an evidentiary concept which requires careful weighing of the unfairness of allowing one party's objectionable evidence to remain unanswered against the danger of compounding the problem with further inadmissible and potentially prejudicial testimony.  See 1 McCormack on Evidence &#167; 57 (John W. Strong, ed., 4th ed.1992).  The judge may well have felt that plaintiffs created the problem about which they now complain.  As plaintiffs did not provide this court with a transcript of their own expert's testimony, we do not reach the question of whether the judge abused his discretion in allowing Santiago's problematic testimony under an \"opening the door\" theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To overcome the jury verdict, plaintiffs must show not only that there were errors under the abuse of discretion standard, but also that the district court's errors were harmful.  \"Only if we answer both questions in the positive will [plaintiffs'] argument on appeal prevail.\"  Ahern v. Scholz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196795\"><a href=\"/opinion/196795/ahern-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 786 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Harmless Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a civil case, the party asserting error bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful, i.e., that it affected that party's substantial rights.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 61;  Fed.R.Evid. 103;  Federico v. Order of St. Benedict in R.I., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196267\"><a href=\"/opinion/196267/federico-v-order-of-st-benedict/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995) (burden of showing harmful error in a civil case is on party asserting error);  Hygh v.

See id.  \"We weigh these factors in the context of the case as gleaned from the record as a whole.\"  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Ultimately, if we are in \"grave doubt\" concerning the likely effect of the error on the verdict, we treat the error as if it had affected the verdict.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although normally testimony such as Santiago's as to legal conclusions is clearly wrong and such testimony as was proper is limited, at best, to damages, we cannot say that the testimony affected the outcome of the trial, and therefore, we consider it harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instructions here reinforce the conclusion that Santiago's testimony was not central nor did it actually prejudice the jury's decision.  The judge properly instructed that \"once a transitory appointment expires, defendant may terminate the transitory employee ... for any reason except if that reason is based on political affiliation.\"  (emphasis added) The judge instructed, not once but several times, that the central issue for the jury to decide was whether the motive for plaintiffs' non-renewals was their political affiliation.  Finally, the verdict form itself posed the question, \"Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the motivating factor for not renewing the appointment of [plaintiff] was [his or her] political affiliation?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge did expressly caution the jury that the municipal defendants could not use compliance with state law as a pretext for political discrimination.  The district court instructed the jury that they were not to consider any facts that were not known to the relevant decision makers at the time plaintiffs' contracts were allowed to expire in deciding whether Soto's administration let plaintiffs go because of their political affiliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  As the district court explained, \"if the irregularity or misconduct was not discovered until after the employee's contract was not renewed, the employer could not have been motivated by knowledge of it, and he cannot now claim that the employee's contract was not renewed for that reason.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we do not find it likely, despite Santiago's testimony, that the jury was confused about the rights of transitory employees under the First Amendment.  As in Caro, the issue in this case was \"the factual matter of [the municipality's] reason for dismissing the plaintiffs.  Was [its] motive political?\"  Caro, 878 F.2d at 2. The jury answered that question.  As we harbor no \"grave doubt,\" the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

In addition, McKennon expressly considered the equitable doctrine of unclean hands in determining that \"the employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account, lest the employer's legitimate concerns be ignored.\"  Id. at 361, 115 S.Ct. at 886.   Here, as the evidence was presented, it was apparently the former administration, not the employees, who made the appointments allegedly against normal procedures.  If the employees were blameless, it may be difficult to import wholesale the McKennon doctrine.  Given the desultory treatment of this aspect of the McKennon issue by the parties and our disposition of the case, we think it wiser to address the issue in some future case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that Santiago's testimony was not relevant in determining liability.  Although the judge properly instructed the jury that it should not consider evidence that it did not believe was before the decision maker at the time of the decision, the risk of prejudice was such that the judge should have stated explicitly that Santiago's testimony concerning irregularities was not to be considered in any way on the question of liability</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> That plaintiffs apparently opened the door to such testimony also bears on the harmless error analysis.  The jury may have had two \"experts\" each opining on the law and may have disregarded both experts as not helpful on the key question of motive.  In this case, the question of motive was a straightforward question of whom the jury believed, the Mayor or the plaintiffs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> In finding any error harmless, we need not decide whether the admission of the evidence was erroneous in the first instance.  Plaintiffs themselves represented to the court that Soto's knowledge of the illegalities was a viable factual issue for the jury.  Plaintiffs asked for and received an instruction, which they said \"would be curative\" of the McKennon problem, that the jury should disregard the illegality evidence \"if they believed that [the illegalities] were discovered after the fact.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
