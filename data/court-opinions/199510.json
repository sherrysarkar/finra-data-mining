O’Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Eileen M. Donoghue on brief for appellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Michael D.\nRicciuti, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         July 20, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. Carlos Tobon appeals his 210-month\n\nsentence imposed following his plea of guilty to charges of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and\n\nattempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and aiding and abetting, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2.    Tobon argues on appeal that he should have\n\nreceived a downward departure from the applicable sentencing\n\nguidelines range and that the district court clearly erred\n\nin imposing sentencing enhancements for being a leader or\n\norganizer of the conspiracy, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c),\n\nand for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.\n\nThe government has filed a Motion for Summary Disposition,\n\npursuant to Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n          In support of his argument that he is entitled to\n\na downward departure, Tobon contends that the government used\n\nan   artificially   beneficial   term   in   the   proposed   drug\n\ntransaction-- that the drugs could be delivered upon the\n\nsigning of a promissory note in lieu of a cash down payment.\n\nTobon argues that the government had at first insisted on a\n\nreasonable down payment, but changed the condition in order\n\nto ensure that the reverse-sting operation would succeed when\n\nthe defendants could not obtain the requisite cash.      He notes\n\n\n\n                             -2-\n\fthat the guidelines, specifically U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, comment.\n\n(n.15), contemplate a departure from the otherwise applicable\n\nsentencing guidelines range when the government has set an\n\nartificially low price in a reverse sting operation that\n\ninduces a defendant to purchase a larger quantity of drugs\n\nthan he would otherwise have obtained.\n\n          “Generally, an appellate court lacks jurisdiction\n\nto review a sentencing court’s discretionary decision not to\n\ndepart below the guideline sentencing range.           An exception\n\nto this general rule applies when the sentencing court’s\n\ndecision not to depart is based upon its belief that it lacks\n\nthe authority or power to depart.”         United States v. Mangos,\n\n134 F.3d 460, 465 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).\n\n          The exception does not apply here.         Nothing in the\n\nrecord indicates that the district court believed it lacked\n\nauthority to depart downward in this case.             Instead, the\n\nrecord indicates that the district court understood that it\n\nhad   authority   to   depart   pursuant    to   U.S.S.G.   §   2D1.1,\n\ncomment. (n.15), but that it exercised its discretion in\n\ndeclining to make such a departure.         We lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview this claim.     See United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27,\n\n40 (1st Cir.),    cert. denied, 121 S.Ct. 1982 (2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f              Tobon argues that the district court clearly erred\n\nin attributing a leadership role to him, contending that he\n\nwas no more culpable than his co-defendant Agudelo, who\n\nactually negotiated and met with the government agents.\n\n              The guidelines provide for at least a two-level\n\naggravating         role   enhancement       if    a     defendant      “was     an\n\norganizer,      leader,        manager,    or     supervisor.”          U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1(c). Factors the court should consider include, among\n\nothers, the exercise of decision making authority and the\n\nrecruitment of accomplices. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, comment (n.4).\n\nThere can be more than one person who qualifies as a leader\n\nor   organizer       of    a   criminal     association        or     conspiracy.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, comment. (n.4).                  We review role-in-the-\n\noffense determinations, steeped in the facts of the case,\n\nunder    a    clearly-erroneous       standard.              United    States   v.\n\nCadavid, 192 F.3d 230, 237 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n              The district court adopted the factual statements\n\nfrom    the   PSR     detailing    that     Tobon      recruited       Velez    and\n\nAgudelo, paid for their hotel room, and directed Agudelo in\n\nhis dealings with the agents for the purchase of the 50\n\nkilograms      of    cocaine.       Tobon    did       not    object    to   these\n\nassertions in the PSR, and he is therefore foreclosed from\n\ncontesting them on appeal.            See United States v. Morillo, 8\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fF.3d 864, 872-73 (1st Cir. 1993) (“A defendant who accepts\n\nthe probation department’s configuration of the sentencing\n\nrecord without contesting the facts set forth in the PSI\n\nReport can scarcely be heard to complain when the sentencing\n\ncourt uses those facts in making its findings”).                    On these\n\nfacts, we conclude that the district court did not clearly\n\nerr in applying the leadership enhancement.\n\n            Tobon argues, for the first time on appeal, that\n\nAgudelo and Velez’s statements that they were recruited by\n\nTobon     are    untrustworthy,        as    Agudelo       and   Velez    were\n\ncooperating          defendants,      and    their     statements         were\n\nuncorroborated.         We review arguments not raised below only\n\nfor plain error.        United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263,\n\n272 (1st Cir. 2001).          We find no plain error in the district\n\ncourt’s decision to credit Velez’s and Agudelo’s statements\n\nthat they were recruited by Tobon.\n\n            Tobon received a two-level enhancement to his base\n\noffense     level     for     obstruction    of    justice,      pursuant   to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 based upon the district court’s finding that\n\nTobon threatened his co-defendant Paola Velez.                   Tobon argues\n\nfor   the   first      time    on   appeal   that    the    district     court\n\nerroneously relied upon insufficient evidence, namely, the\n\nstatement       of   another     individual       charged    with   a    crime\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcontained within an FBI report.      Tobon fails to acknowledge,\n\nhowever, that in addition to providing the court with the FBI\n\nreport, the government had the witness whose statement was\n\nmemorialized in the report available to testify at sentencing\n\nas to the threats Tobon asked her to convey to Velez.        The\n\ngovernment proffered what the witness would testify to, and\n\nTobon did not object to this recitation, or even request that\n\nthe witness actually testify.\n\n            Arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial\n\ncourt may not be raised for the first time in an appellate\n\ncontext.    United States v. Graciana, 61 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).     Even if this court were to review Tobon’s argument\n\nfor plain error, see Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d at 272 (reviewing\n\nobjections not made at the time of sentencing for plain\n\nerror), the claim fails.      A sentencing court may rely upon\n\nhearsay    evidence   to   justify   an   obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement, so long as it appears reliable.         See United\n\nStates v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 1991).      In this\n\ncase, the statement has reasonable indicia of reliability,\n\nas it was corroborated by Velez’s report that she had been\n\ntold about Tobon’s threats and by Velez’s actions in twice\n\nseeking to relocate out of fear for her safety.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f            Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err\n\nin relying upon the FBI report or the government’s proffer\n\nin making its factual finding that Tobon had threatened\n\nVelez.     Furthermore, we see nothing confusing or ambiguous\n\nabout the alleged threat.\n\n            The Government’s Motion for Summary Disposition is\n\ngranted.    Tobon’s sentence is affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f",
