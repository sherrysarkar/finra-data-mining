Plaintiff  Laroy Cox challenges a district\r                    Per Curiam.  \r                              \r\n\ncourt ruling denying relief from  a judgment dismissing his claim\r\n\nfor damages against the City of Boston and various members of its\r\n\npolice  department.  See 42 U.S.C.    1983; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 12,\r                                  \r\n\n  11I.  The  claim arose  out of Cox's  interrogation during  the\r\n\nBoston Police investigation of  the Carol Stewart homicide.   The\r\n\nprincipal thrust of the Cox appeal is that counsel for defendants\r\n\nfailed  to produce  some 900  pages of  material from  the Boston\r\n\nPolice Department  Internal Affairs  Division (\"IAD\")  which were\r\n\nproperly requested  during pretrial  discovery.  As  the district\r\n\ncourt  did not  abuse its  discretion, see  Anderson v.  Cryovac,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 62 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir. 1988), we affirm. \r              \r\n\n          The  record  discloses that  Cox's  counsel knew,  well\r\n\nbefore trial, that  the IAD  files existed; in  fact, counsel  so\r\n\nconceded in  the motion for  reconsideration filed below.   More-\r\n\nover,  in a  pretrial letter  mailed June  1, 1995,  the City  of\r\n\nBoston offered to provide the IAD files to Cox's counsel, but the\r\n\noffer was  declined.  Thus, Cox  has not explained  how the prof-\r\n\nfered IAD  files can have been evidence  \"newly discovered\" after\r\n\nthe entry of judgment, let alone evidence not discoverable in the\r\n\nexercise of due diligence.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \r                                         \r\n\n          Cox nonetheless contends that  his Rule 60(b)(2) motion\r\n\nshould have been granted because  defendants had an ongoing  duty\r\n\nto supplement their  discovery responses.   See Fed.  R. Civ.  P.\r                                                         \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n26(e).1  This  contention reduces  to a claim  that a  responding\r\n\nparty's  alleged failure  to supplement  its document  production\r\n\nexcuses the proponent of a Rule 60(b)(2) motion  from demonstrat-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Rule 26(e) provides as follows: \r\n\n          \"(e) Supplementation of  Disclosures and  Re-\r                         Supplementation of  Disclosures and  Re-\r\n          sponses.   A party who has  made a disclosure\r                    sponses\r\n          under subdivision (a) or  responded to a  re-\r\n          quest  for  discovery  with a  disclosure  or\r\n          response  is under  a duty  to supplement  or\r\n          correct the disclosure or response to include\r\n          information thereafter acquired if ordered by\r\n          the court or in the following circumstances:\r\n                    (1) A party is under a duty to\r\n               supplement at appropriate intervals\r\n               its  disclosures under  subdivision\r\n               (a)  if  the party  learns  that in\r\n               some material  respect the informa-\r\n               tion  disclosed  is  incomplete  or\r\n               incorrect and if the  additional or\r\n               corrective   information  has   not\r\n               otherwise  been  made known  to the\r\n               other parties  during the discovery\r\n               process  or in  writing.

This contention  not only  lacks case\r\n\nsupport,  but runs directly counter to the plain language of Rule\r\n\n60(b)(2),  requiring a showing by the movant that the evidence in\r\n\nquestion  was  \"newly  discovered  [and]  by  due  diligence  [on\r\n\nmovant's part] could not have been discovered in time to move for\r\n\na new trial under  Rule 59(b) . . . .\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).\r\n\nAs Cox's counsel  knew of the existence of the  IAD files, and in\r\n\nthe exercise of  due diligence could  have discovered their  con-\r\n\ntents as well, we reject the Rule 60(b)(2) claim as frivolous. \r\n\n          Cox fares no better  with his Rule 60(b)(3) claim.   As\r\n\nhe  did not  move to  compel production  of the  IAD  files after\r\n\ndefendants objected to their  production,2 defendants were  never\r                                                                           \r\n\nobligated to produce them.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(2)(B).  The\r                                         \r\n\ntrial  transcript  plainly  indicates  that  defendants  made  no\r\n\nmisrepresentations or  misleading  statements regarding  the  IAD\r\n\nfiles.  Rather, defendants represented  to Cox's counsel at trial\r\n\nthat he had been provided with  the entire homicide file.3  Given\r                                                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2On January 13, 1994, defendants City of Boston  and Francis\r\nRoache  objected to  Cox's pretrial  request  to produce  the IAD\r\nfiles, based on a Sept. 20, 1993 stay order issued  by the Massa-\r\nchusetts  Appeals Court in Globe Newspaper Co. v. Police Cmm'r of\r                                                                           \r\nthe City of Boston. \r                            \r\n\n     3At trial,  Cox's counsel moved  to compel production  of an\r\neleven-page statement  by Detective O'Malley.   The next  day the\r\nCity of Boston produced the document and stated that it \"came out\r\nof the  Internal Affairs file  of the Boston  Police department.\"\r\nCox's counsel neither asked  about the rest of the  IAD file, nor\r\ninquired whether it contained other documents. \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat counsel for the City of Boston had made a  pretrial offer on\r\n\nJune 1, 1995, to  produce all IAD files,4 this  written notifica-\r\n\ntion substantially met its obligations under Rule 26(e), see Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Civ. P. 26(e)(2) (\"A party is under a duty seasonably to amend\r\n\na prior response to [a] . . . request for production . . . if the\r\n\nadditional or corrective information  has not otherwise been made\r                                                                           \r\n\nknown to the  other parties  during the discovery  process or  in\r                                                                           \r\n\nwriting.\") (emphasis added).  Having spurned the City of Boston's\r                 \r\n\noffer to  produce the  IAD files,  Cox cannot  plausibly maintain\r\n\nthat the district  court abused its  discretion in rejecting  his\r\n\nbelated  request for  relief from  judgment.

See 42 U.S.C.    1983; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 12,\r                                  \r\n\n  11I.  The  claim arose  out of Cox's  interrogation during  the\r\n\nBoston Police investigation of  the Carol Stewart homicide.   The\r\n\nprincipal thrust of the Cox appeal is that counsel for defendants\r\n\nfailed  to produce  some 900  pages of  material from  the Boston\r\n\nPolice Department  Internal Affairs  Division (\"IAD\")  which were\r\n\nproperly requested  during pretrial  discovery.  As  the district\r\n\ncourt  did not  abuse its  discretion, see  Anderson v.  Cryovac,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 923 (1st Cir. 1988), we affirm. \r              \r\n\n          The  record  discloses that  Cox's  counsel knew,  well\r\n\nbefore trial, that  the IAD  files existed; in  fact, counsel  so\r\n\nconceded in  the motion for  reconsideration filed below.   More-\r\n\nover,  in a  pretrial letter  mailed June  1, 1995,  the City  of\r\n\nBoston offered to provide the IAD files to Cox's counsel, but the\r\n\noffer was  declined.  Thus, Cox  has not explained  how the prof-\r\n\nfered IAD  files can have been evidence  \"newly discovered\" after\r\n\nthe entry of judgment, let alone evidence not discoverable in the\r\n\nexercise of due diligence.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).  \r                                         \r\n\n          Cox nonetheless contends that  his Rule 60(b)(2) motion\r\n\nshould have been granted because  defendants had an ongoing  duty\r\n\nto supplement their  discovery responses.   See Fed.  R. Civ.

This contention  not only  lacks case\r\n\nsupport,  but runs directly counter to the plain language of Rule\r\n\n60(b)(2),  requiring a showing by the movant that the evidence in\r\n\nquestion  was  \"newly  discovered  [and]  by  due  diligence  [on\r\n\nmovant's part] could not have been discovered in time to move for\r\n\na new trial under  Rule 59(b) . . . .\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2).\r\n\nAs Cox's counsel  knew of the existence of the  IAD files, and in\r\n\nthe exercise of  due diligence could  have discovered their  con-\r\n\ntents as well, we reject the Rule 60(b)(2) claim as frivolous. \r\n\n          Cox fares no better  with his Rule 60(b)(3) claim.   As\r\n\nhe  did not  move to  compel production  of the  IAD  files after\r\n\ndefendants objected to their  production,2 defendants were  never\r                                                                           \r\n\nobligated to produce them.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(2)(B).  The\r                                         \r\n\ntrial  transcript  plainly  indicates  that  defendants  made  no\r\n\nmisrepresentations or  misleading  statements regarding  the  IAD\r\n\nfiles.  Rather, defendants represented  to Cox's counsel at trial\r\n\nthat he had been provided with  the entire homicide file.3  Given\r                                                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2On January 13, 1994, defendants City of Boston  and Francis\r\nRoache  objected to  Cox's pretrial  request  to produce  the IAD\r\nfiles, based on a Sept. 20, 1993 stay order issued  by the Massa-\r\nchusetts  Appeals Court in Globe Newspaper Co. v. Police Cmm'r of\r                                                                           \r\nthe City of Boston. \r                            \r\n\n     3At trial,  Cox's counsel moved  to compel production  of an\r\neleven-page statement  by Detective O'Malley.   The next  day the\r\nCity of Boston produced the document and stated that it \"came out\r\nof the  Internal Affairs file  of the Boston  Police department.\"\r\nCox's counsel neither asked  about the rest of the  IAD file, nor\r\ninquired whether it contained other documents. \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat counsel for the City of Boston had made a  pretrial offer on\r\n\nJune 1, 1995, to  produce all IAD files,4 this  written notifica-\r\n\ntion substantially met its obligations under Rule 26(e), see Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Civ. P. 26(e)(2) (\"A party is under a duty seasonably to amend\r\n\na prior response to [a] . . . request for production . . . if the\r\n\nadditional or corrective information  has not otherwise been made\r                                                                           \r\n\nknown to the  other parties  during the discovery  process or  in\r                                                                           \r\n\nwriting.\") (emphasis added).  Having spurned the City of Boston's\r                 \r\n\noffer to  produce the  IAD files,  Cox cannot  plausibly maintain\r\n\nthat the district  court abused its  discretion in rejecting  his\r\n\nbelated  request for  relief from  judgment.
