Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Richard Wilkes on brief pro se.\r\n Donald E. Gardner, John P. Sherman, and Devine, Millimet &amp;\r\nBranch on brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 21, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  We have carefully reviewed the record in\r\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties.  Except as to\r\nthe disposition of the pendent claims, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the dismissal of this case.  \r\n          Several factors support the decision to dismiss this\r\ncase, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).  First, plaintiff\r\nviolated an explicit court order by failing to file a response\r\nto defendants' motion to dismiss.  See Figueroa Ruiz v.\r\nAlegria, 896 F.2d 645, 647 (1st Cir. 1990).  Moreover, this\r\ndisobedience occurred after the district court had shown\r\nsensitivity to plaintiff's pro se status by extending the time\r\nfor filing a response and explaining exactly why the previous\r\nresponse was inadequate.  See Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d\r\n1258, 1261 (9th Cir.) (upholding dismissal where court had\r\nshown similar \"sensitivity\" to a pro se plaintiff's inadequate\r\ncomplaint), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 915 (1992).  \r\n          Second, dismissal occurred only after plaintiff had\r\nbeen explicitly warned of the consequences of his failure to\r\nobey the court order.  See Figueroa Ruiz, 896 F.2d at 547.\r\n          Third, our review of the record convinces us that\r\nplaintiff's case, at least in regard to its federal claims,\r\nsuffers from \"glaring weaknesses.\"  Id.  For example, insofar\r\nas any of plaintiff's constitutional claims are not time\r\nbarred, they are barred by the existence of adequate state\r\nremedies for inverse condemnation and conversion.  See Culebras\r\nEnterprises Corp. v. Rivera Rios, 813 F.2d 506, 512-13 (1st\r\nCir. 1987) (adequate state remedies bar just compensation\r\nclaim); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984) (deprivation\r\nof property).  Plaintiff also fails to allege any \"enduring\r\ncriminal conduct\" sufficient to sustain his RICO claim.  SeeFeinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 45 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (RICO claim requires allegation either that predicate\r\nacts extended more than a few weeks or that a realistic threat\r\nof continued criminal activity exists).\r\n          A final factor supporting dismissal in this case is\r\nthe need to flush out at any early stage meritless RICO and\r\ncivil rights claims since the mere assertion of these claims\r\noften has a \"stigmatizing effect on those named as defendants.\" \r\nFigueroa Ruiz, 896 F.2d at 650; see also Dartmouth Review v.\r\nDartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989) (unfounded\r\ncivil rights actions may \"tar[] defendant's reputation\r\nunfairly\"). \r\n          For all the above reason, the district court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in dismissing plaintiff's federal claims. \r\nHowever, the court order appears to dismiss with prejudice\r\nplaintiff's pendent state claims as well.  This court has held\r\nit preferable to dismiss pendent state claims for want of\r\njurisdiction.  Figueroa Ruiz, 896 F.2d at 650.\r\n          As to the federal claims, the judgment of dismissal\r\nis affirmed.  \r\n          As to the pendent claims, the judgment is vacated and\r\nthe case remanded with directions to enter a judgment\r\ndismissing the pendent claims without prejudice.\r\n",
