FREDYMA,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                LAKE SUNAPEE BANK, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n        [Hon. Shane Devine, Senior District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Jack T. Fredyma on brief pro se.\r\n Michael D. Ramsdell and Gallagher, Callahan &amp; Gartrell, P.A.on brief for appellee Lake Sunapee Bank.\r\n Loretta C. Argrett, Assistant Attorney General, William S.\r\nEstabrook and Pamela C. Berry, Attorneys, Department of Justice and\r\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, on brief for the appellees,\r\nUnited States of America, United States Department of Treasury, and\r\nInternal Revenue Service.\r\n\nNovember 3, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Plaintiff-appellant Jack Fredyma appeals\r\npro se from the dismissal of his claims against various federal\r\ndefendants (the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of\r\nTreasury, and the United States) and the grant of summary\r\njudgment in favor defendant Lake Sunapee Bank (formerly\r\nLandmark Bank).  We affirm.\r\n          The underlying action stems from a levy placed by the\r\nInternal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") on a Landmark Bank account\r\ncontaining a certificate of deposit under the names of Fredyma\r\nand his mother.  The bank honored the levy by withdrawing\r\n$9,338.00 from the account and sending the money to the IRS. \r\nFor the purposes of this appeal, it is assumed by all parties\r\nthat the funds in the account derive from two lump sum workers'\r\ncompensation payments to Fredyma totaling approximately\r\n$100,000.00.\r\n          Fredyma contends that the bank account was immune\r\nfrom levy under 26 U.S.C.  6334(a)(7) (exempting from levy any\r\namount \"payable\" to an individual as workmen's compensation). \r\nThis contention lies at the heart of a five count complaint\r\nfiled against defendants on September 17, 1996.  Three of these\r\ncounts are at issue on appeal:  Count I alleges wrongful levy\r\nby the IRS, Count II alleges reckless and intentional violation\r\nof 26 U.S.C.  6334(a)(7) by IRS officials, and Count V alleges\r\nthat the bank violated state law in honoring the levy.  \r\n          Fredyma's complaint indicates that he filed several\r\n\"administrative complaints\"  protesting  the  levy  prior  to\r\n                             -2-\r\ninitiating the instant lawsuit.  The IRS allegedly responded,\r\ninter alia, that workers' compensation benefits are not exempt\r\nfrom levy upon deposit in a bank account.  In the district\r\ncourt, both the federal defendants and the bank took the\r\nposition that the funds at issue were not immune from levy.\r\n          The district court dismissed Count I for lack of\r\njurisdiction.  In particular, the court concluded that Count\r\nII, which alleges a cause of action under 26 U.S.C.  7433, is\r\nthe only claim as to which the United States has waived its\r\nsovereign immunity.  Fredyma has made no persuasive argument\r\notherwise on appeal, and we conclude that Count I was properly\r\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \r\n          The district court entered judgment in favor of the\r\ndefendants on Counts II and V after concluding that the funds\r\nat issue were not exempt from levy.  Noting that the issue is\r\none of first impression, the lower court concluded that the\r\nplain meaning of \"payable\" in  6334(a)(7) applies to an amount\r\nto be paid or capable of being paid but not money that has\r\nalready been paid.  Fredyma challenges this interpretation, and\r\nhe points to legislative history which, he contends, indicates\r\nthat Congress intended to protect monies paid.  See H.R. Rep.\r\nNo. 89-1884, at 61 (1996); S.R. No. 89-1708, at 19 (1966),\r\nreprinted in 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3722, 3741.\r\n          We affirm the dismissal of Count II on an alternative\r\nbasis than that given by the district court.  By its terms, 26\r\nU.S.C.  7433(a) permits the recovery of damages against the\r\ngovernment only for \"reckless[]\" or \"intentional[]\" disregard\r\nof an Internal Revenue Code provision.  Where, as here, the\r\nIRS's interpretation of the Code is, at the very least,\r\nreasonable, no action lies under  7433.  Cf. United States v.\r\nToyoto of Visalia, 772 F. Supp. 481, 492 (E.D.Cal. 1991)\r\n(indicating that it is not the intent of  7433 that \"any time\r\nan officer of the IRS makes a mistake or simply does not agree\r\nwith a particular interpretation of the law, the United States\r\nis liable for damages\"), aff'd, 988 F.2d 126 (1993).  In so\r\nholding, we express no opinion as to whether or not the IRS is\r\ncorrect in its interpretation.\r\n          We also affirm the dismissal of Count V on an\r\nalternative basis.  Contrary to Fredyma's suggestion, we\r\nconclude that 26 U.S.C.  6332(e) protects the bank from any\r\nliability arising from the surrender of the property.  The\r\nNinth Circuit opinion relied upon by Fredyma, Farr v. United\r\nStates, 990 F.2d 451 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that an employer\r\nwas not immune from liability to a taxpayer for its improper\r\ntransfer of workers' compensation benefits), is distinguishable\r\non its facts.  In Farr, the IRS never asked the party in\r\npossession to turn over workmen's compensation benefits;\r\nindeed, it eschewed any desire to have the party do so.  Farr,\r\n990 F.2d at 457.  By contrast, in the instant case the IRS\r\nlevied on the very property in question. \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
