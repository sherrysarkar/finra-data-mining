Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Ronald B. Eskin on brief for appellant.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Anita Johnson,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 26, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Claimant Nguyen applied for social\r\nsecurity disability benefits after injuring his back at work in\r\nJanuary, 1993.  Following a March, 1995 hearing, an\r\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) found that although claimant's\r\nsevere lumbar and cervical disc-disease prevented him from\r\nreturning to his vocation of welder-carpenter, he retained the\r\nfunctional capacity for sedentary work and exhibited no\r\nsignificant exertional or non-exertional impairments.  The ALJ\r\nthen applied the Medical Vocation Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part\r\n404, Subpart P, Appendix 2 (the Grid), to find that the\r\nnational economy offered claimant substantial employment; ergo,\r\nhe was not disabled.  The Appeals Council and the district\r\ncourt sustained the decision, whereupon claimant appealed to\r\nthis court.  Claimant argues that the ALJ erred in assessing\r\nhis residual functional capacity by ignoring medical evidence,\r\nsubstituting his judgment for that of medical professionals and\r\nimproperly discounting the opinion of a treating physician.   \r\nWe agree.  We vacate the judgment of the district court with\r\ninstructions to remand for further proceedings.\r\n                         I.  \r\n                                 The record shows that claimant was initially\r\ndiagnosed by an occupational health clinic with acute lower-\r\nback strain.  Despite prescribed rest and medication, he soon\r\nexperienced peripheral numbness and radiating pain, triggering\r\na series of diagnostic tests.  In February, the clinic ordered\r\na magnetic resonance scan (MRI) which revealed some lumbar-disc\r\ndegeneration and bulging, but no robust herniation.  A follow-\r\nup surgical consultation disclosed no nerve deficits.\r\n   In May, 1993, Neurologist Mahoney, who apparently\r\nassumed primary responsibility for claimant's care, ordered\r\nanother MRI which revealed diffuse narrowing of the lumbar\r\nspine, aggravated by disc disease.  It also revealed central\r\ndisc herniation, although Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Beers, the\r\nperforming radiologist, disagreed about the magnitude of the\r\nherniation.  At any rate, Dr. Mahoney found claimant utterly\r\nincapacitated and referred him to Dr. Selland for a surgical\r\nconsultation.  Upon physical examination, Dr. Selland agreed\r\nthat claimant was incapacitated and scheduled a myelogram.  The\r\ndoctors agreed that the myelogram was unremarkable, precluding\r\nsurgery.\r\n   By August, Dr. Mahoney reported that claimant's\r\ncondition had further deteriorated and he ordered another MRI\r\nto evaluate treatment alternatives.  Dr. Beers reported marked\r\nnarrowing of the lumbar spinal-canal with potential nerve\r\ncompression.  Dr. Mahoney concluded that the MRI revealed a\r\ncongenitally small, lumbar spinal-canal, aggravated by\r\nsecondary disc-protrusions, and that the findings could explain\r\nclaimant's severe symptoms.  In September, 1993, Dr. Beers\r\nperformed a cervical MRI and reported bulging discs with mild\r\npressure on the cervical cord and diffuse narrowing of the\r\ncervical canal, within the lower limits of normal.\r\n   On October 21, 1993, Dr. Mahoney admitted claimant to\r\nthe hospital for 72 hours after he presented with\r\nincapacitating pain.  Dr. Mahoney reported that while claimant\r\nexhibited no major, peripheral, neurological abnormalities, he\r\nwas debilitated by pain attributable to congenital narrowing of\r\nthe lumbar spine, aggravated by bulging discs.  This remained\r\nDr. Mahoney's opinion through the date of his last report,\r\nApril, 1994, despite numerous treatments, including, rest,\r\nmedications, physical therapy, a back-brace and spinal blocks.\r\n                           II.\r\n                                 In the opinion, the ALJ found that claimant had\r\ndischarged his burden of establishing that a severe impairment\r\nprevented him from resuming his former occupation. \r\nAccordingly, the ALJ proceeded to the determination of\r\nclaimant's residual functional capacity.  20 C.F.R.  404.1520\r\nand 404.1561.  Since, following the medical advisor, the ALJ\r\nconceded that claimant's condition was painful, his\r\ndetermination of residual functional capacity had to take into\r\naccount the severity of claimant's pain and the extent to which\r\nit impeded his ability to work.  20 C.F.R.  404.1529(a) and\r\n(b); Da Rosa v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 803\r\nF.2d 24, 25 (1st Cir. 1986).  In making this assessment, the ALJ\r\nwas required to consider evidence in addition to medical tests,\r\nincluding, inter alia, claimant's statements, opinions of\r\ntreating physicians, reports of claimant's activities and\r\nclaimant's course of treatment.  20 C.F.R.  404.1529(c).\r\n   The ALJ found that claimant suffered no significant\r\nexertional or non-exertional impairments which limited his\r\ncapacity to perform the full range of sedentary work.  He\r\nreasoned that the reports of both Dr. Mahoney and claimant\r\nconcerning the severity of claimant's pain and inability to\r\nremain seated were exaggerated.  Specifically, claimant could\r\nsatisfy his need to change position with regularly-scheduled\r\nbreaks.   The ALJ then invoked the Grid to prove that claimant\r\nwas not disabled.\r\n                          III\r\n                                 Our review is limited to determining whether the ALJ\r\ndeployed the proper legal standards and found facts upon the\r\nproper quantum of evidence.  Manso-Pizarro v. Secretary, 76\r\nF.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1996)(per curiam).  The ALJ's findings of\r\nfact are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence, 42\r\nU.S.C.  405(g), but are not conclusive when derived by\r\nignoring evidence, misapplying the law, or judging matters\r\nentrusted to experts.  Da Rosa v. Secretary, 803 F.2d 24, 26\r\n(1st Cir. 1986)(per curiam); Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and\r\nHuman Services, 955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir. 1991).  Employing\r\nthese standards, we hold that errors of law and a dearth of\r\nevidence invalidated the ALJ's finding that claimant retained\r\nthe residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work and\r\nexhibited no significant exertional or non-exertional\r\nimpairments.\r\n   Dr. Mahoney repeatedly rendered the opinion that\r\nclaimant was incapacitated by severe pain.  The ALJ rejected\r\nthe opinion as inconsistent with \"actual findings made on exam\r\nand the degree of treatment needed,\" the lack of \"recent\r\ntreatment,\"   and some unspecified aspect of the entire record. \r\nThis reasoning lacks proper support in the record.  With\r\nrespect to medical findings and treatment, Dr. Mahoney's\r\nultimate opinion that claimant suffered severe pain\r\nattributable to spinal stenosis was uncontroverted.    Although\r\nhis initial May diagnosis of frank herniation may have been\r\ncontroversial, no medical opinion in the record challenged his\r\nultimate diagnosis.    The medical advisor never addressed, nor\r\ndid the ALJ mention, either Dr. Mahoney's ultimate opinion or\r\nthe related August and September MRIs.    Similarly, no medical\r\nopinion in the record suggested that claimant's course of\r\ntreatment was incommensurate with his purported ailment.  The\r\nALJ was not at liberty to ignore medical evidence or substitute\r\nhis own views for uncontroverted medical opinion.  Rose v.\r\nShalala, 34 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 1994); Nieves v. Secretary of\r\nHealth and Human Services, 775 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1985);\r\nSuarez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 740 F.2d 1\r\n(1st Cir. 1984)(per curiam). \r\n   The Commissioner suggests that despite Dr. Mahoney's\r\nopinion, the medical record supported the ALJ's determination\r\nthat claimant was fully capable of performing sedentary work.\r\nAs a lay person, however, the ALJ was simply not qualified to\r\ninterpret raw medical data in functional terms and no medical\r\nopinion supported the determination.  Manso-Pizarro v.\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 76 F.3d 15 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Perez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 958\r\nF.2d 455, 446 (1st Cir. 1991); Berrios Lopez v. Secretary of\r\nHealth and Human Services, 951 F.2d 427 (1st Cir. 1991); Gordilsv. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 921 F.2d 327, 329\r\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\n   The ALJ's grounds for rejecting claimant's own\r\nreports of severe pain and incapacity also lack support in the\r\nrecord.  The ALJ reasoned that claimant's complaints were\r\ninconsistent with his activities and \"the degree of treatment\r\nrequired.\"  Concerning treatment, the record showed that\r\nbetween the date of his injury and April, 1994, claimant\r\ncontinually sought and received treatment for back-pain,\r\nincluding, numerous tests, physical therapy, back-braces,\r\nspinal-blocks, various drug regimes and a hospitalization. \r\nThis was not a case in which a claimant failed to seek\r\ntreatment for symptoms later claimed debilitating.  C.f.,\r\nDupuis v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 869 F.2d 622\r\n(1st Cir. 1989); Perez Torres v. Secretary of Health and Human\r\nServices, 890 F.2d 1251, 1255 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\n   The ALJ also appealed to a discrepancy between\r\nclaimant's alleged inability to remain seated and his admission\r\nthat he drove.  At the hearing, claimant testified that his\r\nchronic neck and back pain prevented him from remaining seated\r\nfor more than an half-hour; he spent his days shifting position\r\nin search of comfort.  After taking medication, he reclined for\r\nseveral hours, sleeping two of those hours.  The record\r\nincluded claimant's December, 1993 request for reconsideration\r\nin which he reported that he had become house-bound, venturing\r\nout only for medical appointments, and could not tie his shoes\r\nor bend.  His wife's help was often necessary to don socks and\r\nslacks and to shower.  To this evidence, the ALJ counterpoised\r\nclaimant's admission that he drove.  The only evidence\r\nconcerning driving appeared in the initial June, 1993,\r\ndisability application, where the unadorned \"I drive\" was\r\nproffered in response to a request for a description of daily\r\nactivities.  The ALJ never asked claimant how much he drove or\r\nasked him about his subsequent driving history.  \r\n   In summary, the ALJ's finding that claimant was\r\ncapable of performing the full range of sedentary work without\r\nany significant impairments was not supported by the record. \r\nAs claimant argues, the error invalidated the ALJ's application\r\nof the Grid to discharge his burden of proving that claimant\r\nwas employable.  Pain can constitute a significant non-\r\nexertional impairment which precludes naked application of the\r\nGrid and requires use of a vocational expert.  Heggarty v.\r\nSullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 995 (1st Cir. 1991);  Burgos Lopez v.\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 747 F.2d 37, 41-42 (1stCir. 1984); Gagnon v. Secretary of Health and Human Services,\r\n666 F.2d 662, 664, 666 n.8 (1st Cir. 1981).  The inability to\r\nremain seated may constitute an exertional impairment which\r\nsignificantly erodes the occupational base for sedentary work\r\nand requires use of additional vocational resources.  Rose v.\r\nShalala, 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1994); Social Security Ruling96-9p, 61 Fed. Reg. 34478 (July 2, 1996)(vocational specialist\r\nmay be required where period between regularly-scheduled breaks\r\nexceeds capacity to remain seated); Social Security Ruling 83-\r\n12 (1983). \r\n                          IV.\r\n                                 We vacate the judgment of the district court and\r\ndirect the district court to remand the case to the\r\nCommissioner for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.  On remand, the ALJ must reassess, after any\r\nproceedings that may be suitable, the severity of claimant's\r\nsymptoms, including his pain and inability to remain seated,\r\ntaking into account the entire record and obtaining any expert\r\nmedical opinion needed to illuminate the medical records.  If\r\nthe ALJ finds, as he may, that any treating physician's opinion\r\nis not credible, then he must comply with the regulations by\r\nexplicating his grounds.  In any event, before simply applying\r\nthe Grid, the ALJ must consider the extent to which claimant's\r\nexertional or non-exertional impairments may compromise his\r\nability to perform sedentary work and utilize appropriate\r\nvocational resources.\r\n   Vacated and remanded.\n",

The ALJ reasoned that claimant's complaints were\r\ninconsistent with his activities and \"the degree of treatment\r\nrequired.\"  Concerning treatment, the record showed that\r\nbetween the date of his injury and April, 1994, claimant\r\ncontinually sought and received treatment for back-pain,\r\nincluding, numerous tests, physical therapy, back-braces,\r\nspinal-blocks, various drug regimes and a hospitalization. \r\nThis was not a case in which a claimant failed to seek\r\ntreatment for symptoms later claimed debilitating.

At the hearing, claimant testified that his\r\nchronic neck and back pain prevented him from remaining seated\r\nfor more than an half-hour; he spent his days shifting position\r\nin search of comfort.  After taking medication, he reclined for\r\nseveral hours, sleeping two of those hours.  The record\r\nincluded claimant's December, 1993 request for reconsideration\r\nin which he reported that he had become house-bound, venturing\r\nout only for medical appointments, and could not tie his shoes\r\nor bend.  His wife's help was often necessary to don socks and\r\nslacks and to shower.  To this evidence, the ALJ counterpoised\r\nclaimant's admission that he drove.  The only evidence\r\nconcerning driving appeared in the initial June, 1993,\r\ndisability application, where the unadorned \"I drive\" was\r\nproffered in response to a request for a description of daily\r\nactivities.  The ALJ never asked claimant how much he drove or\r\nasked him about his subsequent driving history.  \r\n   In summary, the ALJ's finding that claimant was\r\ncapable of performing the full range of sedentary work without\r\nany significant impairments was not supported by the record. \r\nAs claimant argues, the error invalidated the ALJ's application\r\nof the Grid to discharge his burden of proving that claimant\r\nwas employable.  Pain can constitute a significant non-\r\nexertional impairment which precludes naked application of the\r\nGrid and requires use of a vocational expert.
