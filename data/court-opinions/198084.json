COFSKE,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Mark W. Griffin on brief for appellant.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Donald L. Cabell,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 3, 1998\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we find no need for oral argument and no reason to\r\ndisturb defendant's sentence:   \r\n          1.   For U.S.S.G.  5G1.3 purposes, an undischarged\r\nterm of probation is not an \"undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment.\"  Prewitt v. United States, 83 F.3d 812, 817-18\r\n(7th Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1,\r\n2 (1st Cir. 1995).  Therefore, defendant's ongoing probation in\r\nVirginia did not entitle him to credit for his discharged\r\nVirginia prison term.  The district court did not commit error,\r\nplain or otherwise, in that regard.\r\n          2.   Contrary to defendant's argument, the district\r\ncourt sufficiently identified the grounds for the U.S.S.G. \r\n2K2.1(b)(5) increase:  defendant \"certainly had reason to\r\nbelieve once he was transferring weapons in the middle of the\r\nnight surreptitiously that those weapons were going to be used\r\nin yet another felony,\" and the adjustment was awarded \"because\r\nin [the court's] opinion the defendant had reason to believe\r\nthat the weapons that he sold would be used or possessed in\r\nconnection with another felony.\"  Further, there was a\r\nsufficient factual basis for that increase, given the\r\ninferences reasonably to be drawn from the circumstances of the\r\nsurreptitious transfer of the guns for illegal drugs and money. \r\nAnd, as defendant was aware of the guidelines and the facts\r\nrelevant to his sentence, and the pre-sentence report\r\nspecifically alerted him to the potential for an increase under\r\n 2K2.1(b)(5), no additional notice was required of the\r\ndistrict court's particular intention in that regard.  SeeUnited States v. Canada, 960 F.2d 263, 266-67 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\n          3.   No plain error appears as to the two points\r\nadded to defendant's criminal history score based on his bail\r\nlaw violations.  Even if defendant's new dispute about the 1992\r\nbail law violation had any merit, there is no dispute that the\r\n1990 violation itself warranted two points.  There is no\r\nindication that the 1990 bail violation was counted twice. \r\nAccordingly, we conclude that the two points properly were\r\nadded, whatever the status of the 1992 violation. \r\n          4.   Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel is not cognizable in this direct appeal.  If defendant\r\nbelieves that he has a viable claim, he may raise it in a\r\nmotion under 28 U.S.C.  2255.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
