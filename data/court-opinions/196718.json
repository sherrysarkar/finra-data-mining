We affirm in both\r\n\ncases.\r\n\n          Thomas was, concededly,  a \"career offender\"  under\r\n\n 4B1.1  of  the Sentencing  Guidelines,  which  prescribed an\r\n\noffense  level of 37.   The court  granted him  a three level\r\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility, under  3E1.1, for\r\n\na total  adjusted  offense  level  of  34,  which  yielded  a\r\n\nguideline sentencing  range of  262-327 months.   Pursuant to\r\n\n 5K1.1  of the  Guidelines, the  government recommended  a 20\r\n\npercent departure below  the low end of  the guideline range,\r\n\nbased on  Thomas' forthright cooperation.   The court agreed,\r\n\nsentencing Thomas to 204 months, or 17 years, as recommended.\r\n\n          Thomas  sought  a  further  downward  departure for\r\n\nhaving had an allegedly  minor role in the conspiracy,  which\r\n\nthe court denied.  He claims the court incorrectly ruled that\r\n\nit  had  no  authority  to  depart  from  a  career  offender\r\n\nguideline range on the  basis of a relatively lesser  role in\r\n\nthe offense.   Where the court's departure  decision may have\r\n\nbeen affected by a mistaken view of the law,  it falls within\r\n\nour  jurisdiction to review, de  novo.  See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWebster,  54  F.3d 1,  4 (1st  Cir.  1995); United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                   \r\n\n          Thomas  stakes  his  claim  on   5H1.7,   a  policy\r\n\nstatement that  \"defendant's role in the  offense is relevant\r\n\nin determining  the appropriate  sentence,\"  which refers  to\r\n\nChapter  Three, Part  B (Role  in the  Offense).   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.2  (allowing  downward adjustment  to  offense\r\n\nlevel  for mitigating  role).1   We garner  little  from this\r\n\ngeneral truism  that establishes  authority to depart  on the\r\n\nbasis  of a defendant's role.   Especially should  this be so\r\n\nwhen it is  not found in  Part K of  Chapter Five, where  the\r\n\npermitted  bases for  departure are delineated.   Unspecified\r\n\ndepartures  are  of course  allowed,  but  only where  \"there\r\n\nexists an  aggravating or mitigating circumstance  of a kind,\r\n\nor to  a degree, not  adequately taken into  consideration by\r\n\nthe  Sentencing Commission  in  formulating the  guidelines.\"\r\n\n 5K2.0;  18 U.S.C.   3553(b).   Role-in-the-offense  has been\r\n\namply considered,  see generally U.S.S.G.  Ch.3, and downward\r                                            \r\n\nadjustment for both  \"minor\" and \"minimal\"  role specifically\r\n\nprovided for.  See   3B1.2 and comment. (n.1  and 2).   Thus,\r                              \r\n\nunless a  defendant's role  falls outside the  \"heartland\" of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Over  Thomas'  objection, the  court  ruled  that he  was\r\nineligible for a downward adjustment under  3B1.2 because the\r\ncareer offender guideline allows but a single adjustment, for\r\nacceptance  of  responsibility,  pursuant  to   3E1.1.    See\r                                                                         \r\n 4B1.1;  United States v. McCoy,  23 F.3d 216,  218 (9th Cir.\r                                           \r\n1994).   By way of  a footnote, Thomas  continues to register\r\nhis  disagreement,  but  forgoes  briefing  the  issue.    We\r\ntherefore deem it waived.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncases covered by this  provision \"in a way that  is important\r\n\nto   the  statutory  purposes   of  sentencing,\"   5K2.0  and\r\n\ncomment., departure  is foreclosed.2   Thomas makes  no claim\r\n\nthat his does; nor do we believe he successfully could, given\r\n\nthe unequivocally  stated statutory  purpose to \"assure  that\r\n\ncertain career  offenders receive a sentence  of imprisonment\r\n\nat  or  near  the  maximum  term  authorized  [by  statute].\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    4B1.1,  comment.  (backg'd)   (citing  28  U.S.C.\r\n\n  994(h))  (internal quotations omitted).   See United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Norflett,  922  F.2d 50,  53  (1st  Cir. 1990)  (Congress\r                        \r\n\nintended there to be \"precious little room to maneuver\" below\r\n\nthe statutory maximum for career offenders).  Unsurprisingly,\r\n\nthen,  we find little regard  in the Guidelines  for a career\r\n\noffender's  relative  role  in  his latest  enterprise.    In\r\n\naccordance  with  congressional   directive,  see  28  U.S.C.\r                                                             \r\n\n  994(h),  the  career  offender  provision  \"focuses on  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Thomas claims United States v. Valdez-Gonzalez, 957  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n643  (9th Cir.  1992),  stands  for  the  contrary.    There,\r\ndownward adjustment under   3B1.2 was also  inapplicable, not\r\nbecause defendants were  career offenders,  but because  they\r\nwere each the only participants in the offenses to which they\r\npled guilty.  Id.  at 648.  In nonetheless  allowing downward\r                             \r\ndeparture  for  minimal  role,   the  court  ruled  that  the\r\nSentencing Commission had  not adequately considered relative\r\nrole  in a criminal  scheme extending  beyond the  offense at\r                                                         \r\nhand, permitting a  5K2.0  departure where each defendant was\r\nbut a \"mule\"  in a  much larger criminal  operation than  the\r\nsingle substantive offense he  committed.  Id. at 650.   Role\r                                                          \r\nin a scheme  beyond the  conspiracy charged is  not at  issue\r\nhere, and Valdez-Gonzalez is  of questionable validity in any\r                                     \r\nevent.   See United States v. Webster, 996 F.2d 209, 211 (9th\r                                                 \r\nCir. 1993).\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nrecurrence of offenses  rather than on  the specifics of  the\r\n\nmost  recent offense.\"  United States v. Richardson, 923 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n13, 16\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n(2d Cir. 1991).  Thus, even properly construed as a claim for\r\n\ndeparture under  5K2.0, Thomas' pitch falls short.\r\n\n          Lisa  Booth  faced   a  20-year  mandatory  minimum\r\n\nsentence, based  on a  prior  felony drug  offense, under  21\r\n\nU.S.C.    841(b)(1)(A).   Upon the  government's  motion, the\r\n\ncourt  halved her  sentence for  cooperation and  substantial\r\n\nassistance.  See U.S.S.G.  5K1.1.  She complains, first, that\r                            \r\n\nthe  court took the 20-year mandatory minimum as its point of\r\n\ndeparture, rather  than the  guideline range  of  100 to  125\r\n\nmonths  calculated  from  her  offense  level  and   criminal\r\n\nhistory.   Had the  court ignored the  statutory minimum  and\r\n\ninstead taken the calculated range as the guideline sentence,\r\n\nits departure  would have produced a sentence  closer to five\r\n\nyears.   The simple answer  is that under  the Guidelines, \"a\r\n\nstatutorily required minimum sentence . . .  greater than the\r\n\nmaximum of the  applicable guideline range . . . shall be the\r                                                                  \r\n\nguideline  sentence.\"   U.S.S.G.  5G1.1(b)  (emphasis added).\r\n\nThe remainder  of her complaint  quibbles with the  extent of\r\n\nthe court's departure, over which we  lack jurisdiction.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

Thus, even properly construed as a claim for departure under &#167; 5K2.0, Thomas' pitch falls short.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lisa Booth faced a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence, based on a prior felony drug offense, under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).  Upon the government's motion, the court halved her sentence for cooperation and substantial assistance.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.  She complains, first, that the court took the 20-year mandatory minimum as its point of departure, rather than the guideline range of 100 to 125 months calculated from her offense level and criminal history.  Had the court ignored the statutory minimum and instead taken the calculated range as the guideline sentence, its departure would have produced a sentence closer to five years.  The simple answer is that under the Guidelines, \"a statutorily required minimum sentence ... greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range ... shall be the guideline sentence.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.1(b) (emphasis added).  The remainder of her complaint quibbles with the extent of the court's departure, over which we lack jurisdiction.  See United States v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Over Thomas' objection, the court ruled that he was ineligible for a downward adjustment under &#167; 3B1.2 because the career offender guideline allows but a single adjustment, for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to &#167; 3E1.1.

There, downward adjustment under &#167; 3B1.2 was also inapplicable, not because defendants were career offenders, but because they were each the only participants in the offenses to which they pled guilty.  Id. at 648.  In nonetheless allowing downward departure for minimal role, the court ruled that the Sentencing Commission had not adequately considered relative role in a criminal scheme extending beyond the offense at hand, permitting a &#167; 5K2.0 departure where each defendant was but a \"mule\" in a much larger criminal operation than the single substantive offense he committed.  Id. at 650.  Role in a scheme beyond the conspiracy charged is not at issue here, and Valdez-Gonzalez is of questionable validity in any event.  See United States v.

The court granted him a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under &#167; 3E1.1, for a total adjusted offense level of 34, which yielded a guideline sentencing range of 262-327 months.  Pursuant to &#167; 5K1.1 of the Guidelines, the government recommended a 20 percent departure below the low end of the guideline range, based on Thomas' forthright cooperation.  The court agreed, sentencing Thomas to 204 months, or 17 years, as recommended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas sought a further downward departure for having had an allegedly minor role in the conspiracy, which the court denied.  He claims the court incorrectly ruled that it had no authority to depart from a career offender guideline range on the basis of a relatively lesser role in the offense.  Where the court's departure decision may have been affected by a mistaken view of the law, it falls within our jurisdiction to review, de novo.  See United States v. Webster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196037\"><a href=\"/opinion/196037/united-states-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

See, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2 (allowing downward adjustment to offense level for mitigating role).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We garner little from this general truism that establishes authority to depart on the basis of a defendant's role.  Especially should this be so when it is not found in Part K of Chapter Five, where the permitted bases for departure are delineated.  Unspecified departures are of course allowed, but only where \"there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\"  &#167;  5K2.0;  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b).  Role-in-the-offense has been amply considered, see generally U.S.S.G. Ch.3, and downward adjustment for both \"minor\" and \"minimal\" role specifically provided for.  See &#167; 3B1.2 and comment.  (n.1 and 2).  Thus, unless a defendant's role falls outside the \"heartland\" of cases covered by this provision \"in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing,\" &#167; 5K2.0 and comment., departure is foreclosed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Thomas makes no claim that his does;  nor do we believe he successfully could, given the unequivocally stated statutory purpose to \"assure that certain career offenders receive a sentence of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized [by statute].\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, comment.  (backg'd) (citing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h)) (internal quotations omitted).  See United States v.

Unsurprisingly, then, we find little regard in the Guidelines for a career offender's relative role in his latest enterprise.
