William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nKeeton and McAuliffe, District Judges.\r\n\nMorris M. Goldings with whom Richard S. Jacobs and Mahoney,\r\nHawkes &amp; Goldings were on brief for appellant.\r\nBrien T. O'Connor, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 10, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Simon Firestone and Aqua-Leisure Industries,\r\nInc., 85 percent of which is owned by Firestone, pled guilty on\r\nOctober 23, 1996, to numerous counts of campaign finance law\r\nviolations.  See 2 U.S.C.  441(f), 437g(d), and 441(a)(1).  At the\r\nsame time, the defendants presented separate binding plea\r\nagreements entered into with the government.  Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n11(e)(1)(C).  It appears, and certainly is not disputed, that the\r\nrecommended sentences were well below what could have been imposed\r\nunder the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\r\nUnder Firestone's written plea agreement, he agreed to\r\npay a fine of $1 million and serve six months of confinement;\r\nwhether the confinement was to be at home or in federal prison was\r\na disputed issue reserved for the judge.  As for Aqua-Leisure, its\r\nwritten plea agreement provided that it would pay a fine of $5\r\nmillion.  The government also agreed to drop many of the counts\r\nagainst Firestone personally.\r\nDuring the plea and sentencing hearing, the prosecutor\r\nexplained that the bargained for fines reflected a discount because\r\nthe government could collect a substantial portion from \"the\r\nparties . . . right up front . . . .\"  The court was told that\r\nFirestone owned 85 percent of the stock of Aqua-Leisure, and\r\nFirestone's  counsel told the court that the $5 million fine on\r\nAqua-Leisure was \"in essence\" a \"personal fine\" of Firestone as\r\nwell.  The court imposed on Firestone a $1 million fine and six\r\nmonths of home confinement; and it imposed on Agua-Leisure a $5\r\nmillion fine.\r\nMore than a year later, on November 29, 1979, Aqua-\r\nleisure filed a so called \"Motion for Offset of Fine\" citing\r\nU.S.S.G.  8C3.4.  That provision provides that a court \"may\"\r\noffset (i.e., reduce) the fine imposed on a closely held\r\ncorporation when one or more individuals, each an owner of at least\r\na 5 percent interest, has been fined for the same offense conduct\r\nfor which the organization is being sentenced.  The purpose of\r\nAqua-Leisure's motion for offset of fine was to obtain a reduction\r\nof the fine still owed by Aqua-Leisure corresponding to 85 percent\r\n(Firestone's share of Aqua-Leisure) of the $1 million fine already\r\npaid by Firestone.  The district court denied the motion without\r\nexplanation on December 10, 1997, and thereafter denied a motion\r\nfor reconsideration.  Aqua-Leisure now appeals.\r\nThe district court had no authority to grant Aqua-\r\nLeisure's motion.  A lawful sentence, lawfully imposed, becomes\r\nfinal when judgment is entered; and Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 was\r\ndeliberately amended to restrict the opportunity for a district\r\njudge to revisit thereafter a lawful sentence lawfully imposed. \r\nSee 3 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure  585.1, 585.2, 586-\r\n87 (1998 Supp.).  The occasions on which such a sentence may be\r\nlater reduced are narrowly defined and irrelevant here.\r\nThe situation is more complicated where a sentence is\r\nillegal, or has been illegally imposed, or both.  In these\r\ncircumstances, Rule 35 provides for correction of the sentence by\r\nthe district court within 7 days for \"arithmetical, technical, or\r\nother clear error\"; and, of course, an unlawful sentence may be\r\ncorrected after remand.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a), (c).  Whether and\r\nto what extent an unlawful sentence or one unlawfully imposed may\r\nbe attacked under 28 U.S.C.  2255 or habeas corpus is a separate\r\nissue with complexities of its own.  However, none of these avenues\r\nhas the slightest bearing on this case or provides the district\r\ncourt with any authority to reduce Aqua-Leisure's fine.\r\nThe guideline section relied upon by Aqua-Leisure\r\nspecifies, as already noted, that the court \"may\"--not must--\r\noffset the fine impose on a close corporation.  U.S.S.G.  8C3.4. \r\nHere, the separate fines with no explicit offset were set forth in\r\nthe plea agreements; the district judge was aware of Firestone's 85\r\npercent ownership; and there was no request for offset at the time\r\nof sentence.  Even now, Aqua-Leisure is unable to point to any\r\nlegal error in the failure to afford an offset or any plausible\r\nbasis for district court authority to reduce, over a year later, a\r\nlawful sentence lawfully imposed.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n\n                              Concurrence follows.     KEETON, District Judge, concurring.  Although I agree\r\nthat the occasions on which an allegedly duplicative fine imposed\r\non a corporate entity \"may be later reduced are narrowly defined,\"\r\nPer Curiam Opinion at 3 and n.1, respectfully I do not join in the\r\nconclusion that they are irrelevant here.  Instead, I concur\r\nbecause, first, in my view the district court had jurisdiction to\r\nconsider whether petitioner had succeeded in showing exceptional\r\ncircumstances \"seriously affect[ing] the fairness, integrity or\r\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  United States v.\r\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993) (quoting United States v. Young,\r\n470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985)); United States v. Romano, 137 F.3d 677, 682\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).  And second,  in my view, the district court\r\ncorrectly decided that the petitioner failed to meet this burden in\r\nthis case.\n",
