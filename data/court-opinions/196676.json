Antonellis (\"Antonellis\").   Two\r\n\nprincipal  issues  are  raised  on  appeal:    first,  whether  a\r\n\nnonclient can  maintain an action  against an attorney  when that\r                   \r\n\nattorney negligently certifies to  a mortgagee that the  title is\r\n\ngood,  and  the mortgagee  then  assigns  the title  certificate,\r\n\nmortgage, and all  associated documents to the  nonclient in good\r\n\nfaith; and second, whether  the mortgagee's assignee can maintain\r\n\nan  action  for negligent  title  certification  pursuant to  the\r\n\nMassachusetts title certification statute,  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93,\r\n\n  70.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  late 1987,  Milford Savings  Bank (\"Milford\")  lent\r\n\n$100,000 to Thomas J.  Milani and Thomas Chamberlin, individually\r\n\nand as trustees of T &amp; T Realty Trust, and to Jaqueline Wojnowski\r\n\nand Cathy A.  Milani, individually.   A mortgage  on property  in\r\n\nBellingham, Massachusetts  served as security  (the \"first Milani\r\n\nmortgage\").   A few months later, in April of 1988, Thomas J. and\r\n\nCathy  A.  Milani  (together,  the  \"Milanis\")  executed  another\r\n\nmortgage  on  the same  property, also  to  Milford, to  secure a\r\n\n$150,000  loan  (the  \"second  Milani mortgage\").    Milford  was\r\n\nrepresented in  the 1988  transaction by appellee  Antonellis, an\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nattorney.\r\n\n          Some  months later,  on  August  10, 1988,1  Antonellis\r\n\nissued  a  certification  of  title,  which  certified  that  the\r\n\nmortgagors   held  title   to   the  property   \"free  from   all\r\n\nencumbrances,  and the  mortgagee  [held] a  good and  sufficient\r\n\nrecord first mortgage to the property.\"2  No mention  was made of\r\n\nthe first Milani  mortgage.   The certification  also included  a\r\n\ndisclaimer,  which stated:  \"THIS  CERTIFICATE IS NOT  TO BE USED\r\n\nFOR  TITLE   INSURANCE  PURPOSES  WITHOUT  THE   EXPRESS  WRITTEN\r\n\nPERMISSION OF  JOSEPH M. ANTONELLIS, ESQUIRE.\"   While Antonellis\r\n\nwas preparing the title certificate, according to his deposition,\r\n\na Milford bank  official called  him around the  time the  second\r\n\nMilani mortgage  was executed.  The  official informed Antonellis\r\n\nof  the  first  Milani mortgage,  and  stated  that  it would  be\r\n\nsubordinated to  the April 1988 second Milani mortgage.  However,\r\n\nit appears that Milford never subordinated the mortgage.\r\n\n          In the meantime, ONB purchased a package of eighty-five\r\n\nadjustable rate  one-year first mortgages from  Milford on August\r\n\n2, 1988, including the second Milani  mortgage.  ONB did not hire\r\n\nan attorney  to check  these mortgages' certifications  of title.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The district court noted that  Antonellis claimed that it took\r\nseveral months to  prepare the formal certificate  because he was\r\ntoo busy.\r\n\n2  Antonellis' certification is made up of two documents:  a form\r\nentitled  \"Certification of  Title,\"  dated May  3,  1988, and  a\r\nsecond  form  entitled  \"Attorney's  Certification  of  Title  to\r\nMortgagee  and Mortgagor[s],\" dated August 10,  1988.  The former\r\ndocument  was   attached  to  the  latter   and  incorporated  by\r\nreference.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nSubsequently,  Milford was  declared insolvent  in early  July of\r\n\n1990, and the  Milanis defaulted  on both their  mortgages.   The\r\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\")  took over Milford\r\n\nand  was  appointed  its  receiver.    The  FDIC  repudiated  the\r\n\nagreement between Milford and ONB.\r\n\n          Faced   with   this   situation,  One   National   sued\r\n\nAntonellis,  the  FDIC,  and the  Milanis.    The district  court\r\n\ngranted  summary judgment to defendants Antonellis and FDIC.  One\r\n\nNational  dismissed  its action  against  the  Milanis, and  here\r\n\nappeals the summary judgment only as to appellee Antonellis.  \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          After reciting the standard  of review, we address each\r\n\nissue in turn.\r\n\n                      A.

Here,  because the parties do not dispute\r               \r\n\nany  facts that  could affect  the suit's  outcome, our  analysis\r\n\nconfines itself to whether Antonellis is entitled to  judgment as\r\n\na matter of law.\r\n\n                        B.

Because there  was no\r\n\nattorney-client   relationship  between  the  parties,  any  duty\r\n\nAntonellis  owed ONB must  be based  on Massachusetts'  theory of\r\n\nforeseeable reliance, which states that a lawyer may be liable to\r\n\na non-client.3  As  discussed below, we find that  Antonellis did\r\n\nnot  owe  One  National a  duty  of  care  under the  foreseeable\r\n\nreliance exception.  Therefore, we  will not address the parties'\r\n\ndispute as to  whether Antonellis  was in fact  negligent.

Thus, any potential  conflicts between  Antonellis'\r\n\nduty to  Milford and  his  alleged duty  to ONB  will defeat  One\r\n\nNational's claim.\r\n\n          Before addressing the potential conflicts, we note that\r\n\nthe facts in  the present  case differ in  several material  ways\r\n\nfrom  the Massachusetts  cases  we have  found  that address  the\r\n\nforeseeable  reliance  exception.    In  those  cases,  only  one\r\n\ntransaction  is generally  at  issue, the  potential third  party\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nnonclient's identity is known from the start of the  transaction,\r\n\nand often, the nonclient and client are in an adversary position.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Page, 445 N.E.2d  at 149-50; Kirkland,  658 N.E.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n699-700.   Here, there  were two  independent transactions:   the\r\n\ncertificate  of title prepared  for the first  transaction -- the\r\n\nsecond Milani  mortgage --   was relied on  in the second  -- the\r\n\nsale  of  that  mortgage.    Also, the  third  party  nonclient's\r\n\nidentity  was  not  known  until  after  the  legal  service  was\r\n\nrendered, and the nonclient  is attempting to stand in  the shoes\r\n\nof the client as mortgagor in  the first transaction, not in  its\r\n\nadverse  position  as buyer  in the  second.   In short,  we find\r\n\nourselves  facing  the  dilemma  of  having  to  apply the  fact-\r\n\ndependant Massachusetts foreseeable reliance test to factors that\r\n\nhave not yet come before the state courts.\r\n\n          One National argues that  in this context there was  no\r\n\nconflict  between  Antonellis' duty  to Milford  and the  duty he\r\n\nallegedly owed ONB.  It  asserts that the duty on which  it rests\r\n\nits claim is the same duty  Antonellis owed Milford:  the duty to\r\n\nsearch properly and to  report accurately the state of  the title\r\n\nwith respect to  the 1988 mortgage.   It argues  that two  duties\r\n\ncannot  be in  conflict with  each other  if they  are identical.\r\n\nUnlike  in Page, ONB argues, where the attorney faced a potential\r                         \r\n\nconflict  between duties  to the  mortgagee client  and mortgagor\r\n\nnonclient because  they may have had different concerns about the\r\n\nstate of the title, Page, 445 N.E.2d at 153, both ONB and Milford\r                                  \r\n\nsimply wanted an accurate certificate of title.  That is true, as\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nfar as it goes.\r\n\n          However,  One National  misconstrues the  scope of  the\r\n\nduty to  the client that  Massachusetts courts  have focused  on.\r\n\n\"[A]n isolated  instance identity  of interests\" between  ONB and\r\n\nMilford  does not suffice to impose duty on Antonellis.

The  Massachusetts  and\r\n\nfederal   courts  that  have  applied  the  foreseeable  reliance\r\n\nexception  have repeatedly drawn on the importance of the duty of\r\n\nconfidentiality in  finding the potential for a conflict, so that\r\n\n\"an attorney's duty to third parties is circumscribed and limited\r\n\nby  the  law  and   the  disciplinary  rules  governing  attorney\r\n\nconduct.\"  Schlecht, 1994 WL 621594  at * 5; see, e.g., Austin v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBradley, Barry  &amp; Tarlow,  P.C., 836  F.

Other cases posit the obligation\r\n\nof confidentiality in  more general  terms.

Given  this, if we place a duty  to ONB on Antonellis'\r\n\nshoulders,  we put  on him  the obligation  to inform  it of  his\r\n\nerror.    That  mistake was  made  in  the  first transaction,  a\r\n\ntransaction to which One  National was not a party.   Antonellis'\r\n\npurported  duty  to  ONB  therefore  arose  only  in  the  second\r\n\ntransaction,  where that  bank  actually  was  a  party.      Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nHendrickson  v.

Ostensibly,  having  already\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nproduced the  certificate, his  duty  would be  to check  whether\r\n\nMilford subordinated the  debt, remind  it of his  error, and  if\r\n\nMilford  did not rectify  it, to do so  himself by informing ONB.\r\n\nClearly,  at that point a conflict in the duty of confidentiality\r\n\nwould  arise:    if  his  client  decided  not  to  pass  on  the\r\n\ninformation and Antonellis did  so in its stead, he  would breach\r\n\nhis duty of confidentiality.   See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon  4, DR\r                                            \r\n\n4-101(B)  (stating that  \"a  lawyer shall  not  knowingly .  .  .\r\n\n[r]eveal a confidence or secret of  his client.\").  If he did not\r\n\npass on the  information, he would  breach his duty  to ONB.   We\r\n\nrefuse to place  him in that position.   Therefore, we find  that\r\n\nthe potential for conflicts in Antonellis' duty to Milford and to\r\n\nONB bars  liability in this case.4   Cf. Austin, 836  F.

It found\r\nthat ONB and  Milford were in the adverse positions  of buyer and\r\nseller in August 1988.  Since the courts have found that reliance\r\non  an adverse party's legal counsel in a business transaction is\r\nunreasonable as a matter of law, see Schlecht, 1994 WL 621594  at\r                                                       \r\n* 7; Robertson,  536 N.E.2d at 350 n.6; Page,  445 N.E.2d at 154-\r                                                      \r\n55, the  court found that there was a potential for conflict.  It\r\nfound that Antonellis  would be under  different pressures if  he\r\nwere representing both Milford and ONB than if he represented ONB\r\nalone.  The court also commented on One National's failure to use\r\nits own counsel in the sales transaction.\r\n\n   One National  contests that Antonellis was  not representing a\r\nparty adverse to it, because he did  not represent Milford in the\r\nONB-Milford  sales transaction,  but  only in  the second  Milani\r\nmortgage.   When  he rendered  the  title certificate  at  issue,\r\nMilford and ONB were not yet adverse parties.\r\n\n   Because  we  find  that   One  National  fails  the  potential\r\nconflicts prong  of the  foreseeable reliance exception  on other\r\ngrounds,  we do not address  here whether the  district court was\r\ncorrect in finding that  ONB sought to rely on  the legal counsel\r\nof an adverse party.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n38 (refusing to infer a duty to disclose a client's insolvency to\r\n\nnonclient  investors  where  duty would  directly  conflict  with\r\n\nconcurrent obligation of confidentiality to client).\r\n\n          ONB contests that potential conflicts would  only arise\r\n\nif  Antonellis  had  represented  Milford as  the  seller  of the\r\n\nmortgages  in   the  second  transaction,  and   if  Milford  and\r\n\nAntonellis had intended to deceive ONB.  We disagree.  Neither of\r\n\nthese additional  facts are necessary for  potential conflicts to\r\n\narise.  First, ONB is relying  on the work Antonellis did for the\r\n\nfirst  transaction  --  whether  we  consider  ONB  as  Milford's\r\n\nreplacement in the  first transaction  or as a  party adverse  to\r\n\nMilford in the second is irrelevant to this analysis.  Second, as\r\n\nthe district court noted, there is no allegation that Milford and\r\n\nAntonellis colluded to deceive  ONB.  There are many  reasons why\r\n\nMilford  could fail to inform  ONB of the  faulty title.  Indeed,\r\n\neven if it did tell ONB about the problem, Antonellis could still\r\n\nface  a conflict in his  duty of confidentiality  if Milford made\r\n\nany  misrepresentations about the  circumstances under  which the\r\n\nerror  was made,  i.e. that it  too knew  of the  omission of the\r                                \r\n\nfirst  Milani mortgage.  Thus  we do not  accept ONB's contention\r\n\nthat there was no potential conflict.\r\n\n          3.   Kirkland Construction Co. v. James\r                    3.   Kirkland Construction Co. v.

There, the court faced a challenge to a lower  court's\r\n\ngrant of a 12(b)(6) motion under the Massachusetts Rules of Civil\r\n\nProcedure.   Kirkland,  a  contractor, was  asked  to renovate  a\r\n\nretail space for an office supply firm.  He sought and received a\r\n\nletter from  the firm's attorney, defendant  James, assuring that\r\n\nhis  client could pay for the  work.  However, after Kirkland had\r\n\nperformed under the  contract, the office  supply firm failed  to\r\n\npay.   Kirkland sued James and  the partners of his  law firm for\r\n\nnegligence, and the lower  court granted the defendants' 12(b)(6)\r\n\nmotion.   Id.  at  699-700.   The  court reversed,  finding  that\r                       \r\n\nKirkland was entitled to  seek relief from the attorneys  under a\r\n\ntheory of foreseeable reliance.

That  is  not  true  here:    the\r\n\ncertificate   of   title   was   not  addressed   to   ONB,   the\r\n\nrepresentations were made  in boilerplate language with  standard\r\n\nexceptions  listed,  and  there  was an  express  disclaimer,  in\r\n\ncapital letters, on one of the two pages.\r\n\n          The Kirkland court also  listed a series of allegations\r                                \r\n\nin the plaintiff's complaint that, if proven, would be \"the stuff\r\n\nof liability.\"   658 N.E.2d at 701.  First, both Kirkland and ONB\r\n\nallege that the representations  were false.  The fact  that both\r\n\nplaintiffs make the  same allegation, however,  is somewhat of  a\r\n\nred  herring, because  if  there were  no false  representations,\r\n\nthere would be no basis for suit.  Second, Kirkland alleged  that\r\n\nthe   letter  stated  that  the   office  supply  firm  had  made\r\n\narrangements  to   ensure  payment,   and  that  the   attorneys'\r\n\n\"objective was to induce Kirkland to enter into a contract.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nWe cannot say that Antonellis' objective was to induce ONB into a\r\n\ncontract, since ONB was not a party to the  transaction for which\r\n\nthe certificate  of title  was performed.5   Third,  the Kirkland\r                                                                           \r\n\ncomplaint maintained  that the attorneys \"knew  and intended that\r\n\nKirkland  would  rely  on  the  representations,\"  and  that  the\r\n\nreliance was reasonable.  Id.  Again, ONB was  not a party.  Even\r                                       \r\n\nif we  infer  that  Antonellis should  have  suspected  that  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  Nor can ONB argue that the purpose of Antonellis' work was  to\r\ninduce  the Milanis  into  the mortgage,  because  by law  it  is\r\nunreasonable for a mortgagee  to rely on mortgagor's  counsel, as\r\nmortgagee and mortgagor are adverse parties.

Assignability of Certificate of Title\r                                                               \r\n\n          One  National contends  that it  acquired the  right to\r\n\nproceed    against   Antonellis   through   assignment   of   the\r\n\ncertificate.6    Specifically,  it states  that  because  Milford\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  In  fact, it proves difficult to determine  the intended scope\r\nof  ONB's  assignment  argument.    Before the  court  below,  it\r\ncontended that as assignee of the mortgage it \"had all the rights\r\nof Milford Savings Bank  once the mortgage was assigned  and duly\r\nrecorded  .  . . which  would  include  all  rights  against  the\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nentered into a contract  with Antonellis for the issuance  of the\r\n\ntitle certificate and then assigned the fruits of the contract to\r\n\nONB, ONB has the right  to proceed against Antonellis.  The  crux\r\n\nof  the  issue,   it  claims,  is  whether  the  certificate  was\r\n\ntransferrable by Milford to  ONB.  Essentially, ONB asks  that we\r\n\nallow it to step into Milford's shoes as a  client merely because\r\n\nit  was  assigned the  certificate that  was  the product  of the\r\n\nattorney-client relationship.  Noting  that the disclaimer barred\r\n\nreliance  by a  title  insurer, not  assignment,  it argues  that\r\n\nalthough  the  transferability  of  a certificate  of  title  has\r\n\napparently not  been addressed by the  Massachusetts courts, they\r\n\nwould  hold  the assignment  valid.   ONB  makes its  argument by\r\n\nanalogy  to  the law's  general  favor  towards assignability  of\r\n\ncontracts and  contract rights,  and the fact  that Massachusetts\r\n\nallows assignments  of many  types of claims,  including contract\r\n\ndamages.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 106   2-210(2).  It also makes an\r                       \r\n\nanalogy  to  other jurisdictions'  acceptance  of  assignments of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ncertifying attorney Antonellis.\"   (Appdx.  at 50).   It did  not\r\nspecify which rights it referred to.  In its brief to this court,\r\nONB  argued that the  \"gist\" of the tort  of legal malpractice is\r\nthe  lawyer's breach of contract,  and that ONB  acquired a legal\r\nmalpractice  claim  with   the  certificate,  stating  that   \"if\r\nMilford's  assignment to  ONB is  treated as  an assignment  of a\r\nmalpractice  claim, the  Supreme  Judicial Court  would hold  the\r\nassignment valid.\"  (Brief of Appellant at 27).  Of course, since\r\nONB did  not raise below  a claim that a  legal malpractice claim\r\nwas assigned, they cannot do so here.  See Ondine Shipping  Corp.\r                                                                           \r\nv.

Since we deem that this \"real issue\" was included\r\nwithin the scope of its argument below, we address their claim.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nlegal malpractice claims.  See, e.g., Oppel v. Empire Mutual Ins.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  517 F.

See Dunne v. Cunningham, 125 N.E. 560, 561 (Mass.\r                                                 \r\n\n1920) (commenting on the  \"highly fiduciary\" relationship between\r\n\nattorney and client).  Without citing any direct authority in its\r\n\nsupport,  ONB  contends  that  the   assignment  illustrates  the\r\n\n\"inherently weak  nature\" of the relationship  where the attorney\r\n\nmerely  plays a standardized role  of reporting the  state of the\r\n\npublic records.   See Fall  River Savings Bank  v. Callahan,  463\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.E.2d  555, 561 (Mass.  App. Ct. 1984)  (noting the standardized\r\n\nnature of passing on a title); 1 Mallen &amp; Smith, supra, at   25.8\r                                                                \r\n\n(setting out  the process and describing  potential liabilities).\r\n\nThus, since the purpose of the relationship is not to give advice\r\n\nor  counselling   but  to  produce  a   formal  certificate,  ONB\r\n\nmaintains, the  transfer would  not jeopardize any  public policy\r\n\nfavoring the attorney-client relationship.\r\n\n          The   district   court   addressed   ONB's   assignment\r\n\ncontention  within the context of its discussion of Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\nch.  93,   70.    It rejected  One  National's position  that  an\r\n\nassignee  should have  the same  fiduciary relationship  with the\r\n\nassignor's attorney  as  the assignor,  the  original  mortgagee,\r\n\nenjoyed, on  two bases.  We address the first, which draws on the\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nlanguage of section 70, in our discussion of that section, infra.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThe district  court's second  basis for rejecting  ONB's position\r\n\nwas  that ONB's argument  does not  arise out  of the  common law\r\n\ngoverning  the unique attorney-client  relationship -- a personal\r\n\nrelationship,  voluntarily   assumed,   which  is   governed   by\r\n\ndisciplinary rules.  Under de novo review, we  also find that the\r                                            \r\n\nattorney-client relationship between Antonellis and Milford plays\r\n\na  crucial  role  in  determining  whether  the  certificate  was\r\n\ntransferable.\r\n\n          Massachusetts  case law offers little specific guidance\r\n\non this issue, but we find that an analysis of their treatment of\r\n\nthe  attorney-client relationship  in the  context of  claims for\r\n\nnegligent certification of title  proves illustrative.  First, as\r\n\nwas noted above, the  nature of the attorney-client relationship,\r\n\nincluding the  obligation of  confidentiality and  application of\r\n\nthe  disciplinary  rules,  has  consistently been  cited  by  the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts  within this  context.  See,  e.g., Spinner,\r                                                                          \r\n\n631 N.E.2d at 545.  This indicates that the courts do not see the\r\n\nattorney-client relationship in this context as inherently  weak,\r\n\nas ONB suggests.   Significantly, in Hendrickson  v. Sears, which\r                                                                    \r\n\ninvolved  a suit  by the  purchasers of  real estate  against the\r\n\nattorney they hired  for the  title search, the  Court noted  the\r\n\ndifferences between legal and  medical malpractice actions in its\r\n\nanalysis, 310 N.E.2d at 134, and commented that\r\n\n            [t]he client is not an expert;  he cannot\r\n            be  expected  to  recognize  professional\r\n            negligence if  he sees it,  and he should\r\n            not  be  expected   to  watch  over   the\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n            professional  or  to   retain  a   second\r\n            professional to  do so.   The relation of\r\n            attorney and client  is highly  fiduciary\r\n            in its nature.\r\n\nId. at  135.  Nowhere does the  Court's language suggest that the\r             \r\n\nfiduciary relationship  of an  attorney and client  is diminished\r\n\nbecause   the  services   the  attorney   rendered  were   highly\r\n\nstandardized.   Similarly,  in  Schlecht v.  Smith, the  district\r                                                            \r\n\ncourt addressed the attorney's failure to record the mortgage, at\r\n\nhis  client's request,  within  the context  of the  disciplinary\r\n\nrules.  Schlecht, 1994 WL 621594 at * 5.  Again, nothing suggests\r                          \r\n\nthat the rules' force is somehow diminished.\r\n\n          Second,  in Fall  River Savings  Bank v.  Callahan, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nAppeals Court  of Massachusetts noted the  standardized nature of\r\n\ntitle searches.   463 N.E.2d  at 561  (\"There may be  no definite\r\n\nrules  which  prescribe  a  right  or  wrong  way  to  conduct  a\r\n\ndeposition  but  certain rules  have  evolved  for passing  on  a\r\n\ntitle.\").  The court found that fact significant in deciding that\r\n\na court may use commentaries to establish the standard of care in\r\n\nthe  land  conveyance  context, since  that  is  an  area of  law\r\n\npractice \"which lends itself  particularly to formulation through\r\n\ndecisional  law  and  commentary   as  to  what  are  appropriate\r\n\nprocedures.\"   Id.  But even as it recognized the standardization\r                            \r\n\nof this area, the  Court treated the attorney-client relationship\r\n\nas it would  in any other  context, as carrying  with it all  the\r\n\nattendant duties and responsibilities.  Id.\r                                                     \r\n\n          This approach  makes intuitive sense.   Even though the\r\n\npractices for searching title  are standardized, the disciplinary\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nrules apply  as they  would in any  attorney-client relationship,\r\n\nand  the attorney is subject  to liability for  malpractice.  The\r\n\nduties  attendant  to  the  fiduciary  relationship  between  the\r\n\nattorney and  client are in full  force.  See Dunne,  125 N.E. at\r                                                             \r\n\n561  (noting  that  the  principles  relating  to  an  attorney's\r\n\nfiduciary  duties  \"are  recognized   as  binding  in  all  their\r\n\namplitude.\").   Thus the unspecified public  policy concerns that\r\n\nONB tells us  would not be jeopardized --  presumably, protecting\r\n\nthe   attorney's   ability   to  function   effectively,   client\r\n\nconfidentiality, the  integrity of  the  bench and  bar, and  the\r\n\nethical  administration of  justice, see  Berman v.  Coakley, 137\r                                                                      \r\n\nN.E. 667,  670-71 (Mass. 1923)  (\"Public policy hardly  can touch\r\n\nmatters of  more  general  concern than  the  maintenance  of  an\r\n\nuntarnished standard of conduct by the attorney at law toward his\r\n\nclient.\"); 1 Mallen &amp; Smith, supra, at    11.5, 11.12, 12.4, 13.2\r                                            \r\n\n-- are still implicated.\r\n\n          In sum, since  the case law clearly indicates  that the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts do not consider  the fiduciary nature of the\r\n\nattorney-client relationship to be attenuated in this certificate\r\n\nof title context, and in the absence of further guidance from the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts, we refuse  to allow a third party,  of whom\r\n\nthe attorney does  not know,  to assume  the rights  of a  client\r\n\nthrough  assignment.  We therefore find that One National did not\r\n\nacquire  the  right   to  proceed   against  Antonellis   through\r\n\nassignment of the certificate of title.\r\n\n             E.

Under that section, an\r\n\nattorney  rendering a certificate of title for a mortgagee may be\r\n\nsubject to liability to the mortgagor as well:\r\n\n               The   liability    of   any   attorney\r\n            rendering  such  certification  shall  be\r\n            limited    to    the   amount    of   the\r\n            consideration  shown  on  the  deed  with\r\n            respect  to the  mortgagor, and  shall be\r\n            limited to the original  principal amount\r\n            secured  by the mortgage  with respect to\r\n            the mortgagee.  Said  certification shall\r\n            be  effective  for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n            mortgagor  so long as  said mortgagor has\r\n            title  to  the  mortgaged  premises,  and\r\n            shall be effective for the benefit of the\r\n            mortgagee  so long  as the  original debt\r\n            secured by the mortgage remains unpaid.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 93,   70.   The loan or credit  secured by the\r\n\npurchase money first mortgage must be on real estate with between\r\n\none and four dwellings, to be occupied by the mortgagor.  Id.\r                                                                       \r\n\n          ONB argues that because it  holds the mortgage it falls\r\n\nwithin the scope of  \"mortgagee\" as used in section 70,  and that\r\n\nAntonellis is thus liable to it.  Noting that section 70 operates\r\n\nin a  manner analogous  to a  statute of  limitations in that  it\r\n\nprovides that  the title certification  will remain in  effect so\r\n\nlong as  the original  debt is  unpaid,  ONB argues  it would  be\r\n\nunreasonable  to argue that  the attorney's  liability disappears\r\n\nwhen a  mortgage is sold,  no matter whether or  not the original\r\n\ndebt  is unpaid.  Further, ONB notes  that the sale of a mortgage\r\n\nneither enlarges  the attorney's liability,  as it is  limited by\r\n\nthe statute, nor  changes the nature  of the liability.   As  ONB\r\n\nstates, one bank  is simply  substituted for another:   all  else\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nremains  constant.   Thus  the  attorney  remains liable  on  the\r\n\ncertificate until the mortgage debt is paid.\r\n\n          Upon  de novo review, we agree  with the district court\r                                 \r\n\nthat,  while One  National's argument  makes intuitive  sense, it\r\n\neventually fails.  First, like the  court below, we find that the\r\n\nplain language  of the statute  does not support  ONB's position.\r\n\nIt  is a basic tenet  of statutory interpretation  that where the\r\n\nplain language  of a statute  is clear,  it governs.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 551 (1979) (\"If a legislative\r                              \r\n\npurpose  is expressed in 'plain  and unambiguous language,  . . .\r\n\nthe . . . duty  of the courts is  to give it effect according  to\r\n\nits  terms'\" (quoting United States v.  Lexington Mill &amp; Elevator\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 232 U.S. 399,  409 (1914)).  ONB  correctly points out  that\r             \r\n\nhere, the  statute's  text does  not  state that  the  attorney's\r\n\nliability  to  the  mortgagee  terminates when  the  mortgage  is\r\n\ntransferred.  However, we refuse to read the opposite inference -\r\n\n- that the liability is not extinguished upon transferral -- into\r\n\nthe statute when it is not warranted by the plain language of the\r\n\ntext.  The language of section  70 focuses on mortgagees, not, as\r\n\nOne National would  have us believe,  on their assignees.     See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFalmouth Ob/Gyn Assoc. Inc. v.

Clearly, no\r                                            \r\n\nsuch  exception arises  here.   Constraining  the application  of\r\n\nsection  70  to mortgagees'  assignees  does  not create  \"absurd\r\n\nresults.\"   As  the  court below  noted, Chapter  93  as a  whole\r\n\naddresses \"the  regulation of trade  and enterprises in  order to\r\n\nprevent  unfair  practices against  consumers.\"   (District Court\r\n\nMemorandum  and Decision, p. 8).   Our reading of  the statute is\r\n\nnot \"obviously  at  variance\"  with  that policy,  even  if  this\r\n\nreading does not extend the policy to assignees of mortgagees.\r\n\n          Second,  like  the  court  in Page,  we  note  that the\r                                                      \r\n\nlegislature, in  its amendments to  section 70, has  not expanded\r\n\nthe  class of mortgagors it protects to encompass assignees.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPage, 445 N.E.2d at 152.   As the district court stated,  had the\r              \r\n\nlegislature desired  to extend the  provisions of section  70, it\r\n\ncould  have  done  so.    Instead,  only  purchase  money   first\r\n\nmortgages, of dwellings of  up to four families, occupied  by the\r\n\nmortgagor, fall within the section.  Clearly, the legislature did\r\n\nnot  intend for  section 70  to provide  that a  commercial bank,\r\n\nwhich  neither  paid  for  the attorney's  services  nor  had any\r\n\ncontact with the attorney,  be entitled to the protection  of the\r\n\nsection merely because it was assigned the mortgage.  In the face\r\n\nof the  plain language  of the  statute,  and in  the absence  of\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nlegislative  action to  the  contrary, we  reject One  National's\r\n\nargument that Antonellis is liable to it under section 70.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          In  this case, as in  all cases involving an allegation\r\n\nthat an  attorney failed in  a duty  to a nonclient,  there is  a\r\n\ntension between  two concerns.   On one hand,  we do not  want to\r\n\nextend liability so widely that an  attorney faces \"'liability in\r\n\nan  indeterminate   amount  for  an  indeterminate   time  to  an\r\n\nindeterminate  class.'\"   Craig  v. Everett  M.  Brooks Co.,  222\r                                                                     \r\n\nN.E.2d 752, 755 (Mass. 1967) (quoting Ultramares Corp. v. Touche,\r                                                                           \r\n\nNiven &amp; Co., 174 N.E. 441, 444 (1931)).  On the other hand, we do\r                     \r\n\nnot  want to reward an attorney's carelessness.  See Spinner, 631\r                                                                      \r\n\nN.E.2d  at 545  (noting policy considerations  against sheltering\r\n\nattorney's negligence  from suit  in will-drafting context).   In\r\n\nfinding  that  Antonellis'  liability  does  not  extend  to  One\r\n\nNational, we  are cognizant  that on  the surface  we seem  to be\r\n\nprotecting  him from suit for  his negligence.   However, we note\r\n\nthat ordinarily, ONB would have  recourse against Milford for the\r\n\nfaulty  title, and Milford in turn could bring a negligence claim\r\n\nagainst  Antonellis, as its lawyer.   See id.  (noting that trust\r                                                       \r\n\nbeneficiaries could  sue the trustees,  and the trustees  in turn\r\n\ncould bring an action  against their attorneys, but beneficiaries\r\n\ncould  not directly  sue trustees'  attorneys).   Because Milford\r\n\nfailed, ONB has lost  that option.  ONB, essentially, took a risk\r\n\nin   deciding  not  to  get  its  own  title  insurance  for  the\r\n\ntransaction.    It  was a  calculated  risk,  and  it required  a\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ncomplicated  chain  of  events  --  Antonellis'  negligence,  the\r\n\nMilanis' default,  Milford's failure, and the  FDIC's repudiation\r\n\nof the claim -- to make that risk fail to pay off.  We  refuse to\r\n\nspot  ONB's choice  to take that  risk with  the safety  net of a\r\n\nnegligence  claim against Antonellis.   Cf.  Page, 445  N.E.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n154-55  (\"Where, as here, a  nonclient takes the  chance that the\r\n\nclient's interests  are in harmony with  his own, and  does so in\r\n\nthe face of an express warning that the interests may differ, his\r\n\nclaim of  foreseeable reliance cannot be  rescued simply because,\r\n\nin retrospect, the interests are shown not to have differed.\").\r\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons,  the order of  the district\r\n\ncourt  granting  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Antonellis  is\r\n\naffirmed.\r          affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n",

Antonellis (\"Antonellis\").   Two\r\n\nprincipal  issues  are  raised  on  appeal:    first,  whether  a\r\n\nnonclient can  maintain an action  against an attorney  when that\r                   \r\n\nattorney negligently certifies to  a mortgagee that the  title is\r\n\ngood,  and  the mortgagee  then  assigns  the title  certificate,\r\n\nmortgage, and all  associated documents to the  nonclient in good\r\n\nfaith; and second, whether  the mortgagee's assignee can maintain\r\n\nan  action  for negligent  title  certification  pursuant to  the\r\n\nMassachusetts title certification statute,  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93,\r\n\n  70.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  late 1987,  Milford Savings  Bank (\"Milford\")  lent\r\n\n$100,000 to Thomas J.  Milani and Thomas Chamberlin, individually\r\n\nand as trustees of T &amp; T Realty Trust, and to Jaqueline Wojnowski\r\n\nand Cathy A.  Milani, individually.   A mortgage  on property  in\r\n\nBellingham, Massachusetts  served as security  (the \"first Milani\r\n\nmortgage\").   A few months later, in April of 1988, Thomas J. and\r\n\nCathy  A.  Milani  (together,  the  \"Milanis\")  executed  another\r\n\nmortgage  on  the same  property, also  to  Milford, to  secure a\r\n\n$150,000  loan  (the  \"second  Milani mortgage\").    Milford  was\r\n\nrepresented in  the 1988  transaction by appellee  Antonellis, an\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nattorney.\r\n\n          Some  months later,  on  August  10, 1988,1  Antonellis\r\n\nissued  a  certification  of  title,  which  certified  that  the\r\n\nmortgagors   held  title   to   the  property   \"free  from   all\r\n\nencumbrances,  and the  mortgagee  [held] a  good and  sufficient\r\n\nrecord first mortgage to the property.\"2  No mention  was made of\r\n\nthe first Milani  mortgage.   The certification  also included  a\r\n\ndisclaimer,  which stated:  \"THIS  CERTIFICATE IS NOT  TO BE USED\r\n\nFOR  TITLE   INSURANCE  PURPOSES  WITHOUT  THE   EXPRESS  WRITTEN\r\n\nPERMISSION OF  JOSEPH M. ANTONELLIS, ESQUIRE.\"   While Antonellis\r\n\nwas preparing the title certificate, according to his deposition,\r\n\na Milford bank  official called  him around the  time the  second\r\n\nMilani mortgage  was executed.  The  official informed Antonellis\r\n\nof  the  first  Milani mortgage,  and  stated  that  it would  be\r\n\nsubordinated to  the April 1988 second Milani mortgage.  However,\r\n\nit appears that Milford never subordinated the mortgage.\r\n\n          In the meantime, ONB purchased a package of eighty-five\r\n\nadjustable rate  one-year first mortgages from  Milford on August\r\n\n2, 1988, including the second Milani  mortgage.  ONB did not hire\r\n\nan attorney  to check  these mortgages' certifications  of title.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The district court noted that  Antonellis claimed that it took\r\nseveral months to  prepare the formal certificate  because he was\r\ntoo busy.\r\n\n2  Antonellis' certification is made up of two documents:  a form\r\nentitled  \"Certification of  Title,\"  dated May  3,  1988, and  a\r\nsecond  form  entitled  \"Attorney's  Certification  of  Title  to\r\nMortgagee  and Mortgagor[s],\" dated August 10,  1988.  The former\r\ndocument  was   attached  to  the  latter   and  incorporated  by\r\nreference.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nSubsequently,  Milford was  declared insolvent  in early  July of\r\n\n1990, and the  Milanis defaulted  on both their  mortgages.   The\r\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\")  took over Milford\r\n\nand  was  appointed  its  receiver.    The  FDIC  repudiated  the\r\n\nagreement between Milford and ONB.\r\n\n          Faced   with   this   situation,  One   National   sued\r\n\nAntonellis,  the  FDIC,  and the  Milanis.    The district  court\r\n\ngranted  summary judgment to defendants Antonellis and FDIC.  One\r\n\nNational  dismissed  its action  against  the  Milanis, and  here\r\n\nappeals the summary judgment only as to appellee Antonellis.  \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          After reciting the standard  of review, we address each\r\n\nissue in turn.\r\n\n                      A.

Thus, any potential  conflicts between  Antonellis'\r\n\nduty to  Milford and  his  alleged duty  to ONB  will defeat  One\r\n\nNational's claim.\r\n\n          Before addressing the potential conflicts, we note that\r\n\nthe facts in  the present  case differ in  several material  ways\r\n\nfrom  the Massachusetts  cases  we have  found  that address  the\r\n\nforeseeable  reliance  exception.    In  those  cases,  only  one\r\n\ntransaction  is generally  at  issue, the  potential third  party\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nnonclient's identity is known from the start of the  transaction,\r\n\nand often, the nonclient and client are in an adversary position.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Page, 445 N.E.2d  at 149-50; Kirkland,  658 N.E.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n699-700.   Here, there  were two  independent transactions:   the\r\n\ncertificate  of title prepared  for the first  transaction -- the\r\n\nsecond Milani  mortgage --   was relied on  in the second  -- the\r\n\nsale  of  that  mortgage.    Also, the  third  party  nonclient's\r\n\nidentity  was  not  known  until  after  the  legal  service  was\r\n\nrendered, and the nonclient  is attempting to stand in  the shoes\r\n\nof the client as mortgagor in  the first transaction, not in  its\r\n\nadverse  position  as buyer  in the  second.   In short,  we find\r\n\nourselves  facing  the  dilemma  of  having  to  apply the  fact-\r\n\ndependant Massachusetts foreseeable reliance test to factors that\r\n\nhave not yet come before the state courts.\r\n\n          One National argues that  in this context there was  no\r\n\nconflict  between  Antonellis' duty  to Milford  and the  duty he\r\n\nallegedly owed ONB.  It  asserts that the duty on which  it rests\r\n\nits claim is the same duty  Antonellis owed Milford:  the duty to\r\n\nsearch properly and to  report accurately the state of  the title\r\n\nwith respect to  the 1988 mortgage.   It argues  that two  duties\r\n\ncannot  be in  conflict with  each other  if they  are identical.\r\n\nUnlike  in Page, ONB argues, where the attorney faced a potential\r                         \r\n\nconflict  between duties  to the  mortgagee client  and mortgagor\r\n\nnonclient because  they may have had different concerns about the\r\n\nstate of the title, Page, 445 N.E.2d at 153, both ONB and Milford\r                                  \r\n\nsimply wanted an accurate certificate of title.  That is true, as\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nfar as it goes.\r\n\n          However,  One National  misconstrues the  scope of  the\r\n\nduty to  the client that  Massachusetts courts  have focused  on.\r\n\n\"[A]n isolated  instance identity  of interests\" between  ONB and\r\n\nMilford  does not suffice to impose duty on Antonellis.

See  Austin, 836  F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp.  at  38 (citing  to  attorney's  \"concurrent obligation  of\r\n\nconfidentiality\" to his client).\r\n\n          Here,  contrary  to  ONB's  claim,  there  is  a  clear\r\n\npotential conflict rooted in Antonellis' duty of confidentiality.\r\n\nMilford knew  that there was  a first mortgage that  had not been\r\n\nreported.  Given  this, if we place a duty  to ONB on Antonellis'\r\n\nshoulders,  we put  on him  the obligation  to inform  it of  his\r\n\nerror.    That  mistake was  made  in  the  first transaction,  a\r\n\ntransaction to which One  National was not a party.   Antonellis'\r\n\npurported  duty  to  ONB  therefore  arose  only  in  the  second\r\n\ntransaction,  where that  bank  actually  was  a  party.      Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nHendrickson  v.

Ostensibly,  having  already\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nproduced the  certificate, his  duty  would be  to check  whether\r\n\nMilford subordinated the  debt, remind  it of his  error, and  if\r\n\nMilford  did not rectify  it, to do so  himself by informing ONB.\r\n\nClearly,  at that point a conflict in the duty of confidentiality\r\n\nwould  arise:    if  his  client  decided  not  to  pass  on  the\r\n\ninformation and Antonellis did  so in its stead, he  would breach\r\n\nhis duty of confidentiality.   See S.J.C.

If he did not\r\n\npass on the  information, he would  breach his duty  to ONB.   We\r\n\nrefuse to place  him in that position.   Therefore, we find  that\r\n\nthe potential for conflicts in Antonellis' duty to Milford and to\r\n\nONB bars  liability in this case.4   Cf. Austin, 836  F. Supp. at\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   The court below relied  on a different basis  in finding that\r\nthere was  a clear potential for conflict in this case.  It found\r\nthat ONB and  Milford were in the adverse positions  of buyer and\r\nseller in August 1988.  Since the courts have found that reliance\r\non  an adverse party's legal counsel in a business transaction is\r\nunreasonable as a matter of law, see Schlecht, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">621594</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  at\r                                                       \r\n* 7; Robertson,  536 N.E.2d at 350 n.6; Page,  445 N.E.2d at 154-\r                                                      \r\n55, the  court found that there was a potential for conflict.  It\r\nfound that Antonellis  would be under  different pressures if  he\r\nwere representing both Milford and ONB than if he represented ONB\r\nalone.  The court also commented on One National's failure to use\r\nits own counsel in the sales transaction.\r\n\n   One National  contests that Antonellis was  not representing a\r\nparty adverse to it, because he did  not represent Milford in the\r\nONB-Milford  sales transaction,  but  only in  the second  Milani\r\nmortgage.   When  he rendered  the  title certificate  at  issue,\r\nMilford and ONB were not yet adverse parties.\r\n\n   Because  we  find  that   One  National  fails  the  potential\r\nconflicts prong  of the  foreseeable reliance exception  on other\r\ngrounds,  we do not address  here whether the  district court was\r\ncorrect in finding that  ONB sought to rely on  the legal counsel\r\nof an adverse party.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n38 (refusing to infer a duty to disclose a client's insolvency to\r\n\nnonclient  investors  where  duty would  directly  conflict  with\r\n\nconcurrent obligation of confidentiality to client).\r\n\n          ONB contests that potential conflicts would  only arise\r\n\nif  Antonellis  had  represented  Milford as  the  seller  of the\r\n\nmortgages  in   the  second  transaction,  and   if  Milford  and\r\n\nAntonellis had intended to deceive ONB.  We disagree.  Neither of\r\n\nthese additional  facts are necessary for  potential conflicts to\r\n\narise.  First, ONB is relying  on the work Antonellis did for the\r\n\nfirst  transaction  --  whether  we  consider  ONB  as  Milford's\r\n\nreplacement in the  first transaction  or as a  party adverse  to\r\n\nMilford in the second is irrelevant to this analysis.  Second, as\r\n\nthe district court noted, there is no allegation that Milford and\r\n\nAntonellis colluded to deceive  ONB.  There are many  reasons why\r\n\nMilford  could fail to inform  ONB of the  faulty title.  Indeed,\r\n\neven if it did tell ONB about the problem, Antonellis could still\r\n\nface  a conflict in his  duty of confidentiality  if Milford made\r\n\nany  misrepresentations about the  circumstances under  which the\r\n\nerror  was made,  i.e. that it  too knew  of the  omission of the\r                                \r\n\nfirst  Milani mortgage.  Thus  we do not  accept ONB's contention\r\n\nthat there was no potential conflict.\r\n\n          3.   Kirkland Construction Co. v. James\r                    3.   Kirkland Construction Co. v.

There, the court faced a challenge to a lower  court's\r\n\ngrant of a 12(b)(6) motion under the Massachusetts Rules of Civil\r\n\nProcedure.   Kirkland,  a  contractor, was  asked  to renovate  a\r\n\nretail space for an office supply firm.  He sought and received a\r\n\nletter from  the firm's attorney, defendant  James, assuring that\r\n\nhis  client could pay for the  work.  However, after Kirkland had\r\n\nperformed under the  contract, the office  supply firm failed  to\r\n\npay.   Kirkland sued James and  the partners of his  law firm for\r\n\nnegligence, and the lower  court granted the defendants' 12(b)(6)\r\n\nmotion.   Id.  at  699-700.   The  court reversed,  finding  that\r                       \r\n\nKirkland was entitled to  seek relief from the attorneys  under a\r\n\ntheory of foreseeable reliance.

In  its\r                      \r\n\nanalysis, the  Kirkland  Court focused  on  who was  intended  to\r                                 \r\n\nbenefit  from  the letter:   \"an  independent  duty will  be more\r\n\nreadily  found where, as here, the service is intended to benefit\r\n\nthe  client as  well  as  the  third party.\"    Id.

That  is  not  true  here:    the\r\n\ncertificate   of   title   was   not  addressed   to   ONB,   the\r\n\nrepresentations were made  in boilerplate language with  standard\r\n\nexceptions  listed,  and  there  was an  express  disclaimer,  in\r\n\ncapital letters, on one of the two pages.\r\n\n          The Kirkland court also  listed a series of allegations\r                                \r\n\nin the plaintiff's complaint that, if proven, would be \"the stuff\r\n\nof liability.\"   658 N.E.2d at 701.

Even\r                                       \r\n\nif we  infer  that  Antonellis should  have  suspected  that  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  Nor can ONB argue that the purpose of Antonellis' work was  to\r\ninduce  the Milanis  into  the mortgage,  because  by law  it  is\r\nunreasonable for a mortgagee  to rely on mortgagor's  counsel, as\r\nmortgagee and mortgagor are adverse parties.

Before the  court  below,  it\r\ncontended that as assignee of the mortgage it \"had all the rights\r\nof Milford Savings Bank  once the mortgage was assigned  and duly\r\nrecorded  .  . . which  would  include  all  rights  against  the\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nentered into a contract  with Antonellis for the issuance  of the\r\n\ntitle certificate and then assigned the fruits of the contract to\r\n\nONB, ONB has the right  to proceed against Antonellis.  The  crux\r\n\nof  the  issue,   it  claims,  is  whether  the  certificate  was\r\n\ntransferrable by Milford to  ONB.  Essentially, ONB asks  that we\r\n\nallow it to step into Milford's shoes as a  client merely because\r\n\nit  was  assigned the  certificate that  was  the product  of the\r\n\nattorney-client relationship.  Noting  that the disclaimer barred\r\n\nreliance  by a  title  insurer, not  assignment,  it argues  that\r\n\nalthough  the  transferability  of  a certificate  of  title  has\r\n\napparently not  been addressed by the  Massachusetts courts, they\r\n\nwould  hold  the assignment  valid.   ONB  makes its  argument by\r\n\nanalogy  to  the law's  general  favor  towards assignability  of\r\n\ncontracts and  contract rights,  and the fact  that Massachusetts\r\n\nallows assignments  of many  types of claims,  including contract\r\n\ndamages.

It also makes an\r                       \r\n\nanalogy  to  other jurisdictions'  acceptance  of  assignments of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\ncertifying attorney Antonellis.\"   (Appdx.  at 50).   It did  not\r\nspecify which rights it referred to.  In its brief to this court,\r\nONB  argued that the  \"gist\" of the tort  of legal malpractice is\r\nthe  lawyer's breach of contract,  and that ONB  acquired a legal\r\nmalpractice  claim  with   the  certificate,  stating  that   \"if\r\nMilford's  assignment to  ONB is  treated as  an assignment  of a\r\nmalpractice  claim, the  Supreme  Judicial Court  would hold  the\r\nassignment valid.\"  (Brief of Appellant at 27).  Of course, since\r\nONB did  not raise below  a claim that a  legal malpractice claim\r\nwas assigned, they cannot do so here.

Gen. L.\r\n\nch.  93,   70.    It rejected  One  National's position  that  an\r\n\nassignee  should have  the same  fiduciary relationship  with the\r\n\nassignor's attorney  as  the assignor,  the  original  mortgagee,\r\n\nenjoyed, on  two bases.  We address the first, which draws on the\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nlanguage of section 70, in our discussion of that section, infra.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThe district  court's second  basis for rejecting  ONB's position\r\n\nwas  that ONB's argument  does not  arise out  of the  common law\r\n\ngoverning  the unique attorney-client  relationship -- a personal\r\n\nrelationship,  voluntarily   assumed,   which  is   governed   by\r\n\ndisciplinary rules.  Under de novo review, we  also find that the\r                                            \r\n\nattorney-client relationship between Antonellis and Milford plays\r\n\na  crucial  role  in  determining  whether  the  certificate  was\r\n\ntransferable.\r\n\n          Massachusetts  case law offers little specific guidance\r\n\non this issue, but we find that an analysis of their treatment of\r\n\nthe  attorney-client relationship  in the  context of  claims for\r\n\nnegligent certification of title  proves illustrative.  First, as\r\n\nwas noted above, the  nature of the attorney-client relationship,\r\n\nincluding the  obligation of  confidentiality and  application of\r\n\nthe  disciplinary  rules,  has  consistently been  cited  by  the\r\n\nMassachusetts courts  within this  context.  See,  e.g., Spinner,\r                                                                          \r\n\n631 N.E.2d at 545.  This indicates that the courts do not see the\r\n\nattorney-client relationship in this context as inherently  weak,\r\n\nas ONB suggests.   Significantly, in Hendrickson  v. Sears, which\r                                                                    \r\n\ninvolved  a suit  by the  purchasers of  real estate  against the\r\n\nattorney they hired  for the  title search, the  Court noted  the\r\n\ndifferences between legal and  medical malpractice actions in its\r\n\nanalysis, 310 N.E.2d at 134, and commented that\r\n\n            [t]he client is not an expert;  he cannot\r\n            be  expected  to  recognize  professional\r\n            negligence if  he sees it,  and he should\r\n            not  be  expected   to  watch  over   the\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n            professional  or  to   retain  a   second\r\n            professional to  do so.   The relation of\r\n            attorney and client  is highly  fiduciary\r\n            in its nature.\r\n\nId. at  135.  Nowhere does the  Court's language suggest that the\r             \r\n\nfiduciary relationship  of an  attorney and client  is diminished\r\n\nbecause   the  services   the  attorney   rendered  were   highly\r\n\nstandardized.   Similarly,  in  Schlecht v.  Smith, the  district\r                                                            \r\n\ncourt addressed the attorney's failure to record the mortgage, at\r\n\nhis  client's request,  within  the context  of the  disciplinary\r\n\nrules.

Again, nothing suggests\r                          \r\n\nthat the rules' force is somehow diminished.\r\n\n          Second,  in Fall  River Savings  Bank v.  Callahan, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nAppeals Court  of Massachusetts noted the  standardized nature of\r\n\ntitle searches.   463 N.E.2d  at 561  (\"There may be  no definite\r\n\nrules  which  prescribe  a  right  or  wrong  way  to  conduct  a\r\n\ndeposition  but  certain rules  have  evolved  for passing  on  a\r\n\ntitle.\").  The court found that fact significant in deciding that\r\n\na court may use commentaries to establish the standard of care in\r\n\nthe  land  conveyance  context, since  that  is  an  area of  law\r\n\npractice \"which lends itself  particularly to formulation through\r\n\ndecisional  law  and  commentary   as  to  what  are  appropriate\r\n\nprocedures.\"   Id.  But even as it recognized the standardization\r                            \r\n\nof this area, the  Court treated the attorney-client relationship\r\n\nas it would  in any other  context, as carrying  with it all  the\r\n\nattendant duties and responsibilities.  Id.\r                                                     \r\n\n          This approach  makes intuitive sense.   Even though the\r\n\npractices for searching title  are standardized, the disciplinary\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nrules apply  as they  would in any  attorney-client relationship,\r\n\nand  the attorney is subject  to liability for  malpractice.  The\r\n\nduties  attendant  to  the  fiduciary  relationship  between  the\r\n\nattorney and  client are in full  force.  See Dunne,  125 N.E. at\r                                                             \r\n\n561  (noting  that  the  principles  relating  to  an  attorney's\r\n\nfiduciary  duties  \"are  recognized   as  binding  in  all  their\r\n\namplitude.\").   Thus the unspecified public  policy concerns that\r\n\nONB tells us  would not be jeopardized --  presumably, protecting\r\n\nthe   attorney's   ability   to  function   effectively,   client\r\n\nconfidentiality, the  integrity of  the  bench and  bar, and  the\r\n\nethical  administration of  justice, see  Berman v.

Gen. L. ch. 93,   70.  Under that section, an\r\n\nattorney  rendering a certificate of title for a mortgagee may be\r\n\nsubject to liability to the mortgagor as well:\r\n\n               The   liability    of   any   attorney\r\n            rendering  such  certification  shall  be\r\n            limited    to    the   amount    of   the\r\n            consideration  shown  on  the  deed  with\r\n            respect  to the  mortgagor, and  shall be\r\n            limited to the original  principal amount\r\n            secured  by the mortgage  with respect to\r\n            the mortgagee.  Said  certification shall\r\n            be  effective  for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n            mortgagor  so long as  said mortgagor has\r\n            title  to  the  mortgaged  premises,  and\r\n            shall be effective for the benefit of the\r\n            mortgagee  so long  as the  original debt\r\n            secured by the mortgage remains unpaid.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 93,   70.   The loan or credit  secured by the\r\n\npurchase money first mortgage must be on real estate with between\r\n\none and four dwellings, to be occupied by the mortgagor.  Id.\r                                                                       \r\n\n          ONB argues that because it  holds the mortgage it falls\r\n\nwithin the scope of  \"mortgagee\" as used in section 70,  and that\r\n\nAntonellis is thus liable to it.  Noting that section 70 operates\r\n\nin a  manner analogous  to a  statute of  limitations in that  it\r\n\nprovides that  the title certification  will remain in  effect so\r\n\nlong as  the original  debt is  unpaid,  ONB argues  it would  be\r\n\nunreasonable  to argue that  the attorney's  liability disappears\r\n\nwhen a  mortgage is sold,  no matter whether or  not the original\r\n\ndebt  is unpaid.  Further, ONB notes  that the sale of a mortgage\r\n\nneither enlarges  the attorney's liability,  as it is  limited by\r\n\nthe statute, nor  changes the nature  of the liability.   As  ONB\r\n\nstates, one bank  is simply  substituted for another:   all  else\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nremains  constant.   Thus  the  attorney  remains liable  on  the\r\n\ncertificate until the mortgage debt is paid.\r\n\n          Upon  de novo review, we agree  with the district court\r                                 \r\n\nthat,  while One  National's argument  makes intuitive  sense, it\r\n\neventually fails.  First, like the  court below, we find that the\r\n\nplain language  of the statute  does not support  ONB's position.\r\n\nIt  is a basic tenet  of statutory interpretation  that where the\r\n\nplain language  of a statute  is clear,  it governs.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Clearly, the legislature did\r\n\nnot  intend for  section 70  to provide  that a  commercial bank,\r\n\nwhich  neither  paid  for  the attorney's  services  nor  had any\r\n\ncontact with the attorney,  be entitled to the protection  of the\r\n\nsection merely because it was assigned the mortgage.  In the face\r\n\nof the  plain language  of the  statute,  and in  the absence  of\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nlegislative  action to  the  contrary, we  reject One  National's\r\n\nargument that Antonellis is liable to it under section 70.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          In  this case, as in  all cases involving an allegation\r\n\nthat an  attorney failed in  a duty  to a nonclient,  there is  a\r\n\ntension between  two concerns.   On one hand,  we do not  want to\r\n\nextend liability so widely that an  attorney faces \"'liability in\r\n\nan  indeterminate   amount  for  an  indeterminate   time  to  an\r\n\nindeterminate  class.'\"   Craig  v.

On the other hand, we do\r                     \r\n\nnot  want to reward an attorney's carelessness.  See Spinner, 631\r                                                                      \r\n\nN.E.2d  at 545  (noting policy considerations  against sheltering\r\n\nattorney's negligence  from suit  in will-drafting context).   In\r\n\nfinding  that  Antonellis'  liability  does  not  extend  to  One\r\n\nNational, we  are cognizant  that on  the surface  we seem  to be\r\n\nprotecting  him from suit for  his negligence.   However, we note\r\n\nthat ordinarily, ONB would have  recourse against Milford for the\r\n\nfaulty  title, and Milford in turn could bring a negligence claim\r\n\nagainst  Antonellis, as its lawyer.   See id.  (noting that trust\r                                                       \r\n\nbeneficiaries could  sue the trustees,  and the trustees  in turn\r\n\ncould bring an action  against their attorneys, but beneficiaries\r\n\ncould  not directly  sue trustees'  attorneys).   Because Milford\r\n\nfailed, ONB has lost  that option.  ONB, essentially, took a risk\r\n\nin   deciding  not  to  get  its  own  title  insurance  for  the\r\n\ntransaction.    It  was a  calculated  risk,  and  it required  a\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ncomplicated  chain  of  events  --  Antonellis'  negligence,  the\r\n\nMilanis' default,  Milford's failure, and the  FDIC's repudiation\r\n\nof the claim -- to make that risk fail to pay off.  We  refuse to\r\n\nspot  ONB's choice  to take that  risk with  the safety  net of a\r\n\nnegligence  claim against Antonellis.   Cf.  Page, 445  N.E.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n154-55  (\"Where, as here, a  nonclient takes the  chance that the\r\n\nclient's interests  are in harmony with  his own, and  does so in\r\n\nthe face of an express warning that the interests may differ, his\r\n\nclaim of  foreseeable reliance cannot be  rescued simply because,\r\n\nin retrospect, the interests are shown not to have differed.\").\r\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons,  the order of  the district\r\n\ncourt  granting  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  Antonellis  is\r\n\naffirmed.\r          affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n</pre>",
