Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Schwarzer, Senior District Judge.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\nHenry W. Griffin, by appointment of the Court, for appellant.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and George T.\r\nDilworth, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                   August 17, 1998\r\n                                      \r\n     TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Appellant was charged, tried and\r\nconvicted by a jury pursuant to allegations contained in a multiple\r\ncount indictment in which the government claimed that he conspired\r\nto distribute a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n841 and 846, and engaged in violations of 18 U.S.C.\r\n922(g)(1), 922(g)(3), 924(c)(1), 924(e)(1), and 26 U.S.C.\r\n5841, 5861(d), and 5871, which all deal with the felonious\r\npossession of firearms in various circumstances.  Thereafter, he\r\nwas sentenced to imprisonment for 420 months to be followed by 8\r\nyears of supervised release.\r\n     Five issues are raised on appeal: (1) the legality of the\r\nsearch that led to the charges for which appellant was prosecuted\r\nand convicted; (2) the sufficiency of the evidence presented to\r\nestablish proof beyond a reasonable doubt (and thus the validity of\r\nthe district court's ruling denying appellant's motion for judgment\r\nof acquittal); (3) the district court's failure to declare a\r\nmistrial upon appellant's motion after alleged juror misconduct was\r\ncalled to the court's attention; (4) whether the district court's\r\ninstructions to the jury regarding the government's allegedly\r\nimproper statements in its closing argument were sufficient to\r\navoid the need for a new trial; and (5) whether appellant was\r\nproperly sentenced as an \"armed career criminal.\"  These issues\r\nwill be discussed seriatim.  In a separate brief, appellant\r\nchallenges pro se the admission of certain evidence as well as\r\ncertain remarks made by the government in its opening statement. \r\nWe address these pro se arguments at the end of the opinion. \r\nUltimately, we affirm the rulings of the district court.\r\nI.  The Motion To Suppress\r\n     A.  The facts\r\n     At approximately 1:22 a.m. on August 23, 1996, appellant\r\nwas detained by a state policeman for driving at 88 mph, which is\r\nin excess of the legal speed limit of 65 mph for the Maine\r\nTurnpike. As the officer approached appellant's vehicle, he\r\nobserved a commotion among the occupants.  There were three young\r\nmales in the back seat, an adult female in front next to the\r\ndriver, and an adult male driver.  The officer asked the driver,\r\nwho turned out to be appellant, to step outside the vehicle and to\r\nproduce his driver's license, vehicle registration and insurance\r\ndocumentation.  While this was taking place, the officer noticed\r\nthat appellant's shirt was untucked, whereupon he asked appellant\r\nto lift his shirt so that his waistband was exposed.  Nothing\r\nunusual was revealed.\r\n     The officer then conducted a patdown search of appellant,\r\nduring the course of which he discovered a jackknife and a syringe\r\nand needle in his pants pockets.  Appellant was placed under arrest\r\nfor possession of illegal drug paraphernalia.\r\nAfter appellant was arrested, the officer proceeded to\r\nsearch the other occupants of the car.  The sum of $5,000 cash was\r\ndiscovered in the purse of the female passenger, who was later\r\nidentified as appellant's then-girlfriend Ericka Thibodeau, and a\r\n9-mm pistol was recovered from her person.  Thereafter, the officer\r\nfound an ammunition magazine for the pistol on the floor of the car\r\nbetween the front and back seats.  An additional magazine and three\r\nloose rounds were later found on the floor of the officer's car,\r\ndirectly behind where appellant had been placed after his arrest. \r\nTwo rounds of 9-mm ammunition were also found tucked between the\r\ncushions of the seat that appellant had occupied.\r\nB.   Was the pat-down of appellant a permissible Terry      stop and frisk?\r\n\nAppellant questions the validity of his frisk by the\r\nMaine officer as being beyond the scope permitted by Terry v. Ohio,\r\n392 U.S. 1 (1968), and seeks the suppression of all evidence\r\ndiscovered, claiming it is \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"  Wong Sunv. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485-86 (1963).  In this respect it\r\nis important to keep in mind that the district court's findings of\r\nfact are reviewable only for clear error, although its legal\r\nconclusions receive de novo treatment.  See Ornelas v. United\r\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S. Ct. 1657, 1663 (1996).\r\nBecause appellant concedes that Terry permits the police\r\nto stop a person to investigate upon a reasonable suspicion that a\r\ncrime has been committed, and because appellant does not contest\r\nthe fact that he was violating the speed limit when he was stopped,\r\nour inquiry is narrow in scope.  Was appellant's search after the\r\nlegitimate stop reasonable under the circumstances? \r\nWe first look to whether the officer acted properly in\r\nordering appellant to step outside his vehicle upon being stopped. \r\nThe district court in effect concluded that the officer's\r\nsuspicions were justifiably heightened, not only by the abrupt\r\nmanner in which appellant's vehicle pulled over and came to a stop,\r\nbut \"by the exaggerated level of movement of the occupants of the\r\ncar as it came to a stop, particularly those of the passenger in\r\nthe right front seat.\"  Given these findings, which are fully\r\nsupported by the record, the officer's request that appellant step\r\noutside his automobile was justified.  See Maryland v. Wilson, 519\r\nU.S. 408,   , 117 S. Ct. 882, 885 (1997) (noting that, once vehicle\r\nlawfully stopped for traffic violation, constitutionally\r\npermissible for officer to order driver to get out of vehicle).\r\nThe next and final step of this inquiry is whether\r\nappellant's frisk, which provided the immediate cause for his\r\narrest and which uncovered some of the incriminating evidence for\r\nwhich he was charged and convicted, was appropriate under Terry.\r\nThis step need not detain us long.  Analyzing the\r\npropriety of a frisk involves a two-part inquiry, in which no\r\nsingle factor is controlling: \"first . . . [one must determine]\r\nwhether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and\r\nsecond, whether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to\r\nthe circumstances which justified the interference in the first\r\nplace.\"  United States v. Walker, 924 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(quoting United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54, 55 (1st Cir.\r\n1990)).  The court must consider the circumstances as a whole, and\r\nmust balance the nature of the intrusion with the governmental\r\ninterests that are served.  United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221,\r\n228 (1985).\r\nThe circumstances of this stop are such that the officer\r\nwould have been \"foolhardy\" not to have frisked appellant for\r\nweapons.  See Walker, 924 F.2d at 4.  In particular, the time of\r\nday and location of the incident, the excessive speed at which the\r\nvehicle was driven, the manner in which it came to a stop, and the\r\nunexplained commotion among its occupants who outnumbered the\r\npolice officer five to one, was sufficient cause to conduct the\r\ninitial limited patdown of appellant's front pants pockets, in\r\nwhich contraband was in fact discovered.  What followed has been\r\nfully recounted and need not be repeated, but was certainly not\r\n\"poisoned fruit.\"\r\n\"The Fourth Amendment by its terms prohibits\r\n'unreasonable' searches and seizures.\"  New York v. Class, 475 U.S.\r\n106, 116 (1986).  The stop and ensuing search were reasonable under\r\nthe circumstances and thus the ruling of the district court denying\r\nsuppression of the evidence is affirmed.\r\nII.  The Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nIn considering a motion for judgment of acquittal, both\r\nthe trial and reviewing courts must evaluate the evidence and such\r\nreasonable inferences as arise therefrom in the light most\r\nfavorable to the government.  United States v. Loder, 23 F. 3d 586,\r\n589 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nAppellant's arguments go principally to the credibility\r\nof various government witnesses, and are thus in large measure\r\naddressed to the wrong forum.  See United States v. Meader, 118\r\nF.3d 876, 881 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding credibility assessments to\r\nbe uniquely the domain of the jury).\r\nA.  18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1)\r\nCount VII of the indictment charges appellant with using\r\nand carrying a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1). Since\r\nthis relates to the use or carrying of a firearm during and in\r\nrelation to the drug crime alleged in Count I, we must look first\r\nto the government's proof in that respect. \r\nIn Count I of the indictment, appellant was charged with\r\nengaging in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in violation of\r\n21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) and 846.  At least 8 witnesses testified\r\nthat throughout the summer of 1996, they and others purchased crack\r\ncocaine from appellant.  Each of these witnesses corroborated the\r\nother seven, and their testimony was also confirmed by the\r\nintroduction of evidence seized from appellant's premises, which\r\nincluded cash, drugs, and drug paraphernalia.  Viewing this\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom\r\nin the light most favorable to the government, we find that there\r\nwas enough evidence to allow a reasonable jury to convict on Count\r\nI.\r\nTurning to the proof regarding Count VII, the evidence is\r\nequally overwhelming that appellant carried the 9-mm pistol that\r\nwas introduced into evidence during the various phases of his drug\r\ndeals, including during purchases, transportation, and, most bone-\r\nchillingly described by several witnesses, during drug-debt-\r\ncollection episodes.  Count VII was well proven.\r\nB.  18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1)\r\nThe above evidence is also relevant to the Count VIII\r\ncharge which alleges his condition as a felon in possession with\r\nrespect to the 9-mm pistol.  There is no question that appellant\r\nwas a three-time felon, and that he was in possession of a firearm. \r\nThus, Count VIII was established.\r\nThis evidence is equally applicable to Count IX, with the\r\nslight variation that appellant is charged there with knowing\r\npossession of the seven rounds of 9-mm ammunition discovered in\r\nvarious places where he had passed through during his travails. \r\nAppellant's disavowals as to this evidence were appropriately\r\nbrought to the attention of the jurors, who were entitled to give\r\nhis contention the weight that they considered it deserved.  We see\r\nno reason to disturb their conclusion.\r\nC.  The sawed-off shotgun\r\nCount X is again a variation of the prior felon-in-\r\npossession theme, this one involving a sawed-off shotgun. \r\nWitnesses testified that the shotgun was purchased and paid for at\r\nappellant's behest, and that thereafter he took possession of this\r\nweapon.  Appellant was a felon and he was in possession of a\r\nfirearm -- end of matter.\r\nIn Count XI, appellant was charged with possessing an\r\nunregistered sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C.  5841,\r\n5861, and 5871.  A witness testified to helping appellant to saw\r\nthe barrel off the shotgun referred to in Count X, which in fact he\r\nthereafter used to terrorize this same witness.  This weapon was\r\nless than 26 \"overall, with a barrel shorter than 18,\" and was not\r\nregistered in appellant's name in the National Firearms\r\nRegistration and Transfer Record.  Nothing further need be proven\r\nto establish the violations charged in Count XI of the indictment.\r\nLastly, Count XII which charges appellant, an illegal\r\ndrug user, with possession of the shotgun in contravention to 18\r\nU.S.C.  922(g)(3) and 924(e)(1), was also clearly established\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nIII.  Alleged juror misconduct and denial of mistrial motion\r\n\"When a non-frivolous suggestion is made that a jury may\r\nbe biased or tainted by some incident, the district court must\r\nundertake an adequate inquiry to determine whether the alleged\r\nincident occurred and if so, whether it was prejudicial.\"  UnitedStates v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1306 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st Cir.\r\n1993)).  The trial judge is \"vested with the discretion to fashion\r\nan appropriate and responsible procedure to determine whether\r\nmisconduct actually occurred and whether it was prejudicial.\" \r\nOrtiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d at 442.  A district court has wide\r\nlatitude in responding to such a claim, Meader, 118 F.3d at 880,\r\nand thus, the course of inquiry that is selected is reviewable only\r\nfor patent abuse of discretion.  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d\r\n230, 258 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\nDuring a recess in the trial of this case, court\r\npersonnel overheard three jurors discussing some of the evidence\r\nagainst appellant, conduct which was contrary to instructions\r\npreviously given by the district judge to the jury.  This\r\ninformation was made known to the trial judge, who promptly\r\ncommunicated the incident to trial counsel, requesting their views\r\nas to how to proceed.  Appellant was of the view that only a\r\nmistrial was sufficient to correct the situation.  The trial court\r\nopined that further inquiry was required before such a drastic\r\nmeasure would be taken, and decided instead to summarily excuse the\r\nthree jurors involved, preventing any further contact between them\r\nand the other jurors, and investigate whether any of the remaining\r\njurors had been contaminated.\r\nIn the presence of counsel, the trial judge separately\r\nexamined two of the remaining jurors who were physically in the\r\nvicinity of the offending jurors and might have overheard their\r\nconversation.  Upon being questioned, they denied any knowledge of\r\nthe incident.  Thereafter, the court summoned the remaining jurors\r\nas a group, admonished them to be candid, and explained to them\r\nwhat had happened regarding the excused jurors.  He then asked the\r\nassembled jurors whether any of them had overheard the three jurors\r\ntalking, whether they had heard any talk about the shotgun which\r\nwas the subject of the transgressing jurors' conversation, and\r\nfinally, whether any of them had made up their minds about the\r\ncase.  No juror responded in the affirmative to any of these\r\nquestions.  Thereafter, the court denied appellant's motion for\r\nmistrial and properly corrected any possible damage to the\r\nintegrity of the trial.\r\nGiven the circumstances we have described, we are of the\r\nview that the trial judge acted well within his discretion in\r\ndenying a mistrial.\r\nIV.  Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct During Closing Argument\r\nAppellant did not give up his quest for a new trial. \r\nDuring the course of closing argument, counsel for appellant\r\nlikened the government's witnesses to individuals who were trying\r\nto outrun the appellant while all were running from the federal\r\ngovernment, which was portrayed as a voracious bear.  In his\r\nrebuttal, government counsel responded to this allegory with his\r\nown version of what was going on, stating that \"the man that [was]\r\ntrying to outrun the bear is [appellant]\" in contrast to other\r\npersons, which he named individually, who had \"been caught by the\r\nbear and [had] accepted responsibility.\"  The government went on to\r\nask rhetorically, \"Who is the man that is running?\"\r\nShortly after these statements were made, the government\r\nended its rebuttal and the trial judge called a recess prior to\r\ncharging the jury.  At that point, defense counsel challenged the\r\npropriety of these remarks as disparaging appellant's exercise of\r\nhis constitutional right to a trial, and requested that a mistrial\r\nbe declared.  The district court denied appellant's petition,\r\nruling that the objection was tardy in that it is \"incumbent upon\r\ncounsel when there is improper argument immediately to cut it off\r\nand to give the judge a chance to address it right there and that\r\nwas not done. . . .\"  In view of this ruling, appellant's counsel\r\nstated that, \"[i]n the alternative [he] would ask for some sort of\r\ninstruction . . . that says, I think you may have instructed this\r\nalready, a person accused of a crime has a constitutional right to\r\na trial.\"  The trial judge responded that he would \"give that\r\ninstruction again as part of the proposed speaking draft of the\r\ninstructions,\" to which defense counsel once more stated:\r\nCOUNSEL:  That would be what I would request\r\nsimply to reiterate that a defendant has a\r\nconstitutional right to a trial.  Could there\r\nbe something like no adverse inference can be\r\ndrawn from the fact that a defendant exercised\r\nhis constitutional right?\r\n\nTHE COURT:  Yes, I'll say something.\r\n\nCOUNSEL:  Do you want me to draft it or simply\r\nrely on the Court?\r\n\nTHE COURT: I will draft it. Listen carefully. \r\nIf you don't like it, you will have a chance\r\nto object.\r\n\nThe trial judge, at the appropriate time, proceeded to give the\r\nappropriate instructions, at which point he allowed all counsel the\r\nopportunity to object to the instructions given or to request\r\nfurther instructions.  No such thing happened.  See United Statesv. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that\r\nfailure to renew objections after charge constitutes waiver of any\r\nclaim of error).\r\nThere should be little doubt that appellant's claim of\r\nerror is not well taken.  To begin with, the trial judge was\r\ncorrect in ruling that a timely objection was not made.  In this\r\nday and age we need not elaborate at length as to the consequences\r\nof such a failure.  Suffice it to say that it constitutes a waiver\r\nof rights unless the error committed and not objected to is of such\r\na  magnitude as to have \"so poisoned the well that the trial's\r\noutcome was likely affected.\"  United States v. Meja-Lozano, 829\r\nF.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir. 1987).  Of course, no such thing has taken\r\nplace here.  The weight and quantity of the evidence against\r\nappellant was nothing short of overwhelming, which places any\r\nhypothetical error committed in this respect in the \"harmless\"\r\ncategory.  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).    \r\nTo this we should add that the district court found, and\r\nthe record supports, that the allegedly inappropriate comments by\r\ngovernment counsel were not deliberate.  We have uncovered nothing\r\nthat would lead us to conclude that this was anything but an\r\nisolated slip.  Id.  Lastly, the aforementioned exchange between\r\nappellant's counsel and the district judge leave us with the clear\r\nconviction that the proposed solution not only was accepted, but\r\neffectively protected appellant's rights.  Id.\r\nAny error that may have occurred was harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.  See United States v. Hastings, 461 U.S. 499, 508\r\n(1983) (\"harmless error rule governs even constitutional violations\r\nunder some circumstances\").\r\nV.  Alleged Sentencing Errors\r\nUnder Guideline section 4B1.4, \"[t]he offense level for\r\nan armed career criminal is the greatest of\" three options.  The\r\nfirst is the offense level that results from ordinary Guidelines\r\ncomputations.  The second option is \"the offense level from  4B1.1\r\n[Career Offender], if applicable . . . .\"  See U.S.S.G.  4(b)(2). \r\nThe third alternative sets the offense level at 34 if the defendant\r\nused a firearm in the commission of a drug or violent crime, or\r\npossessed a sawed-off shotgun.  See U.S.S.G.  4B1.4(b)(3)(A).\r\nAppellant claims that the trial court committed five\r\nerrors in imposing the sentence from which he appeals.  Four of\r\nthese challenges are ultimately mooted by our affirmance of his\r\nArmed Career Criminal status.  The four include attacks on the\r\nenhancements under U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5), and 3A1.3\r\nbased on the quantity of the drugs.  In addition, appellant\r\nchallenges his Armed Career Criminal status on the ground that one\r\nof the predicate offenses was a conviction for an attempted\r\ncriminal drug sale and, as an attempt, does not meet the definition\r\nof a \"controlled substance offense\" under U.S.S.G.  4B1.2. \r\nApplication Note 1, however, specifically includes in \"controlled\r\nsubstance offense\" the offense of attempting to commit such\r\noffense.\r\nBecause appellant qualified as an Armed Career Criminal\r\nunder  4B1.1, his offense level was geared to the statutory\r\nmaximum for the offense of the conviction.  In the present case,\r\nonce appellant's enhancing information was filed as required by 21\r\nU.S.C.  851, the maximum sentence for his offense became life\r\nimprisonment, which has a minimum offense level of 37.  The\r\ndistrict court having correctly sentenced appellant based upon an\r\nadjusted total offense level of 37, we need not consider\r\nappellant's other challenges of his sentence.\r\nVI.  Appellant's Pro Se Arguments\r\nAppellant contends that the district court erred in\r\nallowing the testimony of Susan Cronin, whom the government failed\r\nto include on its initial witness list.  Prior to trial, the court\r\nattributed the government's omission to \"inadvertence,\" but agreed\r\nto allow Cronin to testify as long as none of the jurors knew or\r\nhad heard of her.  Appellant's counsel did not object to this\r\napproach either when it was proposed, or at the time the trial\r\njudge asked the jurors whether they knew Cronin.  We note that\r\n\"[e]ven when the government has produced a witness list . . . in\r\nadvance, when a witness . . . not previously listed is offered, the\r\ndecision to admit the testimony . . . is within the discretion of\r\nthe trial judge.\"  See United States v. Reis, 788 F.2d 54, 58 (1st\r\nCir. 1986).\r\nIt was well within the district court judge's discretion\r\nto allow Cronin to testify.  Nothing in the record suggests that\r\nappellant was prejudiced by the government's failure to include\r\nCronin's name on the initial witness list.  Since no member of the\r\njury had heard of Cronin prior to trial, the integrity of the jury\r\nremained intact.  Furthermore, appellant had sufficient time to\r\nprepare for Cronin's testimony because she did not testify\r\nimmediately after being offered as a potential witness, but rather,\r\nlater in the trial, as the government's ninth witness.\r\nAppellant also objects to the substance of Cronin's\r\ntestimony, which helped authenticate photographs of bruises\r\ninflicted on Ericka Thibodeau by appellant on September 4, 1996. \r\nAppellant avers that, under Fed. R. Evid. 403, the prejudicial\r\nimpact of the photographs far outweighed their probative value.  On\r\nappeal, we afford a district court's Rule 403 balancing substantial\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Lowe, 145 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  The district court allowed the photographs into evidence as\r\nprobative of Thibodeau's credibility.  The trial judge, after due\r\nconsideration of the photographs' potential prejudicial impact,\r\ndetermined that while the photographs were \"unpleasant,\" they were\r\nnot \"gruesome.\"  Accordingly, the trial judge concluded \"[t]here is\r\nnothing prejudicial about the jury being able to see by way of\r\ncorroboration of [Thibodeau's] testimony what it is that\r\n[appellant] did to her.\"  Finding no abuse of discretion, we\r\ndecline to disturb the district court's ruling on the admissibility\r\nof the photographic evidence.\r\nAppellant contests the admission of Thibodeau's\r\nstatements to Cronin as excited utterances under Fed. R. Evid. 803. \r\nRule 803(2) allows the admission of hearsay, even though the\r\ndeclarant is available as a witness, if the statement is one\r\n\"relating to a startling event or condition made while the\r\ndeclarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or\r\ncondition.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 803(2).  The statements at issue were\r\nmade on September 4th at approximately 8:00 a.m., shortly after\r\nThibodeau arrived at the battered women's shelter where Cronin was\r\nemployed.  The evidence suggests that while the September 4th\r\nbeating lasted until 4:00 a.m., Thibodeau was unable to escape the\r\napartment where the assault occurred until some period after that\r\ntime.  It is likely that Thibodeau continued to suffer from the\r\ntrauma of the beating when she fled to the women's shelter, and\r\nthus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing\r\nher statements into evidence as excited utterances.\r\nFinally, appellant challenges statements made by the\r\ngovernment in its opening statement to the jury.  Since appellant\r\nfailed to object to any of these challenged statements on the\r\nrecord, we engage in plain error review.  See United States v.\r\nSullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 748 (1st Cir. 1996).  Under the plain error\r\nstandard of review, \"appellant bears the burden of persuasion to\r\nestablish that there was an error, that the error was clear or\r\nobvious, and that the error affected substantial rights.\"  United\r\nStates v. Shifman, 124 F.3d 31, 38-39 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal\r\nquotations and citation omitted).  In its opening statement, the\r\ngovernment told the jury that a weapon was found in the police\r\ncruiser where appellant had been detained when, in fact, only\r\nammunition had been discovered.  The prosecution also stated that\r\nappellant admitted to owning the ammunition found in the cruiser to\r\na police officer, but the evidence shows that appellant did not\r\nmake such a statement to the officer.  Lastly, the government\r\nstated that a shotgun and cocaine had been found in  certain parts\r\nof an apartment although evidence failed to link the weapon and\r\ndrugs to those exact locations.\r\nAppellant does not make any particularized allegations of\r\nbad faith on the part of the government in making its opening\r\nstatement.  Moreover, the evidence presented at trial would have\r\ncorrected any jury misperception arising from the government's\r\nopening statement.  The arresting officer testified that he had\r\ndiscovered only ammunition, not a weapon, in his cruiser.  In\r\naddition, the evidence showed that appellant told Thibodeau he had\r\ndropped his ammunition in the cruiser.  Finally, the evidence\r\nconnected appellant to the shotgun and drugs found in the\r\napartment, rendering the exact location of the contraband\r\nirrelevant.  It is important to note that, while a curative\r\ninstruction was neither requested of nor issued by the district\r\ncourt, appellant's counsel, in his opening statement, which\r\nimmediately followed the government's opening, stated, \"I would\r\nlike to make it clear these opening statements are not evidence.\" \r\nUnder these circumstance, we find no plain error.  Cf. United\r\nStates v. Ferrera, 746 F.2d 908, 910-11 (1st Cir. 1984) (no plain\r\nerror where very little prejudice resulted from improper remark in\r\ngovernment's opening statement).\r\nThe rulings of the district court are affirmed in all\r\nrespects.\n",

In a separate brief, appellant challenges pro se the admission of certain evidence as well as certain remarks made by the government in its opening statement.  We address these pro se arguments at the end of the opinion.  Ultimately, we affirm the rulings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. The Motion To Suppress</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 1:22 a.m. on August 23, 1996, appellant was detained by a state policeman for driving at 88 mph, which is in excess of the legal speed limit of 65 mph for the Maine Turnpike.  As the officer approached appellant's vehicle, he observed a commotion among the occupants.  There were three young males in the back seat, an adult female in front next to the driver, and an adult male driver.  The officer asked the driver, who turned out to be appellant, to step outside the vehicle and to produce his driver's license, vehicle registration and insurance documentation.  While this was taking place, the officer noticed that appellant's shirt was untucked, whereupon he asked appellant to lift his shirt so that his waistband was exposed.  Nothing unusual was revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officer then conducted a patdown search of appellant, during the course of which he discovered a jackknife and a syringe and needle in his pants pockets.  Appellant was placed under arrest for possession of illegal drug paraphernalia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After appellant was arrested, the officer proceeded to search the other occupants of the car.  The sum of $5,000 cash was discovered in the purse of the female passenger, who was later identified as appellant's then-girlfriend Ericka Thibodeau, and a 9-mm pistol was recovered from her person. Thereafter, the officer found an ammunition magazine for the pistol on the floor of the car between the front and back seats.  An additional magazine and three loose rounds were later found on the floor of the officer's car, directly behind where appellant had been placed after his arrest.  Two rounds of 9-mm ammunition were also found tucked between the cushions of the seat that appellant had occupied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Was the pat-down of appellant a permissible Terry stop and frisk?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant questions the validity of his frisk by the Maine officer as being beyond the scope permitted by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and seeks the suppression of all evidence discovered, claiming it is \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"  Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485-86, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).  In this respect it is important to keep in mind that the district court's findings of fact are reviewable only for clear error, although its legal conclusions receive de novo treatment.  See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant concedes that Terry permits the police to stop a person to investigate upon a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, and because appellant does not contest the fact that he was violating the speed limit when he was stopped, our inquiry is narrow in scope.  Was appellant's search after the legitimate stop reasonable under the circumstances?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first look to whether the officer acted properly in ordering appellant to step outside his vehicle upon being stopped.  The district court in effect concluded that the officer's suspicions were justifiably heightened, not only by the abrupt manner in which appellant's vehicle pulled over and came to a stop, but \"by the exaggerated level of movement of the occupants of the car as it came to a stop, particularly those of the passenger in the right front seat.\"   Given these findings, which are fully supported by the record, the officer's request that appellant step outside his automobile was justified.  See Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 885, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997) (noting that, once vehicle lawfully stopped for traffic violation, constitutionally permissible for officer to order driver to get out of vehicle).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next and final step of this inquiry is whether appellant's frisk, which provided the immediate cause for his arrest and which uncovered some of the incriminating evidence for which he was charged and convicted, was appropriate under Terry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This step need not detain us long.  Analyzing the propriety of a frisk involves a two-part inquiry, in which no single factor is controlling:  \"first ... [one must determine] whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and second, whether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\"  United States v. Walker, 924 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54, 55 (1st Cir.1990)).  The court must consider the circumstances as a whole, and must balance the nature of the intrusion with the governmental interests that are served.  United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 228, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances of this stop are such that the officer would have been \"foolhardy\" not to have frisked appellant for weapons.  See Walker, 924 F.2d at 4. In particular, the time of day and location of the incident, the excessive speed at which the vehicle was driven, the manner in which it came to a stop, and the unexplained commotion among its occupants who outnumbered the police officer five to one, was sufficient cause to conduct the initial limited patdown of appellant's front pants pockets, in which contraband was in fact discovered.  What followed has been fully recounted and need not be repeated, but was certainly not \"poisoned fruit.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Fourth Amendment by its terms prohibits 'unreasonable' searches and seizures.\"  New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106, 116, 106 S.Ct. 960, 89 L.Ed.2d 81 (1986).  The stop and ensuing search were reasonable under the circumstances and thus the ruling of the district court denying suppression of the evidence is affirmed.II. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering a motion for judgment of acquittal, both the trial and reviewing courts must evaluate the evidence and such reasonable inferences as arise therefrom in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's arguments go principally to the credibility of various government witnesses, and are thus in large measure addressed to the wrong forum.  See United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 881 (1st Cir.1997) (finding credibility assessments to be uniquely the domain of the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count VII of the indictment charges appellant with using and carrying a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  Since this relates to the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to the drug crime alleged in Count I, we must look first to the government's proof in that respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count I of the indictment, appellant was charged with engaging in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846.  At least 8 witnesses testified that throughout the summer of 1996, they and others purchased crack cocaine from appellant.  Each of these witnesses corroborated the other seven, and their testimony was also confirmed by the introduction of evidence seized from appellant's premises, which included cash, drugs, and drug paraphernalia.  Viewing this evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the government, we find that there was enough evidence to allow a reasonable jury to convict on Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the proof regarding Count VII, the evidence is equally overwhelming that appellant carried the 9-mm pistol that was introduced into evidence during the various phases of his drug deals, including during purchases, transportation, and, most bone-chillingly described by several witnesses, during drug-debt-collection episodes.  Count VII was well proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above evidence is also relevant to the Count VIII charge which alleges his condition as a felon in possession with respect to the 9-mm pistol.  There is no question that appellant was a three-time felon, and that he was in possession of a firearm.  Thus, Count VIII was established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is equally applicable to Count IX, with the slight variation that appellant is charged there with knowing possession of the seven rounds of 9-mm ammunition discovered in various places where he had passed through during his travails.  Appellant's disavowals as to this evidence were appropriately brought to the attention of the jurors, who were entitled to give his contention the weight that they considered it deserved.  We see no reason to disturb their conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The sawed-off shotgun</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count X is again a variation of the prior felon-in-possession theme, this one involving a sawed-off shotgun.  Witnesses testified that the shotgun was purchased and paid for at appellant's behest, and that thereafter he took possession of this weapon.  Appellant was a felon and he was in possession of a firearm--end of matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count XI, appellant was charged with possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5841, 5861, and 5871.  A witness testified to helping appellant to saw the barrel off the shotgun referred to in Count X, which in fact he thereafter used to terrorize this same witness.  This weapon was less than 26\" overall, with a barrel shorter than 18\", and was not registered in appellant's name in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.  Nothing further need be proven to establish the violations charged in Count XI of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Count XII which charges appellant, an illegal drug user, with possession of the shotgun in contravention to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(3) and 924(e)(1), was also clearly established beyond a reasonable doubt.III. Alleged juror misconduct and denial of mistrial motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"When a non-frivolous suggestion is made that a jury may be biased or tainted by some incident, the district court must undertake an adequate inquiry to determine whether the alleged incident occurred and if so, whether it was prejudicial.\"  United States v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1306 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d 436, 442 (1st Cir.1993)).  The trial judge is \"vested with the discretion to fashion an appropriate and responsible procedure to determine whether misconduct actually occurred and whether it was prejudicial.\"  Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d at 442.   A district court has wide latitude in responding to such a claim, Meader, 118 F.3d at 880, and thus, the course of inquiry that is selected is reviewable only for patent abuse of discretion.  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 258 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a recess in the trial of this case, court personnel overheard three jurors discussing some of the evidence against appellant, conduct which was contrary to instructions previously given by the district judge to the jury.  This information was made known to the trial judge, who promptly communicated the incident to trial counsel, requesting their views as to how to proceed.  Appellant was of the view that only a mistrial was sufficient to correct the situation.  The trial court opined that further inquiry was required before such a drastic measure would be taken, and decided instead to summarily excuse the three jurors involved, preventing any further contact between them and the other jurors, and investigate whether any of the remaining jurors had been contaminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the presence of counsel, the trial judge separately examined two of the remaining jurors who were physically in the vicinity of the offending jurors and might have overheard their conversation.  Upon being questioned, they denied any knowledge of the incident.  Thereafter, the court summoned the remaining jurors as a group, admonished them to be candid, and explained to them what had happened regarding the excused jurors.  He then asked the assembled jurors whether any of them had overheard the three jurors talking, whether they had heard any talk about the shotgun which was the subject of the transgressing jurors' conversation, and finally, whether any of them had made up their minds about the case.  No juror responded in the affirmative to any of these questions.  Thereafter, the court denied appellant's motion for mistrial and properly corrected any possible damage to the integrity of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the circumstances we have described, we are of the view that the trial judge acted well within his discretion in denying a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>IV. Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct During Closing Argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not give up his quest for a new trial.  During the course of closing argument, counsel for appellant likened the government's witnesses to individuals who were trying to outrun the appellant while all were running from the federal government, which was portrayed as a voracious bear.  In his rebuttal, government counsel responded to this allegory with his own version of what was going on, stating that \"the man that [was] trying to outrun the bear is [appellant]\" in contrast to other persons, which he named individually, who had \"been caught by the bear and [had] accepted responsibility.\"   The government went on to ask rhetorically, \"Who is the man that is running?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after these statements were made, the government ended its rebuttal and the trial judge called a recess prior to charging the jury.  At that point, defense counsel challenged the propriety of these remarks as disparaging appellant's exercise of his constitutional right to a trial, and requested that a mistrial be declared.  The district court denied appellant's petition, ruling that the objection was tardy in that it is \"incumbent upon counsel when there is improper argument immediately to cut it off and to give the judge a chance to address it right there and that was not done....\"  In view of this ruling, appellant's counsel stated that, \"[i]n the alternative [he] would ask for some sort of instruction ... that says, I think you may have instructed this already, a person accused of a crime has a constitutional right to a trial.\"   The trial judge responded that he would \"give that instruction again as part of the proposed speaking draft of the instructions,\" to which defense counsel once more stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>COUNSEL:  That would be what I would request simply to reiterate that a defendant has a constitutional right to a trial.  Could there be something like no adverse inference can be drawn from the fact that a defendant exercised his constitutional right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Yes, I'll say something.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>COUNSEL:  Do you want me to draft it or simply rely on the Court?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I will draft it.  Listen carefully.  If you don't like it, you will have a chance to object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge, at the appropriate time, proceeded to give the appropriate instructions, at which point he allowed all counsel the opportunity to object to the instructions given or to request further instructions.  No such thing happened.  See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that failure to renew objections after charge constitutes waiver of any claim of error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There should be little doubt that appellant's claim of error is not well taken.  To begin with, the trial judge was correct in ruling that a timely objection was not made.  In this day and age we need not elaborate at length as to the consequences of such a failure.  Suffice it to say that it constitutes a waiver of rights unless the error committed and not objected to is of such a magnitude as to have \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\"  United States v. Meja-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987).  Of course, no such thing has taken place here.  The weight and quantity of the evidence against appellant was nothing short of overwhelming, which places any hypothetical error committed in this respect in the \"harmless\" category.  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this we should add that the district court found, and the record supports, that the allegedly inappropriate comments by government counsel were not deliberate.  We have uncovered nothing that would lead us to conclude that this was anything but an isolated slip.  Id. Lastly, the aforementioned exchange between appellant's counsel and the district judge leave us with the clear conviction that the proposed solution not only was accepted, but effectively protected appellant's rights.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any error that may have occurred was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (\"harmless error rule governs even constitutional violations under some circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Alleged Sentencing Errors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Guideline section 4B1.4, \"[t]he offense level for an armed career criminal is the greatest of\" three options.  The first is the offense level that results from ordinary Guidelines computations.  The second option is \"the offense level from &#167; 4B1.1 [Career Offender], if applicable....\"  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4(b)(2).  The third alternative sets the offense level at 34 if the defendant used a firearm in the commission of a drug or violent crime, or possessed a sawed-off shotgun.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that the trial court committed five errors in imposing the sentence from which he appeals.  Four of these challenges are ultimately mooted by our affirmance of his Armed Career Criminal status.  The four include attacks on the enhancements under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5), and 3A1.3 based on the quantity of the drugs.  In addition, appellant challenges his Armed Career Criminal status on the ground that one of the predicate offenses was a conviction for an attempted criminal drug sale and, as an attempt, does not meet the definition of a \"controlled substance offense\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  Application Note 1, however, specifically includes in \"controlled substance offense\" the offense of attempting to commit such offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant qualified as an Armed Career Criminal under &#167; 4B1.1, his offense level was geared to the statutory maximum for the offense of the conviction.  In the present case, once appellant's enhancing information was filed as required by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851, the maximum sentence for his offense became life imprisonment, which has a minimum offense level of 37.  The district court having correctly sentenced appellant based upon an adjusted total offense level of 37, we need not consider appellant's other challenges of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Appellant's Pro Se Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in allowing the testimony of Susan Cronin, whom the government failed to include on its initial witness list.  Prior to trial, the court attributed the government's omission to \"inadvertence,\" but agreed to allow Cronin to testify as long as none of the jurors knew or had heard of her.  Appellant's counsel did not object to this approach either when it was proposed, or at the time the trial judge asked the jurors whether they knew Cronin.  We note that \"[e]ven when the government has produced a witness list ... in advance, when a witness ... not previously listed is offered, the decision to admit the testimony ... is within the discretion of the trial judge.\"   See United States v. Reis, 788 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was well within the district court judge's discretion to allow Cronin to testify.  Nothing in the record suggests that appellant was prejudiced by the government's failure to include Cronin's name on the initial witness list.  Since no member of the jury had heard of Cronin prior to trial, the integrity of the jury remained intact.  Furthermore, appellant had sufficient time to prepare for Cronin's testimony because she did not testify immediately after being offered as a potential witness, but rather, later in the trial, as the government's ninth witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also objects to the substance of Cronin's testimony, which helped authenticate photographs of bruises inflicted on Ericka Thibodeau by appellant on September 4, 1996.  Appellant avers that, under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the prejudicial impact of the photographs far outweighed their probative value.  On appeal, we afford a district court's Rule 403 balancing substantial discretion.  See United States v. Lowe, 145 F.3d 45, 51 (1st Cir.1998).  The district court allowed the photographs into evidence as probative of Thibodeau's credibility.  The trial judge, after due consideration of the photographs' potential prejudicial impact, determined that while the photographs were \"unpleasant,\" they were not \"gruesome.\"   Accordingly, the trial judge concluded \"[t]here is nothing prejudicial about the jury being able to see by way of corroboration of [Thibodeau's] testimony what it is that [appellant] did to her.\"   Finding no abuse of discretion, we decline to disturb the district court's ruling on the admissibility of the photographic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contests the admission of Thibodeau's statements to Cronin as excited utterances under Fed.R.Evid. 803.  Rule 803(2) allows the admission of hearsay, even though the declarant is available as a witness, if the statement is one \"relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 803(2).  The statements at issue were made on September 4th at approximately 8:00 a.m., shortly after Thibodeau arrived at the battered women's shelter where Cronin was employed.  The evidence suggests that while the September 4th beating lasted until 4:00 a.m., Thibodeau was unable to escape the apartment where the assault occurred until some period after that time.  It is likely that Thibodeau continued to suffer from the trauma of the beating when she fled to the women's shelter, and thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing her statements into evidence as excited utterances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant challenges statements made by the government in its opening statement to the jury.  Since appellant failed to object to any of these challenged statements on the record, we engage in plain error review.  See United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 748 (1st Cir.1996).  Under the plain error standard of review, \"appellant bears the burden of persuasion to establish that there was an error, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected substantial rights.\"  United States v. Shifman, 124 F.3d 31, 38-39 (1st Cir.1997) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  In its opening statement, the government told the jury that a weapon was found in the police cruiser where appellant had been detained when, in fact, only ammunition had been discovered.  The prosecution also stated that appellant admitted to owning the ammunition found in the cruiser to a police officer, but the evidence shows that appellant did not make such a statement to the officer.  Lastly, the government stated that a shotgun and cocaine had been found in certain parts of an apartment although evidence failed to link the weapon and drugs to those exact locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant does not make any particularized allegations of bad faith on the part of the government in making its opening statement.  Moreover, the evidence presented at trial would have corrected any jury misperception arising from the government's opening statement.  The arresting officer testified that he had discovered only ammunition, not a weapon, in his cruiser.  In addition, the evidence showed that appellant told Thibodeau he had dropped his ammunition in the cruiser.  Finally, the evidence connected appellant to the shotgun and drugs found in the apartment, rendering the exact location of the contraband irrelevant.  It is important to note that, while a curative instruction was neither requested of nor issued by the district court, appellant's counsel, in his opening statement, which immediately followed the government's opening, stated, \"I would like to make it clear these opening statements are not evidence.\"   Under these circumstance, we find no plain error.  Cf. United States v. Ferrera, 746 F.2d 908, 910-11 (1st Cir.1984) (no plain error where very little prejudice resulted from improper remark in government's opening statement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rulings of the district court are affirmed in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under Me.Rev.Stat.

In a separate brief, appellant challenges pro se the admission of certain evidence as well as certain remarks made by the government in its opening statement.  We address these pro se arguments at the end of the opinion.  Ultimately, we affirm the rulings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. The Motion To Suppress</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 1:22 a.m. on August 23, 1996, appellant was detained by a state policeman for driving at 88 mph, which is in excess of the legal speed limit of 65 mph for the Maine Turnpike.  As the officer approached appellant's vehicle, he observed a commotion among the occupants.  There were three young males in the back seat, an adult female in front next to the driver, and an adult male driver.  The officer asked the driver, who turned out to be appellant, to step outside the vehicle and to produce his driver's license, vehicle registration and insurance documentation.  While this was taking place, the officer noticed that appellant's shirt was untucked, whereupon he asked appellant to lift his shirt so that his waistband was exposed.  Nothing unusual was revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officer then conducted a patdown search of appellant, during the course of which he discovered a jackknife and a syringe and needle in his pants pockets.  Appellant was placed under arrest for possession of illegal drug paraphernalia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After appellant was arrested, the officer proceeded to search the other occupants of the car.  The sum of $5,000 cash was discovered in the purse of the female passenger, who was later identified as appellant's then-girlfriend Ericka Thibodeau, and a 9-mm pistol was recovered from her person. Thereafter, the officer found an ammunition magazine for the pistol on the floor of the car between the front and back seats.  An additional magazine and three loose rounds were later found on the floor of the officer's car, directly behind where appellant had been placed after his arrest.  Two rounds of 9-mm ammunition were also found tucked between the cushions of the seat that appellant had occupied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

In this respect it is important to keep in mind that the district court's findings of fact are reviewable only for clear error, although its legal conclusions receive de novo treatment.  See Ornelas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 699, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Was appellant's search after the legitimate stop reasonable under the circumstances?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first look to whether the officer acted properly in ordering appellant to step outside his vehicle upon being stopped.  The district court in effect concluded that the officer's suspicions were justifiably heightened, not only by the abrupt manner in which appellant's vehicle pulled over and came to a stop, but \"by the exaggerated level of movement of the occupants of the car as it came to a stop, particularly those of the passenger in the right front seat.\"   Given these findings, which are fully supported by the record, the officer's request that appellant step outside his automobile was justified.  See Maryland v.

See Walker, 924 F.2d at 4. In particular, the time of day and location of the incident, the excessive speed at which the vehicle was driven, the manner in which it came to a stop, and the unexplained commotion among its occupants who outnumbered the police officer five to one, was sufficient cause to conduct the initial limited patdown of appellant's front pants pockets, in which contraband was in fact discovered.

At least 8 witnesses testified that throughout the summer of 1996, they and others purchased crack cocaine from appellant.  Each of these witnesses corroborated the other seven, and their testimony was also confirmed by the introduction of evidence seized from appellant's premises, which included cash, drugs, and drug paraphernalia.  Viewing this evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the government, we find that there was enough evidence to allow a reasonable jury to convict on Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the proof regarding Count VII, the evidence is equally overwhelming that appellant carried the 9-mm pistol that was introduced into evidence during the various phases of his drug deals, including during purchases, transportation, and, most bone-chillingly described by several witnesses, during drug-debt-collection episodes.  Count VII was well proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above evidence is also relevant to the Count VIII charge which alleges his condition as a felon in possession with respect to the 9-mm pistol.

Thus, Count VIII was established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence is equally applicable to Count IX, with the slight variation that appellant is charged there with knowing possession of the seven rounds of 9-mm ammunition discovered in various places where he had passed through during his travails.  Appellant's disavowals as to this evidence were appropriately brought to the attention of the jurors, who were entitled to give his contention the weight that they considered it deserved.  We see no reason to disturb their conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The sawed-off shotgun</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count X is again a variation of the prior felon-in-possession theme, this one involving a sawed-off shotgun.  Witnesses testified that the shotgun was purchased and paid for at appellant's behest, and that thereafter he took possession of this weapon.  Appellant was a felon and he was in possession of a firearm--end of matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count XI, appellant was charged with possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5841, 5861, and 5871.  A witness testified to helping appellant to saw the barrel off the shotgun referred to in Count X, which in fact he thereafter used to terrorize this same witness.  This weapon was less than 26\" overall, with a barrel shorter than 18\", and was not registered in appellant's name in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.  Nothing further need be proven to establish the violations charged in Count XI of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Count XII which charges appellant, an illegal drug user, with possession of the shotgun in contravention to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(3) and 924(e)(1), was also clearly established beyond a reasonable doubt.III. Alleged juror misconduct and denial of mistrial motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"When a non-frivolous suggestion is made that a jury may be biased or tainted by some incident, the district court must undertake an adequate inquiry to determine whether the alleged incident occurred and if so, whether it was prejudicial.\"  United States v.

The trial judge is \"vested with the discretion to fashion an appropriate and responsible procedure to determine whether misconduct actually occurred and whether it was prejudicial.\"  Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d at 442.   A district court has wide latitude in responding to such a claim, Meader, 118 F.3d at 880, and thus, the course of inquiry that is selected is reviewable only for patent abuse of discretion.  United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a recess in the trial of this case, court personnel overheard three jurors discussing some of the evidence against appellant, conduct which was contrary to instructions previously given by the district judge to the jury.  This information was made known to the trial judge, who promptly communicated the incident to trial counsel, requesting their views as to how to proceed.  Appellant was of the view that only a mistrial was sufficient to correct the situation.  The trial court opined that further inquiry was required before such a drastic measure would be taken, and decided instead to summarily excuse the three jurors involved, preventing any further contact between them and the other jurors, and investigate whether any of the remaining jurors had been contaminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the presence of counsel, the trial judge separately examined two of the remaining jurors who were physically in the vicinity of the offending jurors and might have overheard their conversation.  Upon being questioned, they denied any knowledge of the incident.  Thereafter, the court summoned the remaining jurors as a group, admonished them to be candid, and explained to them what had happened regarding the excused jurors.  He then asked the assembled jurors whether any of them had overheard the three jurors talking, whether they had heard any talk about the shotgun which was the subject of the transgressing jurors' conversation, and finally, whether any of them had made up their minds about the case.  No juror responded in the affirmative to any of these questions.  Thereafter, the court denied appellant's motion for mistrial and properly corrected any possible damage to the integrity of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the circumstances we have described, we are of the view that the trial judge acted well within his discretion in denying a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>IV. Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct During Closing Argument</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not give up his quest for a new trial.  During the course of closing argument, counsel for appellant likened the government's witnesses to individuals who were trying to outrun the appellant while all were running from the federal government, which was portrayed as a voracious bear.  In his rebuttal, government counsel responded to this allegory with his own version of what was going on, stating that \"the man that [was] trying to outrun the bear is [appellant]\" in contrast to other persons, which he named individually, who had \"been caught by the bear and [had] accepted responsibility.\"   The government went on to ask rhetorically, \"Who is the man that is running?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after these statements were made, the government ended its rebuttal and the trial judge called a recess prior to charging the jury.  At that point, defense counsel challenged the propriety of these remarks as disparaging appellant's exercise of his constitutional right to a trial, and requested that a mistrial be declared.  The district court denied appellant's petition, ruling that the objection was tardy in that it is \"incumbent upon counsel when there is improper argument immediately to cut it off and to give the judge a chance to address it right there and that was not done....\"  In view of this ruling, appellant's counsel stated that, \"[i]n the alternative [he] would ask for some sort of instruction ... that says, I think you may have instructed this already, a person accused of a crime has a constitutional right to a trial.\"   The trial judge responded that he would \"give that instruction again as part of the proposed speaking draft of the instructions,\" to which defense counsel once more stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>COUNSEL:  That would be what I would request simply to reiterate that a defendant has a constitutional right to a trial.  Could there be something like no adverse inference can be drawn from the fact that a defendant exercised his constitutional right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Yes, I'll say something.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>COUNSEL:  Do you want me to draft it or simply rely on the Court?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I will draft it.  Listen carefully.  If you don't like it, you will have a chance to object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge, at the appropriate time, proceeded to give the appropriate instructions, at which point he allowed all counsel the opportunity to object to the instructions given or to request further instructions.  No such thing happened.  See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572650\"><a href=\"/opinion/572650/united-states-v-edilberto-mendoza-acevedo/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that failure to renew objections after charge constitutes waiver of any claim of error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There should be little doubt that appellant's claim of error is not well taken.  To begin with, the trial judge was correct in ruling that a timely objection was not made.  In this day and age we need not elaborate at length as to the consequences of such a failure.  Suffice it to say that it constitutes a waiver of rights unless the error committed and not objected to is of such a magnitude as to have \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\"  United States v. Meja-Lozano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494593\"><a href=\"/opinion/494593/united-states-v-martha-mejia-lozano/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 274 (1st Cir.1987).  Of course, no such thing has taken place here.  The weight and quantity of the evidence against appellant was nothing short of overwhelming, which places any hypothetical error committed in this respect in the \"harmless\" category.  United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 977 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this we should add that the district court found, and the record supports, that the allegedly inappropriate comments by government counsel were not deliberate.  We have uncovered nothing that would lead us to conclude that this was anything but an isolated slip.  Id. Lastly, the aforementioned exchange between appellant's counsel and the district judge leave us with the clear conviction that the proposed solution not only was accepted, but effectively protected appellant's rights.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any error that may have occurred was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (1983) (\"harmless error rule governs even constitutional violations under some circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Alleged Sentencing Errors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Guideline section 4B1.4, \"[t]he offense level for an armed career criminal is the greatest of\" three options.  The first is the offense level that results from ordinary Guidelines computations.  The second option is \"the offense level from &#167; 4B1.1 [Career Offender], if applicable....\"  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4(b)(2).  The third alternative sets the offense level at 34 if the defendant used a firearm in the commission of a drug or violent crime, or possessed a sawed-off shotgun.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims that the trial court committed five errors in imposing the sentence from which he appeals.  Four of these challenges are ultimately mooted by our affirmance of his Armed Career Criminal status.  The four include attacks on the enhancements under U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5), and 3A1.3 based on the quantity of the drugs.  In addition, appellant challenges his Armed Career Criminal status on the ground that one of the predicate offenses was a conviction for an attempted criminal drug sale and, as an attempt, does not meet the definition of a \"controlled substance offense\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  Application Note 1, however, specifically includes in \"controlled substance offense\" the offense of attempting to commit such offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant qualified as an Armed Career Criminal under &#167; 4B1.1, his offense level was geared to the statutory maximum for the offense of the conviction.  In the present case, once appellant's enhancing information was filed as required by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851, the maximum sentence for his offense became life imprisonment, which has a minimum offense level of 37.  The district court having correctly sentenced appellant based upon an adjusted total offense level of 37, we need not consider appellant's other challenges of his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Appellant's Pro Se Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in allowing the testimony of Susan Cronin, whom the government failed to include on its initial witness list.  Prior to trial, the court attributed the government's omission to \"inadvertence,\" but agreed to allow Cronin to testify as long as none of the jurors knew or had heard of her.  Appellant's counsel did not object to this approach either when it was proposed, or at the time the trial judge asked the jurors whether they knew Cronin.  We note that \"[e]ven when the government has produced a witness list ... in advance, when a witness ... not previously listed is offered, the decision to admit the testimony ... is within the discretion of the trial judge.\"   See United States v. Reis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468533\"><a href=\"/opinion/468533/united-states-v-daniel-reis/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was well within the district court judge's discretion to allow Cronin to testify.  Nothing in the record suggests that appellant was prejudiced by the government's failure to include Cronin's name on the initial witness list.  Since no member of the jury had heard of Cronin prior to trial, the integrity of the jury remained intact.  Furthermore, appellant had sufficient time to prepare for Cronin's testimony because she did not testify immediately after being offered as a potential witness, but rather, later in the trial, as the government's ninth witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also objects to the substance of Cronin's testimony, which helped authenticate photographs of bruises inflicted on Ericka Thibodeau by appellant on September 4, 1996.  Appellant avers that, under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the prejudicial impact of the photographs far outweighed their probative value.  On appeal, we afford a district court's Rule 403 balancing substantial discretion.  See United States v. Lowe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754636\"><a href=\"/opinion/754636/united-states-v-paul-e-lowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1998).  The district court allowed the photographs into evidence as probative of Thibodeau's credibility.  The trial judge, after due consideration of the photographs' potential prejudicial impact, determined that while the photographs were \"unpleasant,\" they were not \"gruesome.\"   Accordingly, the trial judge concluded \"[t]here is nothing prejudicial about the jury being able to see by way of corroboration of [Thibodeau's] testimony what it is that [appellant] did to her.\"   Finding no abuse of discretion, we decline to disturb the district court's ruling on the admissibility of the photographic evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contests the admission of Thibodeau's statements to Cronin as excited utterances under Fed.R.Evid. 803.  Rule 803(2) allows the admission of hearsay, even though the declarant is available as a witness, if the statement is one \"relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 803(2).  The statements at issue were made on September 4th at approximately 8:00 a.m., shortly after Thibodeau arrived at the battered women's shelter where Cronin was employed.  The evidence suggests that while the September 4th beating lasted until 4:00 a.m., Thibodeau was unable to escape the apartment where the assault occurred until some period after that time.  It is likely that Thibodeau continued to suffer from the trauma of the beating when she fled to the women's shelter, and thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing her statements into evidence as excited utterances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant challenges statements made by the government in its opening statement to the jury.  Since appellant failed to object to any of these challenged statements on the record, we engage in plain error review.  See United States v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196791\"><a href=\"/opinion/196791/united-states-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span>, 748 (1st Cir.1996).  Under the plain error standard of review, \"appellant bears the burden of persuasion to establish that there was an error, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected substantial rights.\"  United States v. Shifman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197517\"><a href=\"/opinion/197517/united-states-v-shifman/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 38-39 (1st Cir.1997) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  In its opening statement, the government told the jury that a weapon was found in the police cruiser where appellant had been detained when, in fact, only ammunition had been discovered.  The prosecution also stated that appellant admitted to owning the ammunition found in the cruiser to a police officer, but the evidence shows that appellant did not make such a statement to the officer.  Lastly, the government stated that a shotgun and cocaine had been found in certain parts of an apartment although evidence failed to link the weapon and drugs to those exact locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant does not make any particularized allegations of bad faith on the part of the government in making its opening statement.  Moreover, the evidence presented at trial would have corrected any jury misperception arising from the government's opening statement.  The arresting officer testified that he had discovered only ammunition, not a weapon, in his cruiser.  In addition, the evidence showed that appellant told Thibodeau he had dropped his ammunition in the cruiser.  Finally, the evidence connected appellant to the shotgun and drugs found in the apartment, rendering the exact location of the contraband irrelevant.  It is important to note that, while a curative instruction was neither requested of nor issued by the district court, appellant's counsel, in his opening statement, which immediately followed the government's opening, stated, \"I would like to make it clear these opening statements are not evidence.\"   Under these circumstance, we find no plain error.  Cf. United States v. Ferrera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443207\"><a href=\"/opinion/443207/united-states-v-ricardo-ferrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 910-11 (1st Cir.1984) (no plain error where very little prejudice resulted from improper remark in government's opening statement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rulings of the district court are affirmed in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under Me.Rev.Stat.
