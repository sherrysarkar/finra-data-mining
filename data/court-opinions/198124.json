Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Luis A. Medina-Torres on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jose A. Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Camille Velez-Rive,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSEPTEMBER 8, 1998\r\n\n  Per Curiam.  Appellant Alberto Martinez-Torres appeals\r\nfrom an order of pretrial detention.  Having conducted \"an\r\nindependent review ... tempered by deference to the district\r\ncourt's firsthand judgment of the situation,\" United States v.\r\nBayko, 774 F.2d 516, 520 (1st Cir. 1985), we agree with the\r\ndistrict judge's conclusion that detention is warranted here on\r\nthe ground of \"dangerousness\"--i.e., that \"no condition or\r\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure ... the safety\r\nof any other person and the community.\"  18 U.S.C.  3142(e). \r\nWe therefore affirm.\r\n    Appellant, a member of the municipal police force in\r\nVieques, Puerto Rico, is one of ten law-enforcement officers\r\ncharged in a sting operation with providing protection to\r\npurported drug traffickers thought to be transshipping cocaine\r\nthrough the island.  (In fact, the \"traffickers\" were\r\nundercover FBI agents.)  He has been indicted on two counts:\r\nconspiring to possess more than five kilograms of cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1),\r\n846, and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-\r\ntrafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1). \r\nAfter a hearing, the magistrate-judge ordered that appellant be\r\nreleased subject to stringent conditions--such as that he be\r\nconfined to house arrest with electronic monitoring and post a\r\n$40,000 bond.  Four other defendants were also granted release\r\non bail; the remaining five were ordered detained.  \r\n    The district judge stayed the five release orders at the\r\ngovernment's request.  He thereafter ruled, in a consolidated\r\nopinion, that these defendants (appellant and the four others)\r\nshould likewise be detained pending trial.  The court deemed it\r\nsignificant that defendants were charged with abusing their\r\npositions of trust and that firearms were allegedly employed in\r\nthe scheme.  Of special concern, however, was the prominent\r\nrole defendants occupied in the \"small community\" of Vieques. \r\nDefendants effectively \"controlled\" the area.  And with their\r\nknowledge of the community and their influence therein, they\r\nwere in a position to \"coerce and intimidate witnesses\" and\r\notherwise \"derail the government's investigation.\"  In the\r\ncourt's view, clear and convincing evidence had been presented\r\nthat appellant and the others would pose an unreasonable risk\r\nof danger \"even if released under the most restrictive\r\nconditions.\"  Appellant now seeks review of this ruling,\r\nrequesting that the conditions of release imposed by the\r\nmagistrate-judge be reinstated.  We of course confine our\r\nanalysis to appellant's situation.\r\n    From the sparse record before us, a number of factors\r\nappear that militate in appellant's favor.  A life-long\r\nresident of Vieques, he has been married for fourteen years and\r\nhas two children, aged thirteen and twelve.  He owns a house\r\nworth approximately $75,000, which he has offered as security. \r\nHe has served as a municipal police officer for the past nine\r\nyears.  He denies using drugs or owning a passport.  He has no\r\ncriminal record.  In particular, there is no indication that he\r\nparticipated in earlier, alleged transshipment schemes, or that\r\nhe has ever had contact with genuine drug traffickers.  From\r\nthese facts, one might reasonably conclude that appellant is\r\nunlikely to flee (as was effectively conceded below), and that\r\nhe is unlikely to engage in any sort of drug activity if\r\nreleased on bail (particularly if confined to house arrest). \r\n    Other factors, however, militate in the opposite\r\ndirection.  The charges, if proven, would constitute a grievous\r\nbreach of trust on appellant's part.  The evidence against him\r\nis considerable; most of it was obtained through the use of\r\nconfidential informants and undercover agents, and much of it\r\nwas recorded on tape.  He faces significant penalties if\r\nconvicted.  And the offenses with which he is charged give rise\r\nto a presumption of danger, see 18 U.S.C.  3142(e)--one that,\r\neven if rebutted, would retain some evidentiary weight here,\r\nsee, e.g., United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15, 18\r\n(1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).\r\n    With regard to the specific risk that appellant might\r\ntamper with witnesses or otherwise impede the investigation,\r\nseveral points deserve mention.  Appellant, even if not one of\r\nthe ringleaders of the criminal scheme, played something of a\r\nprominent role; for example, at least two meetings were held at\r\nhis residence.  Moreover, the court was justified in inferring,\r\nunder the circumstances, that appellant would have unusual\r\naccess to outside resources and inside information, even if\r\nheld under house arrest.  Appellant objects that no Vieques\r\nresidents have been identified as potential witnesses, but the\r\ncourt reasonably could conclude that evidence from local\r\nobservers might be forthcoming.  And the court was obviously\r\njustified in believing, as a general matter, that corrupt law-\r\nenforcement officers pose special risks in this regard.    \r\n    Two other points help tip the scale.  First, appellant was\r\nallegedly captured on tape proclaiming that he would \"kill\" any\r\n\"squealers.\"  Rather than deny voicing such a threat, appellant\r\nsimply dismisses it as a meaningless bit of braggadocio.  Yet\r\nno matter how much swaggering was involved, such a\r\npronouncement cannot be entirely discounted--especially coming\r\nfrom someone with ready access to firearms.  Second, this court\r\nhas indicated that two of the proposed conditions of release\r\nhere--electronic monitoring and the posting of real estate as\r\nsecurity--are less effective in \"dangerousness\" cases than in\r\n\"flight risk\" cases.  See United States v. Tortora, 922 F.2d\r\n880, 886-87 &amp; n.8 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n    Appellant's remaining claims likewise prove unavailing. \r\nHe insists that the district court erred in concluding that he\r\nhad failed to rebut the statutory presumption of dangerousness. \r\nYet no such finding appears in the court's opinion; indeed, the\r\ndiscussion therein is equally if not more consistent with a\r\nfinding that the presumption, although rebutted, remained\r\nrelevant.  He also complains, from a procedural standpoint,\r\nthat the district court failed to adequately delineate the\r\nreasons for its decision.  To the contrary, we think the\r\ncourt's explanation was sufficiently detailed to permit\r\n\"meaningful appellate review.\"  United States v. Moss, 887 F.2d\r\n333, 338 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).  \r\n    For these reasons, along with others specified by the\r\ndistrict judge, we agree that appellant's detention pending\r\ntrial is warranted on the ground of dangerousness.\r\n    The motion for oral argument is denied, and the order of\r\npretrial detention is affirmed. \n",
