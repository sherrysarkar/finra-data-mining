We  accept the factual allegations  in the\r\n\ncomplaint  as true and  indulge all reasonable  inferences in\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's  favor.     Id.

However, we  reinstate\r\n\nhis  claim of  discriminatory  termination against  Williams,\r\n\nParet,  and Community  Works.   In  some unspecified  period,\r\n\nWilliams  allegedly suggested that  Cloud not attend  a fund-\r\n\nraising dance because she felt that  he would not fit in with\r\n\nthe white, \"New Age\"  people in attendance.  Paret  allegedly\r\n\nquestioned Cloud's ability  to conduct himself properly  in a\r\n\nroom full  of white people,  especially white men.   We infer\r\n\nfrom  allegations in  the complaint  that  both Williams  and\r\n\nParet were involved  in the decision to terminate  Cloud.  We\r\n\nthink  that these  allegations are  sufficient  to survive  a\r\n\nmotion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).2 \r                                                  2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2We have considered the comments alleged to have been made\r               2\r\nby  Froehlich, but  are not  persuaded that  they support  an\r\ninference of race discrimination.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Our decision foreshadows  nothing about the outcome\r\n\nof  this case  should the  pleadings  be tested  in a  prompt\r\n\nsummary judgment motion; we hold only that dismissal of the  \r\n\n1981 claim cannot  be upheld as to all  defendants under Rule\r\n\n12(b)(6).    Cloud  has not  specifically  requested  that we\r\n\nreinstate his supplemental state  law claims, and  defendants\r\n\nsuggest that  he is  now pursuing  them in state  court.   On\r\n\nremand,  Cloud is  free to  ask  the district  court, in  its\r\n\ndiscretion,  to  exercise  supplemental   jurisdiction.    We\r\n\nexpress no opinion as to the merits of his state law claims. \r\n\n          Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for\r                                                                         \r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
