Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJohn E. Mudd for appellants.\r\nG. William Austin and Jorge F. Freyre for appellees.\r\n\nAugust 4, 1998\r\n\nCoffin, Senior Circuit Judge.  This product liability action\r\narises from a workplace accident in which a cleaning product\r\nmanufactured by LPS Laboratories, Inc. was ignited by sparks from\r\na welding torch, triggering a flash fire that severely burned Felix\r\nMartinez Diaz.  Martinez' wife and two daughters brought suit,\r\nclaiming primarily that the warnings contained in the safety\r\ninstructions accompanying the product were inadequate.  The\r\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for LPS, concluding as a\r\nmatter of law that the product warnings met all applicable\r\nstandards and that the alleged deficiency in the warnings was not,\r\nin any event, the cause of the accident.  The court also rejected\r\nappellants' defective design claim as untimely.  We affirm.\r\nThe following facts are undisputed.  Martinez was injured on\r\nMay 4, 1995, while using LPS's product, CFC-Free Electro Contact\r\nCleaner, to clean a piece of electrical equipment known as the\r\n\"thermatool.\"  The cleaner had been delivered to Martinez's\r\nemployer, Bayamon Steel, in a 55-gallon drum that was kept in a\r\nstorage area, and Martinez used a pail to carry a quantity of the\r\nliquid from the drum to the thermatool.  At the time of the\r\naccident, he was spraying the chemical onto the internal electrical\r\nparts of the thermatool.  A few feet away, other employees were\r\nworking to repair a mill.  Their use of a welding torch ignited the\r\ncleaner and triggered a flash fire in which Martinez suffered\r\nserious burns over more than fifty percent of his body.\r\nSafety warnings appeared on labels on the top and side of the\r\ndrum.  Among other information, the labels contained the word\r\n\"DANGER,\" advised that the cleaner was \"EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE,\" and\r\nspecified certain actions to be taken or avoided (e.g., \"Keep away\r\nfrom heat, sparks and open flame\"; \"Prevent buildup of vapors --\r\nuse adequate cross-ventilation\"; \"[T]urn off all sources of\r\nignition during use and until vapors are gone\").  A \"material\r\nsafety data sheet\" (\"MSDS\"), required by federal law, see 29 C.F.R.\r\n1910.1200, also was available.  Under the heading \"Unusual fire\r\nand explosive hazards,\" it warned that \"[f]lammable vapors which\r\nare heavier than air may accumulate in low areas and/or spread\r\nalong the ground away from handling site\" and it instructed that\r\nthe cleaner should be used and stored \"with adequate ventilation\"\r\nand \"away from ignition sources.\"\r\nThese safety materials all were in English.  The drum also\r\nbore a diamond-shaped warning label that contained a flame symbol\r\nand \"FLAMMABLE LIQUID\" written in white on a red background.\r\nThe central issue in this case is the adequacy of the\r\ninformation provided by LPS concerning the cleaner's flammability. \r\nWe first consider whether the district court properly granted\r\nsummary judgment on that issue and then briefly address plaintiffs'\r\neffort to litigate a defective design claim.\r\nA.  Adequacy of Warnings\r\nEven when considered in the light most favorable to the\r\nplaintiffs, as we do upon review of a district court's grant of\r\nsummary judgment, see Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 44 (1st\r\nCir. 1998), the warning defect claim is lacking.  See Aponte-Riverav. Sears Roebuck de P.R., 98 JTS 12, Certified Translation at 10\r\n(1998) (App. V. at 1282) (noting three types of defective product\r\nclaims, including those based on inadequate warnings).  Although\r\nthe record contains evidence from plaintiffs' experts on ways to\r\nimprove the information provided with the cleaner, this is not\r\nenough to establish that the product is defective.\r\nA detailed scheme of federal statutes and regulations governs\r\nthe handling and labeling of hazardous substances.  See, e.g., 15\r\nU.S.C.  1261-1277 (Federal Hazardous Substances Act); 29 C.F.R.\r\n1910.1200 (governing hazard communication in the workplace); 16\r\nC.F.R.  1500.121 (requirements for safety warnings).  These\r\nprovisions are designed to set a comprehensive standard for\r\nworkplace safety, see 29 C.F.R.  1910.1200(a)(1), (2), and \"to\r\npreempt any legal requirements of a state, or political subdivision\r\nof a state, pertaining to this subject,\" id. at  1910.1200(a)(2). \r\nTo succeed, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendant's warnings\r\nfailed to satisfy the federal standards.  See Moss v. Parks Corp.,\r\n985 F.2d 736, 742 (4th Cir. 1993) (granting summary judgment to\r\nmanufacturer of paint thinner based on finding that product was\r\nproperly labeled in accordance with federal standards).\r\nPlaintiffs assert three primary deficiencies in the labels and\r\nother safety information: the warnings were given only in English\r\neven though the dominant language in Puerto Rico is Spanish; the\r\nsafety information was too small to be seen easily; and the warning\r\nfailed to convey the seriousness of the fire danger, particularly\r\nwhen the cleaner is sprayed (as it was in this case).  We consider\r\neach of these in turn.\r\n(1) Absence of warnings in Spanish.  The regulation that sets\r\nout the necessary elements of a safety label does not explicitly\r\ncontain a language requirement.  See 29 C.F.R.  1910.1200(f)(1). \r\nTwo provisions of the same regulation make it clear, however, that\r\nthe obligation under federal law is to provide the information in\r\nEnglish.  Subsection (f)(9) states that an employer shall ensure\r\nthat labels or other forms of warning are in English and that they\r\nmay add information in other languages, as appropriate.  Subsection\r\n(g) explicitly states that the material safety data sheet, which\r\nmanufacturers must provide, \"shall be in English (although the\r\nemployer may maintain copies in other languages as well).\"  \r\nThese provisions thus establish that federal law requires\r\nmanufacturers to provide safety warnings only in English and that\r\nit is the responsibility of individual employers, at their\r\ndiscretion, to provide additional warnings in other languages.  In\r\nthis case, the 55-gallon drum containing the cleaner also\r\nprominently displayed the pictorial of a flame, which is considered\r\na universal symbol of flammability.  That label filled any language\r\ngap, putting users on notice that precautions needed to be taken\r\nto avoid fire.  Although the pictorial did not fully explain the\r\ndanger, it provided clear warning that, before working with the\r\nproduct, the user should either read the accompanying safety\r\ninstructions or find someone to translate them.  Absence of Spanish\r\nwarnings, therefore, did not violate federal law and could not\r\nrender the cleaner a defective product.  Cf. Ramirez v. Plough, 863\r\nP.2d 167, 174 (Cal. 1994) (\"Defining the circumstances under which\r\nwarnings or other information should be provided in a language\r\nother than English is a task for which legislative and\r\nadministrative bodies are particularly well suited.\").\r\n(2) Size of type.  One of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Stuart\r\nParsons, testified in deposition and stated in a report that the\r\nlettering on the instructions label was too small for easy reading. \r\nIn reaching that conclusion, he relied on standards developed by\r\nprofessional and technical societies through the American National\r\nStandards Institute, whose guidelines do not have the force of law. \r\nThere is no evidence that the label fails to satisfy even the\r\nstrict size requirements for safety labels intended or packaged in\r\na form suitable for household use, see 15 U.S.C.  1261(p)(2); 16\r\nC.F.R.  1500.121(a)(1), (c) (specifying type size and other\r\n\"prominence, placement, and conspicuousness\" requirements).  In the\r\nworkplace, containers of hazardous materials are required to bear\r\nlabels or other indicators with \"the identity of the material and\r\nappropriate hazard warnings.\"  29 C.F.R.  1910.1200 App. E(4)(A). \r\nSuch labels\r\nmust be legible, and prominently displayed.  There are no\r\nspecific requirements for size or color, or any specified\r\ntext.\r\n\nId.  Indeed, another of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Barry  Sanders,\r\nnoted that \"[t]his label probably meets the letter of the law.\"\r\nAlthough he added, \"but not the spirit of the law . . . ,\" he\r\nevidently was suggesting that the federal regulations should be\r\nstricter.\r\nWe note, moreover, that the reasonable size of a warning must\r\nbe linked to whether it is sufficiently eye catching to put the\r\nproduct user on notice of the relevant hazards.  Here, the\r\nprominent red-and-white pictorial serves the function of drawing\r\nattention to the fire danger from the cleaner.  The fact that the\r\nmore detailed information is not presented in the optimal size for\r\ndistance viewing is thus less significant than if it alone was\r\nrelied upon to alert the user to the danger.  The same rationale\r\ntakes care of plaintiffs' related argument that there was\r\ninsufficient contrast between the colors used for the safety\r\ninformation label, which featured black text on a blue background. \r\nThe size and color of the warning label therefore did not render\r\nthis product defective.\r\n(3) Content of the label.  Plaintiffs contend that the label\r\ndid not convey the seriousness of the fire danger from the vapors\r\ndischarged by the cleaner, and failed in particular to warn of the\r\nmagnified risk of a flash fire when the product is sprayed.  We\r\nagree that users would be better informed if the label contained\r\nmore information.  That, however, would be true at most levels of\r\ndetail, and the question we face here is not whether the label is\r\nperfect but whether a jury could find that the product is\r\nunreasonably dangerous with its current warnings.  We conclude that\r\nsuch a finding is insupportable on this record.  Cf. Canty v. Ever-\r\nLast Supply Co., 685 A.2d 1365, 1377 (N.J. Super. 1996)\r\n(\"Disagreement over the adequacy or sufficiency of the information\r\nprovided on a label does not necessarily raise material issues of\r\nfact as to compliance.  What matters is whether the label satisfies\r\nthe requirements of the FHSA, not whether a label defines every\r\nphrase and addresses every potential hazard.\").\r\nPlaintiffs point to an ANSI recommendation that a warning for\r\na product of this type include: \"VAPOR MAY CAUSE FLASH FIRE.\"  The\r\ndescription of the label given above shows, however, that the\r\nsafety label warned against a buildup of vapors, stating that\r\nadequate cross-ventilation should be maintained.  See supra at 3. \r\nThe MSDS further warned that \"[f]lammable vapors which are heavier\r\nthan air may accumulate in low areas and/or spread along the ground\r\naway from handling site\" and it instructed that the cleaner should\r\nbe used and stored \"with adequate ventilation\" and \"away from\r\nignition sources.\"  We think it a matter of common sense that more\r\nvapors are produced when a liquid is sprayed, and while stating\r\nthat fact explicitly would reinforce the awareness of danger, its\r\nomission in light of the information that was provided cannot\r\nproperly be termed a product defect.  In sum, all relevant\r\ninformation related to the hazard that caused this accident was\r\nprovided.  While the ANSI statement is more direct, its content\r\nduplicates other information that was provided.\r\nWe emphasize, as an aside, that what occurred in this case was\r\nexplicitly warned against, both by the label and federal law.  The\r\nsafety information advised that the cleaner and sparks -- a normal\r\nbyproduct of welding -- were a dangerous combination.  To avoid\r\nprecisely the sort of accident that occurred, federal law\r\nexplicitly prohibits welding within close proximity to the use of\r\nflammable liquids.  See 29 C.F.R.  1910.252(a)(2).  The\r\nregulation specifies thirty-five feet as an appropriate distance\r\nbetween welding and combustibles; the welding here took place no\r\nmore than five or six feet from Martinez's work area.   Even if in\r\nother contexts more information would have been necessary to put\r\nthe user on notice of the risk of fire, that was not the case\r\nhere.\r\nWe therefore hold that, on this record, there is no material\r\ndispute of fact concerning the adequacy of the warnings on the drum\r\nof Contact Cleaner.  The combination of the flame pictorial and\r\nsafety information labels satisfied applicable federal regulations\r\nand provided sufficient notice to users of the highly flammable\r\nnature of the cleaner and the danger of accumulated vapors from it. \r\nWe therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\non the defective warning claim.\r\nB. Design Defect Claim.\r\nLPS moved for summary judgment on the defective warnings claim\r\nin February 1997.  Plaintiffs obtained an extension for filing\r\ntheir opposition and did so on May 16, 1997.  In it, for the first\r\ntime in the case, they explicitly also alleged that the cleaner was\r\ndefective in design.  On June 18, 1997, some ten months after the\r\ncourt's deadline for filing amendments to the pleadings, plaintiffs\r\nsought permission to amend the complaint to add a defective design\r\nclaim.\r\nIn denying leave to amend in August 1997, the district court\r\ntermed the motion \"belated\" and concluded that plaintiffs should\r\nhave presented the design defect claim at least by the time the\r\nparties prepared the Joint Case Management Memorandum the previous\r\nfall.  On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in\r\nrejecting the claim both because it was implicitly included within\r\ntheir original pleadings and because they could not develop the\r\nclaim until they obtained complete information from LPS in April\r\n1997.\r\nWe have little difficulty in affirming the district court's\r\njudgment on this issue.  At no time from the filing of the original\r\ncomplaint through the pretrial order did plaintiffs invoke language\r\nthat signals a design defect claim, which most commonly would be an\r\nallegation that the product's benefits did not outweigh its risks. \r\nSee, e.g., Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., No. 97-1365,\r\nslip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. July 9, 1998) (discussing test for design\r\ndefect in Puerto Rico) (citing Aponte-Rivera, Certified Translation\r\nat 10, 29 n.9).  Plaintiffs repeatedly asserted only that\r\ndefendants produced an \"extremely\" or \"inherently\" dangerous\r\nproduct that \"also\" was defective because of inadequate warnings. \r\nBut an allegation of danger does not alone present a design defect\r\nclaim; indeed, describing a product as \"inherently dangerous\" is an\r\nelement of a defective warnings claim.  See, e.g., Rhodes v.\r\nInterstate Battery System of America, 722 F.2d 1517, 1521 (11th\r\nCir. 1984) (manufacturer of dangerous product must use reasonable\r\nefforts to warn potential users; question regarding warning was\r\nwhether it was adequate to apprise user of inherent dangers); id.(Hill, J., dissenting) (battery is a defective product if consumers\r\nare not warned of inherently dangerous characteristics); East Penn\r\nMfg. Co. v. Pineda, 578 A.2d 1113, 1118 (D.C. Ct. App. 1990) (\"The\r\nfailure to warn branch of strict liability recognizes that some\r\nproducts, even if perfectly designed and manufactured, cannot be\r\nmade completely safe for their intended use.\"); Aponte-Rivera,\r\nCertified Translation, at 13 (noting that one element of warnings\r\nclaim is that \"manufacturer knew or should have known of the\r\ninherent danger of the product\" (emphasis added)).\r\nAt best, therefore, plaintiffs' assertion that the cleaner\r\n\"also\" was defective based on its warnings gave a hint of a\r\npossible additional claim.  Given the absence of any development of\r\nsuch a claim by the time of the Joint Case Management Memorandum,\r\nwe join the district court in concluding that a design defect claim\r\nwas not raised by the complaint.\r\nWe similarly concur in the court's rejection of plaintiffs'\r\neffort to amend the complaint to add a design defect theory. \r\nPlaintiffs defend their tardiness by stating that they were unable\r\nto flesh out a design defect allegation until they deposed LPS's\r\nexperts in April 1997, and they blame LPS for withholding\r\ninformation during the early stages of the case.  We are\r\nunpersuaded.  While meaningful discovery might have been necessary\r\nto develop facts to support a design defect claim, the allegation\r\nthat the cleaner was unjustifiably (as distinguished from\r\n\"inherently\" or \"extremely\") dangerous strikes us as having been an\r\nobvious alternative -- if intended -- from the outset.\r\nWe note that plaintiffs' brief identifies the material safety\r\ndata sheets for LPS's other contact cleaners as significant newly\r\nobtained evidence.  Those sheets presumably were available from\r\nmultiple sources and could have been obtained through purchase of\r\nthe products.  In any event, if LPS was unfairly blocking\r\nplaintiffs' legitimate earlier efforts to obtain relevant\r\ninformation, plaintiffs should have informed the court of the\r\nproblem before the case had proceeded to the brink of summary\r\njudgment.  Allowing addition of a new theory of liability after the\r\ndefendant's February motion for summary judgment and after\r\ndiscovery had closed in April unquestionably would prejudice\r\ndefendant, whose focus until that time had been on the adequacy of\r\nthe warning labels and not on the costs and benefits of the product\r\nitself.  In these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe district court's determination that the proposed amendment was\r\ntoo late.  See, e.g., Hayes v. New England Millwork Distributors,\r\n602 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1979) (\"undue delay\" can be a basis for\r\ndenying leave to amend).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\r\nis AFFIRMED.\r\n",

Plough, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (Cal. 1994) (\"Defining the circumstances under which\r\nwarnings or other information should be provided in a language\r\nother than English is a task for which legislative and\r\nadministrative bodies are particularly well suited.\").\r\n(2) Size of type.  One of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Stuart\r\nParsons, testified in deposition and stated in a report that the\r\nlettering on the instructions label was too small for easy reading. \r\nIn reaching that conclusion, he relied on standards developed by\r\nprofessional and technical societies through the American National\r\nStandards Institute, whose guidelines do not have the force of law. \r\nThere is no evidence that the label fails to satisfy even the\r\nstrict size requirements for safety labels intended or packaged in\r\na form suitable for household use, see 15 U.S.C.  1261(p)(2); 16\r\nC.F.R.  1500.121(a)(1), (c) (specifying type size and other\r\n\"prominence, placement, and conspicuousness\" requirements).  In the\r\nworkplace, containers of hazardous materials are required to bear\r\nlabels or other indicators with \"the identity of the material and\r\nappropriate hazard warnings.\"  29 C.F.R.  1910.1200 App. E(4)(A). \r\nSuch labels\r\nmust be legible, and prominently displayed.  There are no\r\nspecific requirements for size or color, or any specified\r\ntext.\r\n\nId.  Indeed, another of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Barry  Sanders,\r\nnoted that \"[t]his label probably meets the letter of the law.\"\r\nAlthough he added, \"but not the spirit of the law . . . ,\" he\r\nevidently was suggesting that the federal regulations should be\r\nstricter.\r\nWe note, moreover, that the reasonable size of a warning must\r\nbe linked to whether it is sufficiently eye catching to put the\r\nproduct user on notice of the relevant hazards.  Here, the\r\nprominent red-and-white pictorial serves the function of drawing\r\nattention to the fire danger from the cleaner.  The fact that the\r\nmore detailed information is not presented in the optimal size for\r\ndistance viewing is thus less significant than if it alone was\r\nrelied upon to alert the user to the danger.  The same rationale\r\ntakes care of plaintiffs' related argument that there was\r\ninsufficient contrast between the colors used for the safety\r\ninformation label, which featured black text on a blue background. \r\nThe size and color of the warning label therefore did not render\r\nthis product defective.\r\n(3) Content of the label.  Plaintiffs contend that the label\r\ndid not convey the seriousness of the fire danger from the vapors\r\ndischarged by the cleaner, and failed in particular to warn of the\r\nmagnified risk of a flash fire when the product is sprayed.  We\r\nagree that users would be better informed if the label contained\r\nmore information.  That, however, would be true at most levels of\r\ndetail, and the question we face here is not whether the label is\r\nperfect but whether a jury could find that the product is\r\nunreasonably dangerous with its current warnings.  We conclude that\r\nsuch a finding is insupportable on this record.  Cf. Canty v. Ever-\r\nLast Supply Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377 (N.J. Super. 1996)\r\n(\"Disagreement over the adequacy or sufficiency of the information\r\nprovided on a label does not necessarily raise material issues of\r\nfact as to compliance.  What matters is whether the label satisfies\r\nthe requirements of the FHSA, not whether a label defines every\r\nphrase and addresses every potential hazard.\").\r\nPlaintiffs point to an ANSI recommendation that a warning for\r\na product of this type include: \"VAPOR MAY CAUSE FLASH FIRE.\"  The\r\ndescription of the label given above shows, however, that the\r\nsafety label warned against a buildup of vapors, stating that\r\nadequate cross-ventilation should be maintained.  See supra at 3. \r\nThe MSDS further warned that \"[f]lammable vapors which are heavier\r\nthan air may accumulate in low areas and/or spread along the ground\r\naway from handling site\" and it instructed that the cleaner should\r\nbe used and stored \"with adequate ventilation\" and \"away from\r\nignition sources.\"  We think it a matter of common sense that more\r\nvapors are produced when a liquid is sprayed, and while stating\r\nthat fact explicitly would reinforce the awareness of danger, its\r\nomission in light of the information that was provided cannot\r\nproperly be termed a product defect.  In sum, all relevant\r\ninformation related to the hazard that caused this accident was\r\nprovided.  While the ANSI statement is more direct, its content\r\nduplicates other information that was provided.\r\nWe emphasize, as an aside, that what occurred in this case was\r\nexplicitly warned against, both by the label and federal law.  The\r\nsafety information advised that the cleaner and sparks -- a normal\r\nbyproduct of welding -- were a dangerous combination.  To avoid\r\nprecisely the sort of accident that occurred, federal law\r\nexplicitly prohibits welding within close proximity to the use of\r\nflammable liquids.  See 29 C.F.R.  1910.252(a)(2).  The\r\nregulation specifies thirty-five feet as an appropriate distance\r\nbetween welding and combustibles; the welding here took place no\r\nmore than five or six feet from Martinez's work area.   Even if in\r\nother contexts more information would have been necessary to put\r\nthe user on notice of the risk of fire, that was not the case\r\nhere.\r\nWe therefore hold that, on this record, there is no material\r\ndispute of fact concerning the adequacy of the warnings on the drum\r\nof Contact Cleaner.  The combination of the flame pictorial and\r\nsafety information labels satisfied applicable federal regulations\r\nand provided sufficient notice to users of the highly flammable\r\nnature of the cleaner and the danger of accumulated vapors from it. \r\nWe therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\non the defective warning claim.\r\nB. Design Defect Claim.\r\nLPS moved for summary judgment on the defective warnings claim\r\nin February 1997.  Plaintiffs obtained an extension for filing\r\ntheir opposition and did so on May 16, 1997.  In it, for the first\r\ntime in the case, they explicitly also alleged that the cleaner was\r\ndefective in design.  On June 18, 1997, some ten months after the\r\ncourt's deadline for filing amendments to the pleadings, plaintiffs\r\nsought permission to amend the complaint to add a defective design\r\nclaim.\r\nIn denying leave to amend in August 1997, the district court\r\ntermed the motion \"belated\" and concluded that plaintiffs should\r\nhave presented the design defect claim at least by the time the\r\nparties prepared the Joint Case Management Memorandum the previous\r\nfall.  On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in\r\nrejecting the claim both because it was implicitly included within\r\ntheir original pleadings and because they could not develop the\r\nclaim until they obtained complete information from LPS in April\r\n1997.\r\nWe have little difficulty in affirming the district court's\r\njudgment on this issue.  At no time from the filing of the original\r\ncomplaint through the pretrial order did plaintiffs invoke language\r\nthat signals a design defect claim, which most commonly would be an\r\nallegation that the product's benefits did not outweigh its risks. \r\nSee, e.g., Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., No. 97-1365,\r\nslip op. at 7-8 (1st Cir. July 9, 1998) (discussing test for design\r\ndefect in Puerto Rico) (citing Aponte-Rivera, Certified Translation\r\nat 10, 29 n.9).  Plaintiffs repeatedly asserted only that\r\ndefendants produced an \"extremely\" or \"inherently\" dangerous\r\nproduct that \"also\" was defective because of inadequate warnings. \r\nBut an allegation of danger does not alone present a design defect\r\nclaim; indeed, describing a product as \"inherently dangerous\" is an\r\nelement of a defective warnings claim.  See, e.g., Rhodes v.\r\nInterstate Battery System of America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428401\"><a href=\"/opinion/428401/robert-e-rhodes-v-interstate-battery-system-of-america-inc-and-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1521 (11th\r\nCir. 1984) (manufacturer of dangerous product must use reasonable\r\nefforts to warn potential users; question regarding warning was\r\nwhether it was adequate to apprise user of inherent dangers); id.(Hill, J., dissenting) (battery is a defective product if consumers\r\nare not warned of inherently dangerous characteristics); East Penn\r\nMfg. Co. v. Pineda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1973885\"><a href=\"/opinion/1973885/east-penn-mfg-co-v-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (D.C. Ct. App. 1990) (\"The\r\nfailure to warn branch of strict liability recognizes that some\r\nproducts, even if perfectly designed and manufactured, cannot be\r\nmade completely safe for their intended use.\"); Aponte-Rivera,\r\nCertified Translation, at 13 (noting that one element of warnings\r\nclaim is that \"manufacturer knew or should have known of the\r\ninherent danger of the product\" (emphasis added)).\r\nAt best, therefore, plaintiffs' assertion that the cleaner\r\n\"also\" was defective based on its warnings gave a hint of a\r\npossible additional claim.  Given the absence of any development of\r\nsuch a claim by the time of the Joint Case Management Memorandum,\r\nwe join the district court in concluding that a design defect claim\r\nwas not raised by the complaint.\r\nWe similarly concur in the court's rejection of plaintiffs'\r\neffort to amend the complaint to add a design defect theory. \r\nPlaintiffs defend their tardiness by stating that they were unable\r\nto flesh out a design defect allegation until they deposed LPS's\r\nexperts in April 1997, and they blame LPS for withholding\r\ninformation during the early stages of the case.  We are\r\nunpersuaded.  While meaningful discovery might have been necessary\r\nto develop facts to support a design defect claim, the allegation\r\nthat the cleaner was unjustifiably (as distinguished from\r\n\"inherently\" or \"extremely\") dangerous strikes us as having been an\r\nobvious alternative -- if intended -- from the outset.\r\nWe note that plaintiffs' brief identifies the material safety\r\ndata sheets for LPS's other contact cleaners as significant newly\r\nobtained evidence.  Those sheets presumably were available from\r\nmultiple sources and could have been obtained through purchase of\r\nthe products.  In any event, if LPS was unfairly blocking\r\nplaintiffs' legitimate earlier efforts to obtain relevant\r\ninformation, plaintiffs should have informed the court of the\r\nproblem before the case had proceeded to the brink of summary\r\njudgment.  Allowing addition of a new theory of liability after the\r\ndefendant's February motion for summary judgment and after\r\ndiscovery had closed in April unquestionably would prejudice\r\ndefendant, whose focus until that time had been on the adequacy of\r\nthe warning labels and not on the costs and benefits of the product\r\nitself.  In these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe district court's determination that the proposed amendment was\r\ntoo late.  See, e.g., Hayes v. New England Millwork Distributors,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368207\"><a href=\"/opinion/368207/joseph-j-hayes-v-new-england-millwork-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 1979) (\"undue delay\" can be a basis for\r\ndenying leave to amend).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court\r\nis AFFIRMED.\r\n</pre>",
