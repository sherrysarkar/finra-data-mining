Azubuko on Reply to Motion for Summary Disposition.\r                             \r\nRobert L. Klivans on Motion for Summary Disposition for appellee.\r                             \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        August 7, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant  Chukwu E.  Azubuko appeals\r                                \r\n\nfrom  the district court's dismissal of his complaint against\r\n\nappellee First  National Bank of Boston.   Appellee has moved\r\n\nfor summary disposition of the  matter under Local Rule 27.1,\r\n\narguing  that the  appeal does  not  present any  substantial\r\n\nquestions.  We agree.\r\n\n          1.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction.  Appellant appears\r                                                     \r\n\nto  confuse  personal  jurisdiction  over  a  defendant  with\r                                 \r\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over a cause of action.  Only the\r                          \r\n\nlatter type of  jurisdiction is in question in this case.  In\r\n\nthis context,  then, we  first note  that appellant's  claims\r\n\nplainly  do not  \"aris[e] under  the  Constitution, laws,  or\r\n\ntreaties  of the  United  States.\"   See  28  U.S.C.    1331.\r                                                    \r\n\nRather, he is asserting state law claims.   Under 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1332(a),  the  district  court  has  jurisdiction  over  such\r\n\nactions  where  the  controversy  is   between  \"citizens  of\r\n\ndifferent States.\"  Appellant does not dispute that defendant\r\n\nis a citizen of Massachusetts.\r\n\n          For  individuals,   citizenship  is   equated  with\r\n\n\"domicile.\"   See Rodriguez-Diaz v. Sierra-Martinez, 853 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1027, 1029  (1st Cir. 1988).   Domicile, in turn,  requires a\r\n\nhome and physical presence in a state.  Id.  Appellant states\r                                                       \r\n\nthat he  is a  resident of Massachusetts;  he does  not claim\r\n\ncitizenship in any other jurisdiction.   Thus, he is deemed a\r\n\ncitizen  of  the  Commonwealth.    See  id.    As  such,  the\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncontroversy  is between  citizens  of  the  same  state  and,\r                                                            \r\n\ndiversity missing, the  district court lacked subject  matter\r\n\njurisdiction over the action.\r\n\n          2.  Review of State Court Judgments.\r                                                         \r\n\n          Appellant plainly  is  attacking  the  state  court\r\n\njudgment  against  him on  the  same  claim  that he  is  now\r\n\nasserting.    The  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine  prohibits  lower\r                                             \r\n\nfederal courts such  as the district court and  this one from\r\n\nreviewing  state court  judgments.   See  Rooker v.  Fidelity\r                                                                         \r\n\nTrust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923); District of Columbia Court of\r                                                                         \r\n\nAppeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983).  Even if appellant's\r                              \r\n\nfederal claims never were presented in state court, they  are\r\n\n\"inextricably  intertwined\"   with  that   judgment,  thereby\r\n\nbarring review by this or the district court.   See Ritter v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRoss, 992 F.2d  750, 753-54 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting Feldman,\r                                                                        \r\n\n460 U.S.  at 483  n.16) (internal  quotation marks  omitted),\r\n\ncert. denied, 510 U.S. 1046 (1994).\r                        \r\n\n          3.  Notice.  The district  court in its endorsement\r                                \r\n\ngranting  appellee's motion to dismiss gave three reasons for\r\n\nits  actions.   Although succinct,  we think  that they  were\r\n\nsufficient.   Given the  basic  flaws in  the complaint,  and\r\n\ndefendant's   memorandum  explaining   the   nature  of   the\r\n\njurisdictional flaw, appellant was adequately apprised of the\r\n\nreasons for the dismissal.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          We therefore  summarily affirm the judgment  of the\r                                                    \r\n\ndistrict court.   See Local R. 27.1.   Appellant's motions to\r                                 \r\n\nproceed in forma  pauperis and without  briefs are denied  as\r                                                                     \r\n\nmoot.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
