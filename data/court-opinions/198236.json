Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Joseph E. Simanonok on brief pro se.\r\n Randall E. Smith, Seth D. Harrow, Smith, Elliott, Smith &amp;\r\nGarmey, P.A., Patricia A. Peard, Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer &amp; Nelson,\r\nAndrew Ketterer, Attorney General and Gerald D. Reid, Assistant\r\nAttorney General on brief for appellees.\r\n\nDECEMBER 7, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Joseph Simanonok appeals from the district court's\r\ndismissal of his civil rights complaint against various defendants and from other orders.  We\r\naffirm, with the modification noted below.\r\n          1.  Dismissal of the Complaint\r\n          Simanonok has waived his appellate claims relative to dismissal of his suit\r\nagainst his neighbors, the Lamontagnes, and the state government defendants, by failing to\r\nbrief his claims adequately in his initial brief.  See United States v. Benavente-Gomez, 921\r\nF.2d 378, 386 (1st Cir. 1990).  In any event, the district court properly dismissed the complaint\r\nagainst those defendants for the reasons given in the magistrate judge's June 11, 1997\r\nrecommended decision (later adopted by the district court).  \r\n          The dismissal of the claims against the municipal defendants was also proper. \r\nThe complaint failed to allege selective treatment based on impermissible considerations and\r\nhence did not state an equal protection claim.  See Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906, 910 (1stCir. 1995) (quoting Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, 878\r\nF.2d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 1989)).  Moreover, having alleged only that the defendants failed to\r\nremedy unlawful property improvements and pollution caused by neighbors, the complaint\r\nalso failed to state a constitutional privacy claim.  See Roach v. City of Evansville, 111 F.3d\r\n544, 550 (7th Cir. 1997) (explaining that the constitutional privacy interests protected by the\r\nFourteenth Amendment involve, first, the right to avoid disclosure of personal matters and the\r\nright to make important decisions in the areas of marriage, procreation, contraception, family\r\nrelationships and child rearing and education and, second, expectations of privacy arising in\r\nthe Fourth Amendment search and seizure context).  The defendants' failure to take the\r\nremedial action allegedly required by local and state law did not in and of itself violate\r\nSimanonok's substantive due process rights.  See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of\r\nSocial Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989) (holding that a state has no due process obligation to\r\nprotect its citizens from harm by private parties, absent the existence of some custodial\r\nrelationship); Licari v. Ferruzzi, 22 F.3d 344, 350 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that \"conscience-\r\nshocking\" facts must be alleged to support a substantive due process claim in the context of\r\na conventional zoning or planning dispute).  \r\n   Because the complaint failed to state any federal claims, the court properly\r\ndismissed any pendent state law claims.  See Wagner v. Devine, 122 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.\r\n1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 880 (1998). \r\n   2.  Failure to Rule on Class Action Status \r\n   Simanonok characterized his complaint as a class action.  On appeal, he objects\r\nto the court's failure to determine whether to maintain the suit as a class action, asserting that\r\nthis omission violated Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) and 23(e).  His assertion lacks merit.  Rule\r\n23(e) is inapplicable because the complaint was not voluntarily dismissed.  See 2 Newberg on\r\nClass Actions  11.65 (3d ed. 1992).  In addition, Rule 23(c)(1) was not implicated, because\r\nthe complaint failed even to allege that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and (b) had been met. \r\nSee Trotter v. Klincar, 748 F.2d 1177, 1185 n.10 (7th Cir. 1984) (\"[Rule 23(c)(1)] in no way\r\nsuggests that the court must generate sua sponte the evidence and arguments necessary for\r\ncertification. . . . [T]he burden for certification falls on the party seeking certification and he\r\ncannot be heard to complain that the court has failed to act when he has given it nothing upon\r\nwhich to act.\").  In addition, Simanonok was the only named class representative, and, once\r\nhis federal claims were dismissed, there was no need to resolve the class allegations.  Cf. Great\r\nRivers Co-Op of S.E. Iowa v. Farmland Indus., Inc., 120 F.3d 893, 899 (8th Cir. 1997)\r\n(affirming dismissal of class action claim after granting summary judgment against the\r\nplaintiff because no other class representative had been named and a class could not be\r\ncertified without an appropriate representative). \r\n   3.  Failure to Shift Service Costs to Defendants\r\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in not shifting the\r\ncosts of service to the defendants under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(2).  In asking for costs,\r\nSimanonok failed to provide the district court with a copy of the request for waiver form which\r\nhe had sent to the defendants.  Accordingly, he failed to show his compliance with Rule\r\n4(d)(2)(D) and his entitlement to costs.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(2)(D) (providing that the\r\nplaintiff must inform the defendant \"by means of a text prescribed in an official form\r\npromulgated pursuant to Rule 84, of the consequences of compliance and of a failure to\r\ncomply with the request\");  Spivey v. Board of Church Extension &amp; Home Mission of the\r\nChurch of God, 160 F.R.D. 660, 662 (M.D. Fla. 1995) (\"If the plaintiff properly complies with\r\nall of the requirements of Rule 4(d)(2), then costs are awarded.\").\r\n   4.  Attorney's Fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988\r\n   Simanonok challenges the lower court's announcement of its intention to award\r\ncosts and \"reasonable\" attorney's fees to the Lamontagnes and its award of $6,680.07 in costs\r\nand attorney's fees to the municipal defendants under 42 U.S.C.  1988.  Insofar as his appeal\r\ntargets the court's pronouncement in the Lamontagnes' favor, it is premature.  Since that\r\nintention has not yet been reduced to a sum certain, there is no final, appealable award.  SeeCentury 21 Real Estate Corp. v. Century 21 Real Estate, Inc., 929 F.2d 827, 830 (1st Cir.\r\n1991). \r\n   Although the district court did not explain its decision awarding fees to the\r\nmunicipal defendants, the record shows that the court was justified in doing so.  In Coutin v.\r\nYoung &amp; Rubicam Puerto Rico, Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 337 (1st Cir. 1997), this court reasoned that\r\nit may review an unexplained award of fees if the district court's order, \"read against the\r\nbackdrop of the record as a whole, [would] expose the district court's thought process and\r\nshow the method and manner underlying its decisional calculus.\"  This is such a case.  \r\n   First, the suit against the defendants was groundless, as Simanonok should have\r\nknown.  In an exhibit attached to the complaint, he stated that the municipal defendants had\r\nno prior knowledge that his neighbors intended unlawfully to improve their property, and both\r\nthe complaint and his other filings indicated that the municipal defendants had acted on his\r\ngrievances, albeit not to his satisfaction.  Nonetheless, he sued the municipal defendants.  For\r\nthe reasons given above, he failed even to make out a prima facie case against them on any of\r\nthe federal claims asserted -- equal protection, privacy or substantive due process.  No more\r\nwas exigible.  See S. Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation  10.02, at 342 (3d\r\ned. 1991) (explaining that a prevailing defendant may receive  1988 attorney's fees if the\r\nplaintiff's action was \"frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation\");  Miller v. Los Angeles\r\nCity Bd. of Educ., 827 F.2d 617, 619 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding that an award of attorney's fees\r\nagainst a pro se plaintiff who knew that his claims lacked merit is \"entirely appropriate\").\r\n   Second, the municipal defendants submitted a properly supported application\r\nfor fees and costs.  In objecting to their application below, Simanonok did not contend that he\r\ncould not pay the sum requested, and he did not challenge the particular evidence submitted\r\nin support of the application, nor has he made any such contention or challenge on appeal.\r\n   Nonetheless, while we affirm the grant of fees in favor of the municipal\r\ndefendants, we reduce the amount to $5,137.71.  This is the aggregate amount of fees and costs\r\nspecified on the invoices annexed to the fee application of record.  We think that an award of\r\nfees in this amount is plainly justified on this record.  See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 897\r\n(1984) (\"When . . . the applicant for a fee has carried his burden of showing that the claimed\r\nrate and number of hours are reasonable, the resulting product is presumed to be the reasonable\r\nfee contemplated by  1988.\"); id. at 892 n.5 (stating that a party waives his right to challenge\r\nthe reasonableness of the number of hours expended by the opposing party's counsel by failing\r\nto present his challenge in the district court).  \r\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed, but the award of attorney's fees\r\nand costs in favor of the municipal defendants is reduced to $5,137.71.  The appeal from the\r\ndecision announcing an intention to award attorney's fees and costs in favor of Carol, Emile\r\nand Doris Lamontagne is dismissed without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n",

Stenson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111123\"><a href=\"/opinion/111123/blum-v-stenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897\r\n(1984) (\"When . . . the applicant for a fee has carried his burden of showing that the claimed\r\nrate and number of hours are reasonable, the resulting product is presumed to be the reasonable\r\nfee contemplated by  1988.\"); id. at 892 n.5 (stating that a party waives his right to challenge\r\nthe reasonableness of the number of hours expended by the opposing party's counsel by failing\r\nto present his challenge in the district court).  \r\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed, but the award of attorney's fees\r\nand costs in favor of the municipal defendants is reduced to $5,137.71.  The appeal from the\r\ndecision announcing an intention to award attorney's fees and costs in favor of Carol, Emile\r\nand Doris Lamontagne is dismissed without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n</pre>",
