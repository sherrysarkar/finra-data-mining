Because   Speen  failed   to  provide\r\n\nsufficient  evidence to support a finding that he was a Crown\r\n\nemployee for  the purposes of his federal and state statutory\r\n\nclaims,  or  evidence  sufficient  to  support  his remaining\r\n\nMassachusetts common law tort claims, we affirm.   \r\n\n               Background and Prior Proceedings\r                           Background and Prior Proceedings\r                                                           \r\n\n          Speen began his career as a men's clothing salesman\r\n\nfollowing his discharge from the U.S. Army in 1945.  Over the\r\n\nensuing  twenty-seven years,  Speen served  as a  New England\r\n\nsales  representative for  various  companies.   In 1972,  he\r\n\nbecame a sales representative for Crown Clothing  Corporation\r\n\n(\"Crown\").  Jack and  Richard Silverman respectively serve as\r\n\nCrown's president and treasurer.\r\n\n          For   the  next   twenty  years,   Speen  travelled\r\n\nthroughout  New England  as  a  Crown representative  hawking\r\n\nCrown products  -- sports jackets, raincoats and  the like --\r\n\nto men's clothing stores.  For some of that time, Speen, with\r\n\nCrown's  approval, also  sold  non-competing lines  of  men's\r\n\nclothes from  other manufacturers,  most notably slacks.   By\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n1992, however, Speen's  relationship with Crown  increasingly\r\n\nsoured.  Speen's immediate supervisor, Jack  Silverman, often\r\n\nexpressed his dissatisfaction with Speen's declining raincoat\r\n\nsales.    In December  1992,  Crown notified  Speen  -- first\r\n\norally  and  then in  writing --  that  his service  would be\r\n\nterminated, effective the end of the month.  Crown went on to\r\n\nreplace Speen, then  71 years old, with a new representative,\r\n\naged 51.\r\n\n          In  June 1993, unwilling  to accept Crown's adverse\r\n\naction,  Speen  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Massachusetts\r\n\nCommission Against Discrimination (MCAD).  Without benefit of\r\n\nany MCAD  determination that  would carry with  it preclusive\r\n\neffect, Speen filed  this suit in  federal district court  in\r\n\nNovember  1994.   Speen's  federal  action  claimed that  his\r\n\ntermination amounted to unlawful age discrimination under the\r\n\nfederal  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act (ADEA),  29\r\n\nU.S.C.     621-634, and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B,   9, and also\r\n\nsought  pension rights  under the Employee  Retirement Income\r\n\nSecurity  Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.   1140.  Speen, in addition,\r\n\nadvanced a  Massachusetts common  law tort claim  against the\r\n\nSilvermans,  alleging   a  tortious  interference   with  his\r\n\nadvantageous business relationship with Crown.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Speen  also asserted claims  under Massachusetts statutes\r\ngoverning minimum  wage, overtime  pay, and the  frequency of\r\npayment of wages. In its Memorandum and Order of May 9, 1995,\r\nthe district court found these claims to be time-barred under\r\nthe  respectively applicable  statutes of  limitations. Speen\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The matter proceeded  to trial before  a jury.   At\r\n\nthe conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the  defendants filed\r\n\na motion for judgment as a  matter of law pursuant to Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 50(a) on essentially two grounds.  The first was that\r\n\nSpeen was  not a  Crown employee,  but rather  an independent\r\n\ncontractor  who enjoyed  no protection  under the  applicable\r\n\nstatutory provisions.2   The  second was  that Speen had  not\r\n\nproduced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to conclude that\r\n\nhe was maliciously discharged because of his age in violation\r\n\nof Massachusetts common law.   The court granted  the motion,\r\n\nordering a judgment for  the defendants on all claims.   This\r\n\nappeal ensued.\r\n\n          For the reasons set  forth below, we reject Speen's\r\n\narguments  concerning   the  employee/independent  contractor\r\n\nissue  and his Massachusetts common law  tort claims and thus\r\n\naffirm the district court's decision.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nsubsequently voluntarily dismissed these claims. \r\n\n2.  Crown and the Silvermans had previously filed a motion to\r\ndismiss and a motion for summary judgment on  essentially the\r\nsame  grounds. The district court denied both motions. At the\r\nsummary judgment  hearing, the district court  noted that the\r\nundisputed   facts  \"weigh[ed]   quite   heavily  toward   an\r\nevaluative determination of  independent contractor  status,\"\r\nexplaining  that it was \"very likely that that's the way it's\r\ngoing to appear to  [the court] at the end of the plaintiff's\r\nevidence.\"  The   court   nonetheless  denied   the   motion,\r\ndetermining that  a more  appropriate time for  resolving the\r\nemployee/independent contractor  issue would be at  the close\r\nof the plaintiff's  evidence in connection with a  motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review  de novo  a district court's  decision to\r                                        \r\n\ngrant judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a).  In\r\n\nexercising that  plenary review, we use  \"the 'same stringent\r\n\nstandard  incumbent  upon  the   trial  court  in  the  first\r\n\ninstance.'\"   Greenberg v. Union  Camp Corp., 48  F.3d 22, 26\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995)  (quoting Favorito v.  Pannell, 27 F.3d  716,\r                                                          \r\n\n719 (1st Cir. 1994)).\r\n\n          We  thus consider the  evidence and  the reasonable\r\n\ninferences that  are to be  drawn from it  in the light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the party opposing the motion, in this case, the\r\n\nplaintiff.   A motion for a  judgment as a matter  of law \"is\r\n\nproper  at  the  close  of  plaintiffs'  case  only  when the\r\n\nplaintiffs' evidence, viewed in  this light, would not permit\r\n\na reasonable  jury to find in favor  of the plaintiffs on any\r\n\npermissible claim  or theory.\"   Murray  v. Ross-Dove Co.,  5\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          The Employee/Independent Contractor Issue\r                      The Employee/Independent Contractor Issue\r                                                               \r\n\n          Crown contends that Speen cannot sue under the ADEA\r\n\nor  the Massachusetts anti-age  discrimination statute, Mass.\r\n\nGen. L. ch. 151B, because, for purposes of those statutes, he\r\n\nis  not  a  covered  \"employee,\" but  rather  an  unprotected\r\n\n\"independent contractor.\"    Speen vigorously  disputes  this\r\n\ncontention and  further argues that  the issue of  his proper\r\n\nclassification, in  any event,  was a  question for the  jury\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthat should not have been decided by the district  court on a\r\n\nRule 50(a) motion.\r\n\n          Both  federal and  Massachusetts courts  have found\r\n\nthat the federal  and Massachusetts statutes  prohibiting age\r\n\ndiscrimination   in  employment  do   not  reach  independent\r\n\ncontractors.

Less\r\n\neasily  discernible,  however,  are  the  tests  federal  and\r\n\nMassachusetts law use to  distinguish a covered employee from\r\n\nan unprotected independent contractor. \r\n\n          1. Employee Status Under Massachusetts Law\r                                                                \r\n\n          In   interpreting  the   Commonwealth's  employment\r\n\ndiscrimination law,  Mass.

Comey, 438 N.E.2d at 814.  The parties in this case both\r                      \r\n\nconcede this point.  Where they differ is in their assessment\r\n\nof what factors Massachusetts courts  look to in applying the\r\n\ncommon  law test.  Speen argues that a claimant is considered\r\n\nan employee under Massachusetts  law if he can show  that the\r\n\nemployer enjoyed the right to control his labor.  This, Speen\r\n\ncontends, he can do.  In particular, he argues he was a Crown\r\n\nemployee because he had to call in his orders every night and\r\n\nfill out special Crown order forms.  Crown responds that this\r\n\ntype  of  activity  does  not  make  one  an  employee  under\r\n\nMassachusetts law, since  a mere showing  of some element  of\r\n\ncontrol  is  not  conclusive  under  the  multifactored  test\r\n\nMassachusetts courts use to determine employee status.  \r\n\n          Speen  points  to older  Massachusetts  cases which\r\n\nindicate that the  test of  employee status is  the right  to\r\n\ncontrol.   McDermott's Case, 186  N.E. 231, 232  (Mass. 1933)\r                                       \r\n\n(\"The  exact point  at issue  is whether  the claimant  was a\r\n\nservant  or  employee, or  an  independent  contractor.   The\r\n\nessence of  the distinction is  the right of  control. . .  .\r\n\nOther  considerations and  tests are  important only  as they\r\n\nbear upon the right of  control.\"); Khoury v. Edison Electric\r                                                                         \r\n\nIlluminating Co., 164 N.E. 77, 78 (Mass. 1928) (\"Although the\r                            \r\n\nconclusive test of  the relationship of master and servant is\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthe  right  to control,  other factors  may be  considered in\r\n\ndetermining whether the right to control exists, but they are\r\n\nsubordinate to this primary test.\").\r\n\n          Upon  initial inspection,  the  language  in  these\r\n\ncases  would  seem to  support  Speen's  contention that  the\r\n\ndistrict court misstated  the relevant Massachusetts standard\r\n\nwhen  it concluded  that Massachusetts  uses a  multifactored\r\n\nanalysis   in   distinguishing  employees   from  independent\r\n\ncontractors.  A closer reading of the cases and consideration\r\n\nof  later  Massachusetts  decisions,  however,  dispels  this\r\n\nconclusion.\r\n\n          In  McDermott's   Case,  for  example,   the  court\r                                            \r\n\nexplained that an independent  contractor is one \"not subject\r\n\nto direction and  control as to every detail of  the work\" to\r\n\nbe performed.  Conversely,  an employee is one who  \"at every\r\n\nmoment,  with  respect  to every  detail.  .  .  is bound  to\r\n\nobedience and subject to direction and control.\"  McDermott's\r                                                                         \r\n\nCase,  186  N.E. at  232.   The  Khoury court  explained this\r                                                   \r\n\nfeature of the Massachusetts common law test as follows: \"the\r\n\nemployee must be subject to control by the employer, not only\r\n\nas to the result to be  accomplished but also as to the means\r\n\nto be used.\"  Khoury, 164 N.E. at 78. \r                                \r\n\n          Such  language,  gleaned  from  the  decisions upon\r\n\nwhich Speen's  counsel relies, indicates the  great degree to\r\n\nwhich  Speen and  Massachusetts courts mean  rather different\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthings  when  they refer  to  \"right of  control\"  within the\r\n\ncontext  of the  common law test.   Simply put,  the level of\r\n\nemployer  control (\"at  every moment,  with respect  to every\r\n\ndetail\")  necessary to conclusively establish employee status\r\n\nwithout  looking  to  any  of  the  additional  \"subordinate\"\r\n\nfactors is such that, as a practical matter, one may speak of\r\n\nthe common law test as being a multifactored one.\r\n\n          Subsequent   Massachusetts   case  law,   in  fact,\r\n\nacknowledges as  much.  While recognizing the vitality of the\r\n\ncommon  law test  in  Massachusetts, for  example, the  Comey\r                                                                         \r\n\ncourt explained  that \"[t]rial  judges  should carefully  and\r\n\nfully instruct juries on  all the factors that may  be useful\r\n\nin  distinguishing  employees from  independent contractors.\"\r\n\nComey, 438 N.E.2d at  815.  This language indicates  that the\r                 \r\n\ncommon  law test in Massachusetts, as  in other states, while\r\n\ndirected towards  the question of right  of control, involves\r\n\nthe assessment of multiple factors.  See Restatement (Second)\r                                                                         \r\n\nof  Agency   220 (1957).  Indeed, the Comey court immediately\r                                                       \r\n\ngoes  on  to  cite  with  approval federal  cases  which,  it\r\n\nexplains, \"list[]  factors  which may  distinguish  employees\r\n\nfrom independent contractors.\"  Id.\r                                              \r\n\n          Confronted with such language,  lower Massachusetts\r\n\ncourts have proceeded on the view that \r\n\n          [i]n  the  employment context,  a master-\r\n          servant relationship is  determined by  a\r\n          number of factors, including the right of\r\n          the  employer to  control the  details of\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          the work done by the employee, the method\r\n          of  payment, the  skill  required in  the\r\n          particular   occupation,    whether   the\r\n          employer     supplies     the      tools,\r\n          instrumentalities and place  of work,  as\r\n          well  as the  parties' own  belief as  to\r\n          whether  they  are  creating   a  master-\r\n          servant relationship.\r\n\nChase  v. Independent  Practice  Ass'n, 583  N.E.2d 251,  253\r                                                  \r\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1991).\r\n\n          The  district  court  thus  did  not  err  when  it\r\n\ndetermined this multifactored approach  to be the  applicable\r\n\nlegal test  in Massachusetts.  Contrary  to Speen's assertion\r\n\nthat  the district  court  found  that \"subordinate\"  factors\r\n\nmight outweigh the existence of a right of control, the state\r\n\ncases  tell us  that Massachusetts  courts make  the employee\r\n\ndetermination in this way only when a right of control is not\r\n\nconclusively   established  and  other  factors  need  to  be\r\n\nexamined.  Given how Massachusetts precedent discusses \"right\r\n\nof control\" in its  technical sense, this would seem  to mean\r\n\nthe  multifactored test  is triggered  when employer  control\r\n\ndoes not  encompass the person  hired \"at every  moment, with\r\n\nrespect to every detail.\"  McDermott's Case, 186 N.E. at 232.\r                                                       \r\n\n          It is  thus not  so much  the case that  additional\r\n\n\"subordinate\" factors might outweigh the existence of a right\r\n\nof  control  (as  Speen  wrongly contends  was  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  view) as  it is  that the  failure to  demonstrate a\r\n\n\"right of control\" in the narrowly-defined technical sense of\r\n\nthat term serves as the  gateway to a multifactored analysis.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nThis  analysis,  in  turn, does  not  ignore  but takes  into\r\n\naccount  the  level  of  control present  in  the  employment\r\n\nrelationship despite the fact that this control, taken alone,\r\n\nwould not be enough to establish employee status.\r\n\n          2. Employee Status Under the ADEA\r                                                       \r\n\n          Federal courts  have used at least  three different\r\n\ntests  to determine whether a  claimant is a covered employee\r\n\nrather than an unprotected independent contractor under anti-\r\n\ndiscrimination acts such as the ADEA.  The  first test is the\r\n\ntraditional common law  test of agency  which focuses on  the\r\n\nemployer's right of  control using a  multifactored analysis.\r\n\nSee Frankel v. Bally, Inc., 987  F.2d 86 (2d Cir. 1993).  The\r                                      \r\n\nsecond test  -- typically more expansive --  is the \"economic\r\n\nrealities\" test, which holds that \"employees are those who as\r\n\na matter of economic reality are dependent upon  the business\r\n\nto which they  render service.\"   Bartels v. Birmingham,  332\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 126, 130  (1947); Doty  v.

The third test is  a \"hybrid\" test, which\r\n\nconsiders   the  economic   realities   of   the   employment\r\n\nrelationship but retains  a focus on the employer's  right to\r\n\ncontrol.  See Oestman v. National Farmers Union Ins. Co., 958\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 303 (10th Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          The First Circuit has not previously  decided which\r\n\ntest to  apply to the ADEA.   In view of  the Supreme Court's\r\n\nunanimous decision in Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nU.S.  318  (1992),  we now  adopt  the  common  law test  for\r\n\ndetermining who qualifies as an \"employee\" under the ADEA and\r\n\nexpressly  hold that  covered  employees under  the ADEA  are\r\n\nthose  who  are   employees  under  traditional   agency  law\r\n\nprinciples.\r\n\n          While the Supreme Court has not directly determined\r\n\nthis  issue,  the   Court  in  Darden   faced  the  task   of\r                                                 \r\n\ninterpreting a  definition of  \"employee\" found in  ERISA, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.   1002(6) (\"any  individual employed by an employer\"),\r\n\nthat is virtually  identical to  that found in  the ADEA,  29\r\n\nU.S.C.    630(f) (\"an individual employed  by any employer\").\r\n\nSee Darden, 503  U.S. at 323.   The Court found this to  be a\r                      \r\n\n\"nominal  definition\"  that   \"is  completely  circular   and\r\n\nexplains  nothing.\" Id.

Speen's Status Under the ADEA and Mass. Gen. L.\r                                                                         \r\n\nch. 151B\r                    \r\n\n          Based  on our  review of  the relevant  federal and\r\n\nstate  precedent,  we  are  of  the  view  that  federal  and\r\n\nMassachusetts  law  use  roughly  identical  tests  based  on\r\n\ntraditional  agency  law principles  to  determine whether  a\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nclaimant  in  an  age  discrimination  suit  is  a  protected\r\n\nemployee. \r\n\n          There may be some  question whether the federal and\r\n\nstate tests  are employed in exactly the  same way in view of\r\n\nsome  of the  language  in older  Massachusetts decisions  we\r\n\nconsidered above.  These earlier opinions speak of  the right\r\n\nof  control  as  if it  were  a  predominant  factor that  is\r\n\nconsidered  before  and  above   others,  at  least  in  some\r\n\ninstances.  This way  of employing the multifactor test  runs\r\n\ncounter  to  instructions  the  Supreme  Court  reiterated in\r\n\nDarden,  503  U.S.  at 324  (\"all  of  the  incidents of  the\r                  \r\n\nrelationship must be assessed and  weighed with no one factor\r\n\nbeing  decisive.\") (internal  quotations  omitted).   To  the\r\n\nextent any  divergence between the federal  and Massachusetts\r\n\nmultifactor test might exist,3 it would seem to involve cases\r\n\nin  which  a hired  party is  subject  to the  \"direction and\r\n\ncontrol\" of the hiring party  \"at every moment, with  respect\r\n\nto every detail.\"  McDermott's Case, 186 N.E. at 232.\r                                               \r\n\n          A  review of  the  record,  however,  reveals  that\r\n\nSpeen's claim does not present such a case.   The record does\r\n\nnot contain  evidence that  even remotely suggests  Speen was\r\n\nsubject  to the  \"direction and control\"  of Crown  \"at every\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  As we more fully explained above, we are  not sure such a\r\ndifference  exists since  more recent  Massachusetts opinions\r\ncite  federal cases and the Restatement (Second) of Agency in\r\nsupport of their discussion. \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nmoment, with respect to every detail.\"  We are thus convinced\r\n\nthat  federal  and  Massachusetts  law  confront  Speen  with\r\n\nmultifactored tests concerning employee status that are, as a\r\n\npractical matter, indistinguishable.\r\n\n          Looking   at   the   record   with    this   common\r\n\nmultifactored test  in  mind  --  even through  a  lens  that\r\n\nrequires  us  to consider  the  evidence  and the  reasonable\r\n\ninferences that are  to be  drawn from it  in the light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to Speen  as the  non-moving party --  we conclude\r\n\nthat the district court  correctly granted Crown's motion for\r\n\na  judgment as  a  matter  of law  on  the  federal ADEA  and\r\n\nMassachusetts statutory age discrimination claims.\r\n\n          We  do  not see  how  the jury  was  presented with\r\n\nevidence sufficient  to support a  finding that Speen  was an\r\n\nemployee  rather  than an  independent  contractor.   Speen's\r\n\ncounsel  vigorously  argues   that  the  evidence   presented\r\n\nestablished that Crown kept Speen on a \"short leash\" and that\r\n\nhe  had  to  obey   \"onerous  work  rules.\"    The   evidence\r\n\noverwhelmingly  shows,  however, that  Speen  was  kept on  a\r\n\nrather long leash, if not  actually allowed to run free in  a\r\n\nrather large yard, and was  allowed to follow procedures that\r\n\nafforded  him the  type of  independence for  which employees\r\n\ntypically yearn.\r\n\n          We first  call attention to  the substantial number\r\n\nof  factors that, as the  district court rightly noted, weigh\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nin favor of  a finding that  Speen's relationship with  Crown\r\n\nwas  that of an independent contractor.  The evidence reveals\r\n\nthat  Speen himself  decided where  he went  and how  long he\r\n\nworked on  any particular  day.   How  and in  what order  he\r\n\ncovered his territory was something he determined.  Speen was\r\n\nnot required to  report to  a Crown  place of  business on  a\r\n\ndaily  basis;  in fact,  he  appeared  at  a  Crown  location\r\n\ninfrequently during the year.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  Speen  was   not  required  to  carry\r\n\nanything, do anything,  or say anything  in particular as  he\r\n\nwent  about  trying  to  sell  Crown  (and  other)  products.\r\n\nAlthough Crown  provided Speen with some  business cards that\r\n\nannounced him as a Crown representative and also provided him\r\n\nwith samples  that he was free  to use in attempting  to make\r\n\nsales, the  evidence does  not indicate that  Crown compelled\r\n\nSpeen to do  anything in particular or somehow controlled the\r\n\nmanner  in which Speen attempted to sell men's clothing.  The\r\n\nfact that Speen was paid on a commission basis also weighs in\r\n\nfavor of a finding of independent  contractor status, as does\r\n\nthe fact that  he received  Form 1099s rather  than W-2s  for\r\n\nfederal tax purposes.\r\n\n          Moreover,  Speen  had  early  on   told  his  Crown\r\n\nsupervisors he wished  to be  treated as an  employee and  in\r\n\nparticular  wished   to  be  enlisted   in  Crown's  employee\r\n\nretirement  pension plan.   Crown  refused and  gave  Speen a\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ntake-it-or-leave-it   response,   but  Speen   continued  his\r\n\nrelationship with Crown.  He did not reject what was offered;\r\n\nrather, he accepted it and worked under this regimen for many\r\n\nyears.  The parties' understanding and Speen's exclusion from\r\n\nCrown's employee pension plan  thus represent two  additional\r\n\nfactors  that weigh  in  favor of  a  finding of  independent\r\n\ncontractor status.\r\n\n          Several other salient factors were  also present in\r\n\nthe   Speen-Crown  relationship,   but  the   district  court\r\n\ncorrectly noted that they  are all compatible with  either an\r\n\nindependent  contractor  or  employee  relationship.    Thus,\r\n\nalthough Speen was  required to phone Crown  daily and report\r\n\nhis sales and  the calls  he had made,  typically by  leaving\r\n\ninformation  on an  answering  machine,  this arrangement  is\r\n\nequally compatible  with the status of  either an independent\r\n\ncontractor or employee.\r\n\n          Crown required Speen to attend two sales meetings a\r\n\nyear that  featured the introduction of the new season's line\r\n\nof clothing.   He  also was  required to  fill out orders  he\r\n\nobtained on forms that Crown provided.  Speen also decided to\r\n\nstop  selling non-Crown  items  once he  reached one  million\r\n\ndollars in sales on  Crown's line of products.   The district\r\n\ncourt correctly noted that  these features of the Speen-Crown\r\n\nrelationship  are   essentially  neutral  in   terms  of  the\r\n\nmultifactor  test,  since they  are  equally compatible  with\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\neither  an employee  or independent  contractor status.   The\r\n\nevidence  developed at  great and  tedious length  during the\r\n\nplaintiff's case  on these points thus  did not significantly\r\n\nadvance Speen's view of his relationship with Crown. \r\n\n          On the other hand,  the evidence presented  reveals\r\n\nnot  only  that  Speen  did  accept  the  take-it-or-leave-it\r\n\nproposition  Crown offered him, but  also that he  went on to\r\n\nform a corporation, Newton Company, Inc. (\"Newton\"), of which\r\n\nhe became an employee.  Some dispute exists  in the record as\r\n\nto  the  reason  behind  Speen's decision  to  establish  the\r\n\ncorporation, but  its  function  is  uncontroverted.    Crown\r\n\nissued  checks made out jointly  to Newton and  Speen for the\r\n\ncommissions  Speen's services  earned, and  Newton, in  turn,\r\n\npaid Speen.   The  district court  correctly noted  that this\r\n\nfact, while not conclusive in any specific sense, constituted\r\n\nan additional factor militating against a finding of employee\r\n\nstatus.\r\n\n          Under  the  multifactored  test, we  conclude  that\r\n\nthere was not enough  evidence from which a  factfinder could\r\n\nmake  a  reasoned determination  in  favor  of  Speen on  the\r\n\nquestion of whether he  was a Crown employee for  purposes of\r\n\nthe  ADEA or Massachusetts law.   As the  district court ably\r\n\ndetermined,  a finding  for the  plaintiff would  not comport\r\n\nwith the applicable legal standard governing employee status.\r\n\n                       The ERISA Claim\r                                   The ERISA Claim\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          The  preceding  analysis also  disposes  of Speen's\r\n\nERISA  claim.   In  view  of  the  Supreme Court's  unanimous\r\n\ninterpretation of the term \"employee\"  in Darden, 503 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n323, Speen  can be considered an employee  for ERISA purposes\r\n\nonly  if we so find using the same  test we have just used to\r\n\ndetermine that he is  not an employee for ADEA purposes.   We\r\n\nconclude, therefore, that Speen's  ERISA claim fails for lack\r\n\nof standing.\r\n\n           The Massachusetts Common Law Tort Claims\r                       The Massachusetts Common Law Tort Claims\r                                                               \r\n\n           Speen   finally   appeals  the   district  court's\r\n\ndisposition  of   his   Massachusetts  common   law   claims.\r\n\nSpecifically,   he  alleged   that  the   Silverman  brothers\r\n\ntortiously interfered with his advantageous relationship with\r\n\nCrown.  The district court entered  a judgment as a matter of\r\n\nlaw  in favor of the defendants  on the tortious interference\r\n\nclaim as well.\r\n\n          Under  established  Massachusetts jurisprudence,  a\r\n\nplaintiff   suing  for   relief  on   a  claim   of  tortious\r\n\ninterference must prove the  existence of the following: \"(1)\r\n\na business relationship or  contemplated contract of economic\r\n\nbenefit;   (2)  the   defendant's  knowledge   of  such   [a]\r\n\nrelationship; (3) the  defendant's intentional and  malicious\r\n\ninterference with  it; (4) the plaintiff's  loss of advantage\r\n\ndirectly resulting from the defendant's conduct.\"  Comey, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nN.E.2d  at 816 (citing Owen v.

See Comey, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d at 816-17.   This lifts the barrier that  proved fatal\r\n\nto Speen's federal and state statutory claims.\r\n\n          The  tort  of  interference  with  an  advantageous\r\n\nrelationship,  of  course,  does  not recognize  a  right  to\r\n\nlifetime   tenure  or  a   perpetual  business  relationship.\r\n\nMassachusetts case law discussing the claim in the context of\r\n\ndischarge cases explains that companies and their supervisors\r\n\nhave the right  to fire  or terminate the  services of  hired\r\n\nparties so long as they do not do so \"malevolently, i.e., for\r\n\na  spiteful, malignant purpose,  unrelated to  the legitimate\r\n\ncorporate interest.\"   Wright  v.

For our purposes, it is only important to note\r\n\nthat Massachusetts courts treat  a showing of intentional age\r\n\ndiscrimination  as sufficient  to  meet the  proof of  malice\r\n\nneeded  for recovery under this  tort claim.   See Comey, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d at 816-17.\r\n\n          Thus, our  inquiry turns to whether Speen presented\r\n\nsufficient  evidence of  age  discrimination  to require  the\r\n\nquestion to be put to the  jury.  For reasons that follow, we\r\n\nconclude he did not. \r\n\n          In reaching  this result, we focus  both on Speen's\r\n\nproffered  statistical arguments  regarding the  treatment of\r\n\nother  Crown  salesmen and  his  alleged  direct evidence  of\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\ndiscriminatory motive.   On the issue  of use of  statistical\r\n\nevidence,  our cases5 establish that a plaintiff need not and\r\n\n\"should  not be  required  to produce  'smoking-gun' evidence\r\n\nbefore prevailing  in a discrimination suit.   There are many\r\n\nveins  of circumstantial  evidence  that may  be  mined by  a\r\n\nplaintiff  to  this end.

In particular, Speen attempted to\r                                     \r\n\nrely on evidence that compared Crown's treatment of Speen and\r\n\nSpeen's  sales figures  with other  members of  Crown's sales\r\n\nforce.

Out  of a sales force of twenty\r\n\npeople, all  five salesmen  over the  age of  70 at the  time\r\n\nSpeen was discharged in December  1992 were still selling for\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nCrown at  the time of  the trial  of Speen's  claim in  March\r\n\n1996.    Combined  with  the  fact  that  no  other  salesmen\r\n\nexperienced a larger  decline in sales than  Speen during the\r\n\nfive year period  1987-1992, this part  of the evidence  does\r\n\nnot permit a reasoned  inference either of age discrimination\r\n\nor  that  Crown's  proffered  reason  for  terminating  Speen\r\n\n(declining and unsatisfactory sales figures) was pretextual.\r\n\n           Contrary to Speen's assertions, a different result\r\n\ndoes not  obtain if we  consider Speen's testimony  about the\r\n\nalleged  statement  that  Jack  Silverman  made  when   Speen\r\n\nallegedly  asked Silverman  to justify  the decision  to fire\r\n\nhim:  \"Why do I need a 71 year old when I can have a 51  year\r\n\nold?\"  This piece of  evidence, which we must credit  as true\r\n\nin view of the requirement that we review the evidence in the\r\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party, would  still not\r\n\nenable a jury to  draw a reasonable inference that  Speen was\r\n\nfired due to his age.\r\n\n          In   reaching  this   conclusion,  we   first  call\r\n\nattention  to the  line  of Massachusetts  and federal  cases\r\n\nwhich indicate that \"'isolated  or ambiguous remarks, tending\r\n\nto suggest  animus based  on age, are  insufficient, standing\r\n\nalone, to prove an employer's discriminatory intent.'\"  Blare\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Speen's  counsel  thus urges  us to\r\n\nconclude that \"even standing alone the plaintiff's  quotation\r\n\nof Jack  Silverman's comment to him, 'Why do I need a 71 year\r\n\nold  when I can have  a 51 year  old' is, if  credited by the\r\n\njury, sufficient toprove .. . [Speen]was fireddue to hisage.\"\r\n\n          We  reach a  contrary result  because the  relevant\r\n\ncase law instructs us not to consider the  statement standing\r\n\nalone  but instead to look  at all the  evidence presented in\r\n\nthe  totality of the circumstances.   In other  words, a fact\r\n\nfinder looking solely at  the statement \"Why  do I need a  71\r\n\nyear  old  when I  can  have a  51  year old\"  could  reach a\r\n\nreasonable inference that Speen was fired because of his age.\r\n\nBut that is not this case.   If we consider this statement in\r\n\nthe  context of all the evidence presented, which we must do,\r\n\nsince we are  not afforded the luxury  of selectively picking\r\n\nand choosing what evidence we will consider, we conclude that\r\n\nJudge   Keeton  was   correct  in   ruling  that   there  was\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\ninsufficient  evidence  for  a  jury  to  draw  a  reasonable\r\n\ninference  that Speen  was fired due  to his age  or permit a\r\n\nreasonable  inference  that   Crown's  proffered  reason  for\r\n\nterminating   Speen   (declining  and   unsatisfactory  sales\r\n\nfigures) was pretextual.\r\n\n          To  the extent  that we  reach a  different outcome\r\n\nthan  the  one Speen  urges,  Speen's mistaken  view  of what\r\n\nprecedent requires  a court to do  in a case like  the one at\r\n\nbar  explains this  difference.   Speen correctly  notes that\r\n\nproffered    direct    evidence   of    unlawful   employment\r\n\ndiscrimination  removes a claimant's case from the well-known\r\n\nMcDonnell Douglas  three-part test for  discrimination (prima\r                             \r\n\nfacie  case, legitimate business justification, and rebuttal)\r\n\noperative in  essentially the same way  in both Massachusetts\r\n\nand federal courts.  We have indicated as much.  See Smith v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.W.

The  evidence  does show  that some\r\n\nsalesmen who were not terminated had sales that declined more\r\n\nthan  Speen's in  absolute dollar  terms in  the year  or two\r\n\nprior to Speen's termination.   But other evidence shows that\r\n\nCrown salesmen each faced  different expectations in terms of\r\n\nyear-to-year  sales,  depending  on  the  location  of  their\r\n\nterritory, how long they had covered it, and other factors. \r\n\n          The   evidence   further  indicates   that  Speen's\r\n\nsupervisors were  unhappy with  Speen's performance and  that\r\n\nJack Silverman  had complained about Speen's  declining sales\r\n\nfigures and attitude  on numerous occasions in  the two years\r\n\nor  so prior  to  Speen's  termination.    In  at  least  one\r\n\ninstance, Silverman did so in  front of other Crown salesmen,\r\n\nmuch to Speen's embarrassment.  Speen's performance, however,\r\n\ndid  not improve.   The  evidence also  demonstrates  that at\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nleast two of Crown's more valued customers contacted Crown on\r\n\ntheir own volition to complain about Speen or to advise Crown\r\n\nto  replace  Speen with  \"a  real  salesman.\"   The  evidence\r\n\nfurther reveals  both that Crown had  terminated the services\r\n\nof  several salesmen and that other salesmen had retired.  No\r\n\ndiscernible age-related  pattern, however, emerges  from this\r\n\nevidence.  Those who  were fired included young, middle-aged,\r\n\nand older  salesmen.  We again note that out of a sales force\r\n\nof twenty people, all five salesmen over the age of 70 at the\r\n\ntime of Speen's  discharge in  December 1992  still sold  for\r\n\nCrown  at the time  of Speen's trial  in March 1996.   One of\r\n\nthose active salesmen was over 80 years old.\r\n\n          This proffered evidence --  considered in the light\r\n\nmost favorable to Speen,  but also in its entirety  -- cannot\r\n\nbe said either to permit a reasonable factfinder to reach the\r\n\nconclusion   that  Speen's  firing   was  triggered   by  age\r\n\ndiscrimination  or  to  permit  a  reasonable  inference that\r\n\nCrown's proffered reason for terminating Speen (declining and\r\n\nunsatisfactory sales  figures) was  pretextual.  Even  if the\r\n\njury credited Jack Silverman's alleged  statement, therefore,\r\n\nSpeen was not entitled to a jury verdict in his favor. \r\n\n          To be sure, our duty in this appeal from a judgment\r\n\nas a  matter  of  law  is to  review  the  evidence  and  the\r\n\nreasonable inferences  extractable from it in  the light most\r\n\nfavorable  to  the nonmovant,  namely,  Speen.   While  \"this\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\napproach does not allow the court to consider the credibility\r\n\nof witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the\r\n\nweight  of the  evidence, neither  does it  pave the  way for\r\n\nevery  case, no  matter  how  sketchy,  to reach  the  jury.\"\r\n\nSmith,  76 F.3d  at  425 (internal  quotations and  citations\r                 \r\n\nomitted).   Put another way, \"a mere scintilla of evidence is\r\n\nnot  enough to forestall a  directed verdict, especially on a\r\n\nclaim or issue as to which the burden of proof belongs to the\r\n\nobjecting  party.\"    Id.  at  425-26   (internal  quotations\r                                    \r\n\nomitted).   These  time-worn  principles of  law support  the\r\n\ndistrict court's disposition of this part of Speen's action.\r\n\n          Nothing  in  the  Massachusetts cases  leads  us to\r\n\nquestion   this  result   given   the  fact   that  the   age\r\n\ndiscrimination  issue  we  are  considering  is  embedded  in\r\n\nSpeen's  state common law tort  claim.  As  we noted earlier,\r\n\nMassachusetts courts have explained that the requisite malice\r\n\nrequired  for finding  liability under  a claim  for tortious\r\n\ninterference exists \"depend[ing] on the evidence in each case\r\n\nand on what the  trier of fact may reasonably infer from that\r\n\nevidence.\"    Gram,  429  N.E.2d  at  24.    \"Any  reasonable\r                              \r\n\ninference of malice must, however, be based on probabilities,\r\n\nrather  than  possibilities.\"     Id.   at  24-25   (internal\r                                                \r\n\nquotations omitted).

Because   Speen  failed   to  provide\r\n\nsufficient  evidence to support a finding that he was a Crown\r\n\nemployee for  the purposes of his federal and state statutory\r\n\nclaims,  or  evidence  sufficient  to  support  his remaining\r\n\nMassachusetts common law tort claims, we affirm.   \r\n\n               Background and Prior Proceedings\r                           Background and Prior Proceedings\r                                                           \r\n\n          Speen began his career as a men's clothing salesman\r\n\nfollowing his discharge from the U.S. Army in 1945.  Over the\r\n\nensuing  twenty-seven years,  Speen served  as a  New England\r\n\nsales  representative for  various  companies.   In 1972,  he\r\n\nbecame a sales representative for Crown Clothing  Corporation\r\n\n(\"Crown\").  Jack and  Richard Silverman respectively serve as\r\n\nCrown's president and treasurer.\r\n\n          For   the  next   twenty  years,   Speen  travelled\r\n\nthroughout  New England  as  a  Crown representative  hawking\r\n\nCrown products  -- sports jackets, raincoats and  the like --\r\n\nto men's clothing stores.  For some of that time, Speen, with\r\n\nCrown's  approval, also  sold  non-competing lines  of  men's\r\n\nclothes from  other manufacturers,  most notably slacks.   By\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n1992, however, Speen's  relationship with Crown  increasingly\r\n\nsoured.  Speen's immediate supervisor, Jack  Silverman, often\r\n\nexpressed his dissatisfaction with Speen's declining raincoat\r\n\nsales.    In December  1992,  Crown notified  Speen  -- first\r\n\norally  and  then in  writing --  that  his service  would be\r\n\nterminated, effective the end of the month.  Crown went on to\r\n\nreplace Speen, then  71 years old, with a new representative,\r\n\naged 51.\r\n\n          In  June 1993, unwilling  to accept Crown's adverse\r\n\naction,  Speen  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Massachusetts\r\n\nCommission Against Discrimination (MCAD).  Without benefit of\r\n\nany MCAD  determination that  would carry with  it preclusive\r\n\neffect, Speen filed  this suit in  federal district court  in\r\n\nNovember  1994.   Speen's  federal  action  claimed that  his\r\n\ntermination amounted to unlawful age discrimination under the\r\n\nfederal  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment  Act (ADEA),  29\r\n\nU.S.C.     621-634, and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B,   9, and also\r\n\nsought  pension rights  under the Employee  Retirement Income\r\n\nSecurity  Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.   1140.  Speen, in addition,\r\n\nadvanced a  Massachusetts common  law tort claim  against the\r\n\nSilvermans,  alleging   a  tortious  interference   with  his\r\n\nadvantageous business relationship with Crown.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Speen  also asserted claims  under Massachusetts statutes\r\ngoverning minimum  wage, overtime  pay, and the  frequency of\r\npayment of wages. In its Memorandum and Order of May 9, 1995,\r\nthe district court found these claims to be time-barred under\r\nthe  respectively applicable  statutes of  limitations. Speen\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The matter proceeded  to trial before  a jury.   At\r\n\nthe conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the  defendants filed\r\n\na motion for judgment as a  matter of law pursuant to Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 50(a) on essentially two grounds.  The first was that\r\n\nSpeen was  not a  Crown employee,  but rather  an independent\r\n\ncontractor  who enjoyed  no protection  under the  applicable\r\n\nstatutory provisions.2   The  second was  that Speen had  not\r\n\nproduced sufficient evidence to allow a jury to conclude that\r\n\nhe was maliciously discharged because of his age in violation\r\n\nof Massachusetts common law.   The court granted  the motion,\r\n\nordering a judgment for  the defendants on all claims.   This\r\n\nappeal ensued.\r\n\n          For the reasons set  forth below, we reject Speen's\r\n\narguments  concerning   the  employee/independent  contractor\r\n\nissue  and his Massachusetts common law  tort claims and thus\r\n\naffirm the district court's decision.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nsubsequently voluntarily dismissed these claims. \r\n\n2.  Crown and the Silvermans had previously filed a motion to\r\ndismiss and a motion for summary judgment on  essentially the\r\nsame  grounds. The district court denied both motions. At the\r\nsummary judgment  hearing, the district court  noted that the\r\nundisputed   facts  \"weigh[ed]   quite   heavily  toward   an\r\nevaluative determination of  independent contractor  status,\"\r\nexplaining  that it was \"very likely that that's the way it's\r\ngoing to appear to  [the court] at the end of the plaintiff's\r\nevidence.\"  The   court   nonetheless  denied   the   motion,\r\ndetermining that  a more  appropriate time for  resolving the\r\nemployee/independent contractor  issue would be at  the close\r\nof the plaintiff's  evidence in connection with a  motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review  de novo  a district court's  decision to\r                                        \r\n\ngrant judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a).  In\r\n\nexercising that  plenary review, we use  \"the 'same stringent\r\n\nstandard  incumbent  upon  the   trial  court  in  the  first\r\n\ninstance.'\"   Greenberg v.

Comey, 438 N.E.2d at 814.  The parties in this case both\r                      \r\n\nconcede this point.  Where they differ is in their assessment\r\n\nof what factors Massachusetts courts  look to in applying the\r\n\ncommon  law test.  Speen argues that a claimant is considered\r\n\nan employee under Massachusetts  law if he can show  that the\r\n\nemployer enjoyed the right to control his labor.  This, Speen\r\n\ncontends, he can do.  In particular, he argues he was a Crown\r\n\nemployee because he had to call in his orders every night and\r\n\nfill out special Crown order forms.  Crown responds that this\r\n\ntype  of  activity  does  not  make  one  an  employee  under\r\n\nMassachusetts law, since  a mere showing  of some element  of\r\n\ncontrol  is  not  conclusive  under  the  multifactored  test\r\n\nMassachusetts courts use to determine employee status.  \r\n\n          Speen  points  to older  Massachusetts  cases which\r\n\nindicate that the  test of  employee status is  the right  to\r\n\ncontrol.

Simply put,  the level of\r\n\nemployer  control (\"at  every moment,  with respect  to every\r\n\ndetail\")  necessary to conclusively establish employee status\r\n\nwithout  looking  to  any  of  the  additional  \"subordinate\"\r\n\nfactors is such that, as a practical matter, one may speak of\r\n\nthe common law test as being a multifactored one.\r\n\n          Subsequent   Massachusetts   case  law,   in  fact,\r\n\nacknowledges as  much.  While recognizing the vitality of the\r\n\ncommon  law test  in  Massachusetts, for  example, the  Comey\r                                                                         \r\n\ncourt explained  that \"[t]rial  judges  should carefully  and\r\n\nfully instruct juries on  all the factors that may  be useful\r\n\nin  distinguishing  employees from  independent contractors.\"\r\n\nComey, 438 N.E.2d at  815.  This language indicates  that the\r                 \r\n\ncommon  law test in Massachusetts, as  in other states, while\r\n\ndirected towards  the question of right  of control, involves\r\n\nthe assessment of multiple factors.  See Restatement (Second)\r                                                                         \r\n\nof  Agency   220 (1957).  Indeed, the Comey court immediately\r                                                       \r\n\ngoes  on  to  cite  with  approval federal  cases  which,  it\r\n\nexplains, \"list[]  factors  which may  distinguish  employees\r\n\nfrom independent contractors.\"  Id.\r                                              \r\n\n          Confronted with such language,  lower Massachusetts\r\n\ncourts have proceeded on the view that \r\n\n          [i]n  the  employment context,  a master-\r\n          servant relationship is  determined by  a\r\n          number of factors, including the right of\r\n          the  employer to  control the  details of\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          the work done by the employee, the method\r\n          of  payment, the  skill  required in  the\r\n          particular   occupation,    whether   the\r\n          employer     supplies     the      tools,\r\n          instrumentalities and place  of work,  as\r\n          well  as the  parties' own  belief as  to\r\n          whether  they  are  creating   a  master-\r\n          servant relationship.\r\n\nChase  v.

Contrary  to Speen's assertion\r\n\nthat  the district  court  found  that \"subordinate\"  factors\r\n\nmight outweigh the existence of a right of control, the state\r\n\ncases  tell us  that Massachusetts  courts make  the employee\r\n\ndetermination in this way only when a right of control is not\r\n\nconclusively   established  and  other  factors  need  to  be\r\n\nexamined.  Given how Massachusetts precedent discusses \"right\r\n\nof control\" in its  technical sense, this would seem  to mean\r\n\nthe  multifactored test  is triggered  when employer  control\r\n\ndoes not  encompass the person  hired \"at every  moment, with\r\n\nrespect to every detail.\"  McDermott's Case, 186 N.E. at 232.\r                                                       \r\n\n          It is  thus not  so much  the case that  additional\r\n\n\"subordinate\" factors might outweigh the existence of a right\r\n\nof  control  (as  Speen  wrongly contends  was  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  view) as  it is  that the  failure to  demonstrate a\r\n\n\"right of control\" in the narrowly-defined technical sense of\r\n\nthat term serves as the  gateway to a multifactored analysis.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nThis  analysis,  in  turn, does  not  ignore  but takes  into\r\n\naccount  the  level  of  control present  in  the  employment\r\n\nrelationship despite the fact that this control, taken alone,\r\n\nwould not be enough to establish employee status.\r\n\n          2.

The\r                                              \r\n\nCourt's analysis  of the difference between  these two pieces\r\n\nof   legislation   suggests  that   this   circuit's  earlier\r\n\npronouncements in  FLSA cases like Donovan  concerning use of\r                                                      \r\n\nthe \"economic  reality\" test  in determining employee  status\r\n\nmay  need to  be confined to  the FLSA context  in which they\r\n\nwere first enunciated.  In any  event, in view of the Court's\r\n\nexpress reasoning  in Darden, we feel  confident in reasoning\r                                        \r\n\nthat the  \"economic reality\" test cannot  be readily imported\r\n\ninto the ADEA context, either  on its own or as part  of some\r\n\n\"hybrid\"  test   that  amalgamates  the   \"economic  reality\"\r\n\nstandard and the traditional common law approach. \r\n\n          3.  Speen's Status Under the ADEA and Mass. Gen. L.\r                                                                         \r\n\nch. 151B\r                    \r\n\n          Based  on our  review of  the relevant  federal and\r\n\nstate  precedent,  we  are  of  the  view  that  federal  and\r\n\nMassachusetts  law  use  roughly  identical  tests  based  on\r\n\ntraditional  agency  law principles  to  determine whether  a\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nclaimant  in  an  age  discrimination  suit  is  a  protected\r\n\nemployee. \r\n\n          There may be some  question whether the federal and\r\n\nstate tests  are employed in exactly the  same way in view of\r\n\nsome  of the  language  in older  Massachusetts decisions  we\r\n\nconsidered above.  These earlier opinions speak of  the right\r\n\nof  control  as  if it  were  a  predominant  factor that  is\r\n\nconsidered  before  and  above   others,  at  least  in  some\r\n\ninstances.  This way  of employing the multifactor test  runs\r\n\ncounter  to  instructions  the  Supreme  Court  reiterated in\r\n\nDarden,  503  U.S.  at 324  (\"all  of  the  incidents of  the\r                  \r\n\nrelationship must be assessed and  weighed with no one factor\r\n\nbeing  decisive.\") (internal  quotations  omitted).   To  the\r\n\nextent any  divergence between the federal  and Massachusetts\r\n\nmultifactor test might exist,3 it would seem to involve cases\r\n\nin  which  a hired  party is  subject  to the  \"direction and\r\n\ncontrol\" of the hiring party  \"at every moment, with  respect\r\n\nto every detail.\"  McDermott's Case, 186 N.E. at 232.\r                                               \r\n\n          A  review of  the  record,  however,  reveals  that\r\n\nSpeen's claim does not present such a case.   The record does\r\n\nnot contain  evidence that  even remotely suggests  Speen was\r\n\nsubject  to the  \"direction and control\"  of Crown  \"at every\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  As we more fully explained above, we are  not sure such a\r\ndifference  exists since  more recent  Massachusetts opinions\r\ncite  federal cases and the Restatement (Second) of Agency in\r\nsupport of their discussion. \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nmoment, with respect to every detail.\"  We are thus convinced\r\n\nthat  federal  and  Massachusetts  law  confront  Speen  with\r\n\nmultifactored tests concerning employee status that are, as a\r\n\npractical matter, indistinguishable.\r\n\n          Looking   at   the   record   with    this   common\r\n\nmultifactored test  in  mind  --  even through  a  lens  that\r\n\nrequires  us  to consider  the  evidence  and the  reasonable\r\n\ninferences that are  to be  drawn from it  in the light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to Speen  as the  non-moving party --  we conclude\r\n\nthat the district court  correctly granted Crown's motion for\r\n\na  judgment as  a  matter  of law  on  the  federal ADEA  and\r\n\nMassachusetts statutory age discrimination claims.\r\n\n          We  do  not see  how  the jury  was  presented with\r\n\nevidence sufficient  to support a  finding that Speen  was an\r\n\nemployee  rather  than an  independent  contractor.   Speen's\r\n\ncounsel  vigorously  argues   that  the  evidence   presented\r\n\nestablished that Crown kept Speen on a \"short leash\" and that\r\n\nhe  had  to  obey   \"onerous  work  rules.\"    The   evidence\r\n\noverwhelmingly  shows,  however, that  Speen  was  kept on  a\r\n\nrather long leash, if not  actually allowed to run free in  a\r\n\nrather large yard, and was  allowed to follow procedures that\r\n\nafforded  him the  type of  independence for  which employees\r\n\ntypically yearn.\r\n\n          We first  call attention to  the substantial number\r\n\nof  factors that, as the  district court rightly noted, weigh\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nin favor of  a finding that  Speen's relationship with  Crown\r\n\nwas  that of an independent contractor.  The evidence reveals\r\n\nthat  Speen himself  decided where  he went  and how  long he\r\n\nworked on  any particular  day.   How  and in  what order  he\r\n\ncovered his territory was something he determined.  Speen was\r\n\nnot required to  report to  a Crown  place of  business on  a\r\n\ndaily  basis;  in fact,  he  appeared  at  a  Crown  location\r\n\ninfrequently during the year.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  Speen  was   not  required  to  carry\r\n\nanything, do anything,  or say anything  in particular as  he\r\n\nwent  about  trying  to  sell  Crown  (and  other)  products.\r\n\nAlthough Crown  provided Speen with some  business cards that\r\n\nannounced him as a Crown representative and also provided him\r\n\nwith samples  that he was free  to use in attempting  to make\r\n\nsales, the  evidence does  not indicate that  Crown compelled\r\n\nSpeen to do  anything in particular or somehow controlled the\r\n\nmanner  in which Speen attempted to sell men's clothing.  The\r\n\nfact that Speen was paid on a commission basis also weighs in\r\n\nfavor of a finding of independent  contractor status, as does\r\n\nthe fact that  he received  Form 1099s rather  than W-2s  for\r\n\nfederal tax purposes.\r\n\n          Moreover,  Speen  had  early  on   told  his  Crown\r\n\nsupervisors he wished  to be  treated as an  employee and  in\r\n\nparticular  wished   to  be  enlisted   in  Crown's  employee\r\n\nretirement  pension plan.   Crown  refused and  gave  Speen a\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ntake-it-or-leave-it   response,   but  Speen   continued  his\r\n\nrelationship with Crown.  He did not reject what was offered;\r\n\nrather, he accepted it and worked under this regimen for many\r\n\nyears.  The parties' understanding and Speen's exclusion from\r\n\nCrown's employee pension plan  thus represent two  additional\r\n\nfactors  that weigh  in  favor of  a  finding of  independent\r\n\ncontractor status.\r\n\n          Several other salient factors were  also present in\r\n\nthe   Speen-Crown  relationship,   but  the   district  court\r\n\ncorrectly noted that they  are all compatible with  either an\r\n\nindependent  contractor  or  employee  relationship.    Thus,\r\n\nalthough Speen was  required to phone Crown  daily and report\r\n\nhis sales and  the calls  he had made,  typically by  leaving\r\n\ninformation  on an  answering  machine,  this arrangement  is\r\n\nequally compatible  with the status of  either an independent\r\n\ncontractor or employee.\r\n\n          Crown required Speen to attend two sales meetings a\r\n\nyear that  featured the introduction of the new season's line\r\n\nof clothing.   He  also was  required to  fill out orders  he\r\n\nobtained on forms that Crown provided.  Speen also decided to\r\n\nstop  selling non-Crown  items  once he  reached one  million\r\n\ndollars in sales on  Crown's line of products.   The district\r\n\ncourt correctly noted that  these features of the Speen-Crown\r\n\nrelationship  are   essentially  neutral  in   terms  of  the\r\n\nmultifactor  test,  since they  are  equally compatible  with\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\neither  an employee  or independent  contractor status.   The\r\n\nevidence  developed at  great and  tedious length  during the\r\n\nplaintiff's case  on these points thus  did not significantly\r\n\nadvance Speen's view of his relationship with Crown. \r\n\n          On the other hand,  the evidence presented  reveals\r\n\nnot  only  that  Speen  did  accept  the  take-it-or-leave-it\r\n\nproposition  Crown offered him, but  also that he  went on to\r\n\nform a corporation, Newton Company, Inc. (\"Newton\"), of which\r\n\nhe became an employee.  Some dispute exists  in the record as\r\n\nto  the  reason  behind  Speen's decision  to  establish  the\r\n\ncorporation, but  its  function  is  uncontroverted.    Crown\r\n\nissued  checks made out jointly  to Newton and  Speen for the\r\n\ncommissions  Speen's services  earned, and  Newton, in  turn,\r\n\npaid Speen.   The  district court  correctly noted  that this\r\n\nfact, while not conclusive in any specific sense, constituted\r\n\nan additional factor militating against a finding of employee\r\n\nstatus.\r\n\n          Under  the  multifactored  test, we  conclude  that\r\n\nthere was not enough  evidence from which a  factfinder could\r\n\nmake  a  reasoned determination  in  favor  of  Speen on  the\r\n\nquestion of whether he  was a Crown employee for  purposes of\r\n\nthe  ADEA or Massachusetts law.   As the  district court ably\r\n\ndetermined,  a finding  for the  plaintiff would  not comport\r\n\nwith the applicable legal standard governing employee status.\r\n\n                       The ERISA Claim\r                                   The ERISA Claim\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          The  preceding  analysis also  disposes  of Speen's\r\n\nERISA  claim.   In  view  of  the  Supreme Court's  unanimous\r\n\ninterpretation of the term \"employee\"  in Darden, 503 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n323, Speen  can be considered an employee  for ERISA purposes\r\n\nonly  if we so find using the same  test we have just used to\r\n\ndetermine that he is  not an employee for ADEA purposes.   We\r\n\nconclude, therefore, that Speen's  ERISA claim fails for lack\r\n\nof standing.\r\n\n           The Massachusetts Common Law Tort Claims\r                       The Massachusetts Common Law Tort Claims\r                                                               \r\n\n           Speen   finally   appeals  the   district  court's\r\n\ndisposition  of   his   Massachusetts  common   law   claims.\r\n\nSpecifically,   he  alleged   that  the   Silverman  brothers\r\n\ntortiously interfered with his advantageous relationship with\r\n\nCrown.  The district court entered  a judgment as a matter of\r\n\nlaw  in favor of the defendants  on the tortious interference\r\n\nclaim as well.\r\n\n          Under  established  Massachusetts jurisprudence,  a\r\n\nplaintiff   suing  for   relief  on   a  claim   of  tortious\r\n\ninterference must prove the  existence of the following: \"(1)\r\n\na business relationship or  contemplated contract of economic\r\n\nbenefit;   (2)  the   defendant's  knowledge   of  such   [a]\r\n\nrelationship; (3) the  defendant's intentional and  malicious\r\n\ninterference with  it; (4) the plaintiff's  loss of advantage\r\n\ndirectly resulting from the defendant's conduct.\"  Comey, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nN.E.2d  at 816 (citing Owen v.

See Comey, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d at 816-17.   This lifts the barrier that  proved fatal\r\n\nto Speen's federal and state statutory claims.\r\n\n          The  tort  of  interference  with  an  advantageous\r\n\nrelationship,  of  course,  does  not recognize  a  right  to\r\n\nlifetime   tenure  or  a   perpetual  business  relationship.\r\n\nMassachusetts case law discussing the claim in the context of\r\n\ndischarge cases explains that companies and their supervisors\r\n\nhave the right  to fire  or terminate the  services of  hired\r\n\nparties so long as they do not do so \"malevolently, i.e., for\r\n\na  spiteful, malignant purpose,  unrelated to  the legitimate\r\n\ncorporate interest.\"   Wright  v.

For our purposes, it is only important to note\r\n\nthat Massachusetts courts treat  a showing of intentional age\r\n\ndiscrimination  as sufficient  to  meet the  proof of  malice\r\n\nneeded  for recovery under this  tort claim.   See Comey, 438\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d at 816-17.\r\n\n          Thus, our  inquiry turns to whether Speen presented\r\n\nsufficient  evidence of  age  discrimination  to require  the\r\n\nquestion to be put to the  jury.  For reasons that follow, we\r\n\nconclude he did not. \r\n\n          In reaching  this result, we focus  both on Speen's\r\n\nproffered  statistical arguments  regarding the  treatment of\r\n\nother  Crown  salesmen and  his  alleged  direct evidence  of\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\ndiscriminatory motive.

Ironically,   the  evidence\r\n\npresented weighs against the  finding of disparate  treatment\r\n\nthat  Speen sought to prove.  Out  of a sales force of twenty\r\n\npeople, all  five salesmen  over the  age of  70 at the  time\r\n\nSpeen was discharged in December  1992 were still selling for\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nCrown at  the time of  the trial  of Speen's  claim in  March\r\n\n1996.    Combined  with  the  fact  that  no  other  salesmen\r\n\nexperienced a larger  decline in sales than  Speen during the\r\n\nfive year period  1987-1992, this part  of the evidence  does\r\n\nnot permit a reasoned  inference either of age discrimination\r\n\nor  that  Crown's  proffered  reason  for  terminating  Speen\r\n\n(declining and unsatisfactory sales figures) was pretextual.\r\n\n           Contrary to Speen's assertions, a different result\r\n\ndoes not  obtain if we  consider Speen's testimony  about the\r\n\nalleged  statement  that  Jack  Silverman  made  when   Speen\r\n\nallegedly  asked Silverman  to justify  the decision  to fire\r\n\nhim:  \"Why do I need a 71 year old when I can have a 51  year\r\n\nold?\"  This piece of  evidence, which we must credit  as true\r\n\nin view of the requirement that we review the evidence in the\r\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party, would  still not\r\n\nenable a jury to  draw a reasonable inference that  Speen was\r\n\nfired due to his age.\r\n\n          In   reaching  this   conclusion,  we   first  call\r\n\nattention  to the  line  of Massachusetts  and federal  cases\r\n\nwhich indicate that \"'isolated  or ambiguous remarks, tending\r\n\nto suggest  animus based  on age, are  insufficient, standing\r\n\nalone, to prove an employer's discriminatory intent.'\"  Blare\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Speen's  counsel  thus urges  us to\r\n\nconclude that \"even standing alone the plaintiff's  quotation\r\n\nof Jack  Silverman's comment to him, 'Why do I need a 71 year\r\n\nold  when I can have  a 51 year  old' is, if  credited by the\r\n\njury, sufficient toprove .. . [Speen]was fireddue to hisage.\"\r\n\n          We  reach a  contrary result  because the  relevant\r\n\ncase law instructs us not to consider the  statement standing\r\n\nalone  but instead to look  at all the  evidence presented in\r\n\nthe  totality of the circumstances.   In other  words, a fact\r\n\nfinder looking solely at  the statement \"Why  do I need a  71\r\n\nyear  old  when I  can  have a  51  year old\"  could  reach a\r\n\nreasonable inference that Speen was fired because of his age.\r\n\nBut that is not this case.   If we consider this statement in\r\n\nthe  context of all the evidence presented, which we must do,\r\n\nsince we are  not afforded the luxury  of selectively picking\r\n\nand choosing what evidence we will consider, we conclude that\r\n\nJudge   Keeton  was   correct  in   ruling  that   there  was\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\ninsufficient  evidence  for  a  jury  to  draw  a  reasonable\r\n\ninference  that Speen  was fired due  to his age  or permit a\r\n\nreasonable  inference  that   Crown's  proffered  reason  for\r\n\nterminating   Speen   (declining  and   unsatisfactory  sales\r\n\nfigures) was pretextual.\r\n\n          To  the extent  that we  reach a  different outcome\r\n\nthan  the  one Speen  urges,  Speen's mistaken  view  of what\r\n\nprecedent requires  a court to do  in a case like  the one at\r\n\nbar  explains this  difference.   Speen correctly  notes that\r\n\nproffered    direct    evidence   of    unlawful   employment\r\n\ndiscrimination  removes a claimant's case from the well-known\r\n\nMcDonnell Douglas  three-part test for  discrimination (prima\r                             \r\n\nfacie  case, legitimate business justification, and rebuttal)\r\n\noperative in  essentially the same way  in both Massachusetts\r\n\nand federal courts.

The  evidence  does show  that some\r\n\nsalesmen who were not terminated had sales that declined more\r\n\nthan  Speen's in  absolute dollar  terms in  the year  or two\r\n\nprior to Speen's termination.   But other evidence shows that\r\n\nCrown salesmen each faced  different expectations in terms of\r\n\nyear-to-year  sales,  depending  on  the  location  of  their\r\n\nterritory, how long they had covered it, and other factors. \r\n\n          The   evidence   further  indicates   that  Speen's\r\n\nsupervisors were  unhappy with  Speen's performance and  that\r\n\nJack Silverman  had complained about Speen's  declining sales\r\n\nfigures and attitude  on numerous occasions in  the two years\r\n\nor  so prior  to  Speen's  termination.    In  at  least  one\r\n\ninstance, Silverman did so in  front of other Crown salesmen,\r\n\nmuch to Speen's embarrassment.  Speen's performance, however,\r\n\ndid  not improve.   The  evidence also  demonstrates  that at\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nleast two of Crown's more valued customers contacted Crown on\r\n\ntheir own volition to complain about Speen or to advise Crown\r\n\nto  replace  Speen with  \"a  real  salesman.\"   The  evidence\r\n\nfurther reveals  both that Crown had  terminated the services\r\n\nof  several salesmen and that other salesmen had retired.  No\r\n\ndiscernible age-related  pattern, however, emerges  from this\r\n\nevidence.  Those who  were fired included young, middle-aged,\r\n\nand older  salesmen.  We again note that out of a sales force\r\n\nof twenty people, all five salesmen over the age of 70 at the\r\n\ntime of Speen's  discharge in  December 1992  still sold  for\r\n\nCrown  at the time  of Speen's trial  in March 1996.   One of\r\n\nthose active salesmen was over 80 years old.\r\n\n          This proffered evidence --  considered in the light\r\n\nmost favorable to Speen,  but also in its entirety  -- cannot\r\n\nbe said either to permit a reasonable factfinder to reach the\r\n\nconclusion   that  Speen's  firing   was  triggered   by  age\r\n\ndiscrimination  or  to  permit  a  reasonable  inference that\r\n\nCrown's proffered reason for terminating Speen (declining and\r\n\nunsatisfactory sales  figures) was  pretextual.  Even  if the\r\n\njury credited Jack Silverman's alleged  statement, therefore,\r\n\nSpeen was not entitled to a jury verdict in his favor. \r\n\n          To be sure, our duty in this appeal from a judgment\r\n\nas a  matter  of  law  is to  review  the  evidence  and  the\r\n\nreasonable inferences  extractable from it in  the light most\r\n\nfavorable  to  the nonmovant,  namely,  Speen.   While  \"this\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\napproach does not allow the court to consider the credibility\r\n\nof witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the\r\n\nweight  of the  evidence, neither  does it  pave the  way for\r\n\nevery  case, no  matter  how  sketchy,  to reach  the  jury.\"\r\n\nSmith,  76 F.3d  at  425 (internal  quotations and  citations\r                 \r\n\nomitted).

These  time-worn  principles of  law support  the\r\n\ndistrict court's disposition of this part of Speen's action.\r\n\n          Nothing  in  the  Massachusetts cases  leads  us to\r\n\nquestion   this  result   given   the  fact   that  the   age\r\n\ndiscrimination  issue  we  are  considering  is  embedded  in\r\n\nSpeen's  state common law tort  claim.  As  we noted earlier,\r\n\nMassachusetts courts have explained that the requisite malice\r\n\nrequired  for finding  liability under  a claim  for tortious\r\n\ninterference exists \"depend[ing] on the evidence in each case\r\n\nand on what the  trier of fact may reasonably infer from that\r\n\nevidence.\"    Gram,  429  N.E.2d  at  24.    \"Any  reasonable\r                              \r\n\ninference of malice must, however, be based on probabilities,\r\n\nrather  than  possibilities.\"     Id.   at  24-25   (internal\r                                                \r\n\nquotations omitted).   In view  of the language  in Gram,  we\r                                                                    \r\n\nthus  conclude  that  Massachusetts  courts  would  not  view\r\n\nSpeen's  claim (that  he was  fired due  to his  age) as  one\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nsupported by reasonable  inferences drawn  from the  evidence\r\n\npresented.\r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          Speen  failed to  provide  sufficient  evidence  to\r\n\nsupport  a finding that he  was a Crown  employee who enjoyed\r\n\nprotection under  the applicable federal and  state statutory\r\n\nprovisions governing age  discrimination and pension  rights.\r\n\nNor  did  he  produce  evidence  sufficient  to  support  his\r\n\nremaining  Massachusetts  common law  tort  claims.   On  the\r\n\nevidence  presented, we  conclude  that the  district court's\r\n\nentry  of judgment  as  a matter  of  law for  the  appellee-\r\n\ndefendants was correct.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n</pre>",
