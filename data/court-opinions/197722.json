In this  action to\r                                                    \r\n\nrecover  funds  advanced  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service\r\n\n(\"IRS\")  by   George  W.   David,  plaintiff-appellant,   the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's opinion, confirmed by the district  court,\r\n\nacceptably  reduced the dispute to what  was the character of\r\n\nDavid's  remittance, whether a tax  payment or a deposit, and\r\n\nwhether the  equities overcame a decision  otherwise favoring\r\n\nthe government.  On summary judgment, it found the remittance\r\n\na payment,  which meant that  the refund claim had  been made\r\n\ntoo late, and denied any equitable extension.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Shortly before April 15, 1990, when his 1989 income\r\n\ntax return,  and payment, were to fall  due, David's business\r\n\nrecords were taken into federal  custody pursuant to a search\r\n\nwarrant.   Without them he  could not prepare his  return or,\r\n\nallegedly, even reasonably estimate his  tax.  On April 15 he\r\n\nfiled  a request  on Form  4868 for  an automatic  four month\r\n\nextension of time to file his return.  With  this he enclosed\r\n\na  check for  $12,000, which  the IRS  negotiated.   He later\r\n\nobtained a second extension to October  15, 1990.  He did not\r\n\nfile his 1989 return, however, until February 24, 1994.\r\n\n          On the return when filed David noted the $12,000 as\r\n\nan \"Amount paid with Form 4868.\"  With credits, it turned out\r\n\nthat all that  had been due was $749,  and the return claimed\r\n\nrefund of the  $11,251 balance.  The refund  claim was timely\r\n\nunder I.R.C.   6511(a).  Cf.  Oropallo v. United States,  994\r                                                                   \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nF.2d 25,  27 (1st  Cir. 1993) (per  curiam) (assuming  that a\r\n\nlate return is  a \"return\" within the  meaning of   6511(a)),\r\n\ncert.  denied, 510  U.S. 1050  (1994).   Unhappily,  however,\r                         \r\n\n  6511(b)(2)(A) limited the amount of credit or refund to the\r\n\namount  of tax  paid within  the  three years,  plus the  six\r\n\nmonths extension preceding the refund claim.  Accordingly, as\r\n\na claim  for refund of a tax payment  made on April 15, 1990,\r\n\nDavid's return was some four months too late.  It was not too\r\n\nlate if the remittance had simply been a deposit.\r\n\n          The IRS stood on its position of payment, and David\r\n\nbrought  this  suit.   In  his  complaint,  doubtless because\r\n\nexecuted pro se, he asserted that he was suing for an  income\r\n\ntax refund  of $11,251,  which, inescapably,  was the  unused\r\n\nportion  of  his  $12,000 remittance.    Eventually,  when he\r\n\nobtained counsel who examined the law, David realized that he\r\n\nhad intended  the $12,000  to be a  general deposit,  not the\r\n\nestimated  tax  payment  (larger  for  safety),  required  to\r\n\naccompany his Form 4868.\r\n\n          Concededly,  whether a remittance  to the IRS  is a\r\n\npayment, or is a general  deposit whose recovery would not be\r\n\nstatutorily  barred,   may  be   a  matter   of  intent   and\r\n\ncircumstance.  See  generally Rosenman v. United  States, 323\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 658,  662 (1945); Moran  v. United States, 63  F.3d 663,\r                                                          \r\n\n668-69 (7th Cir. 1995); Blatt  v. United States, 34 F.3d 252,\r                                                           \r\n\n254-55 (4th Cir. 1994).  But even if the IRS is  incorrect in\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nclaiming  that the circumstances  shown warrant finding  of a\r\n\ntax payment as matter of law under I.R.C.   6513(b)(1), which\r\n\nwe do not  decide, but cf. Gabelman v.  Commissioner, 86 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n609,  612 (6th  Cir.  1996) (holding  remittance accompanying\r\n\nForm  4868  to  be  a  payment  as  a  matter  of  law  under\r\n\n  6513(b)(1));  Weigand v. United States, 760 F.2d 1072, 1073\r                                                    \r\n\n(10th Cir.  1985) (same), it  is only natural to  assume that\r\n\nthe  $12,000 check  was the  payment that  the form  said was\r\n\nrequired in the  absence of  any assertion  to the  contrary.\r\n\nDavid points to  no objective manifestation of  his \"deposit\"\r\n\nintention at the time of remittance.1  To this we add his now\r\n\ncounsel's  inability, at  oral argument,  even  to suggest  a\r\n\npurpose for intending a deposit.\r\n\n          We  cannot decide in David's favor.  Undoubtedly he\r\n\nhad a tax liability on April 15, 1990.  See I.R.C.   6151(a);\r                                                       \r\n\nManning v. Seeley  Tube &amp; Box Co., 338 U.S.  561, 565 (1950).\r                                             \r\n\nHis extension to  file did not postpone this  liability.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n26  C.F.R.    1.6081-1(a)  and 1.6081-4(b).    His Form  4868\r\n\nremittance, required to be an estimate of this liability, was\r\n\nmade in  recognition thereof.   With no further  showing, the\r\n\npresumed  intention  was  to  discharge  the  liability  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Neither party was able to produce David's Form 4868.  His\r\noft-repeated   characterization   of    his   remittance   as\r\n\"arbitrary\" in calculation  is insufficient  in this  regard.\r\nSimilarly  insufficient are his  contentions as to  the IRS's\r\naccounting  practices,   which  reveal  nothing   of  David's\r\nsupposed deposit intent.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nrenders the remittance a payment.  Cf. Moran, 63 F.3d at 668;\r                                                        \r\n\nBlatt, 34  F.3d at 255-57;  Ewing v. United States,  914 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n499, 504 (4th Cir. 1990),  cert. denied, 500 U.S. 905 (1991);\r                                                   \r\n\nAmeel v. United States, 426  F.2d 1270, 1273 (6th Cir. 1970).\r                                  \r\n\nAccordingly,  David's  refund   claim  fails  by   reason  of\r\n\n  6511(b)(2)(A).\r\n\n          David's  equitable   claim,  failing   his  deposit\r\n\nargument,  is based  on the  following facts.   His  time for\r\n\nfiling a claim for refund of a  tax payment made on April 15,\r\n\n1990 would expire, given the six months extension allowed for\r\n\nfiling the return  and claim, on October  15, 1993.  On  that\r\n\ndate, however, he was in  federal custody.  The total picture\r\n\nis  that the  government maintained  its  custody of  David's\r\n\nneeded records  from April 4,  1990 until February  21, 1992.\r\n\nIt  then,  pursuant to  an  agreement between  David  and his\r\n\nformer  employer, released them  to a third  party for making\r\n\ncopies;  neither principal party  to have access  without the\r\n\npresence of the  other until the copying was  completed.  For\r\n\nsome  undisclosed reason,  David  did  not  finally  get  his\r\n\nrecords until December 31, 1992.\r\n\n          Surely  there could be  no per diem  charge against\r\n\nthe government for the time that the records were lawfully in\r\n\nits custody early on; the equity issue would turn on how much\r\n\ntime was  left, obviously there  was enough.  Nor  should the\r\n\ngovernment be  charged for the  possible difficulties imposed\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nby David's  voluntary surrender  thereafter for  copying.   A\r\n\nmore serious matter,  following a plea (to  unrelated federal\r\n\ncounts) on December 10, 1992, David himself was in government\r\n\ncustody; January 8, 1993 to October 4, 1993, in prison; then,\r\n\nto January 5, 1994, in  a halfway house.  Reasonably promptly\r\n\nthereafter, on  February 24,  1994, he  filed his return  and\r\n\nrefund claim.\r\n\n          In United  States v. Brockamp, 117 S. Ct. 849, 852-\r                                                   \r\n\n53  (1997),  the  Court,  seemingly  flatly,  ruled  out  all\r\n\nequitable claims that  would supplement the statutorily-given\r\n\nreasons for tolling  or extending the time  for filing claims\r\n\nfor  refund  of   tax  payments.     We  might  consider   it\r\n\nparticularly rough for  the government to lock  up a taxpayer\r\n\nbefore the time for a claim of refund  would expire, and then\r\n\ntell him it was  too late.  At the same  time, we must adhere\r\n\nto the Court's recognition that \"Congress decided  to pay the\r\n\nprice  of   occasional   unfairness   in   individual   cases\r\n\n(penalizing a taxpayer whose claim is unavoidably delayed) in\r\n\norder  to maintain a  more workable tax  enforcement system.\"\r\n\nId. at 852; cf. Oropallo,  994 F.2d at 28-31.  We do not want\r                                    \r\n\nto  recognize   a  special  exception  for   taxpayers  whose\r\n\ndifficulties are due to their criminal convictions.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

We affirm.\r\n\n          Shortly before April 15, 1990, when his 1989 income\r\n\ntax return,  and payment, were to fall  due, David's business\r\n\nrecords were taken into federal  custody pursuant to a search\r\n\nwarrant.   Without them he  could not prepare his  return or,\r\n\nallegedly, even reasonably estimate his  tax.  On April 15 he\r\n\nfiled  a request  on Form  4868 for  an automatic  four month\r\n\nextension of time to file his return.  With  this he enclosed\r\n\na  check for  $12,000, which  the IRS  negotiated.   He later\r\n\nobtained a second extension to October  15, 1990.  He did not\r\n\nfile his 1989 return, however, until February 24, 1994.\r\n\n          On the return when filed David noted the $12,000 as\r\n\nan \"Amount paid with Form 4868.\"  With credits, it turned out\r\n\nthat all that  had been due was $749,  and the return claimed\r\n\nrefund of the  $11,251 balance.  The refund  claim was timely\r\n\nunder I.R.C.   6511(a).  Cf.  Oropallo v. United States,  994\r                                                                   \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nF.2d 25,  27 (1st  Cir. 1993) (per  curiam) (assuming  that a\r\n\nlate return is  a \"return\" within the  meaning of   6511(a)),\r\n\ncert.  denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1994).   Unhappily,  however,\r                         \r\n\n  6511(b)(2)(A) limited the amount of credit or refund to the\r\n\namount  of tax  paid within  the  three years,  plus the  six\r\n\nmonths extension preceding the refund claim.  Accordingly, as\r\n\na claim  for refund of a tax payment  made on April 15, 1990,\r\n\nDavid's return was some four months too late.  It was not too\r\n\nlate if the remittance had simply been a deposit.\r\n\n          The IRS stood on its position of payment, and David\r\n\nbrought  this  suit.   In  his  complaint,  doubtless because\r\n\nexecuted pro se, he asserted that he was suing for an  income\r\n\ntax refund  of $11,251,  which, inescapably,  was the  unused\r\n\nportion  of  his  $12,000 remittance.    Eventually,  when he\r\n\nobtained counsel who examined the law, David realized that he\r\n\nhad intended  the $12,000  to be a  general deposit,  not the\r\n\nestimated  tax  payment  (larger  for  safety),  required  to\r\n\naccompany his Form 4868.\r\n\n          Concededly,  whether a remittance  to the IRS  is a\r\n\npayment, or is a general  deposit whose recovery would not be\r\n\nstatutorily  barred,   may  be   a  matter   of  intent   and\r\n\ncircumstance.

His  time for\r\n\nfiling a claim for refund of a  tax payment made on April 15,\r\n\n1990 would expire, given the six months extension allowed for\r\n\nfiling the return  and claim, on October  15, 1993.  On  that\r\n\ndate, however, he was in  federal custody.  The total picture\r\n\nis  that the  government maintained  its  custody of  David's\r\n\nneeded records  from April 4,  1990 until February  21, 1992.\r\n\nIt  then,  pursuant to  an  agreement between  David  and his\r\n\nformer  employer, released them  to a third  party for making\r\n\ncopies;  neither principal party  to have access  without the\r\n\npresence of the  other until the copying was  completed.  For\r\n\nsome  undisclosed reason,  David  did  not  finally  get  his\r\n\nrecords until December 31, 1992.\r\n\n          Surely  there could be  no per diem  charge against\r\n\nthe government for the time that the records were lawfully in\r\n\nits custody early on; the equity issue would turn on how much\r\n\ntime was  left, obviously there  was enough.  Nor  should the\r\n\ngovernment be  charged for the  possible difficulties imposed\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nby David's  voluntary surrender  thereafter for  copying.   A\r\n\nmore serious matter,  following a plea (to  unrelated federal\r\n\ncounts) on December 10, 1992, David himself was in government\r\n\ncustody; January 8, 1993 to October 4, 1993, in prison; then,\r\n\nto January 5, 1994, in  a halfway house.  Reasonably promptly\r\n\nthereafter, on  February 24,  1994, he  filed his return  and\r\n\nrefund claim.\r\n\n          In United  States v. Brockamp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118083\"><a href=\"/opinion/118083/united-states-v-brockamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We  might  consider   it\r\n\nparticularly rough for  the government to lock  up a taxpayer\r\n\nbefore the time for a claim of refund  would expire, and then\r\n\ntell him it was  too late.
