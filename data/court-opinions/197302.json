The rule states in pertinent part:\r\n\n          The  judgment  sought  shall be  rendered\r\n          forthwith if  the pleadings, depositions,\r\n          answers    to     interrogatories,    and\r\n          admissions  on  file,  together with  the\r\n          affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n          genuine issue as to any material fact and\r\n          that the  moving party  is entitled  to a\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nsons  were  the co-trustees  of The  Andrea L.  Printy Family\r\n\nTrust, (the Trust)  which had been established in  1986 after\r\n\nthe  death  of Printy's  wife.    Printy was  an  experienced\r\n\ninvestor and knowledgeable in the finance field.  At the time\r\n\nof discovery in this  case he was a business  consultant with\r\n\neighteen  years' experience  in financial  services.   He had\r\n\nbeen  issued  a  broker's  license and  had  held  management\r\n\npositions in several financial services companies.\r\n\n          On August 26, 1992, Printy transferred  the Trust's\r\n\naccount  to  the  office   of  Dean  Witter  in  Minneapolis,\r\n\nMinnesota.   The  record  shows  that  Printy  made  all  the\r\n\ndecisions  about the  Trust; the  sons play  no part  in this\r\n\ncase.  Dean Witter is a national broker-dealer in securities.\r\n\nIt is registered with  the Securities and Exchange Commission\r\n\nand is  a member of  the National  Association of  Securities\r\n\nDealers.  The account was opened in the name of the Trust and\r\n\nfunded with a deposit of $50,000.00.\r\n\n          The account  executive at Dean Witter  in charge of\r\n\nthe  Trust account was Michael Krmpotich.  He and Printy were\r\n\nacquainted.  Printy had tried to persuade Krmpotich to join a\r\n\nbroker-dealer  company  in  New Ulm,  Minnesota,  with  which\r\n\nPrinty  had  been  affiliated.    It  was  Krmpotich  who had\r\n\nsolicited the Trust account.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Printy  executed an Active Assets Account Agreement\r\n\nwith  Dean Witter, effective  September 30, 1992.   Under the\r\n\nterms  of the  agreement, any  controversies relative  to the\r\n\naccount  were  subject to  arbitration.    The Active  Assets\r\n\nAccount permitted the holder to buy and sell securities.  The\r\n\naccount holder  could also write  checks on, or  receive wire\r\n\ntransfers from,  the Account.   Additionally,  the securities\r\n\nheld in the account could be used as collateral for borrowing\r\n\nfunds  from Dean  Witter \"on  margin\"   in order  to purchase\r\n\nadditional securities or  for other reasons.   The amount  of\r\n\nmoney Dean Witter would permit an account holder to borrow on\r\n\nmargin was calculated based  on the value of the  assets held\r\n\nin the  account.    Under  the agreement, if  the Trust  owed\r\n\nmoney to Dean  Witter for margin borrowing  or other reasons,\r\n\nDean Witter  was  entitled  to  a security  interest  in  any\r\n\nsecurities or property held in the Trust's account.\r\n\n          In early  September of 1992,  Dean Witter  received\r\n\nthe  following assets from the  Trust:  a  U.S. Treasury Note\r\n\nand stock  holdings in:   Baxter International,  Inc., Marion\r\n\nMerrill Dow,  Inc., Vital Heart Systems,  Inc., Eastman Kodak\r\n\nCo., Weyerhaeuser Co., Bank America Corp., and J. P. Morgan &amp;\r\n\nCo.   In  addition  to  these  assets, Dean  Witter  received\r\n\n150,000 shares  of Health Concepts,  Inc. and an  interest in\r\n\nMCI  Medical  Seed  Limited  Partnership.    Printy  was  the\r\n\npresident, secretary, and  a shareholder of  Health Concepts.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nHe knew  that the stock  was not  traded on  any exchange  or\r\n\nover-the-counter market  and had  very little value,  if any.\r\n\nThe bankruptcy  judge points out in  connection with Printy's\r\n\nbankruptcy schedules that in Schedule B - Personal Property -\r\n\nPrinty gave a zero  value to his holdings in  Health Concepts\r\n\nand  did  not discuss  the stock  at  all in  the liquidation\r\n\nanalysis section  of his Disclosure Statement  submitted with\r\n\nhis Plan of Reorganization. \r\n\n          As part  of its  services, Dean Witter  sent Printy\r\n\nmonthly  statements detailing  and  summarizing  the  Trust's\r\n\nassets.   As of September 30, 1992, the Dean Witter statement\r\n\nshowed  the  market  value  of   the  Trust's  assets  to  be\r\n\n$191,533.33,  with a  borrowing  limit of  $141,104.50.   The\r\n\nstatement did not reflect the  receipt of the Health Concepts\r\n\nstock or the interest in the MCI Medical Seed Partnership.\r\n\n          Next comes  the event  that led  to this law  suit.\r\n\nThe Dean  Witter  statement for  the  month of  October  1992\r\n\nshowed  receipt by the Trust  on October 28,  1992 of 150,000\r\n\nshares  of   Coastal  HealthCare   stock  with  a   value  of\r\n\n$3,637,500.00.  Coastal HealthCare  stock is publicly traded.\r\n\nIn his  deposition testimony  Printy stated  that he  did not\r\n\nauthorize the  purchase of  the Coastal HealthCare  stock and\r\n\nnever received stock-purchase confirmation slips.  The reason\r\n\nfor this  obviously mistaken increase  of over three  and one\r\n\nhalf million  dollars in the asset  value of the Trust  was a\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncomputer  error  by  Dean  Witter.    The  Trust's  virtually\r\n\nworthless Health Concepts shares  had been given the computer\r\n\ncode for  Coastal HealthCare shares, thus  attributing to the\r\n\nTrust ownership of Coastal HealthCare stock, which it did not\r\n\nown.\r\n\n          On  November 16,  1992,  Printy sent  a fax  to the\r\n\nTrust's account  broker, Krmpotich,  and his  assistant, Lynn\r\n\nJorgenson, asking that 15,000 shares of Coastal HealthCare be\r\n\ndelivered  to  him  but  left  in  the  name  of  the  Trust.\r\n\nJorgenson informed Printy that  Dean Witter could not deliver\r\n\nanything  but the entire  holding of 150,000  shares.  Printy\r\n\nauthorized  the delivery of the 150,000 shares.  In due time,\r\n\nhe  received  a  certificate  for 150,000  shares  of  Health\r\n\nConcepts, not the Coastal HealthCare shares he had requested.\r\n\n          The  computer mix-up  between  Health Concepts  and\r\n\nCoastal HealthCare  continued through November of  1992.  The\r\n\nNovember 1992 statement showed that 150,000 shares of Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare valued at $3,712,500.00  had been debited from the\r\n\naccount.  As  a result,  the total asset  value of the  Trust\r\n\nshrunk   to   $100,475.00   from   the   October   value   of\r\n\n$3,775,925.00.\r\n\n          Printy returned the  150,000 shares certificate  of\r\n\nHealth  Concepts to  Dean Witter  on December  1, 1992.   The\r\n\ncomputer  continued on its merry way  in the wrong direction.\r\n\nThe Dean  Witter December  1992 statement showed  the Trust's\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nreceipt  on   December  2   of  150,000  shares   of  Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare, with an increase  in asset value from $100,475.00\r\n\nto $4,984,275.00.\r\n\n          The December statement,  however, showed more  than\r\n\nthe  return of  the  Coastal HealthCare  stock  to the  Trust\r\n\naccount.  It showed  that Printy purchased a total  of 22,409\r\n\nshares of stock in twelve companies and withdrew through wire\r\n\ntransfers  or  checks,  $262,501.11  from the  account.    In\r\n\nJanuary  of 1993, Printy bought  a total of  16,763 shares of\r\n\nstock in  eight companies  and withdrew $373,670.14  from the\r\n\naccount.   In both  months, the Coastal  HealthCare stock was\r\n\nused to  calculate the authorized limit  for margin borrowing\r\n\nand these  purchases and withdrawals were  made against these\r\n\nerroneously inflated margin limits.\r\n\n          It is  true, as Printy asserts,  that Krmpotich and\r\n\nother brokers  from Dean  Witter urged  Printy to make  stock\r\n\npurchases  on the basis of the Trust's borrowing limits.  But\r\n\nnone  of the brokers  at Dean Witter  knew of the  error that\r\n\ninflated  the value of the Trust's assets.  They assumed that\r\n\nDean Witter's monthly statements were accurate.  The only one\r\n\nwho knew  the monthly statements were  grossly inaccurate was\r\n\nPrinty.    In his  deposition  Printy testified  that  he had\r\n\nquestions  about how his account  was being handled.   But he\r\n\nnever told Krmpotich that he did not own any stock in Coastal\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nHealthCare  and  that the  authorized  borrowing  limits were\r\n\nwrong.\r\n\n          Dean  Witter finally  corrected  the error  in  the\r\n\nFebruary  1993  statement.   The  150,000  shares of  Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare, with a value  of $2,962,500.00, were debited from\r\n\nthe Trust account, and the 150,000 shares of Health Concepts,\r\n\nwith no value, were credited to it.  Dean Witter  also made a\r\n\nmargin  call.  After the margin call, the Trust's account had\r\n\na deficit of $600,230.82 that was not repaid to Dean Witter.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\r                                  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\r                                                   \r\n\n          On  March   30,  1993,  Dean  Witter  commenced  an\r\n\narbitration  proceeding against  Printy,  his  sons, and  the\r\n\nTrust before the National  Association of Securities Dealers.\r\n\nThe  Statement  of Claim  consisted  of  eight counts,  which\r\n\nincluded counts  for  theft and  receiving  stolen  property,\r\n\ncommon-law fraud,  violations  of Minnesota  securities  law,\r\n\ncommon-law  conversion, and common-law replevin.  Dean Witter\r\n\nsought $603,548.00 in compensatory damages, plus interest and\r\n\nattorney's fees,  against all respondents.   Punitive damages\r\n\nwere sought against Printy only.\r\n\n          Printy  responded  to the  Statement  of  Claim and\r\n\nraised  a number  of  affirmative allegations.   The  defense\r\n\nconsisted  of denial of wrongdoing and  shifting the blame to\r\n\nDean Witter.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          The  arbitration  award was  issued on  January 20,\r\n\n1994.   It  found Printy,  his sons  as co-trustees,  and the\r\n\nTrust  liable  for  compensatory  damages in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$634,820.00 plus interest, from February 1, 1993, through the\r\n\ndate of payment  of the  award.  The  arbitration panel  also\r\n\nfoundPrinty liableforpunitivedamagesintheamountof$375,000.00.\r\n\n          Printy filed a voluntary  petition under Chapter 11\r\n\nof  the  Bankruptcy  Code  prior to  Dean  Witter  having the\r\n\narbitration award  confirmed.   Dean  Witter obtained  relief\r\n\nfrom the automatic stay  imposed under the Code.   On January\r\n\n30, 1995, the  Hennepin County District Court for  the Fourth\r\n\nJudicial  District  of  Minnesota confirmed  the  arbitration\r\n\naward.

Section 523 of the Code provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n            523.  Exceptions to discharge\r                        523.  Exceptions to discharge\r\n\n               (a) A discharge  under section  727,\r                           (a)\r\n          1141,  1228(a),  1228(b),  or 1328(b)  of\r\n          this   title   does   not  discharge   an\r\n          individual debtor from any debt--\r\n\n               (2)  for money,  property, services,\r                           (2)\r\n          or an extension, renewal,  or refinancing\r\n          of credit, to the extent obtained by--\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n                    (A)  false  pretenses,   a\r                                (A)\r\n               false representation, or actual\r\n               fraud,  other than  a statement\r\n               respecting  the debtor's  or an\r\n               insider's financial condition;\r\n\n          . . .\r\n\n               (6) for willful and malicious injury\r                           (6)\r\n          by the debtor to another entity or to the\r\n          property of another entity;\r\n\n(Footnote omitted).\r\n\n          Printy  argues  that  the  sections   are  mutually\r\n\nexclusive and  the district  court erred in  proceeding under\r\n\n(a)(6).  This is an ingenious argument but it is convincingly\r\n\nrebutted by the words of the statute and the case law.  There\r\n\nis  no indication in    523 that Congress  intended these two\r\n\nsections to  be mutually exclusive, nor  does the legislative\r\n\nhistory of the statute so suggest.\r\n\n          Printy candidly admits  that, \"[a] number of  cases\r\n\nhave  either applied both provisions  to fraud claims or have\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nindicated an  inclination to do  so.\"2  The cases  do hold as\r\n\nPrinty says.\r\n\n          Both parties have referred  us to Grogan v. Garner,\r                                                                        \r\n\n498 U.S. 279, 282 n.2 (1991), which states:\r\n\n               We  therefore  do  not consider  the\r\n          question  whether    523(a)(2)(A) excepts\r\n          from discharge that part of a judgment in\r\n          excess of  the actual value  of money  or\r\n          property received by  a debtor by  virtue\r\n          of fraud.  See In re Rubin, 875 F.2d 755,\r                                                \r\n          758, n.1  (CA9  1989).   Arguably,  fraud\r\n          judgments in cases in which the defendant\r\n          did  not  obtain   money,  property,   or\r\n          services  from  the plaintiffs  and those\r\n          judgments  that include  punitive damages\r\n          awards are more appropriately governed by\r\n            523(a)(6).

Viewing Printy's  actions as the\r\n\ntort of  conversion, there are cases  holding that conversion\r\n\nfalls within the ambit of   523(a)(6).  See In re Stanley, 66\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 664,  668 (4th Cir. 1995);  In re Lindberg, 49  B.R. 228\r                                                           \r\n\n(Bankr.

Ill.\r                                      \r\n\n1993), the bankruptcy court framed the issue as we see it:\r\n\n          [T]here is nothing in the text of section\r\n          523(a)(6)  which   precludes  its  proper\r\n          invocation  by  an aggrieved  party whose\r\n          claim  for  willful and  malicious injury\r\n          sounds  in fraud.  The critical focus for\r\n          relief  under  section  523(a)(6) for  an\r\n          aggrieved   creditor   is   the   conduct\r\n          committed by the debtor, if found willful\r\n          and malicious under the facts, whether or\r\n          not  such conduct  might also  fit within\r\n          one or  more of  the other  exceptions to\r\n          discharge under section 523(a).\r\n\n162 B.R. at 155-56.\r\n\n          Printy cites to  In re Price,  123 B.R. 42  (Bankr.\r                                                  \r\n\nN.D.  Ill. 1991),  as  precedent for  its mutually  exclusive\r\n\nargument.  Price, however, is the only case so holding and we\r                            \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndecline to follow it.  We hold that sections 523(a)(2)(A) and\r\n\n(a)(6) are  not  mutually exclusive.    It follows  that  the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court did  not err  in using    523(a)(6)  as the\r\n\nsection applicable to Printy's conduct.\r\n\n          The  next issue  is whether  there  were sufficient\r\n\nuncontroverted  facts  to  establish  that  Printy's  conduct\r\n\nviolated    523(a)(6).  We start our analysis with an attempt\r\n\nto  determine   the  meaning   of  the  words   \"willful  and\r\n\nmalicious.\"   The  House Judiciary  Committee's  Report  that\r\n\naccompanied the  passage of the 1978  Bankruptcy Code defined\r\n\n\"willful\"  as  \"deliberate or  intentional\"  and stated  that\r\n\n\"recklessness\" was  no longer the standard for \"willfulness.\"\r\n\nH.R.  Rep. No.  95-595,  at  365  (1977), reprinted  in  1978\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5963, 6320-21.  This, however, is only the\r\n\nbeginning of our task.\r\n\n          As  the  bankruptcy  court  pointed  out, there  is\r\n\ndisagreement  among the  circuits as  to whether  the statute\r\n\nrequires  an intentional act that results in an injury or one\r\n\ndone with the intention of causing an injury, with variations\r\n\non  this theme.   In Piccicuto v.  Dwyer, 39 F.3d  37, 41 n.3\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1994), we noted \"this  difficult and controversial\r\n\nissue.\"   We declined to enter the fray, however, because the\r\n\nparties  had agreed on a  definition which we  used to decide\r\n\nthe case:   \"for  an act  to be willful  and malicious  under\r\n\n  523(a)(6), it must  be 'deliberate,' 'wrongful,'  and 'done\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nwithout  regard to  its consequences'. .  . .\"   Id.  at 41. \r                                                                \r\n\nThat option is not available in this case.\r\n\n          We start with  a survey of the cases.   The rule in\r\n\nthe Eleventh  Circuit is that \"willful\"  means an intentional\r\n\nor deliberate act,  not done merely in  reckless disregard of\r\n\nthe rights of  another.

Our final  case  is,\r\n\ntherefore, In re Long, 774 F.2d 875,  881 (8th Cir. 1985), in\r                                 \r\n\nwhich  the Eighth Circuit stated:   \"When transfers in breach\r\n\nof   security   agreements   are   in   issue,   we   believe\r\n\nnondischargeability  turns  on  whether  the  conduct is  (1)\r\n\nheadstrong and  knowing ('willful') and, (2)  targeted at the\r\n\ncreditor  ('malicious'),  at  least  in the  sense  that  the\r\n\nconduct  is  certain or  almost  certain  to cause  financial\r\n\nharm.\"\r\n\n          The majority rule followed by the bankruptcy courts\r\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts can be stated as follows:\r\n\n          \"[M]alicious\"  means  an   act  done   in\r\n          conscious disregard of  one's duties.  No\r\n          special malice toward  the creditor  need\r\n          be shown.\r\n\n          . . . \r\n\n          [T]he  term  \"willful  and malicious\"  in\r\n            523(a)(6)  means  an act  intentionally\r\n          committed, without just cause  or excuse,\r\n          in conscious disregard  of one's duty and\r\n          that necessarily produces an injury.\r\n\nSee In re Lubanski, 186 B.R. 160, 165 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1995).\r                              \r\n\n          We adopt  the rule of the  Massachusetts bankruptcy\r\n\ncourts and  the  further  refinement  of  it  in    Collier's\r\n\ntreatise on bankruptcy:\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n               To  fall  within  the  exception  of\r\n          section  523(a)(6),  the  injury   to  an\r\n          entity or property must have been willful\r\n          and malicious.  An injury to an entity or\r\n          property may be a malicious injury within\r\n          this provision  if  it was  wrongful  and\r\n          without just cause or excuse, even in the\r\n          absence of personal hatred, spite or ill-\r\n          will.\r\n\n               The  word   \"willfull\"  [sic]  means\r\n          \"deliberate or intentional,\" referring to\r\n          a  deliberate  and  intentional act  that\r\n          necessarily leads to injury.   Therefore,\r\n          a wrongful act done  intentionally, which\r\n          necessarily  produces harm or which has a\r\n          substantial certainty of causing harm and\r\n          is without just cause or excuse, may be a\r\n          willful  and  malicious  injury.    While\r\n          something more than  a mere voluntary act\r\n          is  necessary  to  satisfy  the  scienter\r\n          requirement    of    section   523(a)(6),\r\n          specific   intent   to   injure  is   not\r\n          necessary.\r\n\n               The   malice   element  of   section\r\n          523(a)(6) requires an intent to cause the\r\n          harm,  and the  fact that the  injury was\r\n          caused through negligence or recklessness\r\n          does not satisfy that standard  of proof.\r\n          An  injury  inflicted willfully  and with\r\n          malice  under  section  523(a)(6) is  one\r\n          inflicted intentionally and deliberately,\r\n          and either  with the intent to  cause the\r\n          harm complained of,  or in  circumstances\r\n          in which the  harm was certain or  almost\r\n          certain to result from the debtor's act.\r\n\n4 Collier on  Bankruptcy   523.12 (15th ed.  1996) (footnotes\r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          We agree with  the bankruptcy court that,  whatever\r\n\nstandard is  applied here, summary judgment  was warranted on\r\n\nthe  uncontroverted facts.    There can  be no  question that\r\n\nPrinty willfully  and maliciously injured Dean  Witter by not\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ninforming it that a mistake had been made by crediting to the\r\n\nTrust account  the Coastal HealthCare stock  that Printy knew\r\n\nhe  did  not own.   Printy  took  advantage of  Dean Witter's\r\n\ncomputer error  by borrowing  against  and withdrawing  funds\r\n\nfrom the  false margin  account that  derived its  value from\r\n\nshares  of  stock that  Printy  knew he  did not  own.   Such\r\n\nconduct  by  Printy  translates  easily  into  an  intent  to\r\n\nwillfully and maliciously cause harm.\r\n\n          Printy attempts  to blunt or obscure what he did by\r\n\narguing  that Dean Witter did not prove that \"its own conduct\r\n\nwas  not an intervening cause  in the creation  of the debt.\"\r\n\nAppellant's  Br.  at  21.     Printy  mischaracterizes   what\r\n\nhappened.  There is no question that Dean Witter's error gave\r\n\nPrinty the  opportunity to use  Dean Witter's assets  for his\r\n\nown gain.    Printy  saw  the mistaken  transfer  of  Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare shares as  a way to make  some money quickly.   To\r\n\nput it bluntly, Printy saw a chance to make a killing at Dean\r\n\nWitter's  expense and he took  it.  There  was no intervening\r\n\ncause.  The sole proximate cause was Printy's greed.\r\n\n          The  final   issue  we   discuss  is   whether  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court erred in  ruling that Printy's counterclaims\r\n\nwere barred by res judicata because they were decided against\r                                       \r\n\nPrinty in the arbitration proceedings.\r\n\n          Count  I  of  the  counterclaim  asserts  breach of\r\n\ncontract by  Dean Witter.  The  essence of the claim  is that\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nDean Witter  agreed that  it would accurately  administer the\r\n\nTrust  account and  failed  to do  so.   It  is  specifically\r\n\nalleged that Dean Witter refused to correct the statements in\r\n\nthe  Trust  account  when  \"its  errors  were  called  to its\r\n\nattention.\"   And it  is alleged  that Dean  Witter's broker,\r\n\nKrmpotich,  \"induced and  recommended that  the Family  Trust\r\n\nengage in transactions based on the statements as provided by\r\n\nDean Witter.\"  There are four other allegations in this count\r\n\nthat do not warrant further discussion.3\r\n\n          The  specific allegation  in the  counterclaim that\r\n\nDean  Witter refused to  correct the statements  in the Trust\r\n\naccount \"when its errors were called to its attention\" has no\r\n\nsupport in  the record.  In  fact, the record  is directly to\r\n\nthe contrary.  At  his deposition Printy admitted that  at no\r\n\ntime did  he tell Krmpotich or his  assistant that he did not\r\n\nown any stock in  Coastal HealthCare, and that the  stock the\r\n\nTrust  held was Health  Concepts, whose value  was de minimis\r                                                                         \r\n\ncompared to the three to four million dollar value of Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare.  We find that there is no basis in the record for\r\n\nCount I of the counterclaim.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  \"(9)  Failure by  Dean  Witter to  supervise its  Midwest\r\nOperations  Center;   (10)   failure  to   supervise   broker\r\nKrmpotich; (11) breach of the implied  covenant of good faith\r\nand  fair  dealing; and  (12) that  as  a result,  Printy was\r\ndamaged.\"\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n          Count II of the counterclaim  sounds in negligence.\r\n\nIt alleges  that because  of Dean Witter's  negligence Printy\r\n\nincurred damages.  We have already disposed of the negligence\r\n\nclaim  of  Printy.    It  has  no  merit  either  legally  or\r\n\nfactually.\r\n\n          Count III  alleges a breach  by Dean Witter  of its\r\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing.  This claim  is based on\r\n\nthe following assertions:\r\n\n          16.  As  part  of  the  arbitration  with\r\n          Printy,   Dean  Witter   sought  punitive\r\n          damages.\r\n\n          17.  Dean  Witter has taken  the position\r\n          throughout    the   country    in   other\r\n          arbitrations  pursuant  to  its  customer\r\n          agreements that punitive damages  are not\r\n          available under New York law or any other\r\n          law.\r\n\n          18.  Dean Witter has stated  publicly its\r\n          view  that  punitive   damages  are   not\r\n          available in arbitrations pursuant to its\r\n          customer agreements.\r\n\n          19.  Having  taken  this  position  as  a\r\n          matter of its  consistent practice,  Dean\r\n          Witter is  acting in  bad  faith to  seek\r\n          punitive  damages  against  Printy.   Its\r\n          attempt  to  recover   such  damages   is\r\n          fundamentally unfair and discriminatory.\r\n\n          20.  As   a   result  of   Dean  Witter's\r\n          actions, Printy has been damaged.\r\n\n          Printy  has  cited no  cases supporting  this novel\r\n\nclaim.  We have not looked for any.  We have found nothing in\r\n\nthe record  that would factually support  the statements made\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nin  paragraphs 17 and 18.  We  find that this claim, like the\r\n\nothers asserted in the counterclaim, has no merit.\r\n\n          We also  agree with  the bankruptcy court  that the\r\n\ndoctrine  of   res  judicata   bars   consideration  of   the\r                                        \r\n\ncounterclaim because  the issues asserted in the counterclaim\r\n\nwere   also  raised   as  affirmative   allegations  in   the\r\n\narbitration proceedings.

Shearson/American Exp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n829 F.2d 1201,  1208 (1st  Cir. 1987), we  held that where  a\r\n\nparty  had the  \"full  power\"  to  press  its  claim  in  the\r\n\narbitration   proceeding,    \"[t]he   arbitration   decision,\r\n\ntherefore, stands  as a  res judicata bar  to these  claims.\"\r                                                 \r\n\nSee also  Aunyx Corp. v.

Printy Family\r\n\nTrust, (the Trust)  which had been established in  1986 after\r\n\nthe  death  of Printy's  wife.    Printy was  an  experienced\r\n\ninvestor and knowledgeable in the finance field.  At the time\r\n\nof discovery in this  case he was a business  consultant with\r\n\neighteen  years' experience  in financial  services.   He had\r\n\nbeen  issued  a  broker's  license and  had  held  management\r\n\npositions in several financial services companies.\r\n\n          On August 26, 1992, Printy transferred  the Trust's\r\n\naccount  to  the  office   of  Dean  Witter  in  Minneapolis,\r\n\nMinnesota.   The  record  shows  that  Printy  made  all  the\r\n\ndecisions  about the  Trust; the  sons play  no part  in this\r\n\ncase.  Dean Witter is a national broker-dealer in securities.\r\n\nIt is registered with  the Securities and Exchange Commission\r\n\nand is  a member of  the National  Association of  Securities\r\n\nDealers.  The account was opened in the name of the Trust and\r\n\nfunded with a deposit of $50,000.00.\r\n\n          The account  executive at Dean Witter  in charge of\r\n\nthe  Trust account was Michael Krmpotich.  He and Printy were\r\n\nacquainted.  Printy had tried to persuade Krmpotich to join a\r\n\nbroker-dealer  company  in  New Ulm,  Minnesota,  with  which\r\n\nPrinty  had  been  affiliated.    It  was  Krmpotich  who had\r\n\nsolicited the Trust account.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Printy  executed an Active Assets Account Agreement\r\n\nwith  Dean Witter, effective  September 30, 1992.   Under the\r\n\nterms  of the  agreement, any  controversies relative  to the\r\n\naccount  were  subject to  arbitration.    The Active  Assets\r\n\nAccount permitted the holder to buy and sell securities.  The\r\n\naccount holder  could also write  checks on, or  receive wire\r\n\ntransfers from,  the Account.   Additionally,  the securities\r\n\nheld in the account could be used as collateral for borrowing\r\n\nfunds  from Dean  Witter \"on  margin\"   in order  to purchase\r\n\nadditional securities or  for other reasons.   The amount  of\r\n\nmoney Dean Witter would permit an account holder to borrow on\r\n\nmargin was calculated based  on the value of the  assets held\r\n\nin the  account.    Under  the agreement, if  the Trust  owed\r\n\nmoney to Dean  Witter for margin borrowing  or other reasons,\r\n\nDean Witter  was  entitled  to  a security  interest  in  any\r\n\nsecurities or property held in the Trust's account.\r\n\n          In early  September of 1992,  Dean Witter  received\r\n\nthe  following assets from the  Trust:  a  U.S. Treasury Note\r\n\nand stock  holdings in:   Baxter International,  Inc., Marion\r\n\nMerrill Dow,  Inc., Vital Heart Systems,  Inc., Eastman Kodak\r\n\nCo., Weyerhaeuser Co., Bank America Corp., and J. P. Morgan &amp;\r\n\nCo.   In  addition  to  these  assets, Dean  Witter  received\r\n\n150,000 shares  of Health Concepts,  Inc. and an  interest in\r\n\nMCI  Medical  Seed  Limited  Partnership.    Printy  was  the\r\n\npresident, secretary, and  a shareholder of  Health Concepts.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nHe knew  that the stock  was not  traded on  any exchange  or\r\n\nover-the-counter market  and had  very little value,  if any.\r\n\nThe bankruptcy  judge points out in  connection with Printy's\r\n\nbankruptcy schedules that in Schedule B - Personal Property -\r\n\nPrinty gave a zero  value to his holdings in  Health Concepts\r\n\nand  did  not discuss  the stock  at  all in  the liquidation\r\n\nanalysis section  of his Disclosure Statement  submitted with\r\n\nhis Plan of Reorganization. \r\n\n          As part  of its  services, Dean Witter  sent Printy\r\n\nmonthly  statements detailing  and  summarizing  the  Trust's\r\n\nassets.   As of September 30, 1992, the Dean Witter statement\r\n\nshowed  the  market  value  of   the  Trust's  assets  to  be\r\n\n$191,533.33,  with a  borrowing  limit of  $141,104.50.   The\r\n\nstatement did not reflect the  receipt of the Health Concepts\r\n\nstock or the interest in the MCI Medical Seed Partnership.\r\n\n          Next comes  the event  that led  to this law  suit.\r\n\nThe Dean  Witter  statement for  the  month of  October  1992\r\n\nshowed  receipt by the Trust  on October 28,  1992 of 150,000\r\n\nshares  of   Coastal  HealthCare   stock  with  a   value  of\r\n\n$3,637,500.00.  Coastal HealthCare  stock is publicly traded.\r\n\nIn his  deposition testimony  Printy stated  that he  did not\r\n\nauthorize the  purchase of  the Coastal HealthCare  stock and\r\n\nnever received stock-purchase confirmation slips.  The reason\r\n\nfor this  obviously mistaken increase  of over three  and one\r\n\nhalf million  dollars in the asset  value of the Trust  was a\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ncomputer  error  by  Dean  Witter.    The  Trust's  virtually\r\n\nworthless Health Concepts shares  had been given the computer\r\n\ncode for  Coastal HealthCare shares, thus  attributing to the\r\n\nTrust ownership of Coastal HealthCare stock, which it did not\r\n\nown.\r\n\n          On  November 16,  1992,  Printy sent  a fax  to the\r\n\nTrust's account  broker, Krmpotich,  and his  assistant, Lynn\r\n\nJorgenson, asking that 15,000 shares of Coastal HealthCare be\r\n\ndelivered  to  him  but  left  in  the  name  of  the  Trust.\r\n\nJorgenson informed Printy that  Dean Witter could not deliver\r\n\nanything  but the entire  holding of 150,000  shares.  Printy\r\n\nauthorized  the delivery of the 150,000 shares.  In due time,\r\n\nhe  received  a  certificate  for 150,000  shares  of  Health\r\n\nConcepts, not the Coastal HealthCare shares he had requested.\r\n\n          The  computer mix-up  between  Health Concepts  and\r\n\nCoastal HealthCare  continued through November of  1992.  The\r\n\nNovember 1992 statement showed that 150,000 shares of Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare valued at $3,712,500.00  had been debited from the\r\n\naccount.  As  a result,  the total asset  value of the  Trust\r\n\nshrunk   to   $100,475.00   from   the   October   value   of\r\n\n$3,775,925.00.\r\n\n          Printy returned the  150,000 shares certificate  of\r\n\nHealth  Concepts to  Dean Witter  on December  1, 1992.   The\r\n\ncomputer  continued on its merry way  in the wrong direction.\r\n\nThe Dean  Witter December  1992 statement showed  the Trust's\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nreceipt  on   December  2   of  150,000  shares   of  Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare, with an increase  in asset value from $100,475.00\r\n\nto $4,984,275.00.\r\n\n          The December statement,  however, showed more  than\r\n\nthe  return of  the  Coastal HealthCare  stock  to the  Trust\r\n\naccount.  It showed  that Printy purchased a total  of 22,409\r\n\nshares of stock in twelve companies and withdrew through wire\r\n\ntransfers  or  checks,  $262,501.11  from the  account.    In\r\n\nJanuary  of 1993, Printy bought  a total of  16,763 shares of\r\n\nstock in  eight companies  and withdrew $373,670.14  from the\r\n\naccount.   In both  months, the Coastal  HealthCare stock was\r\n\nused to  calculate the authorized limit  for margin borrowing\r\n\nand these  purchases and withdrawals were  made against these\r\n\nerroneously inflated margin limits.\r\n\n          It is  true, as Printy asserts,  that Krmpotich and\r\n\nother brokers  from Dean  Witter urged  Printy to make  stock\r\n\npurchases  on the basis of the Trust's borrowing limits.  But\r\n\nnone  of the brokers  at Dean Witter  knew of the  error that\r\n\ninflated  the value of the Trust's assets.  They assumed that\r\n\nDean Witter's monthly statements were accurate.  The only one\r\n\nwho knew  the monthly statements were  grossly inaccurate was\r\n\nPrinty.    In his  deposition  Printy testified  that  he had\r\n\nquestions  about how his account  was being handled.   But he\r\n\nnever told Krmpotich that he did not own any stock in Coastal\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nHealthCare  and  that the  authorized  borrowing  limits were\r\n\nwrong.\r\n\n          Dean  Witter finally  corrected  the error  in  the\r\n\nFebruary  1993  statement.   The  150,000  shares of  Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare, with a value  of $2,962,500.00, were debited from\r\n\nthe Trust account, and the 150,000 shares of Health Concepts,\r\n\nwith no value, were credited to it.  Dean Witter  also made a\r\n\nmargin  call.  After the margin call, the Trust's account had\r\n\na deficit of $600,230.82 that was not repaid to Dean Witter.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\r                                  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\r                                                   \r\n\n          On  March   30,  1993,  Dean  Witter  commenced  an\r\n\narbitration  proceeding against  Printy,  his  sons, and  the\r\n\nTrust before the National  Association of Securities Dealers.\r\n\nThe  Statement  of Claim  consisted  of  eight counts,  which\r\n\nincluded counts  for  theft and  receiving  stolen  property,\r\n\ncommon-law fraud,  violations  of Minnesota  securities  law,\r\n\ncommon-law  conversion, and common-law replevin.  Dean Witter\r\n\nsought $603,548.00 in compensatory damages, plus interest and\r\n\nattorney's fees,  against all respondents.   Punitive damages\r\n\nwere sought against Printy only.\r\n\n          Printy  responded  to the  Statement  of  Claim and\r\n\nraised  a number  of  affirmative allegations.   The  defense\r\n\nconsisted  of denial of wrongdoing and  shifting the blame to\r\n\nDean Witter.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          The  arbitration  award was  issued on  January 20,\r\n\n1994.   It  found Printy,  his sons  as co-trustees,  and the\r\n\nTrust  liable  for  compensatory  damages in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$634,820.00 plus interest, from February 1, 1993, through the\r\n\ndate of payment  of the  award.  The  arbitration panel  also\r\n\nfoundPrinty liableforpunitivedamagesintheamountof$375,000.00.\r\n\n          Printy filed a voluntary  petition under Chapter 11\r\n\nof  the  Bankruptcy  Code  prior to  Dean  Witter  having the\r\n\narbitration award  confirmed.   Dean  Witter obtained  relief\r\n\nfrom the automatic stay  imposed under the Code.   On January\r\n\n30, 1995, the  Hennepin County District Court for  the Fourth\r\n\nJudicial  District  of  Minnesota confirmed  the  arbitration\r\n\naward.   Dean  Witter filed  an adversary  proceeding against\r\n\nPrinty in bankruptcy court on August 24, 1994.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n                           ANALYSIS\r                                       ANALYSIS\r                                               \r\n\n          The  first issue  is  whether the  bankruptcy  debt\r\n\nfalls under   523(a)(2)(A)  or   523(a)(6) of the  Bankruptcy\r\n\nCode.  Section 523 of the Code provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n            523.  Exceptions to discharge\r                        523.  Exceptions to discharge\r\n\n               (a) A discharge  under section  727,\r                           (a)\r\n          1141,  1228(a),  1228(b),  or 1328(b)  of\r\n          this   title   does   not  discharge   an\r\n          individual debtor from any debt--\r\n\n               (2)  for money,  property, services,\r                           (2)\r\n          or an extension, renewal,  or refinancing\r\n          of credit, to the extent obtained by--\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n                    (A)  false  pretenses,   a\r                                (A)\r\n               false representation, or actual\r\n               fraud,  other than  a statement\r\n               respecting  the debtor's  or an\r\n               insider's financial condition;\r\n\n          . . .\r\n\n               (6) for willful and malicious injury\r                           (6)\r\n          by the debtor to another entity or to the\r\n          property of another entity;\r\n\n(Footnote omitted).\r\n\n          Printy  argues  that  the  sections   are  mutually\r\n\nexclusive and  the district  court erred in  proceeding under\r\n\n(a)(6).  This is an ingenious argument but it is convincingly\r\n\nrebutted by the words of the statute and the case law.  There\r\n\nis  no indication in    523 that Congress  intended these two\r\n\nsections to  be mutually exclusive, nor  does the legislative\r\n\nhistory of the statute so suggest.\r\n\n          Printy candidly admits  that, \"[a] number of  cases\r\n\nhave  either applied both provisions  to fraud claims or have\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nindicated an  inclination to do  so.\"2  The cases  do hold as\r\n\nPrinty says.\r\n\n          Both parties have referred  us to Grogan v.

We start our analysis with an attempt\r\n\nto  determine   the  meaning   of  the  words   \"willful  and\r\n\nmalicious.\"   The  House Judiciary  Committee's  Report  that\r\n\naccompanied the  passage of the 1978  Bankruptcy Code defined\r\n\n\"willful\"  as  \"deliberate or  intentional\"  and stated  that\r\n\n\"recklessness\" was  no longer the standard for \"willfulness.\"\r\n\nH.R.

This, however, is only the\r\n\nbeginning of our task.\r\n\n          As  the  bankruptcy  court  pointed  out, there  is\r\n\ndisagreement  among the  circuits as  to whether  the statute\r\n\nrequires  an intentional act that results in an injury or one\r\n\ndone with the intention of causing an injury, with variations\r\n\non  this theme.

An injury to an entity or\r\n          property may be a malicious injury within\r\n          this provision  if  it was  wrongful  and\r\n          without just cause or excuse, even in the\r\n          absence of personal hatred, spite or ill-\r\n          will.\r\n\n               The  word   \"willfull\"  [sic]  means\r\n          \"deliberate or intentional,\" referring to\r\n          a  deliberate  and  intentional act  that\r\n          necessarily leads to injury.   Therefore,\r\n          a wrongful act done  intentionally, which\r\n          necessarily  produces harm or which has a\r\n          substantial certainty of causing harm and\r\n          is without just cause or excuse, may be a\r\n          willful  and  malicious  injury.    While\r\n          something more than  a mere voluntary act\r\n          is  necessary  to  satisfy  the  scienter\r\n          requirement    of    section   523(a)(6),\r\n          specific   intent   to   injure  is   not\r\n          necessary.\r\n\n               The   malice   element  of   section\r\n          523(a)(6) requires an intent to cause the\r\n          harm,  and the  fact that the  injury was\r\n          caused through negligence or recklessness\r\n          does not satisfy that standard  of proof.\r\n          An  injury  inflicted willfully  and with\r\n          malice  under  section  523(a)(6) is  one\r\n          inflicted intentionally and deliberately,\r\n          and either  with the intent to  cause the\r\n          harm complained of,  or in  circumstances\r\n          in which the  harm was certain or  almost\r\n          certain to result from the debtor's act.\r\n\n4 Collier on  Bankruptcy   523.12 (15th ed.  1996) (footnotes\r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          We agree with  the bankruptcy court that,  whatever\r\n\nstandard is  applied here, summary judgment  was warranted on\r\n\nthe  uncontroverted facts.    There can  be no  question that\r\n\nPrinty willfully  and maliciously injured Dean  Witter by not\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ninforming it that a mistake had been made by crediting to the\r\n\nTrust account  the Coastal HealthCare stock  that Printy knew\r\n\nhe  did  not own.   Printy  took  advantage of  Dean Witter's\r\n\ncomputer error  by borrowing  against  and withdrawing  funds\r\n\nfrom the  false margin  account that  derived its  value from\r\n\nshares  of  stock that  Printy  knew he  did not  own.   Such\r\n\nconduct  by  Printy  translates  easily  into  an  intent  to\r\n\nwillfully and maliciously cause harm.\r\n\n          Printy attempts  to blunt or obscure what he did by\r\n\narguing  that Dean Witter did not prove that \"its own conduct\r\n\nwas  not an intervening cause  in the creation  of the debt.\"\r\n\nAppellant's  Br.  at  21.     Printy  mischaracterizes   what\r\n\nhappened.  There is no question that Dean Witter's error gave\r\n\nPrinty the  opportunity to use  Dean Witter's assets  for his\r\n\nown gain.    Printy  saw  the mistaken  transfer  of  Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare shares as  a way to make  some money quickly.   To\r\n\nput it bluntly, Printy saw a chance to make a killing at Dean\r\n\nWitter's  expense and he took  it.  There  was no intervening\r\n\ncause.  The sole proximate cause was Printy's greed.\r\n\n          The  final   issue  we   discuss  is   whether  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court erred in  ruling that Printy's counterclaims\r\n\nwere barred by res judicata because they were decided against\r                                       \r\n\nPrinty in the arbitration proceedings.\r\n\n          Count  I  of  the  counterclaim  asserts  breach of\r\n\ncontract by  Dean Witter.  The  essence of the claim  is that\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nDean Witter  agreed that  it would accurately  administer the\r\n\nTrust  account and  failed  to do  so.   It  is  specifically\r\n\nalleged that Dean Witter refused to correct the statements in\r\n\nthe  Trust  account  when  \"its  errors  were  called  to its\r\n\nattention.\"   And it  is alleged  that Dean  Witter's broker,\r\n\nKrmpotich,  \"induced and  recommended that  the Family  Trust\r\n\nengage in transactions based on the statements as provided by\r\n\nDean Witter.\"  There are four other allegations in this count\r\n\nthat do not warrant further discussion.3\r\n\n          The  specific allegation  in the  counterclaim that\r\n\nDean  Witter refused to  correct the statements  in the Trust\r\n\naccount \"when its errors were called to its attention\" has no\r\n\nsupport in  the record.  In  fact, the record  is directly to\r\n\nthe contrary.  At  his deposition Printy admitted that  at no\r\n\ntime did  he tell Krmpotich or his  assistant that he did not\r\n\nown any stock in  Coastal HealthCare, and that the  stock the\r\n\nTrust  held was Health  Concepts, whose value  was de minimis\r                                                                         \r\n\ncompared to the three to four million dollar value of Coastal\r\n\nHealthCare.  We find that there is no basis in the record for\r\n\nCount I of the counterclaim.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  \"(9)  Failure by  Dean  Witter to  supervise its  Midwest\r\nOperations  Center;   (10)   failure  to   supervise   broker\r\nKrmpotich; (11) breach of the implied  covenant of good faith\r\nand  fair  dealing; and  (12) that  as  a result,  Printy was\r\ndamaged.\"\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n          Count II of the counterclaim  sounds in negligence.\r\n\nIt alleges  that because  of Dean Witter's  negligence Printy\r\n\nincurred damages.  We have already disposed of the negligence\r\n\nclaim  of  Printy.    It  has  no  merit  either  legally  or\r\n\nfactually.\r\n\n          Count III  alleges a breach  by Dean Witter  of its\r\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing.  This claim  is based on\r\n\nthe following assertions:\r\n\n          16.  As  part  of  the  arbitration  with\r\n          Printy,   Dean  Witter   sought  punitive\r\n          damages.\r\n\n          17.  Dean  Witter has taken  the position\r\n          throughout    the   country    in   other\r\n          arbitrations  pursuant  to  its  customer\r\n          agreements that punitive damages  are not\r\n          available under New York law or any other\r\n          law.\r\n\n          18.  Dean Witter has stated  publicly its\r\n          view  that  punitive   damages  are   not\r\n          available in arbitrations pursuant to its\r\n          customer agreements.\r\n\n          19.  Having  taken  this  position  as  a\r\n          matter of its  consistent practice,  Dean\r\n          Witter is  acting in  bad  faith to  seek\r\n          punitive  damages  against  Printy.   Its\r\n          attempt  to  recover   such  damages   is\r\n          fundamentally unfair and discriminatory.\r\n\n          20.  As   a   result  of   Dean  Witter's\r\n          actions, Printy has been damaged.\r\n\n          Printy  has  cited no  cases supporting  this novel\r\n\nclaim.  We have not looked for any.  We have found nothing in\r\n\nthe record  that would factually support  the statements made\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nin  paragraphs 17 and 18.  We  find that this claim, like the\r\n\nothers asserted in the counterclaim, has no merit.\r\n\n          We also  agree with  the bankruptcy court  that the\r\n\ndoctrine  of   res  judicata   bars   consideration  of   the\r                                        \r\n\ncounterclaim because  the issues asserted in the counterclaim\r\n\nwere   also  raised   as  affirmative   allegations  in   the\r\n\narbitration proceedings.
