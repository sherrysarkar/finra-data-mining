Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Donna M. Nesselbush and Marasco & Nesselbush on brief for\nappellant.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Anthony C.\nDiGioia, Assistant United States Attorney, and Wayne G. Lewis,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\f                          December 28, 2000\n\n\n\n\n            Per Curiam. Ramon Rivera appeals from the judgment\n\nof   the   district     court    affirming    the   decision   of   the\n\nCommissioner       of   Social   Security    that   claimant   is   not\n\ndisabled and therefore not entitled to supplemental security\n\nincome benefits.        On appeal, claimant raises three issues:\n\n(1) whether the administrative law judge (ALJ) abused his\n\ndiscretion, first, when he failed to acknowledge claimant's\n\nrequest for a supplemental hearing to cross-examine Dr.\n\nTeixeira,    who    conducted     a    psychological   evaluation    of\n\nclaimant and, second, when he (the ALJ) implicitly denied\n\nthe request without giving any reasons for his action; (2)\n\nwhether the IQ test used by Dr. Teixeira was inaccurate; and\n\n(3) whether reliance on the grid was precluded under our\n\ndecision in Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n\n890 F.2d 520 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).\n\n            As for the first two issues, it is noteworthy that\n\nclaimant was the one who had sought, at the last minute, a\n\npsychological evaluation.        In this context, it was incumbent\n\nupon claimant to explain, in his request for a supplemental\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhearing, what such a hearing likely would reveal and why\n\nthere were no other ways, short of a hearing, of obtaining\n\nthe needed information.                  Given this, we cannot say that the\n\nALJ's    implicit           denial        of    claimant's            request     for     a\n\nsupplemental hearing was an abuse of discretion.\n\n              Although we agree that there is a general dispute\n\nconcerning         the    accuracy        of    the    Spanish        version    of     the\n\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (EIWA), that dispute need\n\nnot     be        addressed        in    order        to    resolve       this        case.\n\nSpecifically,         the     IQ    scores      seem       not   to    have     been    the\n\ndetermining factor in Dr. Teixeira's evaluation of claimant\n\nor in the ALJ's decision of no disability.                            Indeed, the ALJ\n\nonly mentioned claimant's EIWA IQ scores in passing and\n\nseemed       to    rely    more     on    Dr.     Teixeira's          observations       of\n\nclaimant's mental capacities and on claimant's history.\n\nThese observations, according to Dr. Teixeira, conformed to\n\nclaimant's EIWA IQ scores.\n\n              Dr.        Teixeira's        observations          resulted        in     the\n\nfollowing residual functional capacity (RFC) assessment.\n\nFirst, Dr. Teixeira found no limits in claimant's abilities\n\n(1) to relate to other people, (2) to respond appropriately\n\nto supervision and to coworkers, and (3) to perform simple\n\ntasks.       Second, Dr. Teixeira determined that claimant had\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fmild limitations in responding to customary work pressures,\n\nand in performing complex or varied tasks.                             Finally, Dr.\n\nTeixeira opined that claimant had moderate limitations in\n\nunderstanding, remembering, and carrying out instructions.\n\nBased on this RFC assessment, it is plain that there is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the ALJ's conclusion that\n\nclaimant's        mental    impairment            did   not    affect,    more    than\n\nmarginally, his (claimant's) capacity to engage in the full\n\nrange of light work.\n\n             Claimant nonetheless argues that the ALJ erred in\n\nrelying on the grid on the ground that the ALJ himself found\n\nthat       claimant        \"often\"      experienced             deficiencies        in\n\nconcentration, persistence, or pace, which resulted in the\n\nfailure to complete tasks in a timely fashion.                             Claimant\n\nmaintains that due to this finding, the instant case falls\n\noutside the situations in which use of the grid is permitted\n\nas   set    out     in    Ortiz   v.    Secretary         of    Health    and    Human\n\nServices, supra, 890 F.2d 520.                          In particular, claimant\n\nargues that since the ALJ in                       Ortiz had found that the\n\nclaimant there \"seldom\" had such problems, the instant case\n\nrequires the testimony of a vocational expert.\n\n             However, while claimant is correct regarding the\n\nALJ's      rating    in    Ortiz,      we    found       that   this     rating    was\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fambiguous and thus we decided to disregard it.             Id. at 526\n\nn.6.   Rather, in relation to the ability to concentrate, we\n\nrelied on the RFC evaluations completed by the various\n\nmedical     experts.      The      claimant,   according   to   these\n\nevaluations, had moderate limits in maintaining attention\n\nand concentration for extended periods.             Id. at 527.    We\n\nnonetheless held that use of the grid was appropriate.\n\n            Thus, the question is whether the ALJ's \"often\"\n\nrating here is equivalent to the \"moderate\" rating in Ortiz.\n\nWe find that it is.       Specifically, \"often\" and \"moderate\"\n\nare both the middle ratings on five-point scales.            That is,\n\nthe ratings on the \"B\" criteria of the Psychiatric Review\n\nTechnique     Form     regarding     how   often   deficiencies    in\n\nconcentration occur are never, seldom, often, frequent, and\n\nconstant; on the RFC forms, the limits are rated as none,\n\nmild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe.          A \"moderate\"\n\nlimit is defined as \"an impairment which affects but does\n\nnot preclude [the] ability to function.\"           See, e.g., Trans.\n\nat 195 (RFC form completed by Dr. Teixeira).           As a result,\n\nthe use of the grid was not precluded by Ortiz.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.*\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f         *Chief Judge Torruella respectfully dissents and\n\nwould order a remand for further proceedings on the question\n\nof the accuracy of the EIWA.\n\n\n\n\n                            -6-\n\f",
