Plaintiffs are two\r                                                    \r\n\nnon-vessel operating common carriers and an insurance carrier\r\n\nwho have sued in  the district court to recover  insurance on\r\n\naccount of damages allegedly suffered from the loss overboard\r\n\nof several cargo containers that  were being carried by barge\r\n\nfrom Jacksonville,  Florida, to San  Juan, Puerto Rico.   The\r\n\nbarge and tug were  operated by Ocean Line of  North Florida,\r\n\nInc.  (\"Ocean Line\"), a  now defunct  shipping company.   The\r\n\nprincipal defendants, from whom plaintiffs seek recovery, are\r\n\nthe  issuers  of an  open marine  cargo insurance  policy for\r\n\nOcean Line.  The case was tried in the United States District\r\n\nCourt for the  District of  Puerto Rico.   The court  entered\r\n\njudgment  for  the  defendant insurers  and  plaintiffs  have\r\n\nappealed.\r\n\n          We  affirm the  judgment below.   We  are satisfied\r\n\nthat the findings  of the district court, as set forth in its\r\n\nOpinion  and Order, are  not clearly erroneous,  and that its\r\n\nconclusions  and   legal  analysis  therein   are  materially\r\n\ncorrect.  This being so  we see no need to go  over in detail\r\n\nthe  same  ground  comprehensively covered  in  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  own opinion.  Instead, we limit ourselves to a brief\r\n\ndiscussion of the controlling issues.\r\n\n          In  their direct action  on the  policy, plaintiffs\r\n\nhave sought to establish  that    notwithstanding the absence\r\n\nof  affirmative requests  from shippers  that their  goods be\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ninsured       the   policy's  coverage   was  \"automatically\"\r\n\navailable to all  shippers.  In support of  this proposition,\r\n\nplaintiffs offered evidence at trial  of a \"custom and usage\"\r\n\nin the Puerto Rico-United States trade for ocean carriers  to\r\n\nprovide insurance automatically up to certain limits, without\r\n\na  shipper having  to affirmatively  request coverage  at the\r\n\ntime of  entrusting his  goods to  the carrier.   Defendants,\r\n\nhowever, sharply disputed  this contention, and the  district\r\n\ncourt  found, on  the conflicting  proofs, that there  was no\r\n\nsuch custom  and  usage.   We  see  no clear  error  in  that\r\n\nfinding.   The  court also  expressed  doubts as  to  whether\r\n\ncustom and  usage evidence,  such as  it was,  could override\r\n\nOcean Line's announced policies on the matter.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that, apart from custom and usage,\r\n\ncoverage is manifest from the language of the  policy itself.\r\n\nThey  disparage as immaterial  Ocean Line's published tariffs\r\n\nand its  bills of  lading, which contained  specific language\r\n\nrequiring shippers to first  request insurance if they wished\r\n\nto  obtain  it.     Instead,  plaintiffs  urge  us   to  rely\r\n\nexclusively  on the insurance  policy itself.   But, like the\r\n\ndistrict court, we find little support in the policy language\r\n\nfor plaintiffs'  position.  The definition of  assured in the\r\n\ninsurance  policy   includes   Ocean  Line   and   associated\r\n\ncompanies,  \"and/or for  whom  they received  instructions to\r\n\ninsure.\"    Express  shipper's  instructions  to  insure  are\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nlacking here,1 and  we see  no reliable basis  from which  to\r\n\ninfer that  such instructions  were given.   The tariffs  and\r\n\nbills  of lading  specifically call  for shippers  to provide\r\n\nexplicit  instructions if  they wish insurance.   It  is true\r\n\nthat  one section of the tariffs indicates that \"the rates in\r\n\nthis tariff include insurance,\" and the parties seem to agree\r\n\nthat a  shipper would  have been  entitled to free  insurance\r\n\n(i.e. with  Ocean  Line to  pay  the premium),  but  disagree\r\n\nwhether the free insurance was \"automatic\" or had first to be\r\n\nrequested, and the  cargo value  stated, as  the tariffs  and\r\n\nbills of lading provide.  Nothing in the policy itself states\r\n\nthat all  shipments are to  be automatically insured;  to the\r\n\ncontrary, the  policy definition of assureds   suggests quite\r\n\nthe  opposite,  as does  the  evidence  of Ocean  Line's  own\r\n\npractices and methods for paying premiums prior to  the loss.\r\n\nAs  we say,  we find  no  indication of  clear  error in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  findings  and  factual  conclusions, which\r\n\nappear well-supported on this record.  We can only agree with\r\n\nthe court that plaintiffs  have failed to establish  that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Transcaribe tendered  pro forma  bills of lading  late in\r\nthe district  court proceedings which it  says manifested the\r\nshipper's  requests  for  insurance.    The  district  court,\r\nexpressing  doubts as  to these  documents' authenticity  and\r\ncredibility, found this late-filed evidence  was insufficient\r\nto establish that proper requests were made.  Infra.\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncargo,  for the loss of which  they are claiming, was in fact\r\n\ninsured under the policy in question.2\r\n\n          As  noted in  Note 1,  there was  a dispute  at the\r\n\ntrial  concerning the weight to be given to certain pro forma\r\n\nbills of lading submitted as evidence very late in the day by\r\n\nTranscaribe.   Transcaribe argued  that these  indicated that\r\n\ncoverage  had,   in  fact,   been  requested,   although  the\r\n\ndocumentary evidence was far from  being clear or uniform  in\r\n\nthis respect.  The district court's disposition of this issue\r\n\nis  explained in its Opinion and Order.  The district court's\r\n\nevaluation  and handling  of  this evidence  was not  clearly\r\n\nerroneous  and was  within its  reasonable discretion  in the\r\n\ncircumstances of this case.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The plaintiffs call  our attention to  several translated\r\nPuerto  Rico cases  and  to one  Second  Circuit case,  Estee\r                                                                         \r\nLauder  International,  Inc.  v.

We  agree  with  the\r                \r\ndefendant insurers that these  cases are either irrelevant to\r\nthe   contested  issues   in   this  case   or  are   readily\r\ndistinguishable and thus are not dispositive.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

It is true that one section of the tariffs indicates that \"the rates in this tariff include insurance,\" and the parties seem to agree that a shipper would have been entitled to free insurance (i.e. with Ocean Line to pay the premium), but disagree whether the free insurance was \"automatic\" or had first to be requested, and the cargo value stated, as the tariffs and bills of lading provide.  Nothing in the policy itself states that all shipments are to be automatically insured;  to the contrary, the policy definition of assureds suggests quite the opposite, as does the evidence of Ocean Line's own practices and methods for paying premiums prior to the loss.  As we say, we find no indication of clear error in the district court's findings and factual conclusions, which appear well-supported on this record.  We can only agree with the court that plaintiffs have failed to establish that the cargo, for the loss of which they are claiming, was in fact insured under the policy in question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted in Note 1, there was a dispute at the trial concerning the weight to be given to certain pro forma bills of lading submitted as evidence very late in the day by Transcaribe.  Transcaribe argued that these indicated that coverage had, in fact, been requested, although the documentary evidence was far from being clear or uniform in this respect.  The district court's disposition of this issue is explained in its Opinion and Order.  The district court's evaluation and handling of this evidence was not clearly erroneous and was within its reasonable discretion in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Transcaribe tendered pro forma bills of lading late in the district court proceedings which it says manifested the shipper's requests for insurance.
