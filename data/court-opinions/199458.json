The appellants in this case,\n\nthe      Penobscot    Nation    and   the     Passamaquoddy       Tribe   (\"the\n\nTribes\"),    occupy    tribal    lands       in   Maine.     The    corporate\n\nappellees--Georgia-Pacific Corp., Great Northern Paper, Inc.,\n\nand Champion International Corp. (\"the companies\")--operate pulp\n\nand paper mills that discharge waste water in rivers near or\n\nflowing through the Tribes' reservations.              A dispute developed\n\nbetween the Tribes and the State of Maine as to the regulation\n\nof waste water discharge under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§\n\n1342(b), 1377 (1994).\n\n            Concerned that the Tribes would seek to regulate their\n\nactivities, the companies requested that the Tribes turn over\n\nbroad    categories   of   documents        bearing   on   such    (potential)\n\nregulation, including efforts by the Tribes to secure authority\n\nto regulate and pertinent agreements between the Tribes and\n\nfederal agencies.      The companies' demand, made on May 10, 2000,\n\nwas based on Maine's Freedom of Access Act (\"the Maine Access\n\nAct\"), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 1 §§ 401-10 (West 1989 & Supp.\n\n2000).    Under Maine law, the Tribes are regulated in certain\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\frespects as municipalities, and municipalities are covered by\n\nthe Access Act.\n\n            The Tribes then brought the present lawsuit against the\n\ncompanies in federal district court to obtain injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief debarring the companies from obtaining the\n\ndocuments they sought.     The substance of the Tribes' position\n\nwas that a settlement between Maine and the Tribes, reflected in\n\nboth Maine law and a federal statute, precluded state regulation\n\nof \"internal tribal matters\" and that applying the Maine Access\n\nAct as sought by the companies would impermissibly regulate the\n\nTribes' internal affairs.      This federal suit was filed on May\n\n18, 2000.\n\n            On May 22, the day before they were served with the\n\nfederal complaint, the companies brought suit against the Tribes\n\nin the Maine Superior Court.    Invoking the Maine Access Act, Me.\n\nRev. Stat. tit. 1 § 409(1), the companies demanded that the\n\nTribes produce the documents previously sought.     In this state-\n\ncourt suit, the Tribes resisted the demand by asserting, inter\n\nalia, that the internal affairs limitation in the settlement\n\nmeant that the Maine Access Act could not validly be applied to\n\nrequire the Tribes to produce the documents.     The same question\n\nas to the breadth of the limitation was thus posed in both\n\ncourts.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                 The federal district court acted first, ruling on July\n\n18, 2000, that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Tribes'\n\nsuit       for     declaratory    and       injunctive     relief    against    the\n\ncompanies.         Penobscot Nation v. Ga.-Pac. Corp., 106 F. Supp. 2d\n\n81, 86 (D. Me. 2000) (\"Penobscot I\").                    The court assumed that\n\nthe internal affairs limitation could comprise a federal-law\n\ndefense if the companies sued the Tribes under the Maine Access\n\nAct; but it ruled that under the well-pleaded complaint rule,\n\nthe anticipatory assertion of such a defense in a suit by the\n\nTribes did not create a case \"arising under\" federal law for\n\npurposes of the general federal-question jurisdiction statute,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1331, nor under the parallel language of section\n\n1362, the special Indian jurisdiction statute.1                     Id. at 83-84.\n\nThe        court    thereafter        (on    September      26,     2000)   denied\n\nreconsideration.           Penobscot Nation v. Ga.-Pac. Corp., 116 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 201, 205 (D. Me. 2000) (\"Penobscot II\").\n\n                 Shortly before the denial of reconsideration, the Maine\n\nSuperior         Court   ruled   on   the    merits   of   the    companies'   suit\n\n\n       1\n     Section 1332 provides that \"[t]he district courts shall\nhave original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under\nthe Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" 28\nU.S.C. § 1332. Section 1362, entitled \"Indian tribes,\" states\nthat \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of\nall civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a\ngoverning body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior,\nwherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution,\nlaws, or treaties of the United States.\" Id. § 1362.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fagainst the Tribes to enforce the Maine Access Act.                         Great N.\n\nPaper, Inc. v. Penobscot Indian Nation, No. CV-00-329, slip op.\n\nat 9 (Me. Super. Ct. Sept. 19, 2000).                  The state court ruled\n\nthat the demand for documents did not contravene the internal\n\naffairs    limitation    and    ordered        the    Tribes   to    produce       the\n\ndocuments     immediately,      save     for     conventionally           privileged\n\ndocuments which needed only to be logged.                   The Tribes refused,\n\nwere   held   in    contempt,    and   appealed        to   the     Maine    Supreme\n\nJudicial    Court.      The   Tribes     also    appealed      to    us     from   the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of their federal suit.\n\n            On May 1, 2001, while the present appeal was pending\n\nbefore us awaiting decision, the Supreme Judicial Court decided\n\nthe state appeal.      Great N. Paper, Inc. v. Penobscot Nation, 770\n\nA.2d 574, 592 (Me. 2001).         It ruled that the internal affairs\n\nlimitation    did    protect    the    Tribes        from   having    to     produce\n\ndocuments reflecting internal deliberations about the waste\n\nwater issue, but not from turning over under the Maine Access\n\nAct any correspondence between the Tribes and federal agencies\n\non that issue.         Id.      The court vacated the lower court's\n\njudgment and contempt ruling and remanded for production of the\n\nnarrower category of materials.\n\n            Because    the    district    court       dismissed      for    want    of\n\nfederal jurisdiction based on rulings of law, our review is de\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fnovo.   Mills v. Maine, 118 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 1997).   To sum\n\nup our conclusion at the outset, we think that whether the\n\nTribes' claims \"arise under\" federal law within the meaning of\n\neither section 1331 or section 1362 is a difficult question; but\n\nthe answer is now irrelevant in this case because the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court has decided the merits of the underlying\n\ndispute, and any further proceedings in the federal district\n\ncourt are controlled by    res judicata doctrine and would be\n\npointlessly duplicative.\n\n          Understanding the jurisdictional issue requires a short\n\nexcursion.   The Tribes in this case occupy a status, and are\n\nsubject to a legal framework, that is atypical.      The federal\n\nMaine Indian Claims Settlement Act (\"the Settlement Act\"), 25\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1721-35 (1994), and the Maine Implementing Act, Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30 §§ 6201-14 (West 1996 & Supp. 2000),\n\ncapped a settlement, reached in 1980, between the Tribes and the\n\nState of Maine involving disputes as to whether the Tribes\n\nshould be recognized at all and as to their claimed ownership of\n\nlarge tracts of land in Maine.      In the settlement, the Tribes\n\ngave up much of their land claims but got recognition, trust\n\nfunds, title to designated reservations, and certain regulatory\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\fpowers within those lands.       See 25 U.S.C. §§ 1723-25; Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 30 §§ 6205-10.2\n\n          However, partly as a result of the Tribes' disputed\n\nstatus, the State of Maine, as part of the settlement, obtained\n\nlegal   authority   over   the   Tribes   exceeding   the    usual   state\n\nauthority over native American tribes.       The Tribes were for most\n\npurposes \"subject to all the laws of the State of Maine.\"               25\n\nU.S.C. § 1721(b)(4); accord id. § 1725; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n30 § 6204.    The Tribes were also (with a few exceptions not\n\nrelevant here) made subject to suit in state courts.           25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1725(a); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30 § 6206(2).           And a central\n\nprovision of the state statute codifying the settlement contains\n\nboth a general rule and a key qualification:\n\n                 Except as otherwise provided in this\n          Act,   the  Passamaquoddy    Tribe  and  the\n          Penobscot Nation, within their respective\n          Indian territories, shall have, exercise and\n          enjoy all the rights, privileges, powers and\n          immunities, . . . and shall be subject to\n          all the duties, obligations, liabilities and\n          limitations of a municipality of and subject\n          to the laws of the State, provided, however,\n          that internal tribal matters, including\n          membership in the respective tribe or\n          nation, the right to reside within the\n          respective    Indian   territories,   tribal\n          organization,   tribal   government,  tribal\n          elections and the use or disposition of\n\n\n    2The story is recounted in detail elsewhere. See Great N.\nPaper, 770 A.2d at 581-85; H.R. Rep. No. 96-1353, at 11-20\n(1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3786, 3787-96.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           settlement fund income shall not be subject\n           to regulation by the State.\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30 § 6206(1).\n\n           In     the    federal      Settlement          Act,    Congress     did     not\n\nexpressly include the provision just quoted; but the Settlement\n\nAct did state, as \"a purpose\" of the statute, Congress' intent\n\n\"to ratify\" the Maine Implementing Act \"which defines\" the\n\nrelationship between the State of Maine and the Tribes.                                 25\n\nU.S.C. § 1721(b)(3).            This court has assumed, albeit without\n\nextensive discussion, that the internal affairs limitation on\n\nstate   authority        in   the    Maine    Implementing          Act   is    also    an\n\noverriding       federal      limitation      on    Maine        authority     over    the\n\nTribes.    Akins v. Penobscot Nation, 130 F.3d 482, 485 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); see also 25 U.S.C. § 1735.                  The companies do not dispute\n\nthat premise in this case.\n\n           This background brings us to the jurisdictional issue\n\ndecided by the district court.                The Tribes, in bringing their\n\nfederal suit, based their claim of jurisdiction on the premise\n\nthat their suit \"arises under\" federal law within the meaning of\n\nsections 1331 and 1362.             In the Tribes' view, the controlling\n\nfederal issue in the lawsuit is whether the internal affairs\n\nlimitation is violated by applying the Maine Access Act to\n\nrequire    the    Tribes      to    produce    the    documents        sought.         The\n\ndistrict    court       assumed     arguendo       that    the     internal     affairs\n\n                                        -8-\n\flimitation was a creature of federal as well as state law.\n\nPenobscot I, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 83.\n\n          But, as the district court pointed out in its very able\n\ndecision, Penobscot I, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 82, it is not enough\n\nto   satisfy   traditional   \"arising   under\"   jurisdiction   under\n\nsection 1331 that a case involve a federal issue.      Although this\n\nwould certainly satisfy Article III, the Supreme Court has read\n\nthe identically-worded statutory grant more narrowly, Verlinden\n\nB.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 494-95 (1983), and\n\nhas, for some time, required that it be apparent from the face\n\nof the plaintiff's complaint either that a cause of action arise\n\nunder federal law, Am. Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241\n\nU.S. 257, 259-60 (1916), or at least (in some cases) that a\n\ntraditional state-law cause of action (e.g., a tort or contract\n\nclaim) present an important federal issue.\n\n          This latter exception, often associated with Smith v.\n\nKansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U.S. 180, 201-02 (1921),3\n\nmight include a case in which a state-law contract claim rests\n\non a federal regulatory requirement.     E.g., Price v. Pierce, 823\n\nF.2d 1114, 1120-21 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 960\n\n\n     3\n     Although the Supreme Court has cited Smith with approval,\nits present scope remains in some doubt. See Merrell Dow Pharm.\nInc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 808-10 & n.5, 813-15 & n.12\n(1986); Franchise Tax Board v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust,\n463 U.S. 1, 9 (1983).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f(1988).   This circuit treats Smith as good law but as limited to\n\ncases where an important federal issue is a central element in\n\nthe state claim.       Almond v. Capital Props., Inc., 212 F.3d 20,\n\n23-24 & nn.2-3 (1st Cir. 2000).       The Tribes in this case do not\n\nrely on Smith.\n\n          In all events, there remains an overriding requirement\n\nthat the federal claim or issue appear on the face of \"a well\n\n[i.e.,    properly]      pleaded   complaint,\"     so    that   federal\n\njurisdiction     is absent where the federal issue would arise only\n\nas a defense to a state cause of action.     Louisville & Nashville\n\nR.R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 153-54 (1908).         As a settled\n\ncorollary, the restriction cannot be avoided by having the\n\nbeneficiary of the defense assert the defense preemptively in a\n\nclaim for declaratory or injunctive relief.4        This is just what\n\nthe district court said that the Tribes were attempting to do.\n\nPenobscot I, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 82-83;           Penobscot II, 116 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 203-04.\n\n          The district court's treatment of the issue under\n\nsection   1331    is    straightforward   and,    with   one    possible\n\n\n\n    4Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. at 16; Pub. Serv. Comm'n v.\nWycoff, 344 U.S. 237, 248 (1952); Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips\nPetroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671-74 (1950); Playboy Enters.,\nInc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 906 F.2d 25, 29-31 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied sub nom. Rivera Cruz v. Playboy Enters., Inc., 498 U.S.\n959 (1990).\n\n                                   -10-\n\fqualification       as    to   nomenclature,     arguably     correct.      The\n\nqualification is that under Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 685\n\n(1946), and its progeny, the Supreme Court has often said that\n\na colorable claim of a federal cause of action will confer\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction even though the claim itself may\n\nfail as a matter of law on further examination.5                On this view,\n\nthe Tribes' suit, if colorably federal, would be better viewed\n\nas   dismissed     for    failure   to   state    a   federal    claim   after\n\n\"jurisdiction\" to decide that issue had been established.                   See\n\nRomero    v.    Int'l    Terminal   Operating    Co.,   358   U.S.   354,   359\n\n(1959).\n\n               But is this a case where there is a federal claim?\n\nCertainly nothing in the Settlement Act explicitly creates a\n\nfederal right for the Tribes to sue to enforce what is at most\n\nan implicitly-adopted federal limitation on state power that\n\ncould easily be asserted as a defense in a state proceeding.\n\nThe creation of private causes of action by implication from\n\nfederal statutes used to be a cottage industry in the Supreme\n\nCourt, e.g., J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433-34\n\n(1964), but it is now less favored, see                 Karahalios v. Nat'l\n\n\n\n      5\n     See, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523\nU.S. 83, 89 (1998); Jackson Transit Auth. v. Local Div'n 1285,\nAmalgamated Transit Union, 457 U.S. 15, 21 n.6 (1982); Oneida\nIndian Nation v.

Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 576-78 (1979).\n\n         Especially in Indian cases, the Supreme Court has\n\nsometimes found federal rights present--or at least arguably\n\npresent--out of a tradition of federal regulation in the area.\n\nSee White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 143-44\n\n(1980); Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661,\n\n677 (1974); see also Felix S. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian\n\nLaw 270-79 (1982 ed.).   At the same time, the Maine tribes are\n\nnot treated like most other tribes but are subject to extensive\n\nstate regulation agreed to by Congress.   And both of the cases\n\nmainly relied upon by the Tribes for section 1331 jurisdiction\n\nin this case are distinguishable on their facts.6\n\n         A further complication exists. In this case the Tribes\n\nsay that even if section 1331 does not support jurisdiction,\n\nsection 1362 will do so.   The \"arising under\" language in the\n\ntwo statutes is parallel; and the purpose of section 1362 was\n\nprobably just to confer federal jurisdiction where it otherwise\n\nwould exist over Indian cases without regard to the amount-in-\n\n\n    6Nat'l Farmers Union Ins.

Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845,\n853 (1985) (non-Indian plaintiff's claim that federal law bars\nIndian tribal court from enforcing a default judgment against it\narguably arises under federal law to extent sufficient to\nestablish jurisdiction); Oneida Indian Nation, 414 U.S. at 666-\n67 (Indian claims of right to land in New York based on federal\ntreaties and statutes).\n\n                              -12-\n\fcontroversy requirement that governed section 1331 at the time\n\n(but has been since repealed). See Blatchford v. Native Vill. of\n\nNoatak, 501 U.S. 775, 784 (1991).                Yet, the Supreme Court has\n\nnot    settled      definitively       the   question   whether     section   1362\n\nreaches any further, and if so, how far, beyond section 1331.\n\nSee    Blatchford, 501 U.S. at 784-85; Moe v. Confederated Salish\n\n& Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S. 463, 472-75 (1976).\n\n                 Because   of   such    uncertainties,        we   are   reluctant\n\n(despite the urging of the district court that we clear up the\n\nmatter) to decide in advance of necessity whether a federal\n\nclaim can be conjured out of a lawsuit by the Tribes asserting\n\nthat       the    threatened    actions      violate    the    internal    affairs\n\nlimitation contained in Maine law and purportedly ratified by a\n\nfederal statute.7          Perhaps there is not even a single answer to\n\nthis question--it could conceivably turn on the circumstances.\n\nSee Penobscot I, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 83 n.4.                   In all events, no\n\n\n       7\n      The Tribes refer extensively to this Court's recent\ndecision\nin Penobscot Nation v. Fellencer, 164 F.3d 706, 713 (1st Cir.),\ncert. denied, 527 U.S. 1022 (1999).     We held there that the\nPenobscot Nation's decision, as employer, to fire a non-Indian\ncommunity health nurse was an \"internal tribal matter\" and\nenjoined a suit brought by the discharged employee in state\ncourt alleging discrimination under the Maine Human Rights Act,\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 4551 et seq. (West 1998). As the\ndistrict judge noted in this case, Penobscot II, 116 F. Supp. 2d\nat 204 & n.5, the question of subject matter jurisdiction was\nnot raised by the parties or the court in that case, so our\ndecision did not resolve the jurisdictional issue.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fanswer is needed in this case because, either way, the federal\n\ncourt can grant the Tribes no relief beyond what the state's\n\nhighest court has decreed.\n\n           Where pending state- and federal-court suits involve\n\nthe same underlying dispute, res judicata principles usually\n\ngive the race to the first court to decide the merits.                     A\n\nfederal court is (in general) bound to give the same respect to\n\na Maine judgment that would be given to it by Maine courts.               28\n\nU.S.C. § 1738 (1994); Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984).         This is true regardless whether\n\nthe state-court decision involves federal or state law.             Cruz v.\n\nMelecio, 204 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).             Here, Maine courts\n\nwould be bound to give res judicata effect to the May 1 decision\n\nof the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.\n\n           In Maine, as in most jurisdictions, the pertinent\n\nbranch of res judicata, collateral estoppel (now often called\n\nissue preclusion), provides that issues actually litigated,\n\ndecided, and necessary to a final judgment are binding in future\n\nlitigation between the same parties.           Morton v. Schneider, 612\n\nA.2d 1285, 1286 (Me. 1992); see also Restatement (Second) of\n\nJudgments § 27 (1982).     None of the exceptions in Maine law even\n\narguably   apply   in   this   case.     See   Mut.   Fire   Ins.   Co.   v.\n\nRichardson, 640 A.2d 205, 208-09 (Me. 1998).          Thus, unless there\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fis some overriding federal exception, the district court would\n\nbe bound to follow the Supreme Judicial Court's resolution of\n\nthe central issue, namely, how the internal affairs limitation\n\napplies to the requested documents.\n\n         The Tribes do invoke a supposed federal exception to\n\nres judicata for which several cases are cited.          The gist of the\n\nsuggested exception is that matters involving \"controversies\n\nabout state power over Indian tribes\" are so sensitive and so\n\nsuffused with a federal interest that they deserve special\n\ntreatment.     In   substance,    the    Tribes   are   urging    that   res\n\njudicata doctrine be ignored and that a federal court routinely\n\nreexamine the merits even in the teeth of a prior state-court\n\ndetermination.      Most of the cases cited by the Tribes do not\n\neven remotely support such an exception.\n\n         The     only   case   warranting   discussion     is    the   Tenth\n\nCircuit's decision in Kiowa Indian Tribe v. Hoover, 150 F.3d\n\n1163 (10th Cir. 1998).     There, a judgment creditor with a state-\n\ncourt judgment against the Kiowa Tribe on promissory notes\n\nobtained state-court authority to garnish tribal revenues, and\n\nthe Tribe brought an action in federal court under section 1983,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Supp. II 1996), to enjoin the garnishment.\n\nId. at 1168.     The district court dismissed the action under the\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine, something of a cousin to res judicata.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fSee D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476, 483-86\n\n& n.16 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16\n\n(1923). The appeals court reversed, holding that the state\n\njudgment did not resolve the matter.\n\n            Whether Kiowa Tribe was rightly decided or not, it is\n\ncompletely    distinguishable.     The   Tenth    Circuit   viewed     the\n\nongoing    state   garnishment   proceeding,     under   attack   in   the\n\nsection 1983 action, as \"separable from and collateral to\" the\n\nstate-court final judgment against the Kiowa Tribe.         150 F.3d at\n\n1171.     Here, no such separation exists:       the Tribes' theory is\n\nthat the internal affairs limitation affords complete protection\n\nfor all the documents sought; the final judgment of the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court decided precisely this issue but held\n\nthat some of the documents were protected and others were not,\n\nsee 770 A.2d at 590.     Certainly, nothing in this state decision\n\nis so implausible as to suggest the need for                independent\n\nfederal reexamination.\n\n            On the premise of Akins, 130 F.3d at 485, this is\n\nultimately a federal issue, and if so, the Tribes may request\n\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court, as they are\n\napparently seeking to do.        The Supreme Court is entitled to\n\nreview a state-court decision that decides a federal issue even\n\nif the action is one that could not have been brought in a\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\ffederal    district        court   under       statutory      \"arising      under\"\n\njurisdiction.          28 U.S.C. § 1257 (1994).         If the Supreme Court\n\ndoes take the case and decides it differently, then all the\n\nrelief that the Tribes seek would be furnished on remand in the\n\nstate system.\n\n            There is one loose end.            In Steel Co. v. Citizens for\n\na Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83 (1998), a plurality of the\n\nSupreme Court disapproved the (until then) common practice by\n\nwhich   lower     federal     courts    sometimes     bypass      jurisdictional\n\nquestions and resolve the merits where the result would be the\n\nsame however the jurisdictional question were decided.                      Id. at\n\n101-02.    It is not clear how firmly the Steel Co. plurality rule\n\nis endorsed by a majority of the Court, see, e.g., id. at 110-11\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring, joined by Kennedy, J.); id. at 111-12\n\n(Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment),\n\nor how far Steel Co. applies when the \"jurisdictional\" objection\n\nis something less fundamental than a doubt as to Article III\n\njurisdiction.       See United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 74 & n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret.\n\nSys., 173 F.3d 46, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                However these questions may be answered, Steel Co. is\n\nno   bar   to    our     disposition.        The   Steel    Co.   limitation    is\n\nfundamentally       an    objection     to   deciding      \"the   merits\"    where\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fjurisdiction is lacking.       See, e.g., 523 U.S. at 101.          Here,\n\nwithout reaching the merits, we simply conclude that the Maine\n\njudgment, binding under 28 U.S.C. § 1738, would prevent the\n\ndistrict court from affording any different relief.            Steel Co.'s\n\nunderlying concern is not implicated.           This spares us the need\n\nto explore further whether under Bell v. Hood, there is a\n\nsufficiently colorable federal claim to confer subject matter\n\njurisdiction,   an   outcome   that     would    also   make   Steel   Co.\n\ninapplicable.\n\n         Accordingly, regardless whether the district court had\n\njurisdiction or whether a federal cause of action is presented,\n\nthe intervening decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\n\nforecloses on res judicata grounds the broader relief sought by\n\nthe Tribes and makes the present federal suit superfluous.              On\n\nthis ground, the judgement of the district court is affirmed.\n\nAbstention requests, urged by the State of Maine as intervenor,\n\nneed not be considered.\n\n         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

The appellants in this case,\n\nthe      Penobscot    Nation    and   the     Passamaquoddy       Tribe   (\"the\n\nTribes\"),    occupy    tribal    lands       in   Maine.     The    corporate\n\nappellees--Georgia-Pacific Corp., Great Northern Paper, Inc.,\n\nand Champion International Corp. (\"the companies\")--operate pulp\n\nand paper mills that discharge waste water in rivers near or\n\nflowing through the Tribes' reservations.              A dispute developed\n\nbetween the Tribes and the State of Maine as to the regulation\n\nof waste water discharge under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§\n\n1342(b), 1377 (1994).\n\n            Concerned that the Tribes would seek to regulate their\n\nactivities, the companies requested that the Tribes turn over\n\nbroad    categories   of   documents        bearing   on   such    (potential)\n\nregulation, including efforts by the Tribes to secure authority\n\nto regulate and pertinent agreements between the Tribes and\n\nfederal agencies.      The companies' demand, made on May 10, 2000,\n\nwas based on Maine's Freedom of Access Act (\"the Maine Access\n\nAct\"), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 1 §§ 401-10 (West 1989 & Supp.\n\n2000).    Under Maine law, the Tribes are regulated in certain\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\frespects as municipalities, and municipalities are covered by\n\nthe Access Act.\n\n            The Tribes then brought the present lawsuit against the\n\ncompanies in federal district court to obtain injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief debarring the companies from obtaining the\n\ndocuments they sought.     The substance of the Tribes' position\n\nwas that a settlement between Maine and the Tribes, reflected in\n\nboth Maine law and a federal statute, precluded state regulation\n\nof \"internal tribal matters\" and that applying the Maine Access\n\nAct as sought by the companies would impermissibly regulate the\n\nTribes' internal affairs.      This federal suit was filed on May\n\n18, 2000.\n\n            On May 22, the day before they were served with the\n\nfederal complaint, the companies brought suit against the Tribes\n\nin the Maine Superior Court.    Invoking the Maine Access Act, Me.\n\nRev. Stat. tit. 1 § 409(1), the companies demanded that the\n\nTribes produce the documents previously sought.     In this state-\n\ncourt suit, the Tribes resisted the demand by asserting, inter\n\nalia, that the internal affairs limitation in the settlement\n\nmeant that the Maine Access Act could not validly be applied to\n\nrequire the Tribes to produce the documents.     The same question\n\nas to the breadth of the limitation was thus posed in both\n\ncourts.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                 The federal district court acted first, ruling on July\n\n18, 2000, that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Tribes'\n\nsuit       for     declaratory    and       injunctive     relief    against    the\n\ncompanies.

To sum\n\nup our conclusion at the outset, we think that whether the\n\nTribes' claims \"arise under\" federal law within the meaning of\n\neither section 1331 or section 1362 is a difficult question; but\n\nthe answer is now irrelevant in this case because the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court has decided the merits of the underlying\n\ndispute, and any further proceedings in the federal district\n\ncourt are controlled by    res judicata doctrine and would be\n\npointlessly duplicative.\n\n          Understanding the jurisdictional issue requires a short\n\nexcursion.   The Tribes in this case occupy a status, and are\n\nsubject to a legal framework, that is atypical.      The federal\n\nMaine Indian Claims Settlement Act (\"the Settlement Act\"), 25\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1721-35 (1994), and the Maine Implementing Act, Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30 §§ 6201-14 (West 1996 & Supp. 2000),\n\ncapped a settlement, reached in 1980, between the Tribes and the\n\nState of Maine involving disputes as to whether the Tribes\n\nshould be recognized at all and as to their claimed ownership of\n\nlarge tracts of land in Maine.      In the settlement, the Tribes\n\ngave up much of their land claims but got recognition, trust\n\nfunds, title to designated reservations, and certain regulatory\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\fpowers within those lands.       See 25 U.S.C. §§ 1723-25; Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 30 §§ 6205-10.2\n\n          However, partly as a result of the Tribes' disputed\n\nstatus, the State of Maine, as part of the settlement, obtained\n\nlegal   authority   over   the   Tribes   exceeding   the    usual   state\n\nauthority over native American tribes.

Thus, unless there\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fis some overriding federal exception, the district court would\n\nbe bound to follow the Supreme Judicial Court's resolution of\n\nthe central issue, namely, how the internal affairs limitation\n\napplies to the requested documents.\n\n         The Tribes do invoke a supposed federal exception to\n\nres judicata for which several cases are cited.          The gist of the\n\nsuggested exception is that matters involving \"controversies\n\nabout state power over Indian tribes\" are so sensitive and so\n\nsuffused with a federal interest that they deserve special\n\ntreatment.     In   substance,    the    Tribes   are   urging    that   res\n\njudicata doctrine be ignored and that a federal court routinely\n\nreexamine the merits even in the teeth of a prior state-court\n\ndetermination.      Most of the cases cited by the Tribes do not\n\neven remotely support such an exception.\n\n         The     only   case   warranting   discussion     is    the   Tenth\n\nCircuit's decision in Kiowa Indian Tribe v. Hoover, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156580\"><a href=\"/opinion/156580/kiowa-indian-tribe-v-hoover/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1998).     There, a judgment creditor with a state-\n\ncourt judgment against the Kiowa Tribe on promissory notes\n\nobtained state-court authority to garnish tribal revenues, and\n\nthe Tribe brought an action in federal court under section 1983,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Supp. II 1996), to enjoin the garnishment.\n\nId. at 1168.     The district court dismissed the action under the\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine, something of a cousin to res judicata.\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fSee D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110889\"><a href=\"/opinion/110889/district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals-v-feldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476, 483-86\n\n& n.16 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415-16\n\n(1923). The appeals court reversed, holding that the state\n\njudgment did not resolve the matter.\n\n            Whether Kiowa Tribe was rightly decided or not, it is\n\ncompletely    distinguishable.     The   Tenth    Circuit   viewed     the\n\nongoing    state   garnishment   proceeding,     under   attack   in   the\n\nsection 1983 action, as \"separable from and collateral to\" the\n\nstate-court final judgment against the Kiowa Tribe.         150 F.3d at\n\n1171.     Here, no such separation exists:       the Tribes' theory is\n\nthat the internal affairs limitation affords complete protection\n\nfor all the documents sought; the final judgment of the Maine\n\nSupreme Judicial Court decided precisely this issue but held\n\nthat some of the documents were protected and others were not,\n\nsee 770 A.2d at 590.     Certainly, nothing in this state decision\n\nis so implausible as to suggest the need for                independent\n\nfederal reexamination.\n\n            On the premise of Akins, 130 F.3d at 485, this is\n\nultimately a federal issue, and if so, the Tribes may request\n\ncertiorari in the United States Supreme Court, as they are\n\napparently seeking to do.        The Supreme Court is entitled to\n\nreview a state-court decision that decides a federal issue even\n\nif the action is one that could not have been brought in a\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\ffederal    district        court   under       statutory      \"arising      under\"\n\njurisdiction.          28 U.S.C. § 1257 (1994).         If the Supreme Court\n\ndoes take the case and decides it differently, then all the\n\nrelief that the Tribes seek would be furnished on remand in the\n\nstate system.\n\n            There is one loose end.            In Steel Co. v. Citizens for\n\na Better Environment, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), a plurality of the\n\nSupreme Court disapproved the (until then) common practice by\n\nwhich   lower     federal     courts    sometimes     bypass      jurisdictional\n\nquestions and resolve the merits where the result would be the\n\nsame however the jurisdictional question were decided.                      Id. at\n\n101-02.    It is not clear how firmly the Steel Co. plurality rule\n\nis endorsed by a majority of the Court, see, e.g., id. at 110-11\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring, joined by Kennedy, J.); id. at 111-12\n\n(Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment),\n\nor how far Steel Co. applies when the \"jurisdictional\" objection\n\nis something less fundamental than a doubt as to Article III\n\njurisdiction.       See United States v. Woods, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198889\"><a href=\"/opinion/198889/united-states-v-woods/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 & n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret.\n\nSys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198432\"><a href=\"/opinion/198432/parella-v-retirement/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                However these questions may be answered, Steel Co. is\n\nno   bar   to    our     disposition.        The   Steel    Co.   limitation    is\n\nfundamentally       an    objection     to   deciding      \"the   merits\"    where\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fjurisdiction is lacking.       See, e.g., 523 U.S. at 101.          Here,\n\nwithout reaching the merits, we simply conclude that the Maine\n\njudgment, binding under 28 U.S.C. § 1738, would prevent the\n\ndistrict court from affording any different relief.            Steel Co.'s\n\nunderlying concern is not implicated.           This spares us the need\n\nto explore further whether under Bell v. Hood, there is a\n\nsufficiently colorable federal claim to confer subject matter\n\njurisdiction,   an   outcome   that     would    also   make   Steel   Co.\n\ninapplicable.\n\n         Accordingly, regardless whether the district court had\n\njurisdiction or whether a federal cause of action is presented,\n\nthe intervening decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court\n\nforecloses on res judicata grounds the broader relief sought by\n\nthe Tribes and makes the present federal suit superfluous.              On\n\nthis ground, the judgement of the district court is affirmed.\n\nAbstention requests, urged by the State of Maine as intervenor,\n\nneed not be considered.\n\n         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f</pre>",
