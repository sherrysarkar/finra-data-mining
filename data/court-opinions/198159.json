Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            Aldrich, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJames G. Goggin with whom Jacqueline W. Rider and Verrill &amp;\r\nDana, LLP were on brief for appellant.\r\nAndrew D. Epstein with whom Barker, Epstein &amp; Loscocco was on\r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\nOctober 9, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Denise Matthews, a fabric\r\ndesigner and wholesale distributor of \"soft-good\" souvenirs, makes\r\nand sells a children's t-shirt with a design entitled, \"Someone\r\nWent to Boston and got me this shirt because they love me Very\r\nmuch.\"  This phrase appears on a t-shirt surrounded by small\r\ndrawings of a fish, a sailboat, a lobster, Faneuil Hall, and\r\nscattered hearts.  Matthews registered this \"Someone...\" t-shirt\r\ndesign with the U.S. Copyright Office, receiving a certificate of\r\nregistration effective August 9, 1995.  \r\nIn February 1997, Alan Freedman, a competing souvenir\r\nproducer, began offering a children's t-shirt with the slogan\r\n\"Someone Who Loves Me Went to Boston and Got Me this Shirt.\"  This\r\nphrase appears on the Freedman t-shirt and is surrounded by small\r\ndrawings of a fish, a sailboat, a lobster, a swan boat, ducklings,\r\nand a smiling sun.  Freedman and Matthews both attend the Boston\r\nGift Show where Freedman has seen Matthews' \"Someone...\" t-shirt\r\ndisplayed.\r\nMatthews filed suit against Freedman for copyright\r\ninfringement under 17 U.S.C.  501 et seq. in August 1997.  The\r\ndistrict court held a non-jury trial on January 21, 1998, and\r\nissued a memorandum and order dated February 5, 1998, granting\r\njudgment in favor of Freedman on the ground that Freedman's t-shirt\r\ndid not infringe upon the protectible elements of Matthews' design. \r\nThereafter, the district court also awarded attorney's fees to\r\nFreedman in the amount of $25,000.  This appeal by Matthews\r\nfollowed.\r\nTo make out a copyright infringement, a plaintiff must\r\nshow ownership of a valid copyright--not questioned here--and the\r\n\"copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\" \r\nFeist Publications v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361\r\n(1991).  As to this latter element, sometimes the dispute concerns\r\nthe factual question of whether the defendant saw and copied the\r\nplaintiff's work; but in other cases, as in this one, the dispute\r\ncenters around more subtle, related questions: what aspects of the\r\nplaintiff's work are protectible under the copyright laws and\r\nwhether whatever copying took place appropriated those elements.\r\nA major limitation on what is protectible under the\r\ncopyright laws is capsulized in the notion that copyright protects \r\nthe original expressions of ideas but not the ideas expressed.  SeeFeist, 499 U.S. at 345-51; CMM Cable Rep, Inc. v. Ocean Coast\r\nProperties, Inc., 97 F.3d 1504, 1516 (1st Cir. 1996).  The point is\r\nthat the underlying idea (e.g., the travails of two star-crossed\r\nlovers), even if original, cannot be removed from the public realm;\r\nbut its expression in the form of a play script (such as William\r\nShakespeare's Romeo and Juliet) can be protected.  Needless to say,\r\nthe line is a blurry one.\r\nIf the idea-expression dichotomy favors copyright-case\r\ndefendants, a somewhat different notion in copyright law favors the\r\nplaintiffs.  It is well-settled that where the plaintiff has\r\ncopyrighted an original expression, an infringement can be found to\r\nexist even where the defendant does not copy the original\r\nexpression in a literal manner (word for word or image by image). \r\nIt is enough to make out infringement--assuming actual copying--if\r\nthe alleged infringing work is \"substantially similar\" to the\r\nprotectible expression in the copywritten work.  CMM Cable, 97 F.3d\r\nat 1513.  In other words, if Romeo and Juliet were under copyright,\r\nthe infringer could not escape solely by changing the names of\r\nevery character and altering a few words in every line.\r\nA potential tension is now obvious.  An alleged\r\ninfringing work taken as a whole may seem \"substantially similar\"\r\nto the copyrighted work taken as whole, but the impression of\r\nsimilarity may rest heavily upon similarities in the two works as\r\nto elements that are  not copyrightable--because those elements are\r\nthe underlying ideas, or expressions that are not original with the\r\nplaintiff, or for some like reason.  See Feist, 499 U.S. at 358-60;\r\nCMM Cable, 97 F.3d at 1515.  Courts have used various formulas to\r\nisolate the protectible expression in the copyrighted work to\r\ndetermine whether the alleged infringing work is \"substantially\r\nsimilar\" to that protectible expression.\r\nThat is just what the district court did in the present\r\ncase.  It declined implicitly to give Matthews any protection for\r\nthe idea that underlies the phrasing on the t-shirt--that the t-\r\nshirt's purchase represents someone's love of the donee--or the\r\nunoriginal notions of having a legend on a t-shirt, using childish\r\nlettering, or placing on the t-shirt symbolic emblems reminiscent\r\nof a location (here, Boston).  The district court then turned its\r\nattention to the remaining elements and found that, as to theseelements, the differences between the two works precluded a finding\r\nof infringement.\r\nIn this regard, the district court pointed to differences\r\nin the particular icons selected, their arrangement, the colors\r\nused, and the lettering.  Examination of Matthews' and Freedman's\r\nt-shirts bears out the district court's conclusion; no one would\r\nthink the lettering, colors or particular icons had been literally\r\ncopied from one t-shirt to the other.  For example, the icons are\r\nnot all of the same subjects and even where both t-shirts depict a\r\nlobster or fish, the drawings are completely different.\r\nBecause Matthews does not directly challenge the district\r\ncourt's assessment on an element-by-element basis, we pause only to\r\naddress the most obvious possible claim: that the expression of the\r\n\"someone\" theme in the two t-shirts is \"substantially similar.\" \r\nObviously, there is a good deal of similarity in the substance of\r\nthe two competing phrases: \"someone went to Boston and got me this\r\nshirt because they love me very much\" and \"someone who loves me\r\nwent to Boston and got me this shirt.\"  But most of the similarity\r\nrests on the fact that both phrases are seeking to express\r\nessentially the same idea.\r\nAdmittedly, there is some similarity in the two\r\nexpressions of the idea, but this is largely because both are\r\nexpressing the same idea briefly and in straightforward terms and\r\nthe available variations in wording are quite limited.  Even if the\r\nsentiment were original with Matthews--which is by no means clear--\r\nit would virtually give Matthews a monopoly on the underlying idea\r\nif everyone else were forbidden from using a differently worded\r\nshort sentence to express the same sentiment.  Cf. CMM Cable, 97\r\nF.3d at 1519-20.\r\nIn all events, Matthews' attack on the district court's\r\ndecision is not based on any refined comparison of individual\r\nelements.  Rather, Matthews says broadly  that the test for\r\ncopyright infringement is whether the \"ordinary observer\" would\r\nfind a substantial similarity between the two works and would be\r\ndisposed to overlook the disparities as minor.  Matthews then\r\nargues that the district court, at least if its judgment is\r\nreviewed de novo (as Matthews urges), erred because the two t-\r\nshirts are to the average observer  substantially similar \"in\r\ndesign and overall aesthetic appeal\" and because \"both exhibits\r\nhave similar 'Someone Who Loves Me Went To Boston And Got Me This\r\nShirt' language and display boats, fish, and a lobster in a\r\nchildlike fashion.\"\r\nCase law supports the \"ordinary observer\" test and the\r\ndisregard of minor differences in favor of major similarity.  SeeConcrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600,\r\n608-11 (1st Cir. 1988).  As for the proper standard of review,\r\nthere is some difference among the circuits where the question of\r\nsubstantial similarity is based solely on a visual comparison of\r\ntwo items easily available to the reviewing court.  But even if we\r\nassumed arguendo a de novo standard of review, the protectible\r\nelements here are not substantially similar for reasons already\r\nindicated. \r\nIndeed, Matthews' own argument (just quoted) is\r\npractically explicit in its refusal to distinguish what is\r\nprotectible from what is not.  Lack of originality to one side, the\r\nnotion of displaying \"boats, fish and a lobster in childlike\r\nfashion\" is not in itself an expression; and although a particular\r\ndrawing might be, the two t-shirts in this case do not display\r\nsimilar icons.  For reasons already indicated, the \"someone\"\r\nphrasing in the two t-shirts reflects the same sentiment, but the\r\nsentiment is not protectible, and Freedman's expression of it was\r\ndifferent from Matthews', given the limited options available.\r\nWe do not mean to suggest that every element in\r\ncopyrighted work must be considered apart from all others; a\r\ncollection of protectible elements may seem substantially similar\r\nprimarily through the overall impression created by those\r\nprotectible elements taken together.  Cf. Knitwaves, Inc. v.\r\nLollytogs Ltd., 71 F.3d 996, 1003-04 (2d Cir. 1995).  Even entirely\r\nunoriginal expressions taken from others might sometimes be\r\ncombined in a way that gave rise to a new protectible expression\r\n(imagine a collage of newspaper headlines juxtaposed in some highly\r\ncreative and original fashion).  Cf. Feist, 499 U.S. at 358-59. \r\nBut this case falls into neither of these categories.\r\nTurning to the issue of attorney's fees, Matthews urges\r\nus to reverse as an abuse of discretion the district court's award\r\nof $25,000 in attorney's fees.  She says that because the district\r\ncourt found that both parties made \"non-meritorious\" arguments, the\r\nSupreme Court decision in Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517,\r\n534 (1994), dictated an even-handed treatment of attorney's fees,\r\nnamely, none to either side.  Matthews also claims that the\r\ndistrict court failed to consider all of the Fogerty factors and\r\nthat even if an award was proper, the fees awarded here were\r\nexcessive.\r\nThe copyright statute departs from the usual American\r\nrule and says that the district court \"may\" award attorney's fees\r\nto the prevailing party.  17 U.S.C.  505.  In Fogerty, the Supreme\r\nCourt rejected the view that fees should be awarded more readily to\r\nprevailing plaintiffs than to prevailing defendants, 510 U.S. at\r\n533; and it said that the weakness of arguments made was a relevant\r\nconsideration.  Id. at 534 n.19.  But the Court did not say that\r\nfees should be withheld from the prevailing party simply because\r\nboth sides made some arguments that did not persuade.\r\nHere, the district court ruled that the Matthews' claim\r\nwas not frivolous and was not brought in bad faith, but that\r\nMatthews \"did try to extend her copyright protection far beyond\r\nwhat is allowed by law.\"  This last conclusion is a judgment call\r\nand, on the present facts, well within the district court's\r\ndiscretion.  A plaintiff's decision to bring a weak, if\r\nnonfrivolous, case and to argue for an unreasonable extension of\r\ncopyright protection are relevant concerns.  Fogerty, 510 U.S. at\r\n526-27; Edwards v. Red Farm Studio Co., 109 F.3d 80, 82-83 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  Depending on other circumstances, a district court\r\ncould conclude that the losing party should pay even if all of the\r\narguments it made were reasonable.\r\nApart from the weakness of the arguments on both sides,\r\nMatthews says only that her company is not a \"corporate giant\"; but \r\nit may well be larger than Freedman's, and anyway Matthews makes no\r\neffort to develop the details, although free to offer such evidence\r\nin the district court.  We conclude that  the district court gave\r\na rational explanation for its decision to award fees to Freedman,\r\nand that Matthews has failed to show an abuse of discretion or any\r\nother error.  This is equally so as to the amount awarded--$25,000\r\nout of the $60,000 originally sought.\r\nFreedman has sought a further award of attorney's fees to\r\ncover this appeal.  In our view, Matthews has raised some issues\r\nworth airing; the arguments on appeal mirror those made in the\r\ndistrict court; and we think that $25,000 is an adequate sum for\r\nFreedman for the litigation as a whole, considering that the\r\ndistrict court conducted an abbreviated bench trial using\r\nstipulated facts and affidavits.  Accordingly, in the exercise of\r\nour own discretion, we decline to make any further award to\r\nFreedman.\r\nAffirmed.  \n",

As to this latter element, sometimes the dispute concerns the factual question of whether the defendant saw and copied the plaintiff's work;  but in other cases, as in this one, the dispute centers around more subtle, related questions:  what aspects of the plaintiff's work are protectible under the copyright laws and whether whatever copying took place appropriated those elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A major limitation on what is protectible under the copyright laws is capsulized in the notion that copyright protects the original expressions of ideas but not the ideas expressed.  See Feist, 499 U.S. at 345-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The point is that the underlying idea (e.g., the travails of two star-crossed lovers), even if original, cannot be removed from the public realm;  but its expression in the form of a play script (such as William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ) can be protected.  Needless to say, the line is a blurry one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the idea-expression dichotomy favors copyright-case defendants, a somewhat different notion in copyright law favors the plaintiffs.  It is well-settled that where the plaintiff has copyrighted an original expression, an infringement can be found to exist even where the defendant does not copy the original expression in a literal manner (word-for-word or image-by-image).  It is enough to make out infringement--assuming actual copying--if the alleged infringing work is \"substantially similar\" to the protectible expression in the copywritten work.  CMM Cable, 97 F.3d at 1513.   In other words, if Romeo and Juliet were under copyright, the infringer could not escape solely by changing the names of every character and altering a few words in every line.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A potential tension is now obvious.  An alleged infringing work taken as a whole may seem \"substantially similar\" to the copyrighted work taken as whole, but the impression of similarity may rest heavily upon similarities in the two works as to elements that are not copyrightable--because those elements are the underlying ideas, or expressions that are not original with the plaintiff, or for some like reason.  See Feist, 499 U.S. at 358-60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>;  CMM Cable, 97 F.3d at 1515.   Courts have used various formulas to isolate the protectible expression in the copyrighted work to determine whether the alleged infringing work is \"substantially similar\" to that protectible expression.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is just what the district court did in the present case.  It declined implicitly to give Matthews any protection for the idea that underlies the phrasing on the t-shirt--that the t-shirt's purchase represents someone's love of the donee--or the unoriginal notions of having a legend on a t-shirt, using childish lettering, or placing on the t-shirt symbolic emblems reminiscent of a location (here, Boston).  The district court then turned its attention to the remaining elements and found that, as to these elements, the differences between the two works precluded a finding of infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard, the district court pointed to differences in the particular icons selected, their arrangement, the colors used, and the lettering.  Examination of Matthews' and Freedman's t-shirts bears out the district court's conclusion;  no one would think the lettering, colors or particular icons had been literally copied from one t-shirt to the other.  For example, the icons are not all of the same subjects and even where both t-shirts depict a lobster or fish, the drawings are completely different.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Matthews does not directly challenge the district court's assessment on an element-by-element basis, we pause only to address the most obvious possible claim:  that the expression of the \"someone\" theme in the two t-shirts is \"substantially similar.\"   Obviously, there is a good deal of similarity in the substance of the two competing phrases:  \"someone went to Boston and got me this shirt because they love me very much\" and \"someone who loves me went to Boston and got me this shirt.\"   But most of the similarity rests on the fact that both phrases are seeking to express essentially the same idea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, there is some similarity in the two expressions of the idea, but this is largely because both are expressing the same idea briefly and in straightforward terms and the available variations in wording are quite limited.  Even if the sentiment were original with Matthews--which is by no means clear--it would virtually give Matthews a monopoly on the underlying idea if everyone else were forbidden from using a differently worded short sentence to express the same sentiment.  Cf. CMM Cable, 97 F.3d at 1519-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Matthews' attack on the district court's decision is not based on any refined comparison of individual elements.  Rather, Matthews says broadly that the test for copyright infringement is whether the \"ordinary observer\" would find a substantial similarity between the two works and would be disposed to overlook the disparities as minor.  Matthews then argues that the district court, at least if its judgment is reviewed de novo (as Matthews urges), erred because the two t-shirts are to the average observer substantially similar \"in design and overall aesthetic appeal\" and because \"both exhibits have similar 'Someone Who Loves Me Went To Boston And Got Me This Shirt' language and display boats, fish, and a lobster in a childlike fashion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Case law supports the \"ordinary observer\" test and the disregard of minor differences in favor of major similarity.  See Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503998\"><a href=\"/opinion/503998/concrete-machinery-company-inc-v-classic-lawn-ornaments-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 608-11 (1st Cir.1988).  As for the proper standard of review, there is some difference among the circuits where the question of substantial similarity is based solely on a visual comparison of two items easily available to the reviewing court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  But even if we assumed arguendo a de novo standard of review, the protectible elements here are not substantially similar for reasons already indicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Matthews' own argument (just quoted) is practically explicit in its refusal to distinguish what is protectible from what is not.  Lack of originality to one side, the notion of displaying \"boats, fish and a lobster in childlike fashion\" is not in itself an expression;  and although a particular drawing might be, the two t-shirts in this case do not display similar icons.  For reasons already indicated, the \"someone\" phrasing in the two t-shirts reflects the same sentiment, but the sentiment is not protectible, and Freedman's expression of it was different from Matthews', given the limited options available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to suggest that every element in copyrighted work must be considered apart from all others;  a collection of protectible elements may seem substantially similar primarily through the overall impression created by those protectible elements taken together.  Cf. Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709490\"><a href=\"/opinion/709490/knitwaves-inc-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-lollytogs-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 1003-04 (2d Cir.1995).  Even entirely unoriginal expressions taken from others might sometimes be combined in a way that gave rise to a new protectible expression (imagine a collage of newspaper headlines juxtaposed in some highly creative and original fashion).

Feist, 499 U.S. at 358-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112568\"><a href=\"/opinion/112568/feist-publications-inc-v-rural-telephone-service-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
