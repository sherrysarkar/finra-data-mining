James A. Chute, a man of Irish\n\ndescent,    filed    a    nine-count    complaint      against     the    City    of\n\nCambridge, the city's police commissioner, and several of the\n\ncity's police officers in both their individual and official\n\ncapacities, alleging that defendant, officer George Walker,\n\ndirected    ethnic       slurs   toward   him,      hit    him   on     the    head,\n\nhandcuffed    him        too   tightly,      and    then   falsely       arrested,\n\nimprisoned, and charged him with various crimes.\n\n            Walker, appearing through counsel, filed a motion to\n\ndismiss one of Chute's nine counts and an answer to Chute's\n\ncomplaint.    On the next day, the city, and all of the other\n\ndefendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only,\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss counts two through four.                             Chute\n\nresponded to none of these motions.                Although no party moved to\n\ndismiss eight of the claims against Walker individually, the\n\ndistrict court nonetheless dismissed Chute's complaint in its\n\nentirety for failure to state a claim, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),\n\nand denied Chute's motion for relief from judgment, Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 60(b).\n\n            Chute    appeals     the   dismissal      of   seven   of    the    nine\n\ncounts, only as they apply to Walker in his individual capacity.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fHe   concedes   the    dismissal   of   two   of   the   counts   in    their\n\nentirety.    He also concedes the dismissal of all of the counts\n\nagainst Walker in his official capacity as well as the dismissal\n\nof all of the counts against all of the other defendants.1                 As\n\nto the remaining counts against Walker individually, Chute says\n\nthe district court erred by, sua sponte, dismissing those counts\n\nwithout providing him notice or an opportunity to be heard.                In\n\naddition, Chute says the district court's conclusion that all of\n\nhis claims against Walker must be dismissed, because he never\n\nserved Walker with process, is incorrect because Walker waived\n\nthis objection.       We agree that the district court erred and so\n\nwe reverse the district court's dismissal of counts one, two,\n\nand five through nine of Chute's complaint, against                    Walker\n\nindividually, and reinstate the case for further proceedings.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            On August 2, 2000, Chute filed a nine-count complaint\n\nin the district court seeking money damages against the City of\n\nCambridge, the city's police commissioner, and several police\n\n\n\n      1   On October 19, 2001, this court granted the official capacity\ndefendants' unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal naming them, and\ndismissed the appeal except for Chute's appeal of the dismissal of the\naction against defendant Walker in his individual capacity.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fofficers, including officer Walker, in their individual and\n\nofficial capacities.        The complaint stated that on August 7,\n\n1997, officer Walker called Chute a \"mick bastard\" and said to\n\nhim \"I'm an American, why don't you scum go back to where you\n\ncame from.\"   According to Chute, Walker then hit him on the head\n\nseveral times and, with the help of other unknown officers,\n\nfalsely arrested him and used excessive force in doing so.\n\nChute's   complaint      also   asserted    that    Walker      and   the    other\n\nunknown officers falsely charged him with \"several criminal and\n\nmotor vehicle violations\" and falsely imprisoned him.                 According\n\nto the signed Return of Service, on August 3, 2000, a constable\n\nserved the summons and complaint by handing copies to Lieutenant\n\nWalsh, who signed as an authorized agent for officer Walker.\n\n           In counts one, four, and five, Chute claimed that these\n\nacts   violated,   in    different    ways,    his       Fourth,   Eighth,     and\n\nFourteenth    Amendment     rights    under    color       of   state   law     in\n\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.          In counts two and six, he also\n\nclaimed that these acts constituted interference, by threat,\n\nintimidation,      and    coercion,     with       the     exercise     of    his\n\nMassachusetts constitutional and statutory rights, in violation\n\nof the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12,\n\n                                      -4-\n\f§§ 11H and 11I (2000).      In count three, he alleged a violation\n\nof the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act,         id. ch. 258, and, in\n\ncounts seven through nine, state tort law prohibiting assault\n\nand battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment.         Counts five\n\nthrough eight were explicitly against Walker in his individual\n\ncapacity and counts one, two, and nine might also fairly be read\n\nto assert claims against Walker individually.\n\n          Approximately one month later, on September 5, Walker\n\nfiled a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss count three -- Chute's\n\nstate Tort Claims Act count -- and an answer to the complaint.\n\nIn neither filing did Walker object to the manner in which he\n\nhad been served or otherwise purport to limit the appearance by\n\nhis counsel.    On the next day, September 6, the city, and all of\n\nthe   other   defendants,   including   Walker,   in   their   official\n\ncapacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through\n\nfour and an answer to the complaint.       Chute did not respond to\n\nany of these filings.\n\n          On February 15, 2001, the district court dismissed\n\nChute's complaint, in its entirety and with prejudice.             The\n\ncourt based its dismissal on the official capacity defendants'\n\nSeptember 6 motion to dismiss counts two through four, which the\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdistrict court incorrectly characterized as a motion to dismiss\n\n\"all\" counts other than count one (the § 1983 claim).       The\n\ndistrict court dismissed count one once it dismissed all of the\n\nother counts because it characterized count one as derivative of\n\nthose other counts.\n\n         Almost two weeks later, on February 28, Chute filed a\n\nmotion for relief from final judgment, under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b), arguing (1) that Walker had never, in his individual\n\ncapacity, moved to dismiss,2 and (2) that the official capacity\n\ndefendants' motion to dismiss only sought dismissal of counts\n\ntwo through four.     Chute's counsel admitted having failed to\n\nrespond to the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss,\n\nbut argued that the motion did not seek dismissal of any counts\n\nagainst the individual capacity defendants and that it did not\n\neven seek dismissal of all counts against the city and the\n\nofficial capacity defendants.\n\n\n    2     About two weeks later, Chute amended his 60(b) motion,\nconceding that Walker had filed a motion to dismiss count three\n(Chute's Tort Claims Act count) only, but continuing to insist\nthat no defendant had sought dismissal of all counts against the\nindividual capacity defendants.    The amendment to the motion\nconsistently, but erroneously, refers to defendant Watson (the\nCambridge police commissioner, sued in his official capacity)\ninstead of Walker.\n\n                                -6-\n\f              Without addressing Chute's claim that no party had ever\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss all counts against the individual\n\ncapacity defendants, all defendants responded to Chute's 60(b)\n\nmotion   by    arguing   that   Chute's   counsel   had   not   provided   a\n\nlegally sufficient excuse for failing to respond to the earlier-\n\nfiled motions to dismiss counts two through four and count\n\nthree.\n\n              Around this time, Chute's counsel withdrew and new\n\ncounsel appeared for him.        Chute's new counsel, who represents\n\nhim on appeal, waived the portion of Chute's 60(b) motion that\n\nsought vacation of the dismissal of the claims against the city\n\nand all official capacity defendants; he only sought vacation of\n\nthe judgment dismissing counts one, two, and five through nine,\n\nagainst the individual capacity defendants.           Counsel explained\n\nthat neither Walker, nor any of the \"unknown officers,\" in their\n\nindividual capacities, had ever filed a motion to dismiss these\n\ncounts and that there was no basis for a sua sponte dismissal.\n\n              On June 12, 2001, the district court entered an order\n\ndeferring its ruling on Chute's 60(b) motion and inviting him to\n\nshow good cause for relief from judgment.            The district court\n\nreasoned that it properly dismissed Chute's complaint, in its\n\n                                    -7-\n\fentirety, because the complaint did not assert any individual\n\ncapacity claims.        This was not so.          The district court also\n\noffered a new justification for dismissal: it said that Chute\n\nhad never served Walker with process in his individual capacity\n\nand that Walker had only participated in the litigation in his\n\nofficial capacity.\n\n           Chute's      new    counsel    accepted   the    district   court's\n\ninvitation to show cause and filed a memorandum stating that\n\nChute's complaint did, in fact, assert counts against Walker\n\nindividually.    In response to the district court's insufficient\n\nservice rationale, the memorandum noted that, contrary to the\n\ndistrict   court's      June    12     conclusion,   separate   counsel     had\n\nrepresented Walker in his individual capacity.                     Chute   also\n\nexplained that Walker, in his individual capacity, had not moved\n\nto dismiss the entire complaint and that Walker had waived any\n\nobjection to service of process by not objecting in his answer.\n\n           Again, this time in response to Chute's memorandum to\n\nshow cause, Walker advanced the inapposite argument that Chute's\n\ncounsel had failed to provide a legally sufficient excuse for\n\nfailing to respond to the earlier-filed motion to dismiss counts\n\ntwo   through   four.         Walker    argued,   without   ever   addressing\n\n                                        -8-\n\fChute's claim that no motion to dismiss all counts against\n\nWalker individually had ever been filed, and without rebutting\n\nChute's claim that Walker had waived any service of process\n\nobjection, that Chute's failure to respond to the earlier-filed\n\nmotions to dismiss did not constitute excusable neglect.\n\n          Finally, on July 30, 2001, the district court denied\n\nChute's 60(b) motion.   The district court deleted its previous\n\nconclusion that Walker had only been represented by a single\n\nattorney, but noted that Walker's attorney had never claimed\n\nthat he had been authorized to represent Walker individually.\n\nThe district court, in defending its dismissal of the individual\n\ncapacity claims against Walker, relied on its view that Walker\n\nhad never been served in his individual capacity.\n\n                               II.\n\n          We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).3   Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor & Gamble Commercial Co.,\n\n228 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n     3    Because Chute has brought a timely appeal of the\ndistrict court's final judgment, we need not discuss or apply\nthe standard of review for rulings on 60(b) motions.\n\n                               -9-\n\f           Here, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint\n\nsua sponte.    The complaint set out nine counts against several\n\ndifferent defendants.        Among these counts were several counts\n\nagainst Walker in his individual capacity.           Neither Walker nor\n\nanybody   else      ever    moved   to     dismiss   all   nine     counts.\n\nNevertheless, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint, in\n\nits entirety and with prejudice,4 based on the official capacity\n\ndefendants' September 6 motion to dismiss counts two through\n\nfour.\n\n           Contrary to the district court's conclusion, Chute did\n\nsue   Walker   in   his    individual    capacity.   Chute's      complaint\n\nstated, at least thirteen separate times, including twice in the\n\n\n      4   The district court appears to backtrack from its\nFebruary 15 memorandum and order dismissing the entirety of\nChute's action when it concluded its July 30 denial of Chute's\n60(b) motion by stating:\n\n      When the adjudication, now confirmed, was made, no claim of\n      liability of a police officer individually was before the\n      court and no individual had been served or filed an\n      appearance. In these circumstances, no adjudication on the\n      merits has been made in this case as to any claim against\n      a police officer individually.\n\nThis recharacterization does not change the fact that Chute's\ncomplaint explicitly asserted several counts against Walker\nindividually and that, on February 15, the district court\ndismissed the complaint.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcomplaint's caption, that Chute was suing Walker and other\n\nunknown   officers   \"individually\"    or   in    their   \"individual\n\ncapacities.\"    Nevertheless,   the    district   court   incorrectly\n\nconcluded that its \"interpretation of the original complaint as\n\none making only official-capacity claims was reasonable\" and\n\nnoted that \"[t]he City of Cambridge, under that interpretation,\n\nwas the only defendant.\"    Chute sued Walker individually, and\n\nthe City of Cambridge was not the only defendant.\n\n          Furthermore, no party moved to dismiss the          entire\n\ncomplaint.   Walker filed a motion to dismiss count three and the\n\ncity, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in\n\ntheir official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts\n\ntwo through four.    Based on the official capacity defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss counts two through four, which the district\n\ncourt characterized as a motion to dismiss \"all\" counts (other\n\nthan the § 1983 count), the district court dismissed the entire\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          Chute grants that he never responded to these two\n\nmotions to dismiss and concedes the dismissal of all counts\n\nagainst the city and the official capacity defendants, and count\n\nthree against Walker.   He also relinquishes count four against\n\n                                -11-\n\fWalker.     He only seeks reinstatement of counts one, two, and\n\nfive through nine against Walker individually because, he says,\n\nthese counts were improperly dismissed.         Chute claims that these\n\ncounts were dismissed sua sponte and without any notice or\n\nopportunity for him to be heard; no defendant moved to dismiss\n\nthe entire complaint and so he was caught by surprise when the\n\ndistrict court dismissed.        We agree.\n\n            \"Sua sponte dismissals are strong medicine, and should\n\nbe dispensed sparingly.\"     Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States,\n\n257 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).           The general rule is that \"in\n\nlimited circumstances, sua sponte dismissals of complaints under\n\nRule 12(b)(6) . . . are appropriate,\" but that \"such dismissals\n\nare erroneous unless the parties have been afforded notice and\n\nan opportunity to amend the complaint or otherwise respond.\"\n\nFutura Dev. of P.R., Inc. v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R., 144\n\nF.3d 7, 13-14 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Carparts Distrib. Ctr.,\n\nInc. v. Auto. Wholesaler's Assoc. of New England, Inc., 37 F.3d\n\n12, 15 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            \"This does not mean . . . that every                 sua   sponte\n\ndismissal    entered   without     prior     notice   to   the    plaintiff\n\nautomatically must be reversed.       If it is crystal clear that the\n\n                                   -12-\n\fplaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would\n\nbe futile, then a sua sponte dismissal may stand.\"                       Gonzalez-\n\nGonzalez, 257 F.3d at 37; see also Clorox, 228 F.3d at 30\n\n(noting     \"limited    exceptions        to    the    general    rule     barring\n\ndismissal without notice\"); accord Curley v. Perry, 246 F.3d\n\n1278 (10th Cir. 2001).         The party defending the dismissal must\n\nshow that \"the allegations contained in the complaint, taken in\n\nthe   light    most    favorable     to    the      plaintiff,    are    patently\n\nmeritless     and   beyond    all   hope       of   redemption.\"         Gonzalez-\n\nGonzalez, 257 F.3d at 37.\n\n            Without expressing any further opinion of the merits\n\nof Chute's complaint, we conclude that counts one, two, and five\n\nthrough nine, against Walker individually, are not \"patently\n\nmeritless and beyond all hope of redemption.\"                   Id.     Therefore,\n\nit was error to dismiss these counts sua sponte and without\n\nnotice.\n\n            This does not end the matter because the district court\n\nstated, as its reason for denying Chute's 60(b) motion, that it\n\nlacked personal jurisdiction because Chute had never served\n\nWalker    individually       with   process.          Without    endorsing   that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\freasoning    or   reaching   the   issue,5   the   dismissal   was   still\n\nimproper because Walker waived any insufficiency of service of\n\nprocess objection when he filed an answer to the complaint and\n\na motion to dismiss without raising such an objection.\n\n            Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1) states: \"A defense of . . .\n\ninsufficiency of service of process is waived . . . if omitted\n\nfrom a motion in the circumstances described in [Rule 12](g).\"\n\nRule 12(g) states: \"If a party makes a motion under this rule\n\nbut omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to\n\nthe party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the\n\nparty shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or\n\nobjection so omitted.\"        Walker moved to dismiss under Rule\n\n12(b)(6) and omitted a Rule 12(b)(5) insufficiency of service of\n\nprocess defense, so his insufficiency of service of process\n\ndefense is waived.      See 5A C.A. Wright & A.R. Miller, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 1353, at 281 (2d ed. 1990) (\"[I]f a\n\nmotion is made asserting any of the defenses listed in Rule\n\n12(b), any objection to process must be joined in that motion or\n\nit will be deemed waived.\"); id. § 1391, at 744 (\"[I]t now is\n\n\n    5     Chute did serve Walker and no restriction was placed\non the acceptance of service.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fclear that any time defendant makes a pre-answer Rule 12 motion,\n\nhe must include, on penalty of waiver, the defenses set forth in\n\nsubdivisions (2) through (5) of Rule 12(b).\").\n\n          Walker never raised the insufficiency of process issue;\n\nonly the district court did.    We need not address whether this\n\nis ever permissible, but note that other circuits frown on it\n\nand that it was impermissible under these circumstances.6    The\n\ndistrict court noted its view that Walker did not waive his\n\nobjection, stating that Walker's motion to dismiss count three\n\nwas \"filed by the only attorney who has made an appearance for\n\nany of the defendants in this case.\"    The district court later\n\nrecognized that this was incorrect and deleted this language\n\nfrom its earlier memorandum.   The district court, however, stuck\n\n\n     6    E.g., O'Brien v. R.J.

Chute, a man of Irish descent, filed a nine-count complaint against the City of Cambridge, the city's police commissioner, and several of the city's police officers in both their individual and official capacities, alleging that defendant, officer George Walker, directed ethnic slurs toward him, hit him on the head, handcuffed him too tightly, and then falsely arrested, imprisoned, and charged him with various crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker, appearing through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss one of Chute's nine counts and an answer to Chute's complaint. On the next day, the city, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through four. Chute responded to none of these motions. Although no party moved to dismiss eight of the claims against Walker individually, the district court nonetheless dismissed Chute's complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and denied Chute's motion for relief from judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chute appeals the dismissal of seven of the nine counts, only as they apply to Walker in his individual capacity. He concedes the dismissal of two of the counts in their entirety. He also concedes the dismissal of all of the counts against Walker in his official capacity as well as the dismissal of all of the counts against all of the other defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> As to the remaining counts against Walker individually, Chute says the district court erred by, sua sponte, dismissing those counts without providing him notice or an opportunity to be heard. In addition, Chute says the district court's conclusion that all of his claims against Walker must be dismissed, because he never served Walker with process, is incorrect because Walker waived this objection. We agree that the district court erred and so we reverse the district court's dismissal of counts one, two, and five through nine of Chute's complaint, against Walker individually, and reinstate the case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, 2000, Chute filed a nine-count complaint in the district court seeking money damages against the City of Cambridge, the city's police commissioner, and several police officers, including officer Walker, in their individual and official capacities. The complaint stated that on August 7, 1997, officer Walker called Chute a \"mick bastard\" and said to him \"I'm an American, why don't you scum go back to where you came from.\" According to Chute, Walker then hit him on the head several times and, with the help of other unknown officers, falsely arrested him and used excessive force in doing so. Chute's complaint also asserted that Walker and the other unknown officers falsely charged him with \"several criminal and motor vehicle violations\" and falsely imprisoned him. According to the signed Return of Service, on August 3, 2000, a constable served the summons and complaint by handing copies to Lieutenant Walsh, who signed as an authorized agent for officer Walker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In counts one, four, and five, Chute claimed that these acts violated, in different ways, his Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under color of state law in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. In counts two and six, he also claimed that these acts constituted interference, by threat, intimidation, and coercion, with the exercise of his Massachusetts constitutional and statutory rights, in violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H and 11I (2000). In count three, he alleged a violation of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, <i>id.</i> ch. 258, and, in counts seven through nine, state tort law prohibiting assault and battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment. Counts five through eight were explicitly against Walker in his individual capacity and counts one, two, and nine might also fairly be read to assert claims against Walker individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one month later, on September 5, Walker filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss count three &#8212; Chute's state Tort Claims Act count &#8212; and an answer to the complaint. In neither filing did Walker object to the manner in which he had been served or otherwise purport to limit the appearance by his counsel. On the next day, September 6, the city, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through four and an answer to the complaint. Chute did not respond to any of these filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 2001, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint, in its entirety and with prejudice. The court based its dismissal on the official capacity defendants' September 6 motion to dismiss counts two through four, which the district court incorrectly characterized as a motion to dismiss \"all\" counts other than count one (the &#167; 1983 claim). The district court dismissed count one once it dismissed all of the other counts because it characterized count one as derivative of those other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost two weeks later, on February 28, Chute filed a motion for relief from final judgment, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), arguing (1) that Walker had never, in his individual capacity, moved to dismiss,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (2) that the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss only sought dismissal of counts two through four. Chute's counsel admitted having failed to respond to the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss, but argued that the motion did not seek dismissal of any counts against the individual capacity defendants and that it did not even seek dismissal of all counts against the city and the official capacity defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without addressing Chute's claim that no party had ever filed a motion to dismiss all counts against the individual capacity defendants, all defendants responded to Chute's 60(b) motion by arguing that Chute's counsel had not provided a legally sufficient excuse for failing to respond to the earlier-filed motions to dismiss counts two through four and count three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this time, Chute's counsel withdrew and new counsel appeared for him. Chute's new counsel, who represents him on appeal, waived the portion of Chute's 60(b) motion that sought vacation of the dismissal of the claims against the city and all official capacity defendants; he only sought vacation of the judgment dismissing counts one, two, and five through nine, against the individual capacity defendants. Counsel explained that neither Walker, nor any of the \"unknown officers,\" in their individual capacities, had ever filed a motion to dismiss these counts and that there was no basis for a sua sponte dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 2001, the district court entered an order deferring its ruling on Chute's 60(b) motion and inviting him to show good cause for relief from judgment. The district court reasoned that it properly dismissed Chute's complaint, in its entirety, because the complaint did not assert any individual capacity claims. This was not so. The district court also offered a new justification for dismissal: it said that Chute had never served Walker with process in his individual capacity and that Walker had only participated in the litigation in his official capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chute's new counsel accepted the district court's invitation to show cause and filed a memorandum stating that Chute's complaint did, in fact, assert counts against Walker individually. In response to the district court's insufficient service rationale, the memorandum noted that, contrary to the district court's June 12 conclusion, separate counsel had represented Walker in his individual capacity. Chute also explained that Walker, in his individual capacity, had not moved to dismiss the entire complaint and that Walker had waived any objection to service of process by not objecting in his answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, this time in response to Chute's memorandum to show cause, Walker advanced the inapposite argument that Chute's counsel had failed to provide a legally sufficient excuse for failing to respond to the earlier-filed motion to dismiss counts two through four. Walker argued, without ever addressing Chute's claim that no motion to dismiss all counts against Walker individually had ever been filed, and without rebutting Chute's claim that Walker had waived any service of process objection, that Chute's failure to respond to the earlier-filed motions to dismiss did not constitute excusable neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on July 30, 2001, the district court denied Chute's 60(b) motion. The district court deleted its previous conclusion that Walker had only been represented by a single attorney, but noted that Walker's attorney had never claimed that he had been authorized to represent Walker individually. The district court, in defending its dismissal of the individual capacity claims against Walker, relied on its view that Walker had never been served in his individual capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Commercial Co.,</i> 228 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint sua sponte. The complaint set out nine counts against several different defendants. Among these counts were several counts against Walker in his individual capacity. Neither Walker nor anybody else ever moved to dismiss all nine counts. Nevertheless, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint, in its entirety and with prejudice,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> based on the official capacity defendants' September 6 motion to dismiss counts two through four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the district court's conclusion, Chute did sue Walker in his individual capacity. Chute's complaint stated, at least thirteen separate times, including twice in the complaint's caption, that Chute was suing Walker and other unknown officers \"individually\" or in their \"individual capacities.\" Nevertheless, the district court incorrectly concluded that its \"interpretation of the original complaint as one making only official-capacity claims was reasonable\" and noted that \"[t]he City of Cambridge, under that interpretation, was the only defendant.\" Chute sued Walker individually, and the City of Cambridge was not the only defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, no party moved to dismiss the entire complaint. Walker filed a motion to dismiss count three and the city, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through four. Based on the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss counts two through four, which the district court characterized as a motion to dismiss \"all\" counts (other than the &#167; 1983 count), the district court dismissed the entire complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chute grants that he never responded to these two motions to dismiss and concedes the dismissal of all counts against the city and the official capacity defendants, and count three against Walker. He also relinquishes count four against Walker. He only seeks reinstatement of counts one, two, and five through nine against Walker individually because, he says, these counts were improperly dismissed. Chute claims that these counts were dismissed sua sponte and without any notice or opportunity for him to be heard; no defendant moved to dismiss the entire complaint and so he was caught by surprise when the district court dismissed. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Sua sponte dismissals are strong medicine, and should be dispensed sparingly.\" <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States,</i> 257 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir.2001). The general rule is that \"in limited circumstances, sua sponte dismissals of complaints under Rule 12(b)(6) ... are appropriate,\" but that \"such dismissals are erroneous unless the parties have been afforded notice and an opportunity to amend the complaint or otherwise respond.\" <i>Futura Dev. of P.R., Inc. v. Estado Libre Asociado de P.R.,</i> 144 F.3d 7, 13-14 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also Carparts Distrib. Ctr., Inc. v. Auto. Wholesaler's Assoc. of New England, Inc.,</i> 37 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This does not mean ... that every sua sponte dismissal entered without prior notice to the plaintiff automatically must be reversed. If it is crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would be futile, then a sua sponte dismissal may stand.\" <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> 257 F.3d at 37; <i>see also Clorox,</i> 228 F.3d at 30 (noting \"limited exceptions to the general rule barring dismissal without notice\"); <i>accord Curley v. Perry,</i> 246 F.3d 1278 (10th Cir.2001). The party defending the dismissal must show that \"the allegations contained in the complaint, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption.\" <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> 257 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without expressing any further opinion of the merits of Chute's complaint, we conclude that counts one, two, and five through nine, against Walker individually, are not \"patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, it was error to dismiss these counts sua sponte and without notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not end the matter because the district court stated, as its reason for denying Chute's 60(b) motion, that it lacked personal jurisdiction because Chute had never served Walker individually with process. Without endorsing that reasoning or reaching the issue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the dismissal was still improper because Walker waived any insufficiency of service of process objection when he filed an answer to the complaint and a motion to dismiss without raising such an objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1) states: \"A defense of ... insufficiency of service of process is waived ... if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in [Rule 12](g).\" Rule 12(g) states: \"If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted.\" Walker moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and omitted a Rule 12(b)(5) insufficiency of service of process defense, so his insufficiency of service of process defense is waived. <i>See</i> 5A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1353, at 281 (2d ed. 1990) (\"[I]f a motion is made asserting any of the defenses listed in Rule 12(b), any objection to process must be joined in that motion or it will be deemed waived.\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1391, at 744 (\"[I]t now is clear that any time defendant makes a pre-answer Rule 12 motion, he must include, on penalty of waiver, the defenses set forth in subdivisions (2) through (5) of Rule 12(b).\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker never raised the insufficiency of process issue; only the district court did. We need not address whether this is ever permissible, but note that other circuits frown on it and that it was impermissible under these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court noted its view that Walker did not waive his objection, stating that Walker's motion to dismiss count three was \"filed by the only attorney who has made an appearance for any of the defendants in this case.\" The district court later recognized that this was incorrect and deleted this language from its earlier memorandum. The district court, however, stuck to its rationale that attorney Urbelis had never represented Walker individually. This too was incorrect. The defendants' opposition to Chute's 60(b) motion was filed by both Schlacter, for the official capacity defendants, and Urbelis, explicitly stating that he represented Walker \"In His Individual Capacity.\" Therefore, Walker waived his service of process objection when he did not include it in his 12(b) motion to dismiss and the district court could not have resurrected it for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the district court erroneously dismissed Chute's complaint, sua sponte and without providing Chute notice or an opportunity to be heard, when it dismissed all counts even though no defendant ever moved for such a dismissal. The district court committed further error when it denied Chute's 60(b) motion, relying on insufficient service of process, because Walker waived such an objection when he filed a 12(b)(6) motion that did not include any mention of insufficient service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's dismissal of counts one, two, and five through nine of Chute's complaint, against Walker individually, is <i>reversed</i> and the case is <i>reinstated</i> for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On October 19, 2001, this court granted the official capacity defendants' unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal naming them, and dismissed the appeal except for Chute's appeal of the dismissal of the action against defendant Walker in his individual capacity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> About two weeks later, Chute amended his 60(b) motion, conceding that Walker had filed a motion to dismiss count three (Chute's Tort Claims Act count) only, but continuing to insist that no defendant had sought dismissal of all counts against the individual capacity defendants.

Chute, a man of Irish descent, filed a nine-count complaint against the City of Cambridge, the city's police commissioner, and several of the city's police officers in both their individual and official capacities, alleging that defendant, officer George Walker, directed ethnic slurs toward him, hit him on the head, handcuffed him too tightly, and then falsely arrested, imprisoned, and charged him with various crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker, appearing through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss one of Chute's nine counts and an answer to Chute's complaint. On the next day, the city, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through four. Chute responded to none of these motions. Although no party moved to dismiss eight of the claims against Walker individually, the district court nonetheless dismissed Chute's complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and denied Chute's motion for relief from judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chute appeals the dismissal of seven of the nine counts, only as they apply to Walker in his individual capacity. He concedes the dismissal of two of the counts in their entirety. He also concedes the dismissal of all of the counts against Walker in his official capacity as well as the dismissal of all of the counts against all of the other defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> As to the remaining counts against Walker individually, Chute says the district court erred by, sua sponte, dismissing those counts without providing him notice or an opportunity to be heard. In addition, Chute says the district court's conclusion that all of his claims against Walker must be dismissed, because he never served Walker with process, is incorrect because Walker waived this objection. We agree that the district court erred and so we reverse the district court's dismissal of counts one, two, and five through nine of Chute's complaint, against Walker individually, and reinstate the case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, 2000, Chute filed a nine-count complaint in the district court seeking money damages against the City of Cambridge, the city's police commissioner, and several police officers, including officer Walker, in their individual and official capacities. The complaint stated that on August 7, 1997, officer Walker called Chute a \"mick bastard\" and said to him \"I'm an American, why don't you scum go back to where you came from.\" According to Chute, Walker then hit him on the head several times and, with the help of other unknown officers, falsely arrested him and used excessive force in doing so. Chute's complaint also asserted that Walker and the other unknown officers falsely charged him with \"several criminal and motor vehicle violations\" and falsely imprisoned him. According to the signed Return of Service, on August 3, 2000, a constable served the summons and complaint by handing copies to Lieutenant Walsh, who signed as an authorized agent for officer Walker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In counts one, four, and five, Chute claimed that these acts violated, in different ways, his Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under color of state law in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. In counts two and six, he also claimed that these acts constituted interference, by threat, intimidation, and coercion, with the exercise of his Massachusetts constitutional and statutory rights, in violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167;&#167; 11H and 11I (2000). In count three, he alleged a violation of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, <i>id.</i> ch. 258, and, in counts seven through nine, state tort law prohibiting assault and battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment. Counts five through eight were explicitly against Walker in his individual capacity and counts one, two, and nine might also fairly be read to assert claims against Walker individually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one month later, on September 5, Walker filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss count three &#8212; Chute's state Tort Claims Act count &#8212; and an answer to the complaint. In neither filing did Walker object to the manner in which he had been served or otherwise purport to limit the appearance by his counsel. On the next day, September 6, the city, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through four and an answer to the complaint. Chute did not respond to any of these filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 2001, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint, in its entirety and with prejudice. The court based its dismissal on the official capacity defendants' September 6 motion to dismiss counts two through four, which the district court incorrectly characterized as a motion to dismiss \"all\" counts other than count one (the &#167; 1983 claim). The district court dismissed count one once it dismissed all of the other counts because it characterized count one as derivative of those other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost two weeks later, on February 28, Chute filed a motion for relief from final judgment, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), arguing (1) that Walker had never, in his individual capacity, moved to dismiss,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (2) that the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss only sought dismissal of counts two through four. Chute's counsel admitted having failed to respond to the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss, but argued that the motion did not seek dismissal of any counts against the individual capacity defendants and that it did not even seek dismissal of all counts against the city and the official capacity defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without addressing Chute's claim that no party had ever filed a motion to dismiss all counts against the individual capacity defendants, all defendants responded to Chute's 60(b) motion by arguing that Chute's counsel had not provided a legally sufficient excuse for failing to respond to the earlier-filed motions to dismiss counts two through four and count three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this time, Chute's counsel withdrew and new counsel appeared for him. Chute's new counsel, who represents him on appeal, waived the portion of Chute's 60(b) motion that sought vacation of the dismissal of the claims against the city and all official capacity defendants; he only sought vacation of the judgment dismissing counts one, two, and five through nine, against the individual capacity defendants. Counsel explained that neither Walker, nor any of the \"unknown officers,\" in their individual capacities, had ever filed a motion to dismiss these counts and that there was no basis for a sua sponte dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 2001, the district court entered an order deferring its ruling on Chute's 60(b) motion and inviting him to show good cause for relief from judgment. The district court reasoned that it properly dismissed Chute's complaint, in its entirety, because the complaint did not assert any individual capacity claims. This was not so. The district court also offered a new justification for dismissal: it said that Chute had never served Walker with process in his individual capacity and that Walker had only participated in the litigation in his official capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chute's new counsel accepted the district court's invitation to show cause and filed a memorandum stating that Chute's complaint did, in fact, assert counts against Walker individually. In response to the district court's insufficient service rationale, the memorandum noted that, contrary to the district court's June 12 conclusion, separate counsel had represented Walker in his individual capacity. Chute also explained that Walker, in his individual capacity, had not moved to dismiss the entire complaint and that Walker had waived any objection to service of process by not objecting in his answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, this time in response to Chute's memorandum to show cause, Walker advanced the inapposite argument that Chute's counsel had failed to provide a legally sufficient excuse for failing to respond to the earlier-filed motion to dismiss counts two through four. Walker argued, without ever addressing Chute's claim that no motion to dismiss all counts against Walker individually had ever been filed, and without rebutting Chute's claim that Walker had waived any service of process objection, that Chute's failure to respond to the earlier-filed motions to dismiss did not constitute excusable neglect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on July 30, 2001, the district court denied Chute's 60(b) motion. The district court deleted its previous conclusion that Walker had only been represented by a single attorney, but noted that Walker's attorney had never claimed that he had been authorized to represent Walker individually. The district court, in defending its dismissal of the individual capacity claims against Walker, relied on its view that Walker had never been served in his individual capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Clorox Co. P.R. v.

The complaint set out nine counts against several different defendants. Among these counts were several counts against Walker in his individual capacity. Neither Walker nor anybody else ever moved to dismiss all nine counts. Nevertheless, the district court dismissed Chute's complaint, in its entirety and with prejudice,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> based on the official capacity defendants' September 6 motion to dismiss counts two through four.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the district court's conclusion, Chute did sue Walker in his individual capacity. Chute's complaint stated, at least thirteen separate times, including twice in the complaint's caption, that Chute was suing Walker and other unknown officers \"individually\" or in their \"individual capacities.\" Nevertheless, the district court incorrectly concluded that its \"interpretation of the original complaint as one making only official-capacity claims was reasonable\" and noted that \"[t]he City of Cambridge, under that interpretation, was the only defendant.\" Chute sued Walker individually, and the City of Cambridge was not the only defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, no party moved to dismiss the entire complaint. Walker filed a motion to dismiss count three and the city, and all of the other defendants, including Walker, in their official capacities only, filed a motion to dismiss counts two through four. Based on the official capacity defendants' motion to dismiss counts two through four, which the district court characterized as a motion to dismiss \"all\" counts (other than the &#167; 1983 count), the district court dismissed the entire complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chute grants that he never responded to these two motions to dismiss and concedes the dismissal of all counts against the city and the official capacity defendants, and count three against Walker. He also relinquishes count four against Walker. He only seeks reinstatement of counts one, two, and five through nine against Walker individually because, he says, these counts were improperly dismissed. Chute claims that these counts were dismissed sua sponte and without any notice or opportunity for him to be heard; no defendant moved to dismiss the entire complaint and so he was caught by surprise when the district court dismissed. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Sua sponte dismissals are strong medicine, and should be dispensed sparingly.\" <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez v.

The party defending the dismissal must show that \"the allegations contained in the complaint, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption.\" <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> 257 F.3d at 37.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without expressing any further opinion of the merits of Chute's complaint, we conclude that counts one, two, and five through nine, against Walker individually, are not \"patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, it was error to dismiss these counts sua sponte and without notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not end the matter because the district court stated, as its reason for denying Chute's 60(b) motion, that it lacked personal jurisdiction because Chute had never served Walker individually with process. Without endorsing that reasoning or reaching the issue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the dismissal was still improper because Walker waived any insufficiency of service of process objection when he filed an answer to the complaint and a motion to dismiss without raising such an objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(1) states: \"A defense of ... insufficiency of service of process is waived ... if omitted from a motion in the circumstances described in [Rule 12](g).\" Rule 12(g) states: \"If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to the party which this rule permits to be raised by motion, the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted.\" Walker moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and omitted a Rule 12(b)(5) insufficiency of service of process defense, so his insufficiency of service of process defense is waived. <i>See</i> 5A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1353, at 281 (2d ed. 1990) (\"[I]f a motion is made asserting any of the defenses listed in Rule 12(b), any objection to process must be joined in that motion or it will be deemed waived.\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1391, at 744 (\"[I]t now is clear that any time defendant makes a pre-answer Rule 12 motion, he must include, on penalty of waiver, the defenses set forth in subdivisions (2) through (5) of Rule 12(b).\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Walker never raised the insufficiency of process issue; only the district court did. We need not address whether this is ever permissible, but note that other circuits frown on it and that it was impermissible under these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court noted its view that Walker did not waive his objection, stating that Walker's motion to dismiss count three was \"filed by the only attorney who has made an appearance for any of the defendants in this case.\" The district court later recognized that this was incorrect and deleted this language from its earlier memorandum. The district court, however, stuck to its rationale that attorney Urbelis had never represented Walker individually. This too was incorrect. The defendants' opposition to Chute's 60(b) motion was filed by both Schlacter, for the official capacity defendants, and Urbelis, explicitly stating that he represented Walker \"In His Individual Capacity.\" Therefore, Walker waived his service of process objection when he did not include it in his 12(b) motion to dismiss and the district court could not have resurrected it for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the district court erroneously dismissed Chute's complaint, sua sponte and without providing Chute notice or an opportunity to be heard, when it dismissed all counts even though no defendant ever moved for such a dismissal. The district court committed further error when it denied Chute's 60(b) motion, relying on insufficient service of process, because Walker waived such an objection when he filed a 12(b)(6) motion that did not include any mention of insufficient service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's dismissal of counts one, two, and five through nine of Chute's complaint, against Walker individually, is <i>reversed</i> and the case is <i>reinstated</i> for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On October 19, 2001, this court granted the official capacity defendants' unopposed motion to dismiss the appeal naming them, and dismissed the appeal except for Chute's appeal of the dismissal of the action against defendant Walker in his individual capacity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> About two weeks later, Chute amended his 60(b) motion, conceding that Walker had filed a motion to dismiss count three (Chute's Tort Claims Act count) only, but continuing to insist that no defendant had sought dismissal of all counts against the individual capacity defendants.
