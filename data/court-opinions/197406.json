(Fullerton)  appeals  from  a\r\n\ndistrict court order dismissing its third-party complaint against\r\n\nCustom Metal Spinning  Corporation (CMSC) for want of in personam\r                                                                           \r\n\njurisdiction.1   Using the  parlance of  the trade,  Fullerton is\r\n\nspinning its wheels.\r\n\n          This  case  had  its genesis  in  or  before 1989  when\r\n\nErnesto Alers  Rodriguez (Rodriguez), a resident  of Puerto Rico,\r\n\npurchased two sand track tires from a Puerto Rican dealer who had\r\n\nseen the tires advertised in a pamphlet distributed by  Fullerton\r\n\nand had ordered a supply of them.  Some five years later, one  of\r\n\nthe  purchased tires  exploded  while being  inflated.   The  rim\r\n\nsnapped, severely injuring Rodriguez.\r\n\n          Invoking  diversity  jurisdiction,  28  U.S.C.     1332\r\n\n(1994),  Rodriguez  sued  Fullerton   in  Puerto  Rico's  federal\r\n\ndistrict court.  Fullerton  filed a third-party complaint against\r\n\nCMSC  (the manufacturer of the rim used in Fullerton's sand track\r\n\ntires).  In due course, CMSC moved to dismiss the claim, alleging\r\n\nlack of personal  jurisdiction.   See Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12(b)(2).\r                                               \r\n\nThe  court obliged.  Rodriguez  v. Fullerton Tires  Corp., 937 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp.  122 (D.P.R. 1996).  After the court certified the judgment\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Fullerton Tires, Inc., an affiliated corporation, joined in\r\nfiling the third-party complaint.  That pleading named CMSC;  its\r\nprincipals, Walter and Marianne Jenkins; and other individuals in\r\nprivity with  them as  third-party defendants.   For simplicity's\r\nsake,  we treat the  appeal as  if only  Fullerton and  CMSC were\r\nparties.  Because the jurisdictional argument is weaker as to the\r\nindividuals, our  decision disposes completely  of the  Fullerton\r\nentities' attempts to sue CMSC and its privies in Puerto Rico.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nin accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), this appeal ensued.\r\n\n          We  need  not linger.    The  district court's  opinion\r\n\ncaptures  the essence  of  the case  and applies  the controlling\r\n\nlegal  principles in an irreproachable  manner.  Hence, we affirm\r\n\nthe judgment primarily on the basis of the opinion below.  We add\r\n\nsix comments.\r\n\n          First:     Fullerton   bemoans  the   district  court's\r                    First:\r                         \r\n\ntreatment of CMSC's  motion to  dismiss as a  motion for  summary\r\n\njudgment.  We are unmoved by this jeremiad.\r\n\n          Motions to dismiss come under the aegis of Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP. 12(b).  The rule states that  if \"matters outside the pleading\r\n\nare  presented to and  not excluded by  the court, the  [Rule 12]\r\n\nmotion  shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed\r\n\nof  as provided in  Rule 56.\"  The  proper approach to conversion\r\n\nunder  this rule is functional rather than mechanical.  See Vega-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodriguez v.  Puerto Rico Tel. Co.,  110 F.3d 174, 177  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1997); Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n15,  18-19 (1st  Cir. 1992).   Here, CMSC attached  to its motion\r\n\nseveral declarations ostensibly made under penalties of  perjury.\r\n\nGiven the specific language of Rule 12(b), the inclusion of these\r\n\nmaterials with the motion  put the nonmovant, Fullerton, squarely\r\n\non notice that the court had the option of treating the motion as\r\n\none for summary judgment.\r\n\n          Of course,  a motion  cannot be  converted  to one  for\r\n\nsummary judgment  unless the  adverse party is  given \"reasonable\r\n\nopportunity  to present  all material  made  pertinent to  such a\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nmotion by Rule 56.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).  Here, however, that\r\n\nrequirement was satisfied.  CMSC  filed its dispositive motion on\r\n\nApril 29, 1996.  Fullerton did not file its opposition until July\r\n\n10,  1996.  During that  interval Fullerton, had  it chosen to do\r\n\nso, could have served counter-affidavits, made other  evidentiary\r\n\nsubmissions,  or sought leave to defer its response to the motion\r\n\nuntil it had conducted jurisdictional discovery.  It pursued none\r\n\nof these  alternatives.   Instead, it filed  an opposition  which\r\n\ntried  to meet  the  motion head-on.    The district  court  then\r\n\nconsidered  the  declarations   in  its   determination  of   the\r\n\njurisdictional issue.   See  Rodriguez, 937  F. Supp.  at 124-25.\r                                                \r\n\nSince  Fullerton  had  ample  opportunity  to  present  pertinent\r\n\nmaterials  in  opposition  to  CMSC's  motion,  as  well  as  the\r\n\nincentive to do so,  we think that the court  acted appropriately\r\n\nin  impliedly  converting  the motion  to  a  motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.   See American Express Int'l,  Inc. v. Mendez-Capellan,\r                                                                          \r\n\n889  F.2d 1175, 1178 (1st  Cir. 1989) (finding  that the district\r\n\ncourt's conversion  of a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to a Rule 56 motion\r\n\nwas proper); see also Vega-Rodriguez, 110 F.3d at 177 (explaining\r                                              \r\n\nthat  when extrinsic  materials  are proffered  and are  actually\r\n\nconsidered by the nisi prius court, conversion is proper).\r\n\n          To  be sure,  we  can envision  circumstances in  which\r\n\nfairness might  require  special notice  of a  court's intent  to\r\n\nexercise the  conversion privilege.  See, e.g., Ohio v. Peterson,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLowry,  Rall,  Barber &amp;  Ross, 585  F.2d  454, 455-57  (10th Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1978).   But this  is not such  a situation.   The district court\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nnever  indicated that  it  would eschew  conversion or  otherwise\r\n\nrefuse  to  consider  the  proffered  exhibits.    Moreover,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court continued to apply the  prima facie standard, see\r                                                                           \r\n\ninfra, not  some more  grueling standard  indigenous to Rule  56.\r               \r\n\nLast, but not  least, Fullerton  to this day  does not  challenge\r\n\nCMSC's  account  of  the  relevant  circumstances,  but,  rather,\r\n\nattacks the  legal significance of certain  facts without seeking\r\n\nto contradict  them.   Consequently, the application  of Rule  56\r\n\nproduced no perceptible unfairness here.\r\n\n          Second:  It is the plaintiff's burden to establish that\r                    Second:\r                          \r\n\nthe  forum court  has jurisdiction  over the  person of  the sued\r\n\ndefendant.  See Sawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381, 1387 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995); Foster-Miller, Inc.  v. Babcock &amp;  Wilcox Canada, 46  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n138,  145 (1st Cir.  1995).  There  are several  standards that a\r\n\ncourt  can use  in determining  whether the exercise  of personal\r\n\njurisdiction is lawful.  These include  the prima facie standard,\r\n\nthe  preponderance standard,  and the  likelihood standard.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBoit  v. Gar-Tec  Prods., Inc.,  967 F.2d  671, 675-78  (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1992).    We  have no  occasion  today  to  delineate either  the\r\n\ndifferences among  these approaches  or  the considerations  that\r\n\ninfluence a  court's  choice  to  use one  standard  rather  than\r\n\nanother at a particular stage of the litigation.\r\n\n          For present purposes, it suffices to say that the least\r\n\ntaxing of  these standards from a plaintiff's standpoint, and the\r\n\none  most commonly employed in the early stages of litigation, is\r\n\nthe prima  facie standard.  Under it, a suitor, in order to stave\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\noff defeat, \"must  make the showing as to  every fact required to\r\n\nsatisfy both  the forum's  long-arm statute  and the  due process\r\n\nclause of the Constitution.\"   Id. at 675 (citation  and internal\r                                            \r\n\nquotation marks  omitted).    When it  employs  the  prima  facie\r\n\nstandard, a district  court does not act as a  factfinder; to the\r\n\ncontrary, it  ascertains only  whether the facts  duly proffered,\r\n\nfully credited,  support the  exercise of personal  jurisdiction.\r\n\nSee  id.  Because this is a quintessentially legal determination,\r                  \r\n\nappellate  review is  plenary.   See  Ticketmaster-N.Y., Inc.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nAlioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                \r\n\n          In the  case at  hand, the  district court  purposed to\r\n\napply the prima facie  standard and made a determination  that it\r\n\ndid  not have in personam jurisdiction over CMSC.  See Rodriguez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n937 F.  Supp.  at 124-25.   Citing  Foster-Miller, the  appellant\r                                                           \r\n\ncomplains  that the court erred because it failed to give advance\r\n\nnotice as  to which of  the three  standards it would  utilize in\r\n\nresolving the jurisdictional issue.\r\n\n          This protest  distorts the rationale  of Foster-Miller.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThere,  we vacated  a  dismissal  when  the trial  court,  having\r                                                                           \r\n\nadvised counsel  that it  would apply  the prima  facie standard,\r                                                                          \r\n\nshifted  gears  without  warning  and  applied  a  more  rigorous\r\n\nstandard.  46 F.3d at 143.  We said in that context that  a trial\r                                                             \r\n\ncourt  should \"alert  the  parties in  advance  to the  level  of\r\n\nscrutiny  that it will apply to the pending motion [to dismiss].\"\r\n\nId. at 151.\r             \r\n\n          But the instant  case is at a considerable  remove from\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nFoster-Miller.   Here, the  signals remained constant;  the court\r                       \r\n\nsteered  a steady  course and  forthrightly applied  the baseline\r\n\nstandard.   We  believe  that all  litigants  effectively are  on\r\n\nnotice that motions  to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction\r\n\nwill  be adjudicated under  the prima  facie standard  unless the\r                                                                       \r\n\ncourt informs them in advance that it will apply a more demanding\r\n\ntest.  Thus, the court below was under no obligation  to give the\r\n\nappellant special notice that it would conduct business as usual,\r\n\nany  more  than a  court,  before passing  upon  a  motion for  a\r\n\ndirected verdict,  would have  to  give advance  warning that  it\r\n\nintended to apply the customary complex of legal rules.\r\n\n          The  appellant  tries  to  avoid  this  conclusion   by\r\n\ninsisting  that the  lower  court, despite  using the  vocabulary\r\n\nassociated  with prima  facie showings,  actually required  it to\r\n\npass a higher level of scrutiny.2   Were the court guilty of such\r\n\ntergiversation, the appellant would  have a legitimate grievance.\r\n\nSee Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 150-51.\r                           \r\n\n          But the accusation  here is merely bombast;  we find no\r\n\nsupport for it  in the lower court's opinion or  elsewhere in the\r\n\nrecord.    CMSC's  assertions  anent  jurisdictional  facts  were\r\n\nbuttressed by  declarations made on personal knowledge; Fullerton\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In Boit, we noted that \"an opinion using the terminology of\r                       \r\n`prima facie'  showing may fairly be read as requiring a bit more\r\n  e.g.,  that the plaintiff present plausible evidence tending to\r                \r\nshow that the court has jurisdiction.\"  Boit, 967 F.2d at 675 n.2\r                                                      \r\n(citation and internal quotation  marks omitted).  To  the extent\r\n(if  any) that Judge Casellas' opinion  falls into this category,\r\nwe do not deem  it to have deviated in any  material way from the\r\nprima facie standard.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ndid  nothing to  rebut or dispute  these facts,  despite abundant\r\n\ntime  to do  so; and  the lower  court therefore  had  the right,\r\n\nconsistent  with the prima facie standard, to take these facts as\r\n\ntrue.  The court's opinion plainly indicates that it reviewed the\r\n\nmaterials  presented  and  passed  upon  them  without   essaying\r\n\ncredibility  judgments,  resolving   evidentiary  conflicts,   or\r\n\notherwise  making findings of fact.  See, e.g., Rodriguez, 937 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at 124-25.   In short, Fullerton's claim that  the district\r\n\ncourt  surreptitiously   applied  a  more  stringent   degree  of\r\n\nperscrutation than that typically associated with the prima facie\r\n\nstandard is totally unsubstantiated.\r\n\n          Third:   Taking as true  the specific averments  of the\r                    Third:\r                         \r\n\nthird-party   complaint,  as  supplemented  by  the  declarations\r\n\nattached to CMSC's motion, the factual scenario is not in serious\r\n\ndispute.   CMSC sold rims to Fullerton (presumably in California,\r\n\nwhere both corporations  maintained their headquarters),  knowing\r\n\nthat Fullerton would  incorporate them into tires and  offer them\r\n\nfor  sale in distant markets.  Fullerton, in turn, sent brochures\r\n\nto  Puerto  Rico  among  other  places,  advertised  in  national\r\n\npublications which  were disseminated  in  the Commonwealth,  and\r\n\nfilled  orders  emanating  from  there.    The  record  confirms,\r\n\nhowever, that CMSC  never conducted any  business in Puerto  Rico\r\n\n(either  directly  or  through  agents),  never  applied  for  or\r\n\nobtained  authorization to  do business  there, and  never owned,\r\n\nleased,  or otherwise  used an  office or  other property  in the\r\n\nCommonwealth.   Based on  these facts, the  district court  found\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthat  CMSC was not amenable to suit  in Puerto Rico.3  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n128.\r\n\n          In this venue, Fullerton argues, as it did  below, that\r\n\nCMSC, by  placing  its  product into  the  stream  of  interstate\r\n\ncommerce,  transacted  business  in  Puerto  Rico  sufficient  to\r\n\nsatisfy the minimum contacts requirement.  This argument will not\r\n\nwash.   In Asahi Metal Indus.  Co. v. Superior Ct.,  480 U.S. 102\r                                                            \r\n\n(1987), the Supreme Court  held that the \"placement of  a product\r\n\ninto the stream  of commerce, without more, is not  an act of the\r\n\ndefendant  purposefully  directed toward  the forum  State,\" and,\r\n\nthus,   is  insufficient   to   support  a   claim  of   personal\r\n\njurisdiction.   Id. at 112  (plurality opinion).   Even  assuming\r                             \r\n\nthat  CMSC had  specific knowledge  that the  stream  of commerce\r\n\nwould move  its tire rims into Puerto Rico   and there is neither\r\n\nevidence  nor allegation  to that  effect   this  awareness alone\r\n\nwould not be enough to constitute  the purposeful availment which\r\n\nis necessary for a showing  of minimum contacts.

See Rodriguez,\r                                                                          \r\n937 F.  Supp. at 124.  Although we agree with both aspects of the\r\ndistrict  court's holding,  we  couch our  ensuing discussion  in\r\nterms of the constitutional requirement.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nmarks  for ingenuity, but otherwise  rates a failing  grade.  The\r\n\nargument features a suggestion that the specific nature of CMSC's\r\n\nproduct   tire rims designed for use with sand track tires   made\r\n\nit  foreseeable that  CMSC could  be amenable  to suit  in Puerto\r\n\nRico,  an  island  ecosystem  containing an  abundance  of  sandy\r\n\nbeaches  ideal for  dune buggies  and other  sandworthy vehicles.\r\n\nThis argument proves too much.\r\n\n          Sand, a  loose granular material that  results from the\r\n\ndisintegration  of  rocks,  consists of  particles  smaller  than\r\n\ngravel  but larger than silt.   The earth's  land mass (excluding\r\n\nthe ice  caps of  Greenland and  Antarctica) totals  32.1 billion\r\n\nacres.   See  Richard  Jackson  &amp; Lloyd  Hudman,  World  Regional\r                                                                           \r\n\nGeography  50 (2d  ed. 1986).   This  total includes  4.2 billion\r                   \r\n\nacres of desert and 1.7 billion acres of soil comprised primarily\r\n\nof  sand.  See id.  at 51.   Put another way, roughly  18% of the\r                            \r\n\nworld's land surface is covered with sand.4\r\n\n          Subjecting a manufacturer to suit in Puerto Rico merely\r\n\nbecause its  product is designed for use in sand would offend the\r\n\nconstitutional  principles  that  limit  a  state's  authority to\r\n\nexercise jurisdiction.   Under such  a regime, a  manufacturer of\r\n\nlife  preservers automatically would be subject  to suit in every\r\n\njurisdiction  whose  boundaries included  an  ocean,  a river,  a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4This  figure is not static  as many of  the world's regions\r\nare experiencing desertification, a process commonly described as\r\nthe slow encroachment of fertile lands by arid  soils.  See David\r                                                                     \r\nHastings, GIS  Techniques Using  NOAA Data Improve  Monitoring of\r                                                                           \r\nDesertification (visited May 12, 1997) <http:                >          seg/globsys/gisdes.html&gt;.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nstream, a lake, a pond, or a swimming pool.

See Asahi, 480 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n109-12  (imposing  reasonableness   requirement  in  respect   to\r\n\nforeseeability).\r\n\n          Fifth:    Following  the  granting  of  CMSC's  motion,\r                    Fifth:\r                         \r\n\nFullerton  sought  reconsideration,  Fed.   R.  Civ.  P.   59(e),\r\n\nproffering a  copy of a  Dun and  Bradstreet credit report.   The\r\n\ndistrict court refused reconsideration,  and Fullerton asks us to\r\n\nreverse this ruling.  This ground of appeal lacks force.\r\n\n          A district court's ruling on  a motion to reconsider is\r\n\nreviewable only for  abuse of  discretion.  See  Cotto v.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 993 F.2d  274, 277  (1st Cir. 1993);  Appeal of Sun  Pipe\r                                                                           \r\n\nLine Co.,  831 F.2d 22, 25  (1st Cir. 1987).   The \"new\" document\r                  \r\n\nthat Fullerton proffered   the Dun and Bradstreet report   hardly\r\n\nqualifies  as newly  discovered evidence.   More  importantly, it\r\n\nindicates only that  CMSC serves a market comprising  the \"United\r\n\nStates, primarily  California.\"    That sort of  broad generality\r\n\nhas very little bearing on whether a defendant's activities  have\r\n\nbeen  directed  to  a  particular  place  in  a  jurisdictionally\r\n\nsignificant fashion.\r\n\n          In essence, then, the belatedly proffered report did no\r\n\nmore than confirm what the court already knew   that CMSC  placed\r\n\nits  product into the stream of interstate commerce.  Under these\r\n\ncircumstances,  the  court's  rejection  of the  motion  did  not\r\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n          Sixth:  The appellant's motion for reconsideration also\r                    Sixth:\r                         \r\n\nrequested  that the lower court  delay the entry  of judgment and\r\n\npermit  discovery on  the  jurisdictional issue.   This  request,\r\n\nwhich  had  not been  made earlier,  was  untimely.5   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nWhittaker  Corp. v.

Therefore,  the district court did  not err in\r\n\ndeclining to honor it.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Fullerton entered  its appearance in the  district court on\r\nMarch  27, 1995.  It brought a third-party complaint against CMSC\r\non December 27, 1995.  CMSC did not file its Rule 12(b)(2) motion\r\nuntil April of 1996 and Fullerton did not respond until July.  As\r\nthis timetable  illustrates, the appellant had  ample opportunity\r\nto initiate discovery before the district court acted upon CMSC's\r\nmotion.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n</http:>\n",

(Fullerton) appeals from a district court order dismissing its third-party complaint against Custom Metal Spinning Corporation (CMSC) for want of in personam jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Using the parlance of the trade, Fullerton is spinning its wheels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case had its genesis in or before 1989 when Ernesto Alers Rodriguez (Rodriguez), a resident of Puerto Rico, purchased two sand track tires from a Puerto Rican dealer who had seen the tires advertised in a pamphlet distributed by Fullerton and had ordered a supply of them.  Some five years later, one of the purchased tires exploded while being inflated.  The rim snapped, severely injuring Rodriguez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (1994), Rodriguez sued Fullerton in Puerto Rico's federal district court.  Fullerton filed a third-party complaint against CMSC (the manufacturer of the rim used in Fullerton's sand track tires).  In due course, CMSC moved to dismiss the claim, alleging lack of personal jurisdiction.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2).  The court obliged.  Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., 937 F.Supp. 122 (D.P.R.1996).  After the court certified the judgment in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger.  The district court's opinion captures the essence of the case and applies the controlling legal principles in an irreproachable manner.  Hence, we affirm the judgment primarily on the basis of the opinion below.  We add six comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  Fullerton bemoans the district court's treatment of CMSC's motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.  We are unmoved by this jeremiad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motions to dismiss come under the aegis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  The rule states that if \"matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the [Rule 12] motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\"   The proper approach to conversion under this rule is functional rather than mechanical.  See Vega-Rodriguez v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 110 F.3d 174, 177 (1st Cir.1997);  Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.1992).  Here, CMSC attached to its motion several declarations ostensibly made under penalties of perjury.  Given the specific language of Rule 12(b), the inclusion of these materials with the motion put the nonmovant, Fullerton, squarely on notice that the court had the option of treating the motion as one for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a motion cannot be converted to one for summary judgment unless the adverse party is given \"reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  Here, however, that requirement was satisfied.  CMSC filed its dispositive motion on April 29, 1996.  Fullerton did not file its opposition until July 10, 1996.  During that interval Fullerton, had it chosen to do so, could have served counter-affidavits, made other evidentiary submissions, or sought leave to defer its response to the motion until it had conducted jurisdictional discovery.  It pursued none of these alternatives.  Instead, it filed an opposition which tried to meet the motion head-on.  The district court then considered the declarations in its determination of the jurisdictional issue.  See Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124-25.   Since Fullerton had ample opportunity to present pertinent materials in opposition to CMSC's motion, as well as the incentive to do so, we think that the court acted appropriately in impliedly converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment.  See American Express Int'l, Inc. v. Mendez-Capellan, 889 F.2d 1175, 1178 (1st Cir.1989) (finding that the district court's conversion of a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to a Rule 56 motion was proper);  see also Vega-Rodriguez, 110 F.3d at 177 (explaining that when extrinsic materials are proffered and are actually considered by the nisi prius court, conversion is proper).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we can envision circumstances in which fairness might require special notice of a court's intent to exercise the conversion privilege.  See, e.g., Ohio v. Peterson, Lowry, Rall, Barber &amp; Ross, 585 F.2d 454, 455-57 (10th Cir.1978).  But this is not such a situation.  The district court never indicated that it would eschew conversion or otherwise refuse to consider the proffered exhibits.  Moreover, the district court continued to apply the prima facie standard, see infra, not some more grueling standard indigenous to Rule 56.  Last, but not least, Fullerton to this day does not challenge CMSC's account of the relevant circumstances, but, rather, attacks the legal significance of certain facts without seeking to contradict them.  Consequently, the application of Rule 56 produced no perceptible unfairness here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  It is the plaintiff's burden to establish that the forum court has jurisdiction over the person of the sued defendant.  See Sawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d 1381, 1387 (1st Cir.1995);  Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 145 (1st Cir.1995).  There are several standards that a court can use in determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is lawful.  These include the prima facie standard, the preponderance standard, and the likelihood standard.  See Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675-78 (1st Cir.1992).  We have no occasion today to delineate either the differences among these approaches or the considerations that influence a court's choice to use one standard rather than another at a particular stage of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, it suffices to say that the least taxing of these standards from a plaintiff's standpoint, and the one most commonly employed in the early stages of litigation, is the prima facie standard.  Under it, a suitor, in order to stave off defeat, \"must make the showing as to every fact required to satisfy both the forum's long-arm statute and the due process clause of the Constitution.\"  Id. at 675 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  When it employs the prima facie standard, a district court does not act as a factfinder;  to the contrary, it ascertains only whether the facts duly proffered, fully credited, support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  See id.   Because this is a quintessentially legal determination, appellate review is plenary.  See Ticketmaster-N.Y., Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 204 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the district court purposed to apply the prima facie standard and made a determination that it did not have in personam jurisdiction over CMSC. See Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124-25.   Citing Foster-Miller, the appellant complains that the court erred because it failed to give advance notice as to which of the three standards it would utilize in resolving the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This protest distorts the rationale of Foster-Miller.   There, we vacated a dismissal when the trial court, having advised counsel that it would apply the prima facie standard, shifted gears without warning and applied a more rigorous standard.  46 F.3d at 143.   We said in that context that a trial court should \"alert the parties in advance to the level of scrutiny that it will apply to the pending motion [to dismiss].\"  Id. at 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the instant case is at a considerable remove from Foster-Miller.   Here, the signals remained constant;  the court steered a steady course and forthrightly applied the baseline standard.  We believe that all litigants effectively are on notice that motions to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction will be adjudicated under the prima facie standard unless the court informs them in advance that it will apply a more demanding test.  Thus, the court below was under no obligation to give the appellant special notice that it would conduct business as usual, any more than a court, before passing upon a motion for a directed verdict, would have to give advance warning that it intended to apply the customary complex of legal rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to avoid this conclusion by insisting that the lower court, despite using the vocabulary associated with prima facie showings, actually required it to pass a higher level of scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Were the court guilty of such tergiversation, the appellant would have a legitimate grievance.  See Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 150-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the accusation here is merely bombast;  we find no support for it in the lower court's opinion or elsewhere in the record.  CMSC's assertions anent jurisdictional facts were buttressed by declarations made on personal knowledge;  Fullerton did nothing to rebut or dispute these facts, despite abundant time to do so;  and the lower court therefore had the right, consistent with the prima facie standard, to take these facts as true.  The court's opinion plainly indicates that it reviewed the materials presented and passed upon them without essaying credibility judgments, resolving evidentiary conflicts, or otherwise making findings of fact.  See, e.g., Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124-25.   In short, Fullerton's claim that the district court surreptitiously applied a more stringent degree of perscrutation than that typically associated with the prima facie standard is totally unsubstantiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  Taking as true the specific averments of the third-party complaint, as supplemented by the declarations attached to CMSC's motion, the factual scenario is not in serious dispute.  CMSC sold rims to Fullerton (presumably in California, where both corporations maintained their headquarters), knowing that Fullerton would incorporate them into tires and offer them for sale in distant markets.  Fullerton, in turn, sent brochures to Puerto Rico among other places, advertised in national publications which were disseminated in the Commonwealth, and filled orders emanating from there.  The record confirms, however, that CMSC never conducted any business in Puerto Rico (either directly or through agents), never applied for or obtained authorization to do business there, and never owned, leased, or otherwise used an office or other property in the Commonwealth.  Based on these facts, the district court found that CMSC was not amenable to suit in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See id. at 128.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, Fullerton argues, as it did below, that CMSC, by placing its product into the stream of interstate commerce, transacted business in Puerto Rico sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement.  This argument will not wash.  In Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Ct., 480 U.S. 102, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987), the Supreme Court held that the \"placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State,\" and, thus, is insufficient to support a claim of personal jurisdiction.  Id. at 112, 107 S.Ct. at 1032 (plurality opinion).  Even assuming that CMSC had specific knowledge that the stream of commerce would move its tire rims into Puerto Rico--and there is neither evidence nor allegation to that effect--this awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the purposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of minimum contacts.  See id.  Asahi is still good law, see Boit, 967 F.2d at 681-83, and Fullerton has failed to direct us to any persuasive authority supporting a contrary view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  The appellant's next argument deserves high marks for ingenuity, but otherwise rates a failing grade.  The argument features a suggestion that the specific nature of CMSC's product--tire rims designed for use with sand track tires--made it foreseeable that CMSC could be amenable to suit in Puerto Rico, an island ecosystem containing an abundance of sandy beaches ideal for dune buggies and other sandworthy vehicles.  This argument proves too much.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sand, a loose granular material that results from the disintegration of rocks, consists of particles smaller than gravel but larger than silt.  The earth's land mass (excluding the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica) totals 32.1 billion acres.  See Richard Jackson &amp; Lloyd Hudman, World Regional Geography 50 (2d ed.1986).  This total includes 4.2 billion acres of desert and 1.7 billion acres of soil comprised primarily of sand.  See id. at 51.   Put another way, roughly 18% of the world's land surface is covered with sand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subjecting a manufacturer to suit in Puerto Rico merely because its product is designed for use in sand would offend the constitutional principles that limit a state's authority to exercise jurisdiction.  Under such a regime, a manufacturer of life preservers automatically would be subject to suit in every jurisdiction whose boundaries included an ocean, a river, a stream, a lake, a pond, or a swimming pool.  By the same token, a manufacturer of air conditioners would be subject to suit worldwide.  This surely is not the law.  See Asahi, 480 U.S. at 109-12, 107 S.Ct. at 1030-32 (imposing reasonableness requirement in respect to foreseeability).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth:  Following the granting of CMSC's motion, Fullerton sought reconsideration, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), proffering a copy of a Dun and Bradstreet credit report.  The district court refused reconsideration, and Fullerton asks us to reverse this ruling.  This ground of appeal lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's ruling on a motion to reconsider is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.  See Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d 274, 277 (1st Cir.1993);  Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1987).  The \"new\" document that Fullerton proffered--the Dun and Bradstreet report--hardly qualifies as newly discovered evidence.  More importantly, it indicates only that CMSC serves a market comprising the \"United States, primarily California.\"   That sort of broad generality has very little bearing on whether a defendant's activities have been directed to a particular place in a jurisdictionally significant fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, then, the belatedly proffered report did no more than confirm what the court already knew--that CMSC placed its product into the stream of interstate commerce.  Under these circumstances, the court's rejection of the motion did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth:  The appellant's motion for reconsideration also requested that the lower court delay the entry of judgment and permit discovery on the jurisdictional issue.  This request, which had not been made earlier, was untimely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Whittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., 482 F.2d 1079, 1086 (1st Cir.1973).  Therefore, the district court did not err in declining to honor it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fullerton Tires, Inc., an affiliated corporation, joined in filing the third-party complaint.  That pleading named CMSC;  its principals, Walter and Marianne Jenkins;  and other individuals in privity with them as third-party defendants.  For simplicity's sake, we treat the appeal as if only Fullerton and CMSC were parties.  Because the jurisdictional argument is weaker as to the individuals, our decision disposes completely of the Fullerton entities' attempts to sue CMSC and its privies in Puerto Rico</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Boit, we noted that \"an opinion using the terminology of 'prima facie' showing may fairly be read as requiring a bit more--e.g., that the plaintiff present plausible evidence tending to show that the court has jurisdiction.\"  Boit, 967 F.2d at 675 n. 2 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  To the extent (if any) that Judge Casellas' opinion falls into this category, we do not deem it to have deviated in any material way from the prima facie standard</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The lower court determined that the appellant had not made the requisite jurisdictional showing under either the federal Constitution, see Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 204-12 (describing constitutional minima), or Puerto Rico's long-arm statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  III, Rule 4.7(a) (1989).  See Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124.   Although we agree with both aspects of the district court's holding, we couch our ensuing discussion in terms of the constitutional requirement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This figure is not static as many of the world's regions are experiencing desertification, a process commonly described as the slow encroachment of fertile lands by arid soils.

(Fullerton) appeals from a district court order dismissing its third-party complaint against Custom Metal Spinning Corporation (CMSC) for want of in personam jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Using the parlance of the trade, Fullerton is spinning its wheels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case had its genesis in or before 1989 when Ernesto Alers Rodriguez (Rodriguez), a resident of Puerto Rico, purchased two sand track tires from a Puerto Rican dealer who had seen the tires advertised in a pamphlet distributed by Fullerton and had ordered a supply of them.  Some five years later, one of the purchased tires exploded while being inflated.  The rim snapped, severely injuring Rodriguez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (1994), Rodriguez sued Fullerton in Puerto Rico's federal district court.  Fullerton filed a third-party complaint against CMSC (the manufacturer of the rim used in Fullerton's sand track tires).  In due course, CMSC moved to dismiss the claim, alleging lack of personal jurisdiction.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2).  The court obliged.  Rodriguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span> (D.P.R.1996).  After the court certified the judgment in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger.  The district court's opinion captures the essence of the case and applies the controlling legal principles in an irreproachable manner.  Hence, we affirm the judgment primarily on the basis of the opinion below.  We add six comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  Fullerton bemoans the district court's treatment of CMSC's motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.  We are unmoved by this jeremiad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motions to dismiss come under the aegis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  The rule states that if \"matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the [Rule 12] motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\"   The proper approach to conversion under this rule is functional rather than mechanical.  See Vega-Rodriguez v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739069\"><a href=\"/opinion/739069/hector-vega-rodriguez-v-puerto-rico-telephone-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 177 (1st Cir.1997);  Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir.1992).  Here, CMSC attached to its motion several declarations ostensibly made under penalties of perjury.  Given the specific language of Rule 12(b), the inclusion of these materials with the motion put the nonmovant, Fullerton, squarely on notice that the court had the option of treating the motion as one for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a motion cannot be converted to one for summary judgment unless the adverse party is given \"reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  Here, however, that requirement was satisfied.  CMSC filed its dispositive motion on April 29, 1996.  Fullerton did not file its opposition until July 10, 1996.  During that interval Fullerton, had it chosen to do so, could have served counter-affidavits, made other evidentiary submissions, or sought leave to defer its response to the motion until it had conducted jurisdictional discovery.  It pursued none of these alternatives.  Instead, it filed an opposition which tried to meet the motion head-on.  The district court then considered the declarations in its determination of the jurisdictional issue.  See Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124-25.   Since Fullerton had ample opportunity to present pertinent materials in opposition to CMSC's motion, as well as the incentive to do so, we think that the court acted appropriately in impliedly converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment.  See American Express Int'l, Inc. v. Mendez-Capellan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532515\"><a href=\"/opinion/532515/american-express-international-inc-v-victor-mendez-capellan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span>, 1178 (1st Cir.1989) (finding that the district court's conversion of a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to a Rule 56 motion was proper);  see also Vega-Rodriguez, 110 F.3d at 177 (explaining that when extrinsic materials are proffered and are actually considered by the nisi prius court, conversion is proper).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we can envision circumstances in which fairness might require special notice of a court's intent to exercise the conversion privilege.  See, e.g., Ohio v. Peterson, Lowry, Rall, Barber &amp; Ross, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360256\"><a href=\"/opinion/360256/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96582-state-of-ohio-v-peterson-lowry-rall-barber/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 455-57 (10th Cir.1978).  But this is not such a situation.  The district court never indicated that it would eschew conversion or otherwise refuse to consider the proffered exhibits.  Moreover, the district court continued to apply the prima facie standard, see infra, not some more grueling standard indigenous to Rule 56.  Last, but not least, Fullerton to this day does not challenge CMSC's account of the relevant circumstances, but, rather, attacks the legal significance of certain facts without seeking to contradict them.  Consequently, the application of Rule 56 produced no perceptible unfairness here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  It is the plaintiff's burden to establish that the forum court has jurisdiction over the person of the sued defendant.  See Sawtelle v. Farrell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709024\"><a href=\"/opinion/709024/arthur-f-sawtelle-etc-v-george-e-farrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1387 (1st Cir.1995);  Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 145 (1st Cir.1995).  There are several standards that a court can use in determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is lawful.  These include the prima facie standard, the preponderance standard, and the likelihood standard.  See Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585777\"><a href=\"/opinion/585777/robert-s-boit-v-gar-tec-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 675-78 (1st Cir.1992).  We have no occasion today to delineate either the differences among these approaches or the considerations that influence a court's choice to use one standard rather than another at a particular stage of the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, it suffices to say that the least taxing of these standards from a plaintiff's standpoint, and the one most commonly employed in the early stages of litigation, is the prima facie standard.  Under it, a suitor, in order to stave off defeat, \"must make the showing as to every fact required to satisfy both the forum's long-arm statute and the due process clause of the Constitution.\"  Id. at 675 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  When it employs the prima facie standard, a district court does not act as a factfinder;  to the contrary, it ascertains only whether the facts duly proffered, fully credited, support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  See id.   Because this is a quintessentially legal determination, appellate review is plenary.  See Ticketmaster-N.Y., Inc. v. Alioto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the district court purposed to apply the prima facie standard and made a determination that it did not have in personam jurisdiction over CMSC. See Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124-25.   Citing Foster-Miller, the appellant complains that the court erred because it failed to give advance notice as to which of the three standards it would utilize in resolving the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This protest distorts the rationale of Foster-Miller.   There, we vacated a dismissal when the trial court, having advised counsel that it would apply the prima facie standard, shifted gears without warning and applied a more rigorous standard.  46 F.3d at 143.   We said in that context that a trial court should \"alert the parties in advance to the level of scrutiny that it will apply to the pending motion [to dismiss].\"  Id. at 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the instant case is at a considerable remove from Foster-Miller.   Here, the signals remained constant;  the court steered a steady course and forthrightly applied the baseline standard.  We believe that all litigants effectively are on notice that motions to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction will be adjudicated under the prima facie standard unless the court informs them in advance that it will apply a more demanding test.  Thus, the court below was under no obligation to give the appellant special notice that it would conduct business as usual, any more than a court, before passing upon a motion for a directed verdict, would have to give advance warning that it intended to apply the customary complex of legal rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to avoid this conclusion by insisting that the lower court, despite using the vocabulary associated with prima facie showings, actually required it to pass a higher level of scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Were the court guilty of such tergiversation, the appellant would have a legitimate grievance.  See Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 150-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the accusation here is merely bombast;  we find no support for it in the lower court's opinion or elsewhere in the record.  CMSC's assertions anent jurisdictional facts were buttressed by declarations made on personal knowledge;  Fullerton did nothing to rebut or dispute these facts, despite abundant time to do so;  and the lower court therefore had the right, consistent with the prima facie standard, to take these facts as true.  The court's opinion plainly indicates that it reviewed the materials presented and passed upon them without essaying credibility judgments, resolving evidentiary conflicts, or otherwise making findings of fact.  See, e.g., Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124-25.   In short, Fullerton's claim that the district court surreptitiously applied a more stringent degree of perscrutation than that typically associated with the prima facie standard is totally unsubstantiated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  Taking as true the specific averments of the third-party complaint, as supplemented by the declarations attached to CMSC's motion, the factual scenario is not in serious dispute.  CMSC sold rims to Fullerton (presumably in California, where both corporations maintained their headquarters), knowing that Fullerton would incorporate them into tires and offer them for sale in distant markets.  Fullerton, in turn, sent brochures to Puerto Rico among other places, advertised in national publications which were disseminated in the Commonwealth, and filled orders emanating from there.  The record confirms, however, that CMSC never conducted any business in Puerto Rico (either directly or through agents), never applied for or obtained authorization to do business there, and never owned, leased, or otherwise used an office or other property in the Commonwealth.  Based on these facts, the district court found that CMSC was not amenable to suit in Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See id. at 128.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, Fullerton argues, as it did below, that CMSC, by placing its product into the stream of interstate commerce, transacted business in Puerto Rico sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement.  This argument will not wash.  In Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Ct., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111824\"><a href=\"/opinion/111824/asahi-metal-industry-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-solano-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span> (1987), the Supreme Court held that the \"placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State,\" and, thus, is insufficient to support a claim of personal jurisdiction.  Id. at 112, 107 S.Ct. at 1032 (plurality opinion).  Even assuming that CMSC had specific knowledge that the stream of commerce would move its tire rims into Puerto Rico--and there is neither evidence nor allegation to that effect--this awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the purposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of minimum contacts.  See id.  Asahi is still good law, see Boit, 967 F.2d at 681-83, and Fullerton has failed to direct us to any persuasive authority supporting a contrary view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  The appellant's next argument deserves high marks for ingenuity, but otherwise rates a failing grade.  The argument features a suggestion that the specific nature of CMSC's product--tire rims designed for use with sand track tires--made it foreseeable that CMSC could be amenable to suit in Puerto Rico, an island ecosystem containing an abundance of sandy beaches ideal for dune buggies and other sandworthy vehicles.  This argument proves too much.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sand, a loose granular material that results from the disintegration of rocks, consists of particles smaller than gravel but larger than silt.  The earth's land mass (excluding the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica) totals 32.1 billion acres.  See Richard Jackson &amp; Lloyd Hudman, World Regional Geography 50 (2d ed.1986).  This total includes 4.2 billion acres of desert and 1.7 billion acres of soil comprised primarily of sand.  See id. at 51.   Put another way, roughly 18% of the world's land surface is covered with sand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subjecting a manufacturer to suit in Puerto Rico merely because its product is designed for use in sand would offend the constitutional principles that limit a state's authority to exercise jurisdiction.  Under such a regime, a manufacturer of life preservers automatically would be subject to suit in every jurisdiction whose boundaries included an ocean, a river, a stream, a lake, a pond, or a swimming pool.  By the same token, a manufacturer of air conditioners would be subject to suit worldwide.  This surely is not the law.  See Asahi, 480 U.S. at 109-12, 107 S.Ct. at 1030-32 (imposing reasonableness requirement in respect to foreseeability).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth:  Following the granting of CMSC's motion, Fullerton sought reconsideration, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), proffering a copy of a Dun and Bradstreet credit report.  The district court refused reconsideration, and Fullerton asks us to reverse this ruling.  This ground of appeal lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's ruling on a motion to reconsider is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.  See Cotto v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606662\"><a href=\"/opinion/606662/evelyn-cotto-and-edwin-torres-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 277 (1st Cir.1993);  Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495473\"><a href=\"/opinion/495473/application-for-issuance-of-order-requiring-the-united-states-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1987).  The \"new\" document that Fullerton proffered--the Dun and Bradstreet report--hardly qualifies as newly discovered evidence.  More importantly, it indicates only that CMSC serves a market comprising the \"United States, primarily California.\"   That sort of broad generality has very little bearing on whether a defendant's activities have been directed to a particular place in a jurisdictionally significant fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, then, the belatedly proffered report did no more than confirm what the court already knew--that CMSC placed its product into the stream of interstate commerce.  Under these circumstances, the court's rejection of the motion did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth:  The appellant's motion for reconsideration also requested that the lower court delay the entry of judgment and permit discovery on the jurisdictional issue.  This request, which had not been made earlier, was untimely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Whittaker Corp. v. United Aircraft Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312802\"><a href=\"/opinion/312802/whittaker-corporation-v-united-aircraft-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span>, 1086 (1st Cir.1973).  Therefore, the district court did not err in declining to honor it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fullerton Tires, Inc., an affiliated corporation, joined in filing the third-party complaint.  That pleading named CMSC;  its principals, Walter and Marianne Jenkins;  and other individuals in privity with them as third-party defendants.  For simplicity's sake, we treat the appeal as if only Fullerton and CMSC were parties.  Because the jurisdictional argument is weaker as to the individuals, our decision disposes completely of the Fullerton entities' attempts to sue CMSC and its privies in Puerto Rico</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Boit, we noted that \"an opinion using the terminology of 'prima facie' showing may fairly be read as requiring a bit more--e.g., that the plaintiff present plausible evidence tending to show that the court has jurisdiction.\"  Boit, 967 F.2d at 675 n. 2 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  To the extent (if any) that Judge Casellas' opinion falls into this category, we do not deem it to have deviated in any material way from the prima facie standard</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The lower court determined that the appellant had not made the requisite jurisdictional showing under either the federal Constitution, see Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 204-12 (describing constitutional minima), or Puerto Rico's long-arm statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  III, Rule 4.7(a) (1989).  See Rodriguez, 937 F.Supp. at 124.   Although we agree with both aspects of the district court's holding, we couch our ensuing discussion in terms of the constitutional requirement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This figure is not static as many of the world's regions are experiencing desertification, a process commonly described as the slow encroachment of fertile lands by arid soils.

It brought a third-party complaint against CMSC on December 27, 1995.  CMSC did not file its Rule 12(b)(2) motion until April of 1996 and Fullerton did not respond until July.  As this timetable illustrates, the appellant had ample opportunity to initiate discovery before the district court acted upon CMSC's motion</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
