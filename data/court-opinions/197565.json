In  this appeal, the Court is\r                    LAGUEUX, District Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nasked to decide whether certain  employees of the John Alden Life\r\n\nInsurance Company (\"John Alden\") are exempt from the overtime pay\r\n\nprovisions of the Fair Labor  Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.    201-219\r\n\n(\"FLSA\" or the \"Act\").   The particular question before the Court\r\n\nconcerns  whether  the  employees at  issue,  known  as marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  or  marketing   specialists  (collectively,  the\r\n\n\"marketing  representatives\"),  fall within  the  \"administrative\r\n\nemployee\" exemption, 29  U.S.C.   213(a)(1), which  provides that\r\n\n\"any  employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative,\r\n\nor professional capacity\" is excluded from the Act's overtime pay\r\n\nand recordkeeping provisions.\r\n\n          The United States Secretary of Labor (\"the  Secretary\")\r\n\nfiled this  action against John Alden on  May 4, 1995, seeking to\r\n\nenjoin  the  company  from  violating  the  FLSA's  overtime  and\r\n\nrecordkeeping   requirements  with   respect  to   the  marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives.  The parties submitted  the case to the district\r\n\ncourt on stipulated facts and cross-motions for summary judgment,\r\n\nunder Rule  56 of  the Federal Rules  of Civil  Procedure.   In a\r\n\nMemorandum and  Order dated October  8, 1996, Judge  Gorton found\r\n\nthat the marketing  representatives qualified as  \"administrative\r\n\nemployees\" under 29 U.S.C.   213(a)(1), and  therefore denied the\r\n\nSecretary's motion  and granted summary judgment in favor of John\r\n\nAlden.  See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 940 F. Supp.  418,\r                                                       \r\n\n421-24 (D. Mass. 1996).  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r          I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n          As noted above, the parties submitted this case  to the\r\n\ndistrict  court on stipulated facts,  and Judge Gorton provides a\r\n\ndetailed account of  the parties' stipulation in  his memorandum.\r\n\nSee id.  at 419-20.   Thus, for the  purposes of this  appeal the\r                 \r\n\nCourt needs only to highlight  those facts that are most relevant\r\n\nto the issue presented for review.\r\n\n          John  Alden is a Florida-based company that operates in\r\n\nseveral states,  including Massachusetts,  where it  maintains an\r\n\noffice in Westborough.   The company designs,  creates, and sells\r\n\nvarious  types of insurance products; its customers are typically\r\n\nbusinesses,  who purchase  group  coverage  on  behalf  of  their\r\n\nemployees.\r\n\n          As is the common  practice in the industry, John  Alden\r\n\ndoes  not  sell   its  products  through  direct   contacts  with\r\n\ncustomers, but  instead relies on licensed  independent insurance\r\n\nagents (\"agents\") to  provide its customer base.   In general, an\r\n\nagent will recommend  a variety of insurance  products, including\r\n\nJohn  Alden  products   and  those  of  its   competitors,  to  a\r\n\nprospective end-purchaser.  When a customer decides to purchase a\r\n\nJohn Alden product, the agent acts as an intermediary between the\r\n\ncompany  and the  end-purchaser  to  achieve  completion  of  the\r\n\ntransaction.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          The primary  duty of  the marketing representatives  --\r\n\nthe employees at issue here1  -- is to cultivate this independent\r\n\nagent sales force,  and, thereby, ultimately to increase sales of\r\n\nJohn Alden products.  To this end,  the marketing representatives\r\n\nmaintain constant contact with agents.  Marketing representatives\r\n\ndo not  \"share\" agents  with one another;  instead, each  keeps a\r\n\nlist or \"deck\" of  agents with whom he or she is in contact.  The\r\n\ntypical   deck  consists   of  500-600   agents,   and  marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  continually  cull  their decks  to  maintain  an\r\n\nactive agent base.\r\n\n          As  an agent's  primary  contact  with  John  Alden,  a\r\n\nmarketing  representative is responsible  for keeping his  or her\r\n\nagents up  to date on all  aspects of John Alden's  product line.\r\n\nFor instance,  the marketing  representatives  keep their  agents\r\n\napprised  of any new  products or product  combinations available\r\n\nfrom John Alden,  and make their agents  aware of any changes  in\r\n\nthe  pricing   of  the   company's  products.     The   marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives also discuss how John Alden's products might meet\r\n\nthe  particular  needs  of  an  agent's  current  or  prospective\r\n\ncustomers, and advise  agents as to which John  Alden products to\r\n\nmarket against competing products.  Often, they help their agents\r\n\ndevelop proposals for bidding on new business by recommending the\r\n\nappropriate  combination  of   John  Alden  products  to   fit  a\r\n\nprospective customer's needs.   To further educate  their agents,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   All of  the marketing representatives  at issue in  this case\r\nwork in John Alden's Westborough, Massachusetts office.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nmarketing representatives sometimes pass along articles about the\r\n\ncompany and/or its competitors, or give small-group presentations\r\n\nabout John Alden's products.\r\n\n          In dealing  with agents, the  marketing representatives\r\n\ndo not  use prepared  scripts.   Further,  although they  receive\r\n\nguidance about  suggested points  of emphasis  during an  initial\r\n\ntraining period  and at  weekly sales  meetings, these  employees\r\n\nmust  decide for  themselves  which products  to  emphasize to  a\r\n\nparticular agent, and which of their agents to contact on a given\r\n\nday.  Thus, to make these decisions the marketing representatives\r\n\nmust rely  on their own  knowledge of their  agent decks  and the\r\n\nspecific  needs of their  agents' customers.   Consequently, they\r\n\nspend most of their time (approximately seven hours a day) on the\r\n\nphone with agents.   While most of these calls are made to agents\r\n\nwith whom they  are already familiar --  to advise agents  of new\r\n\nproduct developments,  discuss current customer needs,  or follow\r\n\nup on  outstanding sales proposals  -- they also make  some \"cold\r\n\ncalls\" to agents in  the deck with whom they are unfamiliar, both\r\n\nto  acquaint the agents  with John Alden and  to learn about each\r\n\nagent's customer base.\r\n\n          When a customer  ultimately decides to purchase  a John\r\n\nAlden  product,  a  marketing representative  acts  as  a conduit\r\n\nbetween the agent and prospective purchaser, on the one hand, and\r\n\nJohn Alden's underwriting  department, on the other.   Generally,\r\n\nthe marketing representative  sends an application to  the agent,\r\n\nwho meets with the customer  to complete the necessary paperwork;\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe agent then returns the completed application to the marketing\r\n\nrepresentative,  who  in  turn forwards  it  to  the underwriting\r\n\ndepartment.   While  the application  is  pending, the  marketing\r\n\nrepresentative will  sometimes gather the  additional information\r\n\nneeded  in the  approval  process, such  as  medical records,  or\r\n\narrange  medical tests for  the purchasers' employees  where such\r\n\ninformation  is lacking.   Beyond  this,  however, the  marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives play no further role in the purchase transaction.\r\n\nThus,  they do not set or negotiate prices or terms of insurance,\r\n\nnor do they have any authority to approve or deny an application,\r\n\nas this is done solely by the underwriting department.\r\n\n          Typically,   marketing   representatives   are  college\r\n\ngraduates  with two  to six  years of  marketing experience.   An\r\n\ninitial  period of  training at  John Alden is  supplemented with\r\n\nboth  formal and informal  instruction from supervisors  and more\r\n\nsenior marketing  representatives throughout their tenure  at the\r\n\ncompany.  They also attend  weekly sales meetings with a District\r\n\nManager,  where  they  learn  about  new  products  and  exchange\r\n\ninformation   about  sales  techniques  they  have  found  to  be\r\n\neffective.      At   these   sales   meetings,   the    marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives also pass  along any information they  might have\r\n\nreceived  from agents --  for instance, information  concerning a\r\n\ncompetitor's new  products or prices, or about which new products\r\n\nare  selling well  -- that  might be  helpful to  the company  in\r\n\ndesigning new products.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The marketing  representatives work  five days a  week,\r\n\ntypically working ten-hour days with a one-hour lunch break.2  As\r\n\nnoted earlier, they  spend most of  their time on the  phone with\r\n\nagents,  with the remaining  time spent completing  and reviewing\r\n\npaperwork related to these agent  contacts.  On average, a first-\r\n\nyear marketing  representative will  generate approximately  $1.5\r\n\nmillion   in  sales  annually  for  the  company,  while  a  more\r\n\nexperienced representative will be credited with approximately $3\r\n\nmillion in sales each year.   The average annual compensation for\r\n\na   marketing  representative   is  $50,000,   and  more   senior\r\n\nrepresentatives can  earn as much  as $75,000.  In  addition to a\r\n\nbase salary of $34,000 to $37,000, these employees earn quarterly\r\n\nincentive and  bonus pay based  on the number, value,  and profit\r\n\nperformance of the  policies issued by the agents  in their agent\r\n\ndecks.  To further encourage  sales, the company sets a quarterly\r\n\nsales goal for each marketing representative; anyone who fails to\r\n\nmeet this benchmark receives further training and counseling, and\r\n\nultimately risks termination if this failure persists for two  or\r\n\nmore consecutive quarters.\r\n\nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r          II.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On May  4, 1995,  the Secretary  commenced this  action\r\n\nagainst John Alden pursuant to section 17 of the  FLSA, 29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  217, seeking  to enjoin the company from violating the overtime\r\n\nand recordkeeping  provisions of  the Act, 29  U.S.C.     207 and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Although John Alden  does not maintain  records of the  hours\r\nworked  by  its  marketing  representatives,  the   parties  have\r\nstipulated that they average more than 40 hours per week.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n211, respectively, and from withholding unpaid overtime wages due\r\n\nto the  marketing representatives.3   In its  answer, John  Alden\r\n\nasserted   as  an  affirmative  defense,  inter  alia,  that  the\r                                                               \r\n\nmarketing  representatives   were  exempt  from   the  applicable\r\n\nregulations  of  the  FLSA  as  \"administrative employees\"  under\r\n\nsection 13 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.   213(a)(1).\r\n\n          The  parties submitted the  case to the  district court\r\n\nfor  decision on  cross-motions for  summary  judgment, based  on\r\n\ntheir stipulation of facts as described above.  It was undisputed\r\n\nthat the marketing representatives routinely worked more than 40-\r\n\nhour workweeks without overtime pay  and that the company did not\r\n\nkeep  records of  the hours  worked  by each  during a  workweek.\r\n\nTherefore, the only issue before  the district court was  whether\r\n\nthe marketing representatives could be considered \"administrative\r\n\nemployees\"  under the  FLSA.   In  a Memorandum  and Order  dated\r\n\nOctober  8,  1996,   the  court  concluded  that   the  marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  satisfied  the  Department  of  Labor's  (\"DOL\")\r\n\nregulatory  requirements  for the  administrative  exemption, and\r\n\ntherefore entered judgment in favor of John Alden.   See Reich v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nJohn Alden Life Ins. Co., 940 F. Supp. 418 (D. Mass. 1996).\r                                  \r\n\n          In  finding these  employees to  be  exempt, the  court\r\n\napplied  the  regulatory  \"short  test\"  for  the  administrative\r\n\nexemption, as set forth in  29 C.F.R.   541.2(e)(2).   First, the\r\n\ncourt addressed whether a marketing representative's primary duty\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Specifically, the Secretary  seeks to recover unpaid overtime\r\nwages owed to 29 marketing representatives, 16 of whom were still\r\nemployed at John Alden at the time of the suit.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nconsists  of \"[t]he  performance  of  office  or  nonmanual  work\r\n\ndirectly  related  to  management policies  or  general  business\r\n\noperations,\" as required  by   541.2(a)(1).   In concluding  that\r\n\nthis  \"primary duty\" requirement  had been  met, the  court first\r\n\nfound that  marketing representatives perform  the administrative\r\n\ntasks  of \"promoting sales\" and \"representing the company\" within\r\n\nthe  meaning  of  the DOL's  interpretative  regulations,  see 29\r                                                                        \r\n\nC.F.R.    541.205(b).   The court  thus rejected  the Secretary's\r\n\ncontention that, because  they are concerned with  securing sales\r\n\nfor   the  company,   marketing   representatives  perform   non-\r\n\nadministrative  \"production\"  work, the  distinction  drawn  in  \r\n\n541.205(a).   See John Alden, 940 F. Supp. at 421-22.  Completing\r                                      \r\n\nits analysis of the \"primary duty\" requirement, the court went on\r\n\nto  find  that  the  work   performed  by  the  employees  is  of\r\n\n\"substantial importance  to the  management or  operation of  the\r\n\nbusiness\" within  the meaning  of    541.205(a)  and (c),  noting\r\n\nthat  \"[t]he success  of the  company in  New England  depends in\r\n\nlarge part on  the success of  the marketing representatives  who\r\n\npromote sales of John Alden products.\"  Id. at 422-23.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The court then  turned to the second part  of the short\r\n\ntest,  which provides that an exempt administrative employee must\r\n\nengage in  work  that requires  the exercise  of \"discretion  and\r\n\nindependent judgment.\"  29 C.F.R.   541.2(e)(2).  The court found\r\n\nthat this  requirement had  been met  on the  facts before  it as\r\n\nwell, noting  that marketing representatives  exercise discretion\r\n\nand use  their own judgment  in deciding which agents  to contact\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nand which products to  emphasize on a given day.  See id. at 423-\r                                                                   \r\n\n24.  Thus,  having found that both  prongs of the short  test had\r\n\nbeen   satisfied,  the   court  concluded   that  the   marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  qualified as  administrative employees  and were\r\n\nthus exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements.\r\n\n          Following the entry of judgment in favor of John Alden,\r\n\nthe Secretary filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.  The\r\n\ncase is now in order for decision.\r\n\nIII.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW\r          III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW\r\n\n          Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets\r\n\nforth the standard for ruling on a motion for summary judgment:\r\n\n          The   judgment  sought   shall  be   rendered\r\n          forthwith  if  the   pleadings,  depositions,\r\n          answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\n          file, together with  the affidavits, if  any,\r\n          show that there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n          material fact and  that the  moving party  is\r\n          entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\nThe trial court  must view all facts  and draw all inferences  in\r\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See Continental\r                                                                           \r\n\nCas.  Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins.

When  deciding cross-motions for  summary judgment,\r\n\nthe  court   must  consider  each   motion  separately,   drawing\r\n\ninferences against each movant in turn.  See Blackie v.

Adopting the approach used by\r\n\nthe Fifth Circuit in Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, 918 F.2d 1220, 1226 (5th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1990), this Court recognized that \"there are three distinct\r\n\ntypes of findings involved in  determining whether an employee is\r\n\nexempt.\"  Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1073.  First, the\r                                             \r\n\ncourt must  make  findings concerning  the so-called  \"historical\r\n\nfacts\" of the case, such as determining an  employee's day-to-day\r\n\nduties.  Id.  Second, the court must draw factual inferences from\r                     \r\n\nthese historical facts,  for instance, to conclude  whether these\r\n\nday-to-day duties require \"invention,  imagination, or talent\" as\r\n\nrequired  by  applicable regulations.   Id.   Finally,  the trial\r                                                    \r\n\ncourt must reach  the ultimate conclusion of whether  an employee\r\n\nis exempt, based on both historical facts and factual inferences.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nId.   Having separated  out the  lower court's  determinations in\r            \r\n\nthis manner, we  concluded that the first two  types of findings,\r\n\nas  essentially  factual  determinations,  were  subject  to  the\r\n\nclearly erroneous standard of review.   Id.  As for the  district\r                                                    \r\n\ncourt's ultimate finding, we noted that \"[a]lthough this is based\r\n\non  both  historical  facts  and  factual  inferences,  it  is  a\r\n\nconclusion of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\"  Id.\r                                                                        \r\n\n          The Court  will apply this  framework in its  review of\r\n\nthe decision at issue here.  Of course, there are no \"first tier\"\r\n\nfindings to review,  as the historical facts were  agreed upon in\r\n\nthe parties' stipulation.   Accordingly,  the factual  inferences\r\n\ndrawn by  the district  court from the  stipulated facts  will be\r\n\nreviewed for clear error, while the lower  court's ultimate legal\r\n\ndetermination engenders plenary review.\r\n\n          Finally, while  recognizing that  the determination  of\r\n\nwhether an  employee is  exempt is clearly  tied to  the district\r\n\ncourt's  inferential factfinding,4 we remain acutely aware of our\r\n\nduty  to engage in a  thorough review of the  record.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1073.  Moreover, we must review the decision below to ensure that\r\n\nthe court's factfinding was guided by the proper legal standards,\r\n\nas \"to the extent that findings of fact can be shown to have been\r\n\npredicated  upon, or  induced by,  errors  of law,  they will  be\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  As  the Fifth Circuit has  noted, \"[i]n the great  majority of\r\ncases, the district court's  findings of fact and  the inferences\r\nit draws,  if carefully  set forth and  supported by  the record,\r\nwill all but compel the legal conclusion that a given employee is\r\nor is  not exempt.   Absent some  fundamental legal  error, those\r\nconclusions  will usually stand undisturbed on appeal.\"  Dalheim,\r                                                                          \r\n918 F.2d at 1226-27.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\naccorded  diminished respect  on appeal.\"   Dedham  Water Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                                      \r\n\nIV.  DISCUSSION\r          IV.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          The FLSA establishes, as a general rule, that employees\r\n\nmust be compensated  at a  rate not  less than  one and  one-half\r\n\ntimes  their regular rate  for all overtime  hours.  29  U.S.C.  \r\n\n207(a)(1).   The Act  further defines overtime  as employment  in\r\n\nexcess  of 40  hours in a  single workweek.   Id.   However, this\r                                                          \r\n\novertime provision does not apply  to \"any employee employed in a\r\n\nbona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity . .\r\n\n. (as such terms are defined  and delimited from time to time  by\r\n\nregulations  of the  Secretary).\"   29  U.S.C.    213(a)(1).   Of\r\n\ncourse,  the remedial nature  of the  statute requires  that FLSA\r\n\nexemptions be \"narrowly  construed against the  employers seeking\r\n\nto  assert   them  and   their  application   limited  to   those\r\n\nestablishments plainly  and unmistakably  within their  terms and\r\n\nspirit.\"  Arnold v.

The\r\n\nregulations,  promulgated pursuant  to an  express delegation  of\r\n\nlegislative  authority, are to be given controlling weight unless\r\n\nfound to  be arbitrary, capricious,  or contrary to  the statute.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nSee Chevron U.S.A.

On the  other hand,  the interpretive\r\n\nregulations  are not  conclusive, as  they merely  set  forth the\r\n\nSecretary's  official position on  how the regulations  should be\r\n\napplied in specific contexts.   See Newspapers of New England, 44\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 1070.  Even so, these interpretations have the \"power  to\r\n\npersuade, if  lacking power  to control,\" as  they \"constitute  a\r\n\nbody  of experience  and informed  judgment to  which courts  and\r\n\nlitigants may properly resort for guidance.\"  Skidmore v. Swift &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).\r             \r\n\n          The requirements  of the  administrative exemption  are\r\n\nset  forth  in  the  regulations at  29  C.F.R.     541.2.   That\r\n\nregulation outlines both a short  and a long test for determining\r\n\nwhether an employee  qualifies for the  administrative exemption;\r\n\nthe short test is used for employees whose salaries are more than\r\n\n$250 per week.  29 C.F.R.   541.2(e)(2).  Since the  parties have\r\n\nstipulated that the marketing representatives earn more than $250\r\n\nper week, there  is no  dispute that the  short test governs  the\r\n\ninstant case.\r\n\n          Under the short test, John Alden must demonstrate:  (1)\r\n\nthat the primary duty of the marketing representative consists of\r\n\n\"[t]he performance of  office or nonmanual work  directly related\r\n\nto  management policies  or general  business  operations of  his\r\n\nemployer  or his employer's customers,\" 29 C.F.R.   541.2(a)(1),5\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   To be more  precise, the  first prong of  the short  test set\r\nforth at    541.2(e)(2) requires that the  \"primary duty consists\r\nof the  performance of  work described in  paragraph (a)  of this\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nand  (2) that  such  primary duty  \"includes  work requiring  the\r\n\nexercise of  discretion and  independent judgment,\"  29 C.F.R.   \r\n\n541.2(e)(2).   The district court  found, and we agree,  that the\r\n\nmarketing representatives meet both parts of this test.\r\n\nA.  Work Directly Related to Management or Operations\r          A.  Work Directly Related to Management or Operations\r\n\n          As stated  above, under  this first prong  of the  test\r\n\nJohn Alden must show that its marketing representatives have as a\r\n\nprimary  duty \"office  or  nonmanual  work  directly  related  to\r\n\nmanagement policies or general business operations\" of John Alden\r\n\nor its  customers.  29  C.F.R.    541.2(a)(1).   In the  parties'\r\n\nstipulation, the \"primary duty\" of the  marketing representatives\r\n\nis described as follows:\r\n\n          to contact and deal with licensed independent\r\n          insurance  agents  (\"agents\"),   and  related\r\n          activities,  to  increase purchases  of  John\r\n          Alden  insurance  products  by end-purchasers\r\n          who are in contact with the agents.\r\n\nAs there is  no dispute that this statement  describes \"office or\r\n\nnonmanual work,\"  the only question that remains  is whether this\r\n\nprimary duty  is \"directly  related\" to  John Alden's  management\r\n\npolicies or general business operations.\r\n\n          The   interpretative    regulations   concerning    the\r\n\nadministrative  exemption are set  forth at  29 C.F.R.    541.201\r\n\nthrough   541.215.   Of particular relevance is section  541.205,\r\n\nwhich specifically addresses the  \"directly related to management\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nsection.\"   For  the sake  of  simplicity, the  Court has  quoted\r\ndirectly from paragraph (a) in setting out the short test.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\npolicies   or  general   business   operations\"  language   under\r\n\nconsideration.  Subsection 541.205(a) provides as follows:\r\n\n          The  phrase \"directly  related to  management\r\n          policies  or general  business operations  of\r\n          his  employer  or his  employer's  customers\"\r\n          describes those types  of activities relating\r\n          to   the  administrative   operations  of   a\r\n          business as  distinguished from  \"production\"\r\n          or,  in  a retail  or  service establishment,\r\n          \"sales\" work.  In  addition to describing the\r\n          types  of activities,  the phrase  limits the\r\n          exemption  to  persons  who  perform work  of\r\n          substantial importance  to the  management or\r\n          operation of the business of his  employer or\r\n          his employer's customers.\r\n\nThus,    541.205(a) of the interpretations further subdivides the\r\n\nfirst  prong of  the  short test  into  two  subparts:   (1)  the\r\n\nemployee   must  be  engaged   in  \"administrative\"  rather  than\r\n\n\"production\" activity; and (2) this administrative activity  must\r\n\nbe of \"substantial importance\" to management or operations.\r\n\n          The district court found  that both parts of  this test\r\n\nhad  been satisfied,  and thus  concluded  that the  work of  the\r\n\nmarketing representatives was \"directly  related\" to John Alden's\r\n\nbusiness operations.  See John Alden, 940 F. Supp. at 421-23.  As\r                                              \r\n\nthe Fifth Circuit has noted,  \"[w]hether an employee's work is or\r\n\nshould be deemed 'directly related' to business operations  is an\r\n\ninference drawn from the historical facts.\"  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1230.

On the contrary, non-manufacturing employees can\r\n\nbe considered  \"production\"  employees in  those instances  where\r\n\ntheir job  is to generate  (i.e., \"produce\") the very  product or\r\n\nservice that the employer's business  offers to the public.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Reich v. New York, 3 F.3d 581, 587-89 (2d Cir. 1993), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 510  U.S. 1163  (1994) (police  investigators conduct  or\r                \r\n\n\"produce\" criminal investigations); Dalheim,  918 F.2d at 1230-31\r                                                     \r\n\n(television  station's   producers,  directors,   and  assignment\r\n\neditors \"produced\" newscasts, and were thus non-exempt).\r\n\n          Applying this distinction, the district court held that\r\n\nthe  marketing  representatives  were engaged  in  administrative\r\n\nrather than  production activities, a finding in which this Court\r\n\njoins.  As stated  in the stipulation of facts, John  Alden is in\r\n\nthe  business  of  designing,  creating,  and  selling  insurance\r\n\npolicies  to the  public.    It follows,  as  the district  court\r\n\nproperly  recognized, that the \"products\" generated by John Alden\r\n\nare  these insurance  policies  themselves.    As  the  marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  are  in  no  way  involved  in  the   design  or\r\n\ngeneration  of insurance  policies, the  very  product \"that  the\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nenterprise exists  to produce and  market,\" Dalheim, 918  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1230, they cannot be considered production employees.\r\n\n          In its arguments both to the lower court and on appeal,\r\n\nthe Secretary  has  urged that  the Third  Circuit's decision  in\r\n\nMartin  v. Cooper  Electric Supply  Co.,  940 F.2d  896 (3d  Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 936  (1992), compels the conclusion\r                             \r\n\nthat  the employees  at  issue  here  are  production  employees.\r\n\nHowever, both  the district  court and  John Alden  have properly\r\n\ndistinguished Cooper Electric from the instant case.  The company\r                                       \r\n\nat  issue  in Cooper  Electric  was  a  wholesaler that  did  not\r                                        \r\n\nmanufacture any  products of its  own, but instead  sold products\r\n\nmade by other firms.   Id. at 903.  Thus,  the parties stipulated\r                                   \r\n\nthat the  wholesaler's primary  business purpose  was to  produce\r\n\nsales of electrical products.  Id.  Since the employees  at issue\r                                           \r\n\nin Cooper Electric, the company's salespeople, worked to generate\r                            \r\n\nthe very product that  the company existed to market --  sales of\r\n\nelectrical products -- the Third Circuit concluded that they were\r\n\nnon-exempt production employees.  Id.  at 903-04.  Of course, the\r                                              \r\n\nfacts  of Cooper Electric  are clearly distinguishable  from this\r                                   \r\n\ncase, as  John Alden does  indeed generate  a product,  insurance\r\n\npolicies, not merely sales of a product.\r\n\n          In  an attempt to  answer this argument,  the Secretary\r\n\npoints out that the  stipulation of facts describes John  Alden's\r\n\nbusiness purpose as the  design, creation, and sale  of insurance\r                                                             \r\n\npolicies.  Thus, the Secretary  contends that, in addition to the\r\n\nproduction of insurance policies, John Alden also produces sales,\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nand that any  employee engaged in the generation  of sales should\r\n\nbe  deemed  non-exempt  under  the  logic  of  Cooper  Electric.6\r                                                                         \r\n\nHowever, Cooper  Electric itself  provides an  effective counter.\r                                   \r\n\nIn  discussing  the  \"servicing\"  component  of  the  Secretary's\r\n\ninterpretations,  see 29 C.F.R.    541.205(b), the  Third Circuit\r                               \r\n\nexplained  that  \"servicing  a   business\"  entailed  \"employment\r\n\nactivity   ancillary  to   an  employer's   principal  production\r                              \r\n\nactivity.\"    Cooper  Electric,  940 F.2d  at  904  (emphasis  in\r                                        \r\n\noriginal).  In the instant  case, the activities of the marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives are  clearly ancillary to John  Alden's principal\r\n\nproduction activity -- the creation of insurance policies  -- and\r\n\ntherefore could be  considered administrative \"servicing\"  within\r\n\nthe meaning of section 541.205(b).\r\n\n          As  the district court noted, the day-to-day activities\r\n\nof   marketing  representatives  are   more  in  the   nature  of\r\n\n\"representing  the company\" and  \"promoting sales\" of  John Alden\r\n\nproducts,  two examples of exempt administrative work provided by\r\n\n   541.205(b) of  the interpretations.   As John  Alden's primary\r\n\ncontact with the insurance market (via agent contacts), marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  represent  the  company  by  keeping  the market\r\n\ninformed of changes in John Alden's product offerings and pricing\r\n\nstructure.   Further,  by advising  agents  as to  which of  John\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  In  the context of a retail or  service establishment, section\r\n541.205(a)  expressly   provides  that   \"sales\"   work  is   not\r\nadministrative.  However, as the  Secretary recognizes, insurance\r\ncompanies are  not retail  or service  establishments within  the\r\nmeaning of  the FLSA,  see 29  C.F.R.    779.316,  and thus  this\r                                    \r\nprovision is inapplicable to the present case.\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nAlden's products  to market  against competing  products, and  by\r\n\nhelping them put together proposals for bidding on  new business,\r\n\nmarketing representatives  are, again  to quote  Cooper Electric,\r                                                                          \r\n\nengaged in \"something  more than routine selling  efforts focused\r\n\nsimply on particular  sales transactions.\"  Id. at  905.  Rather,\r                                                         \r\n\ntheir agent contacts  are \"aimed at promoting  (i.e., increasing,\r\n\ndeveloping,  facilitating,  and/or  maintaining)  customer  sales\r\n\ngenerally,\"  id. (emphasis in original), activity which is deemed\r                          \r\n\nadministrative  sales  promotion work  under  section 541.205(b).\r\n\nTherefore, there  was no  error in  the district  court's finding\r\n\nthat John Alden's marketing representatives are engaged primarily\r\n\nin administrative rather than production work.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n2.  Substantial Importance to Management or Operations\r          2.  Substantial Importance to Management or Operations\r\n\n          In  addition to  drawing the  administrative-production\r\n\nwork  dichotomy,  29  C.F.R.    541.205(a)  limits  the \"directly\r\n\nrelated\" language  to \"persons  who perform  work of  substantial\r\n\nimportance to the management or  operation of the business of his\r\n\nemployer or his employer's customers.\"   Of course, employees who\r\n\nformulate  management   policies  or  oversee   general  business\r\n\noperations   easily   satisfy   this   \"substantial   importance\"\r\n\nrequirement.    See  29  C.F.R.     541.205(c).    However,   the\r                             \r\n\ninterpretations make  it clear  that the exemption  is not  to be\r\n\nlimited solely to so-called \"management\" personnel:\r\n\n          As  used  to  describe  work  of  substantial\r\n          importance to the management or operation  of\r\n          the business, the phrase \"directly related to\r\n          management  policies   or  general   business\r\n          operations\"  is not  limited  to persons  who\r\n          participate in the  formulation of management\r\n          policies or  in the operation of the business\r\n          as   a  whole.     Employees  whose  work  is\r\n          \"directly related\" to  management policies or\r\n          to general business  operations include those\r\n          [whose]   work   affects  policy   or   whose\r\n          responsibility it is  to execute or  carry it\r\n          out.  The phrase also includes a wide variety\r\n          of  persons   who  either  carry   out  major\r\n          assignments in  conducting the  operations of\r\n          the business, or whose  work affects business\r\n          operations  to  a  substantial  degree,  even\r\n          though their assignments are tasks related to\r\n          the  operation of a particular segment of the\r\n          business.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.205(c).   Examples of employees or positions that\r\n\ngenerally meet  the \"substantial importance\"  requirement include\r\n\ncredit  managers, claim agents and adjusters, wage-rate analysts,\r\n\nsecurities  brokers,   and  promotion   men.     See  29   C.F.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n  541.205(c)(5).    However,  the particular  title  given  to an\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nemployee is  not determinative,  as an  employee's exempt  status\r\n\nmust  instead be  predicated on  whether  his or  her duties  and\r\n\nresponsibilities   meet   all   of   the  applicable   regulatory\r\n\nrequirements.  See 29 C.F.R.   541.201(b).\r                            \r\n\n          In applying  these interpretations, the  district court\r\n\nfirst  recognized that \"the work of the marketing representatives\r\n\nis critically important to John Alden's business,\" in that \"[t]he\r\n\nsuccess  of the company  in New England depends  in large part on\r\n\nthe success of the marketing representatives who promote sales of\r\n\nJohn  Alden products.\"    John  Alden, 940  F.  Supp. at  422-23.\r                                               \r\n\nHaving thus found that the marketing representatives were engaged\r\n\nin  work that  \"affects  business  operations  to  a  substantial\r\n\ndegree\"  --  one of  the  categories  of  work  deemed to  be  of\r\n\n\"substantial  importance\" under  29 C.F.R.     541.205(c) --  the\r\n\ndistrict court  concluded that their  work met this prong  of the\r\n\ntest.  Id. \r                   \r\n\n          On appeal, the Secretary contends that, in applying the\r\n\ninterpretations, the district  court misconstrued the concept  of\r\n\n\"substantial importance\" so as to  require plenary review of this\r\n\nissue.   In  short, the  Secretary submits  that the  lower court\r\n\nimproperly equated economic  impact with substantial  importance,\r\n\nso  that  if  an  employee's work  contributes  to  an employer's\r\n\nfinancial  well-being, that fact  alone is sufficient  to satisfy\r\n\nthe substantial importance requirement.  If  the court did indeed\r\n\nmisconstrue  the  concept of  \"substantial importance,\"  then its\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nfactual inferences  were drawn with  the wrong legal  standard in\r\n\nmind, and it would have erred as a matter of law.\r\n\n          We  recognize that more than  one circuit has held that\r\n\n\"[t]he  financial effect of  employee activity cannot  alone show\r\n\nwork of 'substantial  importance to the management  or operation'\r\n\nof an  employer's business.\"   Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d  at 906;\r                                                        \r\n\nsee  also Dalheim, 918  F.2d at 1231.7   As stated  by the Fourth\r                           \r\n\nCircuit in  Clark  v. J.M.  Benson Co.,  789 F.2d  282 (4th  Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1986), in  assessing substantial  importance it  is necessary  to\r\n\nlook at \"the  nature of the work, not  its ultimate consequence.\"\r                              \r\n\nId. at  287 (emphasis in  original).   Further, the  interpretive\r            \r\n\nregulations clearly dismiss the view that this requirement can be\r\n\nmet simply  by showing a  link between poor performance  and lost\r\n\nprofits:\r\n\n          A  messenger  boy   who  is  entrusted   with\r\n          carrying large  sums of  money or  securities\r\n          cannot be said to be doing work of importance\r\n          to   the   business   even   though   serious\r\n          consequences may  flow from his neglect.   An\r\n          employee operating  very expensive  equipment\r\n          may cause serious loss to his employer by the\r\n          improper performance of his duties. . . . But\r\n          such employees, obviously, are not performing\r\n          work of  such substantial  importance to  the\r\n          management or operation of the business  that\r\n          it can  be said  to be  \"directly related  to\r\n          management  policies   or  general   business\r\n          operations\"  as  that  phrase  is used  in   \r\n          541.2.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  In Dalheim, the  employer argued for substantial importance by\r                       \r\nstressing that \"if a producer performs poorly, KDFW's bottom line\r\nmight suffer.\"   Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1231.   The Court held that\r                                  \r\n\"[a]s  a matter  of law,  that is  insufficient to  establish the\r\ndirect  relationship  required  by     541.2  by  virtue  of  the\r\n'substantial importance' contemplated by   541.205(c).\"  Id.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nSee 29 C.F.R.   541.205(c)(2).\r             \r\n\n          Although the district court did not expressly set forth\r\n\nthe test in the above manner, our review of the  district court's\r\n\nreasoning  convinces us  that these  principles  were taken  into\r\n\naccount in  assessing substantial  importance.   Contrary to  the\r\n\nSecretary's   assertion,  the   court   did  not   simply  equate\r\n\n\"substantial  importance\" with  financial impact.   Rather, after\r\n\nnoting the economic  significance of their sales  promotion work,\r\n\nthe  court then  proceeded to  consider  the nature  of the  work\r                                                             \r\n\nundertaken  by the  marketing  representatives,  which the  court\r\n\nrecognized required them to:\r\n\n          a)  understand  the  nature  of the  evolving\r\n          insurance market, b) grasp the subtleties  of\r\n          that market,  c) familiarize  themselves with\r\n          their agents, their competitors and the needs\r\n          of existing  and prospective  end-purchasers,\r\n          and  d) respond  quickly  in identifying  and\r\n          promoting a  John Alden product when an agent\r\n          contemplates    a   particular    competitive\r\n          product.\r\n\nJohn  Alden,  940 F.  Supp. at  423.   In light  of this,  we are\r                     \r\n\nsatisfied that the district court did not misconstrue the  nature\r\n\nof the  \"substantial importance\"  inquiry, as  it considered  the\r\n\nnature of the employee's work as well as the consequences of that\r\n\nwork.8   Accordingly, because  the district  court was  operating\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  While recognizing  the Fourth Circuit's statement  that \"[t]he\r\nregulations emphasize  the nature of  the work, not  its ultimate\r                                           \r\nconsequence,\"  J.M.  Benson,   789  F.2d  at  287   (emphasis  in\r                                     \r\noriginal), we would find it  difficult to conclude that a certain\r\nkind of work was \"substantially important\" to business operations\r\nwithout also considering the consequences of that work.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nwithin the proper legal framework, we will review its inferential\r\n\nfactfinding on this issue for clear error.\r\n\n          Our review of  the record finds  ample support for  the\r\n\nlower  court's conclusion.   First and foremost,  as John Alden's\r\n\nprimary  contact   with   the   independent   agents,   marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives are  the insurance market's  principle source for\r\n\ninformation about John Alden and  its products.  Moreover, in the\r\n\ncourse  of  their  daily   activities,  these  employees   gather\r\n\ninformation  about their agents,  the agents' customers,  and the\r\n\ninsurance market as a whole  -- such as information about changes\r\n\nin   consumer  needs,  or   regarding  the  success   of  certain\r\n\ncompetitors' offerings.  The marketing representatives  must then\r\n\nuse all of this information  both to pique their agents' interest\r\n\nin John  Alden, and to  suggest products or  product combinations\r\n\nthat an agent's  customers might find  attractive.  In  addition,\r\n\nthe marketing representatives can pass along the information they\r\n\nhave compiled to  their supervisors, who later relay  the same to\r\n\nJohn Alden's management, who can then factor it into decisions on\r\n\nnew product designs and offerings.\r\n\n          It is certainly  reasonable to draw the  inference that\r\n\nthis type  of work, both  by its  nature and in  its consequence,\r\n\nwould  affect John Alden's  business operations to  a substantial\r\n\ndegree.   Indeed, it  would appear  that work of  this nature  --\r\n\ndisseminating  information  to   the  marketplace,  understanding\r\n\ncustomers and competitors, and gathering available information to\r\n\nbe  used in  putting  together proposals  and  packages that  are\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nappropriate  for  those  customers  --  is  directly  related  to\r\n\noperations, and  at the heart  of John Alden's  business success.\r\n\nAs such,  we find no error in  the district court's conclusion on\r\n\nthis issue.\r\n\n          Lastly, the Secretary attaches some significance to the\r\n\nfact   that  John   Alden   employs   a   number   of   marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives in  this region,  stressing  that the  collective\r\n\neconomic  impact  of a  group  of  employees is  insufficient  to\r\n\nsatisfy  the  substantial  importance requirement.    See  Cooper\r                                                                           \r\n\nElectric,  940  F.2d  at  906.    However,  the  Secretary's  own\r                  \r\n\ninterpretative regulations provide a sufficient rejoinder:\r\n\n          The fact  that there  are a  number of  other\r\n          employees of  the same employer  carrying out\r\n          assignments of  the same  relative importance\r\n          or performing identical work  does not affect\r\n          the determination  of whether they  meet this\r\n          test  so  long  as  the  work  of  each  such\r\n          employee is of substantial  importance to the\r\n          management or operation of the business.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.205(c)(6).  In the instant case, we find that the\r\n\nwork  of each  marketing representative,  standing  alone, has  a\r\n\nsubstantial effect on John Alden's business.9   As set out in the\r\n\nparties'  stipulation,  the   sixteen  marketing  representatives\r\n\ncurrently employed in the regional office are responsible for the\r\n\npromotion of the company's products throughout all of New England\r\n\n(minus Connecticut).  Moreover, each marketing  representative is\r\n\nindividually responsible for a deck  of 500-600 agents, with each\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9  It is unclear from the district court's discussion  whether it\r\nconsidered  the  consequences of  the  marketing representatives'\r\nwork individually or  as a whole.   Thus, we consider  this issue\r\nbased upon our own review of the record.\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\ndeck generating, on  average, from $1.5 million to  $3 million in\r\n\nsales annually.  In light of  all this, we have little difficulty\r\n\nin finding that each  individual marketing representative carries\r\n\nout  a \"major assignment[]  in conducting  the operations  of the\r\n\nbusiness,\" and  \"affects  business operations  to  a  substantial\r\n\ndegree\" through his  or her own sales promotion  activities.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n29 C.F.R.   541.205(c).\r\n\n          The district  court was  not clearly  wrong in  finding\r\n\nthat the marketing representatives  are engaged in administrative\r\n\nwork  of   substantial  importance   to  John   Alden's  business\r\n\noperations.    Accordingly,  we agree  that  these  employees are\r\n\nengaged  in administrative work  \"directly related  to management\r\n\npolicies or general  business operations,\" as required  under the\r\n\nfirst prong of the short test,  29 C.F.R.   541.2(a)(1).  We  now\r\n\nturn to the court's  analysis of the \"discretion  and independent\r\n\njudgment\" part of the test.\r\n\nB.  Work Requiring Discretion and Independent Judgment\r          B.  Work Requiring Discretion and Independent Judgment\r\n\n          To  satisfy the  second prong of  the short  test, John\r\n\nAlden must  demonstrate  that its  marketing representatives  are\r\n\nengaged  in work  that  requires the  exercise of  discretion and\r\n\nindependent judgment.   29 C.F.R.   541.2(e)(2).  The Secretary's\r\n\ninterpretations elaborate on this requirement as follows:\r\n\n          In general,  the exercise  of discretion  and\r\n          independent judgment involves  the comparison\r\n          and  the  evaluation of  possible  courses of\r\n          conduct and acting or making a decision after\r\n          the   various    possibilities   have    been\r\n          considered.    The  term .  .  .  , moreover,\r\n          implies that the person has the  authority or\r\n          power  to make  an  independent choice,  free\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\n          from immediate  direction or  supervision and\r\n          with respect to matters of significance.\r\n\n29  C.F.R.   541.207(a).  The interpretations further advise that\r\n\n\"the discretion and  independent judgment exercised must  be real\r\n\nand substantial, that is, they  must be exercised with respect to\r\n\nmatters of  consequence.\"  29  C.F.R.   541.207(d)(1).   However,\r\n\nthe  exempt employee need not have final decisionmaking authority\r\n\nover  such matters; \"[e]ven though  an employee's work is subject\r\n\nto approval,  even to the extent that  a decision may be reversed\r\n\nby higher level  management, it does not follow that the work did\r\n\nnot require the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.\"\r\n\nDymond v. United  States Postal Serv., 670 F.2d  93, 96 (8th Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1982); see also 29 C.F.R.   541.207(e).\r                         \r\n\n          The  district court  found,  and  we  agree,  that  the\r\n\nmarketing  representatives  exercise discretion  and  independent\r\n\njudgment in  carrying out  their duties.   It is  undisputed that\r\n\nthese  employees  have  discretion in  choosing  which  agents to\r\n\ncontact  on  any  given  day, and  concerning  which  products to\r\n\ndiscuss   with  each   agent.     In   addition,  the   marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  rely  on  their  own  knowledge  of  an  agent's\r\n\nbusiness  to help tailor proposals for the agent's end-customers.\r\n\nFurther, they must  be able to anticipate  the competing products\r\n\nthat  the agent's customers might be considering, and distinguish\r\n\nJohn Alden's offerings from those of competitors.  Thus, there is\r\n\nclear  support in the record for  the district court's conclusion\r\n\nthat John Alden's  marketing representatives exercise  discretion\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nand independent judgment in the  course of their day-to-day agent\r\n\ncontacts.\r\n\n          While recognizing that the marketing representatives do\r\n\nexercise  some  discretion  in their  dealings  with  agents, the\r\n\nSecretary  argues  that  this discretion  is  not  exercised with\r\n\nrespect to \"matters  of consequence\"  within the  meaning of  the\r\n\ninterpretive  regulations.  However,  the matters on  which these\r\n\nemployees exercise their  discretion and judgment --  which agent\r\n\nwould be in the best position to  sell a given product, and which\r\n\nproducts would  be most attractive  to a given customer  -- would\r\n\ncertainly appear to be \"of consequence\" to John Alden's business.\r\n\nIndeed, this work would seem to be of equal or greater importance\r\n\nthan some of the work the Secretary's interpretations identify as\r\n\nexempt, such as  the duties of an administrative  assistant to an\r\n\nexecutive,10 or those of a customer's man in a brokerage house.11\r\n\nSee  29 C.F.R.    541.207(d)(2).   Thus,  we will  not upset  the\r             \r\n\ndistrict court's decision on this ground.12\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  \"The regulations . . . contemplate the kind of discretion and\r\nindependent judgment exercised by an administrative  assistant to\r\nan  executive, who  without  specific  instruction or  prescribed\r\nprocedures, arranges interviews and meetings, and handles callers\r\nand  meetings himself where the executive's personal attention is\r\nnot required.\"  29 C.F.R.   541.207(d)(2).\r\n\n11   The test  includes \"the kind  of discretion  and independent\r\njudgment exercised  by a customer's  man in a brokerage  house in\r\ndeciding  what recommendations  to  make to  a  customer for  the\r\npurchase of securities.\"  Id.\r                                       \r\n\n12   As  the district  court  noted, the  work of  the  marketing\r\nrepresentatives  does not at  all resemble the  given examples of\r\nnonexempt  work where  discretion  is  exercised  on  matters  of\r\nrelatively little consequence: i.e., a truck driver's decision on\r\nwhich route to follow; a  shipping clerk's decision on the method\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\n          The  Secretary  also  contends  that  the  lower  court\r\n\ncommitted error by  mistaking the mere \"use of  skill in applying\r\n\ntechniques,  procedures,  or   specific  standards,\"  29   C.F.R.\r\n\n  541.207(b),  for   the  required  discretion   and  independent\r\n\njudgment.      The   Secretary   submits   that   the   marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives,  in  informing  agents  and  persuading  them to\r\n\nrecommend  John Alden  products, are  simply  applying the  sales\r\n\ntechniques they  learned in  training sessions  and weekly  sales\r\n\nmeetings.    The Secretary  also  points out  that  the marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives receive  both formal and informal  guidance about\r\n\nwhich  products and product features to  emphasize, and about the\r\n\ngeneral points  to make with  agents.  Thus, the  Secretary avers\r\n\nthat rather than exercising discretion and independent  judgment,\r\n\nthese employees are simply making decisions within a given set of\r\n\nparameters,  the type  of work  that  would not  qualify for  the\r\n\nexemption.  See 29 C.F.R.   541.207(c).13\r                         \r\n\n          However, as the district court found, the record simply\r\n\ndoes not  support the Secretary's assertion.   These employees do\r\n\nnot  use  prepared  scripts  or read  from  a  required  verbatim\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nof packing and  mode of shipment; and a  bookkeeper's decision on\r\nwhether to post  to one ledger or  another first.  See  29 C.F.R.\r                                                                \r\n  541.207(d)(1).\r\n\n13   The interpretive regulations offer the following examples of\r\nwork in  which skill in  applying standards or techniques  can be\r\nmistaken for discretion:  inspectors who  develop facts to assess\r\nwhether  prescribed standards have been met; lumber \"graders\" who\r\ninspect  each \"stick\"  and then  place  each into  a well-defined\r\ngrading category;  personnel clerks  who screen applications  and\r\nreject  those that do  not meet prescribed  minimum requirements.\r\nSee 29 C.F.R.   541.207(c)(1)-(6).\r             \r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nstatement,  nor  do  they  operate   within  the  contours  of  a\r\n\nprescribed  technique or  \"sales  pitch\".   On the  contrary, the\r\n\ncontent of a given conversation with an agent is dictated  by the\r\n\nneeds  or customer  base  of  that agent,  or  by the  particular\r\n\ninformation  sought by the  marketing representative  during that\r\n\nphone  call.    Further,   to  the  extent  that   the  marketing\r\n\nrepresentatives  receive guidance about products to emphasize and\r\n\nsuggested points to  make with agents, they  nonetheless exercise\r\n\ndiscretion  in  applying  this instruction  --  for  instance, in\r\n\ndetermining which agent may have  an interest in that product, or\r\n\nin fashioning  bid proposals that  meet the needs of  the agent's\r\n\ncustomers.14  See Atlanta Prof'l Firefighters Union, Local 134 v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCity of  Atlanta, 920 F.2d  800, 805 (11th Cir.  1991) (employees\r                          \r\n\nwho retained  \"discretion in  implementing  [the] directions\"  of\r\n\nanother meet discretion and independent judgment test).  In light\r\n\nof  all this, we  concur that the  marketing representatives \"are\r\n\nnot merely 'skilled'  workers who operate within a  strict set of\r\n\nrules.   Rather, they  exercise significant  discretion in  their\r\n\ndaily contacts with  various insurance agents.\"   John Alden, 940\r                                                                      \r\n\nF. Supp. at 423.\r\n\n          The district court did not commit error in finding that\r\n\nthe  primary duty of the marketing representatives \"includes work\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n14  By way of comparison, the  Court notes that a \"customer's man\r\nin  a brokerage  house\" likely  receives  similar training  about\r\nproduct  features and points of emphasis.  Under the interpretive\r\nregulations, 29 C.F.R.    541.207(d)(2), this employee  exercises\r\nthe requisite discretion when he  or she applies this guidance to\r\nmake a recommendation to a customer for a securities purchase.\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nrequiring the  exercise of  discretion and independent  judgment\"\r\n\nwithin the  meaning of  29 C.F.R.    541.2(e)(2).   Therefore, we\r\n\nconclude  that the second  prong of the  administrative exemption\r\n\nhas been met in this case.\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          For all of  these reasons, we  agree with the  district\r\n\ncourt's determination that John Alden's marketing representatives\r\n\nare exempt administrative employees.   Accordingly, the  judgment\r\n\nbelow is affirmed.\r                   affirmed\r                           \r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n",

The particular question before the Court concerns whether the employees at issue, known as marketing representatives or marketing specialists (collectively, the \"marketing representatives\"), fall within the \"administrative employee\" exemption, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1), which provides that \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\" is excluded from the Act's overtime pay and recordkeeping provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Secretary of Labor (\"the Secretary\") filed this action against John Alden on May 4, 1995, seeking to enjoin the company from violating the FLSA's overtime and recordkeeping requirements with respect to the marketing representatives.  The parties submitted the case to the district court on stipulated facts and cross-motions for summary judgment, under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In a Memorandum and Order dated October 8, 1996, Judge Gorton found that the marketing representatives qualified as \"administrative employees\" under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1), and therefore denied the Secretary's motion and granted summary judgment in favor of John Alden.  See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 940 F.Supp. 418, 421-24 (D.Mass.1996).  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the parties submitted this case to the district court on stipulated facts, and Judge Gorton provides a detailed account of the parties' stipulation in his memorandum.  See id. at 419-20.   Thus, for the purposes of this appeal the Court needs only to highlight those facts that are most relevant to the issue presented for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Alden is a Florida-based company that operates in several states, including Massachusetts, where it maintains an office in Westborough.  The company designs, creates, and sells various types of insurance products;  its customers are typically businesses, who purchase group coverage on behalf of their employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is the common practice in the industry, John Alden does not sell its products through direct contacts with customers, but instead relies on licensed independent insurance agents (\"agents\") to provide its customer base.  In general, an agent will recommend a variety of insurance products, including John Alden products and those of its competitors, to a prospective end-purchaser.  When a customer decides to purchase a John Alden product, the agent acts as an intermediary between the company and the end-purchaser to achieve completion of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary duty of the marketing representatives--the employees at issue here<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>--is to cultivate this independent agent sales force, and, thereby, ultimately to increase sales of John Alden products.  To this end, the marketing representatives maintain constant contact with agents.  Marketing representatives do not \"share\" agents with one another;  instead, each keeps a list or \"deck\" of agents with whom he or she is in contact.  The typical deck consists of 500-600 agents, and marketing representatives continually cull their decks to maintain an active agent base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an agent's primary contact with John Alden, a marketing representative is responsible for keeping his or her agents up to date on all aspects of John Alden's product line.  For instance, the marketing representatives keep their agents apprised of any new products or product combinations available from John Alden, and make their agents aware of any changes in the pricing of the company's products.  The marketing representatives also discuss how John Alden's products might meet the particular needs of an agent's current or prospective customers, and advise agents as to which John Alden products to market against competing products.  Often, they help their agents develop proposals for bidding on new business by recommending the appropriate combination of John Alden products to fit a prospective customer's needs.  To further educate their agents, marketing representatives sometimes pass along articles about the company and/or its competitors, or give small-group presentations about John Alden's products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dealing with agents, the marketing representatives do not use prepared scripts.  Further, although they receive guidance about suggested points of emphasis during an initial training period and at weekly sales meetings, these employees must decide for themselves which products to emphasize to a particular agent, and which of their agents to contact on a given day.  Thus, to make these decisions the marketing representatives must rely on their own knowledge of their agent decks and the specific needs of their agents' customers.  Consequently, they spend most of their time (approximately seven hours a day) on the phone with agents.  While most of these calls are made to agents with whom they are already familiar--to advise agents of new product developments, discuss current customer needs, or follow up on outstanding sales proposals--they also make some \"cold calls\" to agents in the deck with whom they are unfamiliar, both to acquaint the agents with John Alden and to learn about each agent's customer base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a customer ultimately decides to purchase a John Alden product, a marketing representative acts as a conduit between the agent and prospective purchaser, on the one hand, and John Alden's underwriting department, on the other.  Generally, the marketing representative sends an application to the agent, who meets with the customer to complete the necessary paperwork;  the agent then returns the completed application to the marketing representative, who in turn forwards it to the underwriting department.  While the application is pending, the marketing representative will sometimes gather the additional information needed in the approval process, such as medical records, or arrange medical tests for the purchasers' employees where such information is lacking.  Beyond this, however, the marketing representatives play no further role in the purchase transaction.  Thus, they do not set or negotiate prices or terms of insurance, nor do they have any authority to approve or deny an application, as this is done solely by the underwriting department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, marketing representatives are college graduates with two to six years of marketing experience.  An initial period of training at John Alden is supplemented with both formal and informal instruction from supervisors and more senior marketing representatives throughout their tenure at the company.  They also attend weekly sales meetings with a District Manager, where they learn about new products and exchange information about sales techniques they have found to be effective.  At these sales meetings, the marketing representatives also pass along any information they might have received from agents--for instance, information concerning a competitor's new products or prices, or about which new products are selling well--that might be helpful to the company in designing new products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marketing representatives work five days a week, typically working ten-hour days with a one-hour lunch break.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As noted earlier, they spend most of their time on the phone with agents, with the remaining time spent completing and reviewing paperwork related to these agent contacts.  On average, a first-year marketing representative will generate approximately $1.5 million in sales annually for the company, while a more experienced representative will be credited with approximately $3 million in sales each year.  The average annual compensation for a marketing representative is $50,000, and more senior representatives can earn as much as $75,000.  In addition to a base salary of $34,000 to $37,000, these employees earn quarterly incentive and bonus pay based on the number, value, and profit performance of the policies issued by the agents in their agent decks.  To further encourage sales, the company sets a quarterly sales goal for each marketing representative;  anyone who fails to meet this benchmark receives further training and counseling, and ultimately risks termination if this failure persists for two or more consecutive quarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1995, the Secretary commenced this action against John Alden pursuant to section 17 of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 217, seeking to enjoin the company from violating the overtime and recordkeeping provisions of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 207 and 211, respectively, and from withholding unpaid overtime wages due to the marketing representatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In its answer, John Alden asserted as an affirmative defense, inter alia, that the marketing representatives were exempt from the applicable regulations of the FLSA as \"administrative employees\" under section 13 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties submitted the case to the district court for decision on cross-motions for summary judgment, based on their stipulation of facts as described above.  It was undisputed that the marketing representatives routinely worked more than 40-hour workweeks without overtime pay and that the company did not keep records of the hours worked by each during a workweek.  Therefore, the only issue before the district court was whether the marketing representatives could be considered \"administrative employees\" under the FLSA.  In a Memorandum and Order dated October 8, 1996, the court concluded that the marketing representatives satisfied the Department of Labor's (\"DOL\") regulatory requirements for the administrative exemption, and therefore entered judgment in favor of John Alden.  See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 940 F.Supp. 418 (D.Mass.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding these employees to be exempt, the court applied the regulatory \"short test\" for the administrative exemption, as set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  First, the court addressed whether a marketing representative's primary duty consists of \"[t]he performance of office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations,\" as required by &#167; 541.2(a)(1).  In concluding that this \"primary duty\" requirement had been met, the court first found that marketing representatives perform the administrative tasks of \"promoting sales\" and \"representing the company\" within the meaning of the DOL's interpretative regulations, see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(b).  The court thus rejected the Secretary's contention that, because they are concerned with securing sales for the company, marketing representatives perform non-administrative \"production\" work, the distinction drawn in &#167; 541.205(a).  See John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 421-22.   Completing its analysis of the \"primary duty\" requirement, the court went on to find that the work performed by the employees is of \"substantial importance to the management or operation of the business\" within the meaning of &#167;&#167; 541.205(a) and (c), noting that \"[t]he success of the company in New England depends in large part on the success of the marketing representatives who promote sales of John Alden products.\"  Id. at 422-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the second part of the short test, which provides that an exempt administrative employee must engage in work that requires the exercise of \"discretion and independent judgment.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  The court found that this requirement had been met on the facts before it as well, noting that marketing representatives exercise discretion and use their own judgment in deciding which agents to contact and which products to emphasize on a given day.  See id. at 423-24.   Thus, having found that both prongs of the short test had been satisfied, the court concluded that the marketing representatives qualified as administrative employees and were thus exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the entry of judgment in favor of John Alden, the Secretary filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.  The case is now in order for decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the standard for ruling on a motion for summary judgment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court must view all facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See Continental Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 370, 373 (1st Cir.1991).  When deciding cross-motions for summary judgment, the court must consider each motion separately, drawing inferences against each movant in turn.  See Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir.1996).  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no dispute as to any material fact and only questions of law remain.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the summary judgment standard requires the trial court to make a legal determination rather than to engage in factfinding, appellate review is generally governed by the de novo standard.  See National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1103, 115 S.Ct. 2247, 132 L.Ed.2d 255 (1995).  However, the particular procedural vehicle by which this case was decided by the district court requires some deviation from the norm.  As noted earlier, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts, with their legal arguments focused on the significance to be accorded to the agreed-upon facts.  Thus, in effect, the parties submitted this case to the district court as a case stated.  Cf. Equal Employment Opportunity Com'n v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 603 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 65, 133 L.Ed.2d 27 (1995).  As this Court has stated in a similar case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[W]here, in a nonjury case, \"the basic dispute between the parties concerns the factual inferences ... that one might draw from the more basic facts to which the parties have drawn the court's attention,\" ... the district court is freed from the usual constraints that attend the adjudication of summary judgment motions.  Federacion De Empleados Tribunal General De Justicia v. Torres, 747 F.2d 35, 36 (1st Cir.1984) (Breyer, J.).  The court may then engage in a certain amount of differential factfinding, including the sifting of inferences.  By the same token, the court of appeals may assume that \"the parties considered the matter to have been submitted below as a case ready for decision on the merits.\"  Id. Consequently, the standard for appellate oversight shifts from de novo review to clear-error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Steamship Clerks, in reaching its decision the lower court was required first to engage in some differential factfinding--i.e., the drawing of factual inferences from the stipulated facts--and then to make a legal determination based upon these facts.  Thus, this appeal involves both factual and legal determinations.  This Court will apply the more deferential clear-error standard when reviewing the factual inferences drawn by the court below, id., while the lower court's ultimate application of the law to the facts, both those stated and inferred, remains subject to de novo review.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parsing out the questions of fact from the ultimate legal conclusion, we are guided by our decision in Reich v. Newspapers of New England, Inc., 44 F.3d 1060 (1st Cir.1995), where the Court considered whether certain newspaper employees fell within the professional exemption to the FLSA's overtime pay provisions, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1).  Adopting the approach used by the Fifth Circuit in Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, 918 F.2d 1220, 1226 (5th Cir.1990), this Court recognized that \"there are three distinct types of findings involved in determining whether an employee is exempt.\"  Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1073.   First, the court must make findings concerning the so-called \"historical facts\" of the case, such as determining an employee's day-to-day duties.  Id. Second, the court must draw factual inferences from these historical facts, for instance, to conclude whether these day-to-day duties require \"invention, imagination, or talent\" as required by applicable regulations.  Id. Finally, the trial court must reach the ultimate conclusion of whether an employee is exempt, based on both historical facts and factual inferences.  Id. Having separated out the lower court's determinations in this manner, we concluded that the first two types of findings, as essentially factual determinations, were subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.  Id. As for the district court's ultimate finding, we noted that \"[a]lthough this is based on both historical facts and factual inferences, it is a conclusion of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court will apply this framework in its review of the decision at issue here.  Of course, there are no \"first tier\" findings to review, as the historical facts were agreed upon in the parties' stipulation.  Accordingly, the factual inferences drawn by the district court from the stipulated facts will be reviewed for clear error, while the lower court's ultimate legal determination engenders plenary review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, while recognizing that the determination of whether an employee is exempt is clearly tied to the district court's inferential factfinding,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we remain acutely aware of our duty to engage in a thorough review of the record.  See id. at 1073.   Moreover, we must review the decision below to ensure that the court's factfinding was guided by the proper legal standards, as \"to the extent that findings of fact can be shown to have been predicated upon, or induced by, errors of law, they will be accorded diminished respect on appeal.\"  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FLSA establishes, as a general rule, that employees must be compensated at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular rate for all overtime hours.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 207(a)(1).  The Act further defines overtime as employment in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek.  Id. However, this overtime provision does not apply to \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity ... (as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary).\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1).  Of course, the remedial nature of the statute requires that FLSA exemptions be \"narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.\"  Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388, 392, 80 S.Ct. 453, 456, 4 L.Ed.2d 393 (1960).  Further, it is the employer in an FLSA case that bears the ultimate burden of establishing that its employees fall within the exemption.  See Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1070.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific parameters of the FLSA's administrative exemption are not set forth in the statute, but are instead articulated in the DOL's regulations and interpretations. The regulations, promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of legislative authority, are to be given controlling weight unless found to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  On the other hand, the interpretive regulations are not conclusive, as they merely set forth the Secretary's official position on how the regulations should be applied in specific contexts.  See Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1070.   Even so, these interpretations have the \"power to persuade, if lacking power to control,\" as they \"constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\"  Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 164, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirements of the administrative exemption are set forth in the regulations at 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2.  That regulation outlines both a short and a long test for determining whether an employee qualifies for the administrative exemption;  the short test is used for employees whose salaries are more than $250 per week.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  Since the parties have stipulated that the marketing representatives earn more than $250 per week, there is no dispute that the short test governs the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the short test, John Alden must demonstrate:  (1) that the primary duty of the marketing representative consists of \"[t]he performance of office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer or his employer's customers,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(A)(1),  AND (2)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that such primary duty \"includes work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  The district court found, and we agree, that the marketing representatives meet both parts of this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>A. Work Directly Related to Management or Operations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, under this first prong of the test John Alden must show that its marketing representatives have as a primary duty \"office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations\" of John Alden or its customers.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(a)(1).  In the parties' stipulation, the \"primary duty\" of the marketing representatives is described as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>to contact and deal with licensed independent insurance agents (\"agents\"), and related activities, to increase purchases of John Alden insurance products by end-purchasers who are in contact with the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there is no dispute that this statement describes \"office or nonmanual work,\" the only question that remains is whether this primary duty is \"directly related\" to John Alden's management policies or general business operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interpretative regulations concerning the administrative exemption are set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.201 through &#167; 541.215.  Of particular relevance is section 541.205, which specifically addresses the \"directly related to management policies or general business operations\" language under consideration.  Subsection 541.205(a) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The phrase \"directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer or his employer's customers\" describes those types of activities relating to the administrative operations of a business as distinguished from \"production\" or, in a retail or service establishment, \"sales\" work.  In addition to describing the types of activities, the phrase limits the exemption to persons who perform work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business of his employer or his employer's customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, &#167; 541.205(a) of the interpretations further subdivides the first prong of the short test into two subparts:  (1) the employee must be engaged in \"administrative\" rather than \"production\" activity;  and (2) this administrative activity must be of \"substantial importance\" to management or operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that both parts of this test had been satisfied, and thus concluded that the work of the marketing representatives was \"directly related\" to John Alden's business operations.  See John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 421-23.   As the Fifth Circuit has noted, \"[w]hether an employee's work is or should be deemed 'directly related' to business operations is an inference drawn from the historical facts.\"  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1230.   Thus, we review this finding for clear error.  Id.;  see also Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1073.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Administrative-Production Dichotomy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection 541.205(b) of the interpretations offers the following definition of \"administrative\" work:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>The administrative operations of the business include the work performed by so-called white collar employees engaged in \"servicing\" a business as, for example, advising the management, planning, negotiating, representing the company, purchasing, promoting sales, and business research and control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, applying the administrative-production dichotomy is not as simple as drawing the line between white-collar and blue-collar workers.  On the contrary, non-manufacturing employees can be considered \"production\" employees in those instances where their job is to generate (i.e., \"produce\") the very product or service that the employer's business offers to the public.  See, e.g., Reich v. New York, 3 F.3d 581, 587-89 (2d Cir.1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1163, 114 S.Ct. 1187, 127 L.Ed.2d 537 (1994) (police investigators conduct or \"produce\" criminal investigations);  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1230-31 (television station's producers, directors, and assignment editors \"produced\" newscasts, and were thus non-exempt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this distinction, the district court held that the marketing representatives were engaged in administrative rather than production activities, a finding in which this Court joins.  As stated in the stipulation of facts, John Alden is in the business of designing, creating, and selling insurance policies to the public.  It follows, as the district court properly recognized, that the \"products\" generated by John Alden are these insurance policies themselves.  As the marketing representatives are in no way involved in the design or generation of insurance policies, the very product \"that the enterprise exists to produce and market,\" Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1230, they cannot be considered production employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its arguments both to the lower court and on appeal, the Secretary has urged that the Third Circuit's decision in Martin v. Cooper Electric Supply Co., 940 F.2d 896 (3d Cir.1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 936, 112 S.Ct. 1473, 117 L.Ed.2d 617 (1992), compels the conclusion that the employees at issue here are production employees.  However, both the district court and John Alden have properly distinguished Cooper Electric from the instant case.  The company at issue in Cooper Electric was a wholesaler that did not manufacture any products of its own, but instead sold products made by other firms.  Id. at 903.   Thus, the parties stipulated that the wholesaler's primary business purpose was to produce sales of electrical products.  Id. Since the employees at issue in Cooper Electric, the company's salespeople, worked to generate the very product that the company existed to market--sales of electrical products--the Third Circuit concluded that they were non-exempt production employees.  Id. at 903-04.   Of course, the facts of Cooper Electric are clearly distinguishable from this case, as John Alden does indeed generate a product, insurance policies, not merely sales of a product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to answer this argument, the Secretary points out that the stipulation of facts describes John Alden's business purpose as the design, creation, and sale of insurance policies.  Thus, the Secretary contends that, in addition to the production of insurance policies, John Alden also produces sales, and that any employee engaged in the generation of sales should be deemed non-exempt under the logic of Cooper Electric.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, Cooper Electric itself provides an effective counter.  In discussing the \"servicing\" component of the Secretary's interpretations, see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(b), the Third Circuit explained that \"servicing a business\" entailed \"employment activity ancillary to an employer's principal production activity.\"  Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d at 904 (emphasis in original).  In the instant case, the activities of the marketing representatives are clearly ancillary to John Alden's principal production activity--the creation of insurance policies--and therefore could be considered administrative \"servicing\" within the meaning of section 541.205(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the day-to-day activities of marketing representatives are more in the nature of \"representing the company\" and \"promoting sales\" of John Alden products, two examples of exempt administrative work provided by &#167; 541.205(b) of the interpretations.  As John Alden's primary contact with the insurance market (via agent contacts), marketing representatives represent the company by keeping the market informed of changes in John Alden's product offerings and pricing structure.  Further, by advising agents as to which of John Alden's products to market against competing products, and by helping them put together proposals for bidding on new business, marketing representatives are, again to quote Cooper Electric, engaged in \"something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.\"  Id. at 905.   Rather, their agent contacts are \"aimed at promoting (i.e., increasing, developing, facilitating, and/or maintaining) customer sales generally,\" id.  (emphasis in original), activity which is deemed administrative sales promotion work under section 541.205(b).  Therefore, there was no error in the district court's finding that John Alden's marketing representatives are engaged primarily in administrative rather than production work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>2. Substantial Importance to Management or Operations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to drawing the administrative-production work dichotomy, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(a) limits the \"directly related\" language to \"persons who perform work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business of his employer or his employer's customers.\"   Of course, employees who formulate management policies or oversee general business operations easily satisfy this \"substantial importance\" requirement.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c).  However, the interpretations make it clear that the exemption is not to be limited solely to so-called \"management\" personnel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>As used to describe work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business, the phrase \"directly related to management policies or general business operations\" is not limited to persons who participate in the formulation of management policies or in the operation of the business as a whole.  Employees whose work is \"directly related\" to management policies or to general business operations include those [whose] work affects policy or whose responsibility it is to execute or carry it out.  The phrase also includes a wide variety of persons who either carry out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business, or whose work affects business operations to a substantial degree, even though their assignments are tasks related to the operation of a particular segment of the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c).  Examples of employees or positions that generally meet the \"substantial importance\" requirement include credit managers, claim agents and adjusters, wage-rate analysts, securities brokers, and promotion men.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)(5).  However, the particular title given to an employee is not determinative, as an employee's exempt status must instead be predicated on whether his or her duties and responsibilities meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.201(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying these interpretations, the district court first recognized that \"the work of the marketing representatives is critically important to John Alden's business,\" in that \"[t]he success of the company in New England depends in large part on the success of the marketing representatives who promote sales of John Alden products.\"  John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 422-23.   Having thus found that the marketing representatives were engaged in work that \"affects business operations to a substantial degree\"--one of the categories of work deemed to be of \"substantial importance\" under 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)--the district court concluded that their work met this prong of the test.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Secretary contends that, in applying the interpretations, the district court misconstrued the concept of \"substantial importance\" so as to require plenary review of this issue.  In short, the Secretary submits that the lower court improperly equated economic impact with substantial importance, so that if an employee's work contributes to an employer's financial well-being, that fact alone is sufficient to satisfy the substantial importance requirement.  If the court did indeed misconstrue the concept of \"substantial importance,\" then its factual inferences were drawn with the wrong legal standard in mind, and it would have erred as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that more than one circuit has held that \"[t]he financial effect of employee activity cannot alone show work of 'substantial importance to the management or operation' of an employer's business.\"  Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d at 906;  see also Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1231.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  As stated by the Fourth Circuit in Clark v. J.M. Benson Co., 789 F.2d 282 (4th Cir.1986), in assessing substantial importance it is necessary to look at \"the nature of the work, not its ultimate consequence.\"  Id. at 287 (emphasis in original).  Further, the interpretive regulations clearly dismiss the view that this requirement can be met simply by showing a link between poor performance and lost profits:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>A messenger boy who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money or securities cannot be said to be doing work of importance to the business even though serious consequences may flow from his neglect.  An employee operating very expensive equipment may cause serious loss to his employer by the improper performance of his duties....  But such employees, obviously, are not performing work of such substantial importance to the management or operation of the business that it can be said to be \"directly related to management policies or general business operations\" as that phrase is used in &#167; 541.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not expressly set forth the test in the above manner, our review of the district court's reasoning convinces us that these principles were taken into account in assessing substantial importance.  Contrary to the Secretary's assertion, the court did not simply equate \"substantial importance\" with financial impact.  Rather, after noting the economic significance of their sales promotion work, the court then proceeded to consider the nature of the work undertaken by the marketing representatives, which the court recognized required them to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>a) understand the nature of the evolving insurance market, b) grasp the subtleties of that market, c) familiarize themselves with their agents, their competitors and the needs of existing and prospective end-purchasers, and d) respond quickly in identifying and promoting a John Alden product when an agent contemplates a particular competitive product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 423.   In light of this, we are satisfied that the district court did not misconstrue the nature of the \"substantial importance\" inquiry, as it considered the nature of the employee's work as well as the consequences of that work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Accordingly, because the district court was operating within the proper legal framework, we will review its inferential factfinding on this issue for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record finds ample support for the lower court's conclusion.  First and foremost, as John Alden's primary contact with the independent agents, marketing representatives are the insurance market's principle source for information about John Alden and its products.  Moreover, in the course of their daily activities, these employees gather information about their agents, the agents' customers, and the insurance market as a whole--such as information about changes in consumer needs, or regarding the success of certain competitors' offerings.  The marketing representatives must then use all of this information both to pique their agents' interest in John Alden, and to suggest products or product combinations that an agent's customers might find attractive.  In addition, the marketing representatives can pass along the information they have compiled to their supervisors, who later relay the same to John Alden's management, who can then factor it into decisions on new product designs and offerings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is certainly reasonable to draw the inference that this type of work, both by its nature and in its consequence, would affect John Alden's business operations to a substantial degree.  Indeed, it would appear that work of this nature--disseminating information to the marketplace, understanding customers and competitors, and gathering available information to be used in putting together proposals and packages that are appropriate for those customers--is directly related to operations, and at the heart of John Alden's business success.  As such, we find no error in the district court's conclusion on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the Secretary attaches some significance to the fact that John Alden employs a number of marketing representatives in this region, stressing that the collective economic impact of a group of employees is insufficient to satisfy the substantial importance requirement.  See Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d at 906.   However, the Secretary's own interpretative regulations provide a sufficient rejoinder:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>The fact that there are a number of other employees of the same employer carrying out assignments of the same relative importance or performing identical work does not affect the determination of whether they meet this test so long as the work of each such employee is of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)(6).  In the instant case, we find that the work of each marketing representative, standing alone, has a substantial effect on John Alden's business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  As set out in the parties' stipulation, the sixteen marketing representatives currently employed in the regional office are responsible for the promotion of the company's products throughout all of New England (minus Connecticut).  Moreover, each marketing representative is individually responsible for a deck of 500-600 agents, with each deck generating, on average, from $1.5 million to $3 million in sales annually.  In light of all this, we have little difficulty in finding that each individual marketing representative carries out a \"major assignment[ ] in conducting the operations of the business,\" and \"affects business operations to a substantial degree\" through his or her own sales promotion activities.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was not clearly wrong in finding that the marketing representatives are engaged in administrative work of substantial importance to John Alden's business operations.  Accordingly, we agree that these employees are engaged in administrative work \"directly related to management policies or general business operations,\" as required under the first prong of the short test, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(a)(1).  We now turn to the court's analysis of the \"discretion and independent judgment\" part of the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>B. Work Requiring Discretion and Independent Judgment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the second prong of the short test, John Alden must demonstrate that its marketing representatives are engaged in work that requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  The Secretary's interpretations elaborate on this requirement as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>In general, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.  The term ..., moreover, implies that the person has the authority or power to make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision and with respect to matters of significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(a).  The interpretations further advise that \"the discretion and independent judgment exercised must be real and substantial, that is, they must be exercised with respect to matters of consequence.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(1).  However, the exempt employee need not have final decisionmaking authority over such matters;  \"[e]ven though an employee's work is subject to approval, even to the extent that a decision may be reversed by higher level management, it does not follow that the work did not require the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.\"  Dymond v. United States Postal Serv., 670 F.2d 93, 96 (8th Cir.1982);  see also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, and we agree, that the marketing representatives exercise discretion and independent judgment in carrying out their duties.  It is undisputed that these employees have discretion in choosing which agents to contact on any given day, and concerning which products to discuss with each agent.  In addition, the marketing representatives rely on their own knowledge of an agent's business to help tailor proposals for the agent's end-customers.  Further, they must be able to anticipate the competing products that the agent's customers might be considering, and distinguish John Alden's offerings from those of competitors.  Thus, there is clear support in the record for the district court's conclusion that John Alden's marketing representatives exercise discretion and independent judgment in the course of their day-to-day agent contacts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While recognizing that the marketing representatives do exercise some discretion in their dealings with agents, the Secretary argues that this discretion is not exercised with respect to \"matters of consequence\" within the meaning of the interpretive regulations.  However, the matters on which these employees exercise their discretion and judgment--which agent would be in the best position to sell a given product, and which products would be most attractive to a given customer--would certainly appear to be \"of consequence\" to John Alden's business.  Indeed, this work would seem to be of equal or greater importance than some of the work the Secretary's interpretations identify as exempt, such as the duties of an administrative assistant to an executive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> or those of a customer's man in a brokerage house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(2).  Thus, we will not upset the district court's decision on this ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also contends that the lower court committed error by mistaking the mere \"use of skill in applying techniques, procedures, or specific standards,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(b), for the required discretion and independent judgment.  The Secretary submits that the marketing representatives, in informing agents and persuading them to recommend John Alden products, are simply applying the sales techniques they learned in training sessions and weekly sales meetings.  The Secretary also points out that the marketing representatives receive both formal and informal guidance about which products and product features to emphasize, and about the general points to make with agents.  Thus, the Secretary avers that rather than exercising discretion and independent judgment, these employees are simply making decisions within a given set of parameters, the type of work that would not qualify for the exemption.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as the district court found, the record simply does not support the Secretary's assertion.  These employees do not use prepared scripts or read from a required verbatim statement, nor do they operate within the contours of a prescribed technique or \"sales pitch\".  On the contrary, the content of a given conversation with an agent is dictated by the needs or customer base of that agent, or by the particular information sought by the marketing representative during that phone call.  Further, to the extent that the marketing representatives receive guidance about products to emphasize and suggested points to make with agents, they nonetheless exercise discretion in applying this instruction--for instance, in determining which agent may have an interest in that product, or in fashioning bid proposals that meet the needs of the agent's customers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  See Atlanta Professional Firefighters Union, Local 134 v. City of Atlanta, 920 F.2d 800, 805 (11th Cir.1991) (employees who retained \"discretion in implementing [the] directions\" of another meet discretion and independent judgment test).  In light of all this, we concur that the marketing representatives \"are not merely 'skilled' workers who operate within a strict set of rules.  Rather, they exercise significant discretion in their daily contacts with various insurance agents.\"  John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 423.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not commit error in finding that the primary duty of the marketing representatives \"includes work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment\" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  Therefore, we conclude that the second prong of the administrative exemption has been met in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we agree with the district court's determination that John Alden's marketing representatives are exempt administrative employees.

The particular question before the Court concerns whether the employees at issue, known as marketing representatives or marketing specialists (collectively, the \"marketing representatives\"), fall within the \"administrative employee\" exemption, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1), which provides that \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\" is excluded from the Act's overtime pay and recordkeeping provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Secretary of Labor (\"the Secretary\") filed this action against John Alden on May 4, 1995, seeking to enjoin the company from violating the FLSA's overtime and recordkeeping requirements with respect to the marketing representatives.  The parties submitted the case to the district court on stipulated facts and cross-motions for summary judgment, under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In a Memorandum and Order dated October 8, 1996, Judge Gorton found that the marketing representatives qualified as \"administrative employees\" under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1), and therefore denied the Secretary's motion and granted summary judgment in favor of John Alden.  See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></span>, 421-24 (D.Mass.1996).  For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the parties submitted this case to the district court on stipulated facts, and Judge Gorton provides a detailed account of the parties' stipulation in his memorandum.  See id. at 419-20.   Thus, for the purposes of this appeal the Court needs only to highlight those facts that are most relevant to the issue presented for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Alden is a Florida-based company that operates in several states, including Massachusetts, where it maintains an office in Westborough.  The company designs, creates, and sells various types of insurance products;  its customers are typically businesses, who purchase group coverage on behalf of their employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is the common practice in the industry, John Alden does not sell its products through direct contacts with customers, but instead relies on licensed independent insurance agents (\"agents\") to provide its customer base.  In general, an agent will recommend a variety of insurance products, including John Alden products and those of its competitors, to a prospective end-purchaser.  When a customer decides to purchase a John Alden product, the agent acts as an intermediary between the company and the end-purchaser to achieve completion of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary duty of the marketing representatives--the employees at issue here<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>--is to cultivate this independent agent sales force, and, thereby, ultimately to increase sales of John Alden products.  To this end, the marketing representatives maintain constant contact with agents.  Marketing representatives do not \"share\" agents with one another;  instead, each keeps a list or \"deck\" of agents with whom he or she is in contact.  The typical deck consists of 500-600 agents, and marketing representatives continually cull their decks to maintain an active agent base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an agent's primary contact with John Alden, a marketing representative is responsible for keeping his or her agents up to date on all aspects of John Alden's product line.  For instance, the marketing representatives keep their agents apprised of any new products or product combinations available from John Alden, and make their agents aware of any changes in the pricing of the company's products.  The marketing representatives also discuss how John Alden's products might meet the particular needs of an agent's current or prospective customers, and advise agents as to which John Alden products to market against competing products.  Often, they help their agents develop proposals for bidding on new business by recommending the appropriate combination of John Alden products to fit a prospective customer's needs.  To further educate their agents, marketing representatives sometimes pass along articles about the company and/or its competitors, or give small-group presentations about John Alden's products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dealing with agents, the marketing representatives do not use prepared scripts.  Further, although they receive guidance about suggested points of emphasis during an initial training period and at weekly sales meetings, these employees must decide for themselves which products to emphasize to a particular agent, and which of their agents to contact on a given day.  Thus, to make these decisions the marketing representatives must rely on their own knowledge of their agent decks and the specific needs of their agents' customers.  Consequently, they spend most of their time (approximately seven hours a day) on the phone with agents.  While most of these calls are made to agents with whom they are already familiar--to advise agents of new product developments, discuss current customer needs, or follow up on outstanding sales proposals--they also make some \"cold calls\" to agents in the deck with whom they are unfamiliar, both to acquaint the agents with John Alden and to learn about each agent's customer base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a customer ultimately decides to purchase a John Alden product, a marketing representative acts as a conduit between the agent and prospective purchaser, on the one hand, and John Alden's underwriting department, on the other.  Generally, the marketing representative sends an application to the agent, who meets with the customer to complete the necessary paperwork;  the agent then returns the completed application to the marketing representative, who in turn forwards it to the underwriting department.  While the application is pending, the marketing representative will sometimes gather the additional information needed in the approval process, such as medical records, or arrange medical tests for the purchasers' employees where such information is lacking.  Beyond this, however, the marketing representatives play no further role in the purchase transaction.  Thus, they do not set or negotiate prices or terms of insurance, nor do they have any authority to approve or deny an application, as this is done solely by the underwriting department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, marketing representatives are college graduates with two to six years of marketing experience.  An initial period of training at John Alden is supplemented with both formal and informal instruction from supervisors and more senior marketing representatives throughout their tenure at the company.  They also attend weekly sales meetings with a District Manager, where they learn about new products and exchange information about sales techniques they have found to be effective.  At these sales meetings, the marketing representatives also pass along any information they might have received from agents--for instance, information concerning a competitor's new products or prices, or about which new products are selling well--that might be helpful to the company in designing new products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marketing representatives work five days a week, typically working ten-hour days with a one-hour lunch break.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As noted earlier, they spend most of their time on the phone with agents, with the remaining time spent completing and reviewing paperwork related to these agent contacts.  On average, a first-year marketing representative will generate approximately $1.5 million in sales annually for the company, while a more experienced representative will be credited with approximately $3 million in sales each year.  The average annual compensation for a marketing representative is $50,000, and more senior representatives can earn as much as $75,000.  In addition to a base salary of $34,000 to $37,000, these employees earn quarterly incentive and bonus pay based on the number, value, and profit performance of the policies issued by the agents in their agent decks.  To further encourage sales, the company sets a quarterly sales goal for each marketing representative;  anyone who fails to meet this benchmark receives further training and counseling, and ultimately risks termination if this failure persists for two or more consecutive quarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1995, the Secretary commenced this action against John Alden pursuant to section 17 of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 217, seeking to enjoin the company from violating the overtime and recordkeeping provisions of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 207 and 211, respectively, and from withholding unpaid overtime wages due to the marketing representatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In its answer, John Alden asserted as an affirmative defense, inter alia, that the marketing representatives were exempt from the applicable regulations of the FLSA as \"administrative employees\" under section 13 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties submitted the case to the district court for decision on cross-motions for summary judgment, based on their stipulation of facts as described above.  It was undisputed that the marketing representatives routinely worked more than 40-hour workweeks without overtime pay and that the company did not keep records of the hours worked by each during a workweek.  Therefore, the only issue before the district court was whether the marketing representatives could be considered \"administrative employees\" under the FLSA.  In a Memorandum and Order dated October 8, 1996, the court concluded that the marketing representatives satisfied the Department of Labor's (\"DOL\") regulatory requirements for the administrative exemption, and therefore entered judgment in favor of John Alden.  See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></span> (D.Mass.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding these employees to be exempt, the court applied the regulatory \"short test\" for the administrative exemption, as set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  First, the court addressed whether a marketing representative's primary duty consists of \"[t]he performance of office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations,\" as required by &#167; 541.2(a)(1).  In concluding that this \"primary duty\" requirement had been met, the court first found that marketing representatives perform the administrative tasks of \"promoting sales\" and \"representing the company\" within the meaning of the DOL's interpretative regulations, see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(b).  The court thus rejected the Secretary's contention that, because they are concerned with securing sales for the company, marketing representatives perform non-administrative \"production\" work, the distinction drawn in &#167; 541.205(a).  See John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 421-22.   Completing its analysis of the \"primary duty\" requirement, the court went on to find that the work performed by the employees is of \"substantial importance to the management or operation of the business\" within the meaning of &#167;&#167; 541.205(a) and (c), noting that \"[t]he success of the company in New England depends in large part on the success of the marketing representatives who promote sales of John Alden products.\"  Id. at 422-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then turned to the second part of the short test, which provides that an exempt administrative employee must engage in work that requires the exercise of \"discretion and independent judgment.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  The court found that this requirement had been met on the facts before it as well, noting that marketing representatives exercise discretion and use their own judgment in deciding which agents to contact and which products to emphasize on a given day.  See id. at 423-24.   Thus, having found that both prongs of the short test had been satisfied, the court concluded that the marketing representatives qualified as administrative employees and were thus exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the entry of judgment in favor of John Alden, the Secretary filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.  The case is now in order for decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the standard for ruling on a motion for summary judgment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court must view all facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See Continental Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555048\"><a href=\"/opinion/555048/continental-casualty-co-v-canadian-universal-insurance-co-appeal-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 373 (1st Cir.1991).  When deciding cross-motions for summary judgment, the court must consider each motion separately, drawing inferences against each movant in turn.  See Blackie v. Maine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712176\"><a href=\"/opinion/712176/dana-blackie-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 721 (1st Cir.1996).  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no dispute as to any material fact and only questions of law remain.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the summary judgment standard requires the trial court to make a legal determination rather than to engage in factfinding, appellate review is generally governed by the de novo standard.  See National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195818\"><a href=\"/opinion/195818/national-amusements-v-town-of-dedham/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></span> (1995).  However, the particular procedural vehicle by which this case was decided by the district court requires some deviation from the norm.  As noted earlier, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts, with their legal arguments focused on the significance to be accorded to the agreed-upon facts.  Thus, in effect, the parties submitted this case to the district court as a case stated.  Cf. Equal Employment Opportunity Com'n v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195936\"><a href=\"/opinion/195936/eeoc-v-local-1066/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, 603 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span> (1995).  As this Court has stated in a similar case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[W]here, in a nonjury case, \"the basic dispute between the parties concerns the factual inferences ... that one might draw from the more basic facts to which the parties have drawn the court's attention,\" ... the district court is freed from the usual constraints that attend the adjudication of summary judgment motions.  Federacion De Empleados Tribunal General De Justicia v. Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443945\"><a href=\"/opinion/443945/federacion-de-empleados-del-tribunal-general-de-justicia-v-eulalio-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1984) (Breyer, J.).  The court may then engage in a certain amount of differential factfinding, including the sifting of inferences.  By the same token, the court of appeals may assume that \"the parties considered the matter to have been submitted below as a case ready for decision on the merits.\"  Id. Consequently, the standard for appellate oversight shifts from de novo review to clear-error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 603.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Steamship Clerks, in reaching its decision the lower court was required first to engage in some differential factfinding--i.e., the drawing of factual inferences from the stipulated facts--and then to make a legal determination based upon these facts.  Thus, this appeal involves both factual and legal determinations.  This Court will apply the more deferential clear-error standard when reviewing the factual inferences drawn by the court below, id., while the lower court's ultimate application of the law to the facts, both those stated and inferred, remains subject to de novo review.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parsing out the questions of fact from the ultimate legal conclusion, we are guided by our decision in Reich v. Newspapers of New England, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686722\"><a href=\"/opinion/686722/robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor-us-department-of-labor-v-newspapers/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), where the Court considered whether certain newspaper employees fell within the professional exemption to the FLSA's overtime pay provisions, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1).  Adopting the approach used by the Fifth Circuit in Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551500\"><a href=\"/opinion/551500/edward-w-dalheim-v-kdfw-tv/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>, 1226 (5th Cir.1990), this Court recognized that \"there are three distinct types of findings involved in determining whether an employee is exempt.\"  Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1073.   First, the court must make findings concerning the so-called \"historical facts\" of the case, such as determining an employee's day-to-day duties.  Id. Second, the court must draw factual inferences from these historical facts, for instance, to conclude whether these day-to-day duties require \"invention, imagination, or talent\" as required by applicable regulations.  Id. Finally, the trial court must reach the ultimate conclusion of whether an employee is exempt, based on both historical facts and factual inferences.  Id. Having separated out the lower court's determinations in this manner, we concluded that the first two types of findings, as essentially factual determinations, were subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.  Id. As for the district court's ultimate finding, we noted that \"[a]lthough this is based on both historical facts and factual inferences, it is a conclusion of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court will apply this framework in its review of the decision at issue here.  Of course, there are no \"first tier\" findings to review, as the historical facts were agreed upon in the parties' stipulation.  Accordingly, the factual inferences drawn by the district court from the stipulated facts will be reviewed for clear error, while the lower court's ultimate legal determination engenders plenary review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, while recognizing that the determination of whether an employee is exempt is clearly tied to the district court's inferential factfinding,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we remain acutely aware of our duty to engage in a thorough review of the record.  See id. at 1073.   Moreover, we must review the decision below to ensure that the court's factfinding was guided by the proper legal standards, as \"to the extent that findings of fact can be shown to have been predicated upon, or induced by, errors of law, they will be accorded diminished respect on appeal.\"  Dedham Water Co. v.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FLSA establishes, as a general rule, that employees must be compensated at a rate not less than one and one-half times their regular rate for all overtime hours.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 207(a)(1).  The Act further defines overtime as employment in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek.  Id. However, this overtime provision does not apply to \"any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity ... (as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary).\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 213(a)(1).  Of course, the remedial nature of the statute requires that FLSA exemptions be \"narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.\"  Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105994\"><a href=\"/opinion/105994/arnold-v-ben-kanowsky-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105994\"><a href=\"/opinion/105994/arnold-v-ben-kanowsky-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, it is the employer in an FLSA case that bears the ultimate burden of establishing that its employees fall within the exemption.

The regulations, promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of legislative authority, are to be given controlling weight unless found to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On the other hand, the interpretive regulations are not conclusive, as they merely set forth the Secretary's official position on how the regulations should be applied in specific contexts.

That regulation outlines both a short and a long test for determining whether an employee qualifies for the administrative exemption;  the short test is used for employees whose salaries are more than $250 per week.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  Since the parties have stipulated that the marketing representatives earn more than $250 per week, there is no dispute that the short test governs the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the short test, John Alden must demonstrate:  (1) that the primary duty of the marketing representative consists of \"[t]he performance of office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer or his employer's customers,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(A)(1),  AND (2)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that such primary duty \"includes work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).

In the parties' stipulation, the \"primary duty\" of the marketing representatives is described as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>to contact and deal with licensed independent insurance agents (\"agents\"), and related activities, to increase purchases of John Alden insurance products by end-purchasers who are in contact with the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there is no dispute that this statement describes \"office or nonmanual work,\" the only question that remains is whether this primary duty is \"directly related\" to John Alden's management policies or general business operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interpretative regulations concerning the administrative exemption are set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.201 through &#167; 541.215.  Of particular relevance is section 541.205, which specifically addresses the \"directly related to management policies or general business operations\" language under consideration.  Subsection 541.205(a) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The phrase \"directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer or his employer's customers\" describes those types of activities relating to the administrative operations of a business as distinguished from \"production\" or, in a retail or service establishment, \"sales\" work.  In addition to describing the types of activities, the phrase limits the exemption to persons who perform work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business of his employer or his employer's customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, &#167; 541.205(a) of the interpretations further subdivides the first prong of the short test into two subparts:  (1) the employee must be engaged in \"administrative\" rather than \"production\" activity;  and (2) this administrative activity must be of \"substantial importance\" to management or operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that both parts of this test had been satisfied, and thus concluded that the work of the marketing representatives was \"directly related\" to John Alden's business operations.  See John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 421-23.   As the Fifth Circuit has noted, \"[w]hether an employee's work is or should be deemed 'directly related' to business operations is an inference drawn from the historical facts.\"  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1230.   Thus, we review this finding for clear error.  Id.;  see also Newspapers of New England, 44 F.3d at 1073.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Administrative-Production Dichotomy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection 541.205(b) of the interpretations offers the following definition of \"administrative\" work:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>The administrative operations of the business include the work performed by so-called white collar employees engaged in \"servicing\" a business as, for example, advising the management, planning, negotiating, representing the company, purchasing, promoting sales, and business research and control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, applying the administrative-production dichotomy is not as simple as drawing the line between white-collar and blue-collar workers.  On the contrary, non-manufacturing employees can be considered \"production\" employees in those instances where their job is to generate (i.e., \"produce\") the very product or service that the employer's business offers to the public.  See, e.g., Reich v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628970\"><a href=\"/opinion/628970/robert-b-reich-secretary-of-the-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 587-89 (2d Cir.1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As stated in the stipulation of facts, John Alden is in the business of designing, creating, and selling insurance policies to the public.  It follows, as the district court properly recognized, that the \"products\" generated by John Alden are these insurance policies themselves.  As the marketing representatives are in no way involved in the design or generation of insurance policies, the very product \"that the enterprise exists to produce and market,\" Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1230, they cannot be considered production employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its arguments both to the lower court and on appeal, the Secretary has urged that the Third Circuit's decision in Martin v. Cooper Electric Supply Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566011\"><a href=\"/opinion/566011/lynn-martin-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></span> (1992), compels the conclusion that the employees at issue here are production employees.  However, both the district court and John Alden have properly distinguished Cooper Electric from the instant case.  The company at issue in Cooper Electric was a wholesaler that did not manufacture any products of its own, but instead sold products made by other firms.  Id. at 903.   Thus, the parties stipulated that the wholesaler's primary business purpose was to produce sales of electrical products.  Id. Since the employees at issue in Cooper Electric, the company's salespeople, worked to generate the very product that the company existed to market--sales of electrical products--the Third Circuit concluded that they were non-exempt production employees.  Id. at 903-04.   Of course, the facts of Cooper Electric are clearly distinguishable from this case, as John Alden does indeed generate a product, insurance policies, not merely sales of a product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to answer this argument, the Secretary points out that the stipulation of facts describes John Alden's business purpose as the design, creation, and sale of insurance policies.  Thus, the Secretary contends that, in addition to the production of insurance policies, John Alden also produces sales, and that any employee engaged in the generation of sales should be deemed non-exempt under the logic of Cooper Electric.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, Cooper Electric itself provides an effective counter.  In discussing the \"servicing\" component of the Secretary's interpretations, see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(b), the Third Circuit explained that \"servicing a business\" entailed \"employment activity ancillary to an employer's principal production activity.\"  Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d at 904 (emphasis in original).  In the instant case, the activities of the marketing representatives are clearly ancillary to John Alden's principal production activity--the creation of insurance policies--and therefore could be considered administrative \"servicing\" within the meaning of section 541.205(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court noted, the day-to-day activities of marketing representatives are more in the nature of \"representing the company\" and \"promoting sales\" of John Alden products, two examples of exempt administrative work provided by &#167; 541.205(b) of the interpretations.  As John Alden's primary contact with the insurance market (via agent contacts), marketing representatives represent the company by keeping the market informed of changes in John Alden's product offerings and pricing structure.  Further, by advising agents as to which of John Alden's products to market against competing products, and by helping them put together proposals for bidding on new business, marketing representatives are, again to quote Cooper Electric, engaged in \"something more than routine selling efforts focused simply on particular sales transactions.\"  Id. at 905.   Rather, their agent contacts are \"aimed at promoting (i.e., increasing, developing, facilitating, and/or maintaining) customer sales generally,\" id.  (emphasis in original), activity which is deemed administrative sales promotion work under section 541.205(b).  Therefore, there was no error in the district court's finding that John Alden's marketing representatives are engaged primarily in administrative rather than production work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>2. Substantial Importance to Management or Operations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to drawing the administrative-production work dichotomy, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(a) limits the \"directly related\" language to \"persons who perform work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business of his employer or his employer's customers.\"   Of course, employees who formulate management policies or oversee general business operations easily satisfy this \"substantial importance\" requirement.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c).  However, the interpretations make it clear that the exemption is not to be limited solely to so-called \"management\" personnel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>As used to describe work of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business, the phrase \"directly related to management policies or general business operations\" is not limited to persons who participate in the formulation of management policies or in the operation of the business as a whole.  Employees whose work is \"directly related\" to management policies or to general business operations include those [whose] work affects policy or whose responsibility it is to execute or carry it out.  The phrase also includes a wide variety of persons who either carry out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business, or whose work affects business operations to a substantial degree, even though their assignments are tasks related to the operation of a particular segment of the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c).  Examples of employees or positions that generally meet the \"substantial importance\" requirement include credit managers, claim agents and adjusters, wage-rate analysts, securities brokers, and promotion men.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)(5).  However, the particular title given to an employee is not determinative, as an employee's exempt status must instead be predicated on whether his or her duties and responsibilities meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.201(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying these interpretations, the district court first recognized that \"the work of the marketing representatives is critically important to John Alden's business,\" in that \"[t]he success of the company in New England depends in large part on the success of the marketing representatives who promote sales of John Alden products.\"  John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 422-23.   Having thus found that the marketing representatives were engaged in work that \"affects business operations to a substantial degree\"--one of the categories of work deemed to be of \"substantial importance\" under 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)--the district court concluded that their work met this prong of the test.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Secretary contends that, in applying the interpretations, the district court misconstrued the concept of \"substantial importance\" so as to require plenary review of this issue.  In short, the Secretary submits that the lower court improperly equated economic impact with substantial importance, so that if an employee's work contributes to an employer's financial well-being, that fact alone is sufficient to satisfy the substantial importance requirement.  If the court did indeed misconstrue the concept of \"substantial importance,\" then its factual inferences were drawn with the wrong legal standard in mind, and it would have erred as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that more than one circuit has held that \"[t]he financial effect of employee activity cannot alone show work of 'substantial importance to the management or operation' of an employer's business.\"  Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d at 906;  see also Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1231.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  As stated by the Fourth Circuit in Clark v. J.M. Benson Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469091\"><a href=\"/opinion/469091/martha-skidmore-clark-v-jm-benson-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1986), in assessing substantial importance it is necessary to look at \"the nature of the work, not its ultimate consequence.\"  Id. at 287 (emphasis in original).  Further, the interpretive regulations clearly dismiss the view that this requirement can be met simply by showing a link between poor performance and lost profits:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>A messenger boy who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money or securities cannot be said to be doing work of importance to the business even though serious consequences may flow from his neglect.  An employee operating very expensive equipment may cause serious loss to his employer by the improper performance of his duties....  But such employees, obviously, are not performing work of such substantial importance to the management or operation of the business that it can be said to be \"directly related to management policies or general business operations\" as that phrase is used in &#167; 541.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not expressly set forth the test in the above manner, our review of the district court's reasoning convinces us that these principles were taken into account in assessing substantial importance.  Contrary to the Secretary's assertion, the court did not simply equate \"substantial importance\" with financial impact.  Rather, after noting the economic significance of their sales promotion work, the court then proceeded to consider the nature of the work undertaken by the marketing representatives, which the court recognized required them to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>a) understand the nature of the evolving insurance market, b) grasp the subtleties of that market, c) familiarize themselves with their agents, their competitors and the needs of existing and prospective end-purchasers, and d) respond quickly in identifying and promoting a John Alden product when an agent contemplates a particular competitive product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 423.   In light of this, we are satisfied that the district court did not misconstrue the nature of the \"substantial importance\" inquiry, as it considered the nature of the employee's work as well as the consequences of that work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Accordingly, because the district court was operating within the proper legal framework, we will review its inferential factfinding on this issue for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record finds ample support for the lower court's conclusion.  First and foremost, as John Alden's primary contact with the independent agents, marketing representatives are the insurance market's principle source for information about John Alden and its products.  Moreover, in the course of their daily activities, these employees gather information about their agents, the agents' customers, and the insurance market as a whole--such as information about changes in consumer needs, or regarding the success of certain competitors' offerings.  The marketing representatives must then use all of this information both to pique their agents' interest in John Alden, and to suggest products or product combinations that an agent's customers might find attractive.  In addition, the marketing representatives can pass along the information they have compiled to their supervisors, who later relay the same to John Alden's management, who can then factor it into decisions on new product designs and offerings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is certainly reasonable to draw the inference that this type of work, both by its nature and in its consequence, would affect John Alden's business operations to a substantial degree.  Indeed, it would appear that work of this nature--disseminating information to the marketplace, understanding customers and competitors, and gathering available information to be used in putting together proposals and packages that are appropriate for those customers--is directly related to operations, and at the heart of John Alden's business success.  As such, we find no error in the district court's conclusion on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the Secretary attaches some significance to the fact that John Alden employs a number of marketing representatives in this region, stressing that the collective economic impact of a group of employees is insufficient to satisfy the substantial importance requirement.  See Cooper Electric, 940 F.2d at 906.   However, the Secretary's own interpretative regulations provide a sufficient rejoinder:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>The fact that there are a number of other employees of the same employer carrying out assignments of the same relative importance or performing identical work does not affect the determination of whether they meet this test so long as the work of each such employee is of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c)(6).  In the instant case, we find that the work of each marketing representative, standing alone, has a substantial effect on John Alden's business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  As set out in the parties' stipulation, the sixteen marketing representatives currently employed in the regional office are responsible for the promotion of the company's products throughout all of New England (minus Connecticut).  Moreover, each marketing representative is individually responsible for a deck of 500-600 agents, with each deck generating, on average, from $1.5 million to $3 million in sales annually.  In light of all this, we have little difficulty in finding that each individual marketing representative carries out a \"major assignment[ ] in conducting the operations of the business,\" and \"affects business operations to a substantial degree\" through his or her own sales promotion activities.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.205(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was not clearly wrong in finding that the marketing representatives are engaged in administrative work of substantial importance to John Alden's business operations.  Accordingly, we agree that these employees are engaged in administrative work \"directly related to management policies or general business operations,\" as required under the first prong of the short test, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(a)(1).  We now turn to the court's analysis of the \"discretion and independent judgment\" part of the test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>B. Work Requiring Discretion and Independent Judgment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the second prong of the short test, John Alden must demonstrate that its marketing representatives are engaged in work that requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  The Secretary's interpretations elaborate on this requirement as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>In general, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.  The term ..., moreover, implies that the person has the authority or power to make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision and with respect to matters of significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(a).  The interpretations further advise that \"the discretion and independent judgment exercised must be real and substantial, that is, they must be exercised with respect to matters of consequence.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(1).  However, the exempt employee need not have final decisionmaking authority over such matters;  \"[e]ven though an employee's work is subject to approval, even to the extent that a decision may be reversed by higher level management, it does not follow that the work did not require the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.\"  Dymond v. United States Postal Serv., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399190\"><a href=\"/opinion/399190/gregory-b-dymond-and-samuel-k-gibbons-v-united-states-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 96 (8th Cir.1982);  see also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, and we agree, that the marketing representatives exercise discretion and independent judgment in carrying out their duties.  It is undisputed that these employees have discretion in choosing which agents to contact on any given day, and concerning which products to discuss with each agent.  In addition, the marketing representatives rely on their own knowledge of an agent's business to help tailor proposals for the agent's end-customers.  Further, they must be able to anticipate the competing products that the agent's customers might be considering, and distinguish John Alden's offerings from those of competitors.  Thus, there is clear support in the record for the district court's conclusion that John Alden's marketing representatives exercise discretion and independent judgment in the course of their day-to-day agent contacts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While recognizing that the marketing representatives do exercise some discretion in their dealings with agents, the Secretary argues that this discretion is not exercised with respect to \"matters of consequence\" within the meaning of the interpretive regulations.  However, the matters on which these employees exercise their discretion and judgment--which agent would be in the best position to sell a given product, and which products would be most attractive to a given customer--would certainly appear to be \"of consequence\" to John Alden's business.  Indeed, this work would seem to be of equal or greater importance than some of the work the Secretary's interpretations identify as exempt, such as the duties of an administrative assistant to an executive,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> or those of a customer's man in a brokerage house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(2).  Thus, we will not upset the district court's decision on this ground.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary also contends that the lower court committed error by mistaking the mere \"use of skill in applying techniques, procedures, or specific standards,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(b), for the required discretion and independent judgment.  The Secretary submits that the marketing representatives, in informing agents and persuading them to recommend John Alden products, are simply applying the sales techniques they learned in training sessions and weekly sales meetings.  The Secretary also points out that the marketing representatives receive both formal and informal guidance about which products and product features to emphasize, and about the general points to make with agents.  Thus, the Secretary avers that rather than exercising discretion and independent judgment, these employees are simply making decisions within a given set of parameters, the type of work that would not qualify for the exemption.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as the district court found, the record simply does not support the Secretary's assertion.  These employees do not use prepared scripts or read from a required verbatim statement, nor do they operate within the contours of a prescribed technique or \"sales pitch\".  On the contrary, the content of a given conversation with an agent is dictated by the needs or customer base of that agent, or by the particular information sought by the marketing representative during that phone call.  Further, to the extent that the marketing representatives receive guidance about products to emphasize and suggested points to make with agents, they nonetheless exercise discretion in applying this instruction--for instance, in determining which agent may have an interest in that product, or in fashioning bid proposals that meet the needs of the agent's customers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  See Atlanta Professional Firefighters Union, Local 134 v. City of Atlanta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552454\"><a href=\"/opinion/552454/atlanta-professional-firefighters-union-local-134-larry-r-atchley-curley/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 805 (11th Cir.1991) (employees who retained \"discretion in implementing [the] directions\" of another meet discretion and independent judgment test).  In light of all this, we concur that the marketing representatives \"are not merely 'skilled' workers who operate within a strict set of rules.  Rather, they exercise significant discretion in their daily contacts with various insurance agents.\"  John Alden, 940 F.Supp. at 423.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not commit error in finding that the primary duty of the marketing representatives \"includes work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment\" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.2(e)(2).  Therefore, we conclude that the second prong of the administrative exemption has been met in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we agree with the district court's determination that John Alden's marketing representatives are exempt administrative employees.  Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All of the marketing representatives at issue in this case work in John Alden's Westborough, Massachusetts office</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although John Alden does not maintain records of the hours worked by its marketing representatives, the parties have stipulated that they average more than 40 hours per week</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Specifically, the Secretary seeks to recover unpaid overtime wages owed to 29 marketing representatives, 16 of whom were still employed at John Alden at the time of the suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As the Fifth Circuit has noted, \"[i]n the great majority of cases, the district court's findings of fact and the inferences it draws, if carefully set forth and supported by the record, will all but compel the legal conclusion that a given employee is or is not exempt.  Absent some fundamental legal error, those conclusions will usually stand undisturbed on appeal.\"  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1226-27</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To be more precise, the first prong of the short test set forth at &#167; 541.2(e)(2) requires that the \"primary duty consists of the performance of work described in paragraph (a) of this section.\"   For the sake of simplicity, the Court has quoted directly from paragraph (a) in setting out the short test</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In the context of a retail or service establishment, section 541.205(a) expressly provides that \"sales\" work is not administrative.  However, as the Secretary recognizes, insurance companies are not retail or service establishments within the meaning of the FLSA, see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 779.316, and thus this provision is inapplicable to the present case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In Dalheim, the employer argued for substantial importance by stressing that \"if a producer performs poorly, KDFW's bottom line might suffer.\"  Dalheim, 918 F.2d at 1231.   The Court held that \"[a]s a matter of law, that is insufficient to establish the direct relationship required by &#167; 541.2 by virtue of the 'substantial importance' contemplated by &#167; 541.205(c).\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> While recognizing the Fourth Circuit's statement that \"[t]he regulations emphasize the nature of the work, not its ultimate consequence,\" J.M. Benson, 789 F.2d at 287 (emphasis in original), we would find it difficult to conclude that a certain kind of work was \"substantially important\" to business operations without also considering the consequences of that work</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> It is unclear from the district court's discussion whether it considered the consequences of the marketing representatives' work individually or as a whole.  Thus, we consider this issue based upon our own review of the record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> \"The regulations ... contemplate the kind of discretion and independent judgment exercised by an administrative assistant to an executive, who without specific instruction or prescribed procedures, arranges interviews and meetings, and handles callers and meetings himself where the executive's personal attention is not required.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(2)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The test includes \"the kind of discretion and independent judgment exercised by a customer's man in a brokerage house in deciding what recommendations to make to a customer for the purchase of securities.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> As the district court noted, the work of the marketing representatives does not at all resemble the given examples of nonexempt work where discretion is exercised on matters of relatively little consequence:  i.e., a truck driver's decision on which route to follow;  a shipping clerk's decision on the method of packing and mode of shipment;  and a bookkeeper's decision on whether to post to one ledger or another first.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(1)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The interpretive regulations offer the following examples of work in which skill in applying standards or techniques can be mistaken for discretion:  inspectors who develop facts to assess whether prescribed standards have been met;  lumber \"graders\" who inspect each \"stick\" and then place each into a well-defined grading category;  personnel clerks who screen applications and reject those that do not meet prescribed minimum requirements.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(c)(1)-(6)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> By way of comparison, the Court notes that a \"customer's man in a brokerage house\" likely receives similar training about product features and points of emphasis.  Under the interpretive regulations, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.207(d)(2), this employee exercises the requisite discretion when he or she applies this guidance to make a recommendation to a customer for a securities purchase</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
