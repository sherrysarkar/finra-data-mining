Finding no  clear error in  the court's sentencing\r\n\ndetermination, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n            Pertinent Facts and Prior Proceedings\r                        Pertinent Facts and Prior Proceedings\r                                                             \r\n\n          The  facts as set forth  in the plea agreement, and\r\n\nto  which the parties agreed  at the change  of plea hearing,\r\n\nare as follows.  On August 21, 1995, postal employees at  the\r\n\nHato  Rey Post Office in  San Juan, Puerto  Rico, noticed two\r\n\nsuspicious Express  Mail parcels addressed to  Rochester, New\r\n\nYork.   Upon investigation, both return  addresses were found\r\n\nto be nonexistent.   In addition, a U.S. Customs  Canine Unit\r\n\ndetected  the  presence of  a  controlled  substance in  both\r\n\npackages.   Pursuant to a search warrant, the contents of the\r\n\npackages  were field  tested  and determined  to be  cocaine.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nPostal  agents forwarded  one  package (\"package  No. 1\")  to\r\n\nRochester,  New  York  for  a controlled  delivery.    Postal\r\n\ninspectors retained the other package (\"package No. 2\") for a\r\n\npossible \"reverse delivery.\"\r\n\n          Surprisingly, three days later  Otero-Rolon decided\r\n\nto effectuate the reverse delivery.  Armed with  the customer\r\n\ncopy of the Express  Mail receipt, he claimed and  signed for\r\n\npackage No.  2, which the authorities  had already determined\r\n\ncontained approximately three kilograms  of cocaine.  At that\r\n\ntime, a postal inspector surveilling the customer parking lot\r\n\noutside  the post  office noticed Gonzalez-Vega  loitering at\r\n\nthe facility's  exit doors.   Gonzalez-Vega then  entered the\r\n\npost office  and made eye contact with  Otero-Rolon.  Moments\r\n\nlater, both men exited  with package No. 2.   Agents arrested\r\n\nthe two men and subsequently charged them with respect to the\r\n\ndrugs  in  that  package.    Post  office  clerks  identified\r\n\nGonzalez-Vega as  the  person who  mailed package  No. 1  and\r\n\nOtero-Rolon as the person who mailed package No. 2.\r\n\n          Thereafter, both men pleaded  guilty pursuant to  a\r\n\nplea  agreement in  which the  parties stipulated  to various\r\n\nsentencing recommendations,  including: a base  offense level\r\n\nof 28 under  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1, a three  level reduction  for\r\n\ntheir  mitigating roles  in  the offense,  and an  additional\r\n\nthree level reduction for  acceptance of responsibility.  The\r\n\nplea  agreement acknowledged  possible further relief  if the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ndefendants met  the criteria contained in  the \"safety valve\"\r\n\nprovision.  See 18 U.S.C.   3553(f)(1)-(5); U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.\r                           \r\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the district court found\r\n\nthe  stipulated base  offense level and  downward adjustments\r\n\napplicable to the defendants.  The court determined, however,\r\n\nthat   neither   Gonzalez-Vega  nor   Otero-Rolon  truthfully\r\n\nprovided   the  government  all  information  concerning  the\r\n\noffense,   as   required   by   18   U.S.C.       3553(f)(5).\r\n\nConsequently,  the court declined  to afford either defendant\r\n\nany relief  from the statutory minimum  term of imprisonment.\r\n\nThis appeal ensued.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Gonzalez-Vega  and  Otero-Rolon   argue  that   the\r\n\ndistrict  court clearly erred in finding  that they failed to\r\n\nmeet the five  criteria listed in the safety valve provision.\r\n\nThat provision, if applicable, requires a sentencing court to\r\n\ndisregard the statutorily  imposed mandatory minimum sentence\r\n\nand impose  sentence pursuant  to the Sentencing  Guidelines.\r\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.    3553(f).  The government concedes  that both\r               \r\n\nmen met  the first  four of  the criteria.   See 18  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n3553(f)(1)-(4).   In  dispute is  the fifth  criterion, which\r\n\nrequires   a  defendant  to   \"truthfully  provide[]  to  the\r                                                     \r\n\nGovernment all  information and evidence  the defendant  has\"\r                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nregarding  the  offense.   18  U.S.C.    3553(f)(5) (emphasis\r\n\nadded).1\r\n\n          In order  to qualify  for safety valve  relief, the\r\n\ndefendant  must persuade the court  that he meets  all of the\r\n\nrequirements.   See United States  v. Montanez, 82  F.3d 520,\r                                                          \r\n\n523 (1st Cir. 1996).  We review  for clear error the district\r\n\ncourt's  factual  determinations   underlying  the   question\r\n\nwhether a defendant is  entitled to such relief.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 527 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                      \r\n\n\"Where  there  is  more  than  one   plausible  view  of  the\r\n\ncircumstances,   the   sentencing   court's    choice   among\r\n\nsupportable  alternatives  cannot   be  clearly   erroneous.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. D'Andrea, 107 F.3d 949, 958 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                                     \r\n\n          Previously, we have found clear error in the denial\r\n\nof safety  valve relief where  \"the government did  not rebut\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In full, the fifth criterion requires that\r\n\n          not later than the time of the sentencing\r\n          hearing,  the  defendant  has  truthfully\r\n          provided    to    the   Government    all\r\n          information  and  evidence the  defendant\r\n          has  concerning  the offense  or offenses\r\n          that were  part  of the  same  course  of\r\n          conduct or  of a  common scheme  or plan,\r\n          but the  fact that the  defendant has  no\r\n          relevant or useful  other information  to\r\n          provide or that the Government is already\r\n          aware  of  the   information  shall   not\r\n          preclude  a  determination  by the  court\r\n          that the defendant has complied with this\r\n          requirement.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3553(f)(5).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n[defendant's]  facially plausible tale of limited involvement\r\n\nby pointing to information  [the] defendant must have known.\"\r\n\nMiranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at 529.  Thus, a sentencing court's\r                            \r\n\n\"bare  conclusion\"  that the  defendant  failed to  cooperate\r\n\nwithin the meaning of   3553(f)(5) is insufficient to support\r\n\nsuch a  finding \"absent  either specific factual  findings or\r\n\neasily recognizable support in the record.\"  Id.\r                                                            \r\n\n          We  consider  the facts  and legal  challenges with\r\n\nrespect to each defendant in turn.\r\n\nA.  Otero-Rolon\r                           \r\n\n          At his  change  of plea  hearing  and in  his  plea\r\n\nagreement,   Otero-Rolon  admitted   that   a  postal   clerk\r\n\nidentified  him  as having  mailed package  No.  2.   The day\r\n\nbefore the sentencing hearing,  however, at a debriefing with\r\n\nthe  government, he denied that  he mailed the  package.  The\r\n\ncourt found the later denial incredible and concluded that it\r\n\ncreated  the   likelihood  of  an   absence  of   information\r\n\nconcerning the  identity of the person who supplied the drugs\r\n\nand  other particulars  surrounding the  package.   Presented\r\n\nwith Otero-Rolon's recantation, the resulting factual vacuum,\r\n\nand other  inconsistencies in his informative  proffers,2 the\r\n\ndistrict  court  found that  Otero-Rolon  did  not truthfully\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  For  example, Otero-Rolon originally  told the government\r\nthat  Gonzalez-Vega  asked him  to pick  up the  Express Mail\r\npackage, then  later stated  that an acquaintance  he chanced\r\nupon  at a shopping mall hired the two defendants to retrieve\r\nthe parcel.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nprovide all information to  the government within the meaning\r\n\nof    3553(f)(5).  See United  States v. Wrenn, 66  F.3d 1, 3\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (explaining  that defendant failed to provide\r\n\n\"all\"  information regarding  convicted offense  where, after\r\n\nclaiming to have numerous drug customers, defendant \"supplied\r\n\nnary a name to the government\").\r\n\n          Unlike  the  sentencing court  in Miranda-Santiago,\r                                                                        \r\n\nhere, the court  identified specific and supportable  reasons\r\n\nfor concluding  that  Otero-Rolon was  neither  truthful  nor\r\n\ncompletely    forthcoming     in    providing    information.\r\n\nFurthermore,  contrary to the defendant's proffer in Miranda-\r                                                                         \r\n\nSantiago,  Otero-Rolon's later  denials and  new explanations\r                    \r\n\nrendered  his inexplicit  final  version  implausible on  its\r\n\nface.  While the court could have found that Otero-Rolon had,\r\n\nin  the  end,  provided  the government  with  all  pertinent\r\n\ninformation he had, its rejection of that conclusion reflects\r\n\na readily plausible view of the evidence.  Therefore, we find\r\n\nno  clear error  in  the court's  factual determination  that\r\n\nOtero-Rolon did not meet the fifth  requirement of the safety\r\n\nvalve provision.3 \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Otero-Rolon suggests  that the district  court denied him\r\nthe opportunity  to provide  further relevant  information at\r\nhis sentencing  hearing.   He  also intimates  that, had  the\r\ncourt queried  him, it would  have found credible  his latest\r\nversion  of the facts surrounding the offense.  Our review of\r\nthe  record  shows  otherwise.   At  the  hearing, the  court\r\ndirectly  asked  Otero-Rolon  whether   or  not  he  had  any\r\ninformation  to present other than that found in his previous\r\nsubmissions.   Otero-Rolon replied that he did not.  The fact\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nB.  Gonzalez-Vega\r                             \r\n\n          Like  Otero-Rolon,  Gonzalez-Vega  asserts that  he\r\n\ntruthfully disclosed all information that he might reasonably\r\n\nhave been expected to possess.  Our review of Gonzalez-Vega's\r\n\ncontention that  the court's findings were clearly erroneous,\r\n\nhowever,  is  severely hindered  by  his  failure to  provide\r\n\ncopies of  the sentencing  hearing transcript.

On August 21, 1995, postal employees at  the\r\n\nHato  Rey Post Office in  San Juan, Puerto  Rico, noticed two\r\n\nsuspicious Express  Mail parcels addressed to  Rochester, New\r\n\nYork.   Upon investigation, both return  addresses were found\r\n\nto be nonexistent.   In addition, a U.S. Customs  Canine Unit\r\n\ndetected  the  presence of  a  controlled  substance in  both\r\n\npackages.   Pursuant to a search warrant, the contents of the\r\n\npackages  were field  tested  and determined  to be  cocaine.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nPostal  agents forwarded  one  package (\"package  No. 1\")  to\r\n\nRochester,  New  York  for  a controlled  delivery.    Postal\r\n\ninspectors retained the other package (\"package No. 2\") for a\r\n\npossible \"reverse delivery.\"\r\n\n          Surprisingly, three days later  Otero-Rolon decided\r\n\nto effectuate the reverse delivery.  Armed with  the customer\r\n\ncopy of the Express  Mail receipt, he claimed and  signed for\r\n\npackage No.  2, which the authorities  had already determined\r\n\ncontained approximately three kilograms  of cocaine.  At that\r\n\ntime, a postal inspector surveilling the customer parking lot\r\n\noutside  the post  office noticed Gonzalez-Vega  loitering at\r\n\nthe facility's  exit doors.   Gonzalez-Vega then  entered the\r\n\npost office  and made eye contact with  Otero-Rolon.  Moments\r\n\nlater, both men exited  with package No. 2.   Agents arrested\r\n\nthe two men and subsequently charged them with respect to the\r\n\ndrugs  in  that  package.    Post  office  clerks  identified\r\n\nGonzalez-Vega as  the  person who  mailed package  No. 1  and\r\n\nOtero-Rolon as the person who mailed package No. 2.\r\n\n          Thereafter, both men pleaded  guilty pursuant to  a\r\n\nplea  agreement in  which the  parties stipulated  to various\r\n\nsentencing recommendations,  including: a base  offense level\r\n\nof 28 under  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1, a three  level reduction  for\r\n\ntheir  mitigating roles  in  the offense,  and an  additional\r\n\nthree level reduction for  acceptance of responsibility.  The\r\n\nplea  agreement acknowledged  possible further relief  if the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ndefendants met  the criteria contained in  the \"safety valve\"\r\n\nprovision.  See 18 U.S.C.   3553(f)(1)-(5); U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.\r                           \r\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the district court found\r\n\nthe  stipulated base  offense level and  downward adjustments\r\n\napplicable to the defendants.  The court determined, however,\r\n\nthat   neither   Gonzalez-Vega  nor   Otero-Rolon  truthfully\r\n\nprovided   the  government  all  information  concerning  the\r\n\noffense,   as   required   by   18   U.S.C.       3553(f)(5).\r\n\nConsequently,  the court declined  to afford either defendant\r\n\nany relief  from the statutory minimum  term of imprisonment.\r\n\nThis appeal ensued.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Gonzalez-Vega  and  Otero-Rolon   argue  that   the\r\n\ndistrict  court clearly erred in finding  that they failed to\r\n\nmeet the five  criteria listed in the safety valve provision.\r\n\nThat provision, if applicable, requires a sentencing court to\r\n\ndisregard the statutorily  imposed mandatory minimum sentence\r\n\nand impose  sentence pursuant  to the Sentencing  Guidelines.\r\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.    3553(f).  The government concedes  that both\r               \r\n\nmen met  the first  four of  the criteria.   See 18  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n3553(f)(1)-(4).   In  dispute is  the fifth  criterion, which\r\n\nrequires   a  defendant  to   \"truthfully  provide[]  to  the\r                                                     \r\n\nGovernment all  information and evidence  the defendant  has\"\r                          \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nregarding  the  offense.   18  U.S.C.    3553(f)(5) (emphasis\r\n\nadded).1\r\n\n          In order  to qualify  for safety valve  relief, the\r\n\ndefendant  must persuade the court  that he meets  all of the\r\n\nrequirements.

The day\r\n\nbefore the sentencing hearing,  however, at a debriefing with\r\n\nthe  government, he denied that  he mailed the  package.  The\r\n\ncourt found the later denial incredible and concluded that it\r\n\ncreated  the   likelihood  of  an   absence  of   information\r\n\nconcerning the  identity of the person who supplied the drugs\r\n\nand  other particulars  surrounding the  package.

For  example, Otero-Rolon originally  told the government\r\nthat  Gonzalez-Vega  asked him  to pick  up the  Express Mail\r\npackage, then  later stated  that an acquaintance  he chanced\r\nupon  at a shopping mall hired the two defendants to retrieve\r\nthe parcel.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nprovide all information to  the government within the meaning\r\n\nof    3553(f)(5).

While the court could have found that Otero-Rolon had,\r\n\nin  the  end,  provided  the government  with  all  pertinent\r\n\ninformation he had, its rejection of that conclusion reflects\r\n\na readily plausible view of the evidence.  Therefore, we find\r\n\nno  clear error  in  the court's  factual determination  that\r\n\nOtero-Rolon did not meet the fifth  requirement of the safety\r\n\nvalve provision.3 \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Otero-Rolon suggests  that the district  court denied him\r\nthe opportunity  to provide  further relevant  information at\r\nhis sentencing  hearing.   He  also intimates  that, had  the\r\ncourt queried  him, it would  have found credible  his latest\r\nversion  of the facts surrounding the offense.  Our review of\r\nthe  record  shows  otherwise.   At  the  hearing, the  court\r\ndirectly  asked  Otero-Rolon  whether   or  not  he  had  any\r\ninformation  to present other than that found in his previous\r\nsubmissions.   Otero-Rolon replied that he did not.  The fact\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nB.  Gonzalez-Vega\r                             \r\n\n          Like  Otero-Rolon,  Gonzalez-Vega  asserts that  he\r\n\ntruthfully disclosed all information that he might reasonably\r\n\nhave been expected to possess.  Our review of Gonzalez-Vega's\r\n\ncontention that  the court's findings were clearly erroneous,\r\n\nhowever,  is  severely hindered  by  his  failure to  provide\r\n\ncopies of  the sentencing  hearing transcript.   See Fed.  R.\r                                                                \r\n\nApp. P. 10(b)(2)  (requiring appellant to provide  transcript\r\n\nwhen  challenging  a  finding  on the  basis  of  evidentiary\r\n\ninsufficiency).

At oral argument before this court, Gonzalez-Vega claimed\r\nthat the  district court erroneously denied  him the benefits\r\nof  the safety  valve  provision because  the information  he\r\nwithheld from  the government concerned conduct  unrelated to\r\nthe charged  offense.
