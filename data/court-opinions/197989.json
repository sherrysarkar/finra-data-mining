Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Selya, Boudin and Lynch, \r\n\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nBrian R. Cunha with whom Brian Cunha &amp; Associates was on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\nMary O'Neil, First Assistant Corporation Counsel, Law\r\nDepartment, for appellees City of Fall River and Richard Levesque.\r\nAndrew B. Peppard and Borders, Littman &amp; Peppard on brief for\r\nappellee Richard Levesque.\r\nWilliam G. Camara with whom William G. Camara, P.C. was on\r\nbrief for appellee Raymond Paradis.\r\n\nJune 4, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Roger Ringuette brought this\r\naction in the district court against the City of Fall River and\r\nseveral police officers for medical injuries that he suffered,\r\nthrough inattention by the police, while he was in police custody. \r\nHe recovered a judgment against the city for negligence, but the\r\ndistrict court dismissed on qualified immunity grounds a \"Fourth\r\nAmendment\" claim against two police officers.\r\nSave in one significant respect, the background facts\r\npertinent to the appeal are undisputed.  On July 27, 1992, at about\r\n7 p.m., police in Fall River, Massachusetts, responded to a report\r\nof a disabled person and found Ringuette slumped over a car in a\r\nstupor.  According to the officers, Ringuette was unsteady on his\r\nfeet, had bloodshot eyes, and smelled of alcohol.  Believing him to\r\nbe drunk, the police asked if he wanted a ride home.  He replied,\r\n\"to my brother's\" but gave no address.  Asked if he wanted to go to\r\n\"detox,\" he gave the same answer.\r\nLater evidence indicates that Ringuette was suffering\r\nfrom an overdose of prescription pills, although the police did not\r\nknow this at any relevant time.  Not knowing how to contact\r\nRinguette's brother, the police took Ringuette into protective\r\ncustody pursuant to the Massachusetts Alcoholism Treatment and\r\nRehabilitation Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111B,  8.  The police\r\nhandcuffed him, put him in the police car and drove him to the\r\nstation.\r\nUnder section 8 of the Act, a person incapacitated by\r\nalcohol is to be taken with or without his consent to his own\r\nresidence, to a treatment facility, or to a police station.  If\r\ntaken to a police station, the officer in charge is to transfer him\r\nto the nearest treatment facility, if available.  The statute\r\ncontinues:\r\nNo person assisted to a police station\r\npursuant to this section shall be held in\r\nprotective custody against his will; provided,\r\nhowever, that if suitable treatment at a\r\n[treatment] facility is not available, an\r\nincapacitated person may be held in protective\r\ncustody at a police station until he is no\r\nlonger incapacitated or for a period not\r\nlonger than twelve hours, whichever is\r\nshorter.\r\n\nIn fact, Ringuette remained at the facility for more than\r\ntwelve hours--whether he was \"held\" after twelve hours is a\r\ndifferent question--and during this period he suffered serious\r\ninjury.  Ringuette was booked into the police station at 7:19 p.m.\r\nand assisted to a cell which was neither monitored by video camera\r\nnor directly observable by the booking officer.  No call was made\r\nto the local treatment center; but according to later evidence, no\r\nbed was then available, and the center had not admitted anyone from\r\nthe police station on short notice in the previous seven years.  \r\nDuring the night of July 27-28, Ringuette was monitored\r\nby an officer at 15-minute intervals, as required by department\r\nregulations.  According to the officer, at around 5 a.m., the\r\nofficer found Ringuette standing in his cell and asked if he was\r\nready to be released; in reply, Ringuette swore at him.  The\r\nofficer further testified that at the officer's last check, at 6:20\r\na.m., Ringuette said he was not ready to leave and was told that he\r\nwould nevertheless be released when the officer of the next shift\r\ncame on in about 15 minutes.\r\nOfficer Paradis, one of the three individuals named as a\r\ndefendant in this case, took over as booking officer at 6:50 a.m.\r\non July 28 and was told of the prior conversation with Ringuette. \r\nParadis knew Ringuette from prior periods of protective custody. \r\nAccording to Paradis, shortly after he came on duty, he asked\r\nRinguette if he wanted to leave, and Ringuette replied in \"slurred\"\r\nspeech:  \"I've got nowhere to go and I'm still half in the bag.\" \r\nTold of these events, Sergeant Levesque, who was then the\r\nsupervising sergeant, authorized Paradis to fill out a second\r\nprotective custody form, although the statute makes no reference to\r\na second form and provides for protective custody \"for a period of\r\nnot longer than twelve hours.\"\r\nIt appears that Paradis then checked on Ringuette only a\r\ncouple of times in the succeeding eight hours between 7 a.m. and\r\n3 p.m., when Paradis was relieved by another officer.  Throughout\r\nhis time at the police station, Ringuette was given neither food\r\nnor water, despite the department handbook's policy requiring the\r\nfeeding of persons kept in protective custody for more than five\r\nhours.  At around 3 p.m., a new officer took over and found\r\nRinguette sitting and then lying on the floor.  At this point,\r\nRinguette refused food and mumbled incoherently.\r\nFinally, at around 6 p.m. on the evening of July 28,\r\nafter Ringuette had been in the cell for almost 24 hours, the\r\npolice officer on duty realized that Ringuette was moaning and\r\nmaking gurgling noises.  Levesque called a medical technician who\r\narrived almost immediately and found that Ringuette was in a state\r\nof shock, lying motionless in a pool of vomit, with eyes dilated\r\nand  his pulse racing.  At the hospital, doctors found him to be in\r\nsevere shock--that is, having no measurable blood pressure--\r\nseverely dehydrated with several vital bodily functions impaired,\r\nand suffering from a drug overdose of prescription pills and from\r\nfirst and second degree burns (which are unexplained).  \r\nRinguette now suffers from seriously impaired use of his\r\nleft arm and left leg, caused by \"compartmental syndrome.\"  This is\r\na muscle-tissue condition associated with tissue compression, in\r\nthis case due to lying in the same position for a long period and\r\ncompounded by the drug overdose.  Expert testimony at trial\r\nindicated that the condition likely occurred within three to six\r\nhours prior to the technician's arrival.  In the aftermath, Police\r\nChief McDonald filed charges against Paradis and Levesque and after\r\na hearing, both were found liable of derelictions.\r\nOn June 2, 1993, Ringuette filed a 17-count complaint in\r\nthe district court, asserting various state law claims and federal\r\nclaims under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  The defendants named in the\r\ncomplaint were the city, Chief McDonald, officer Paradis and\r\nSergeant Levesque.  On summary judgment, defendants obtained a\r\ndismissal of a number of claims, Ringuette v. City of Fall River,\r\n888 F. Supp. 258 (D. Mass. 1995), but several claims were reserved\r\nfor trial, and the issue of qualified immunity was not resolved. \r\nThis summary judgment decision is not directly challenged on this\r\nappeal, and we confine ourselves solely to the remaining claims\r\nthat were not then dismissed on summary judgment.\r\nAfter the summary judgment decision, the claim against\r\nthe city for negligence was left standing (state law barred such a\r\nclaim against the police officers).  McDonald had been dismissed\r\nfrom the case on summary judgment, but two constitutional claims\r\nremained against Paradis and Levesque:  a so-called \"Fourth\r\nAmendment\" claim based on unlawful seizure, and a claim under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment's due process clause for deliberate\r\nindifference to Ringuette's medical needs while in police \r\ncustody.  As to these claims, the district court said that it\r\ncould not resolve qualified immunity issues without factfinding and\r\nsent the claims to trial.  888 F. Supp. at 266, 270.\r\nThe case was tried over a number of days in October and\r\nNovember, 1995.  After the evidence was presented but before\r\nsubmitting the case to the jury, the court withdrew the Fourth\r\nAmendment claim on qualified immunity grounds, granting the\r\nofficers' motions for judgment as a matter of law; the court's\r\nreasoning is set forth in a published memorandum.  906 F. Supp. 55\r\n(D. Mass. 1995).  The court then submitted to the jury, together\r\nwith a special verdict form, the Fourteenth Amendment claims\r\nagainst the officers and the negligence claim against the city.\r\nBy special verdict, the jury denied recovery against the\r\nofficers, finding that Ringuette had failed to prove that either\r\nofficer acted with \"such recklessness as to constitute deliberate\r\nindifference to Ringuette's serious medical needs.\"  As to the\r\ncity, the jury found that it was liable for negligence and\r\neventually set damages at $1,780,360.  Based on a statutory cap,\r\nthe court later reduced damages to $100,000.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n258,  2.  Ringuette now appeals, urging that the district court\r\nerred in dismissing the Fourth Amendment claim against the officers\r\non grounds of qualified immunity. \r\nThe central issue on appeal is whether the district judge\r\nproperly sustained the defense of qualified immunity on the Fourth\r\nAmendment claim, but we first face a threshold issue:  Ringuette\r\nsays that while Levesque pleaded the defense in his answer to the\r\ncomplaint, Paradis failed to do so and therefore waived it. \r\nQualified immunity is an affirmative defense, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c),\r\nand an affirmative offense is generally lost unless it is raised in\r\nthe pleadings.  5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and\r\nProcedure  1278 (2d ed. 1990). \r\nHowever, Ringuette waived his own procedural objection by\r\nfailing to assert it in the district court when the officers moved\r\nfor judgment as a matter of law on grounds of qualified immunity. \r\nApparently, no one realized that Paradis had failed to assert this\r\ndefense.  When Levesque's counsel renewed a general motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law after the close of evidence, a motion\r\npreviously joined in by all defendants, the district judge held\r\nboth officers protected by qualified immunity without\r\ndistinguishing between them.  906 F. Supp. at 58.  After the jury\r\nverdict, Ringuette's counsel moved for reconsideration on the\r\nqualified immunity issue but argued it again on the merits without\r\nsuggesting that Paradis had waived the defense.\r\nParadis' failure to assert the defense in his answer to\r\nthe complaint did not prejudice Ringuette, because Ringuette's\r\nposition on qualified immunity is the same as to both officers, and\r\nhe presented it to the district court both before the summary\r\njudgment decision and after the ruling at trial.  Had the waiver\r\nobjection been raised in the district court, Paradis would have had\r\na good chance of persuading the district judge to allow the defense\r\nby an amendment to the answer.  The issue, in short, was presented\r\nto the court without objection and decided on the merits. \r\nAccordingly, Ringuette's procedural objection fails.  Manchester\r\nGardens, Inc. v. Great West Life Assur. Co., 205 F.2d 872, 877\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1953); Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b).\r\nThe merits of the qualified immunity defense, ably\r\nanalyzed by the district judge in her published opinion, are more\r\ntroublesome.  At issue are Ringuette's claims that he was \"seized\"\r\nby being detained by the police in protective custody, and that\r\nthis seizure became \"unreasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment when\r\na twelve-hour time limit under state law expired.  On this double\r\npremise, he sought damages for the medical injuries he suffered on\r\nthe ground that they flowed from a state actor's violation of his\r\nfederal constitutional right under color of state law.  42 U.S.C.\r\n1983.\r\nUnder Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982), the\r\npolice in their arrest and detention functions are normally\r\n\"shielded from liability for civil damages\" under federal law\r\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate \"clearly established\"\r\nrights of which \"a reasonable person would have known.\"  It is not\r\nenough for the constitutional right to be \"clearly established\" at\r\na highly abstract level; what matters is whether in the\r\ncircumstances faced by the official, he should reasonably have\r\nunderstood that his conduct violated clearly established law. \r\nBerthiaume v. Caron,    F.3d.    (1st Cir. 1998), 1998 WL 178384 at\r\n*3.  This qualified immunity standard leaves \"ample room for\r\nmistaken judgments.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 343 (1986). \r\nThe district court said that while the issue was \"far\r\nfrom clear cut,\" \"Ringuette's re-PC [i.e., the renewal of the\r\nprotective custody order after the first twelve hours] was a Fourth\r\nAmendment seizure conducted without lawful authority, and\r\ntherefore, was unreasonable.\"  906 F. Supp. at 57.  And while not\r\nevery violation of a state statute bearing on detention would\r\nnecessarily constitute an \"unreasonable\" seizure under the Fourth\r\nAmendment, we agree with the district court that the statute's\r\ntwelve-hour limitation on protective custody was intended as a\r\nfundamental limitation on state authority to detain Ringuette.  \r\nIf Ringuette had gotten up after twelve hours and\r\ndemanded to be released, it is likely that a refusal to let him out\r\nwould have constituted not only a violation of the Fourth Amendment\r\nbut one that a reasonable Massachusetts police officer should have\r\nknown to be such a violation.  Even without any direct precedent,\r\nthe explicit limitation in the state statute arguably made further\r\ninvoluntary detention a constitutional violation clear enough--on\r\nmost facts--so as to negate any police claim of a reasonable\r\nmistake.  United States v. Lanier, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 1227-28 (1997). \r\nThe difficulty for Ringuette is that this leaves out half\r\nof the story.  Ringuette was not a citizen demanding to be released\r\nfrom confinement.  He was, from all appearances, still drunk or\r\notherwise incapacitated, and--according to the district court\r\nfindings--he rebuffed two offers to release him, one made shortly\r\nbefore the end of the twelve-hour period and one made not long\r\nthereafter.  Nor did he later ask to leave.  The notion that police\r\nofficers should simply have put Ringuette out on the street against\r\nhis will in his then-apparent condition is implausible.\r\nThus, while Ringuette's further \"confinement\" can be\r\ncalled an unreasonable seizure once the twelve-hour period had\r\npassed, the unreasonableness was obviously mitigated by the offers\r\nto release him, the belief that he remained incapacitated, and the\r\nimplicit willingness to let him go whenever he said he was ready. \r\nThe police decision was neither at odds with \"clearly established\"\r\ncase law under the Fourth Amendment, nor so manifestly unreasonable\r\na \"seizure\" that any reasonable police officer should have regarded\r\nit as such.  That is enough for qualified immunity.  Joyce v. Town\r\nof Tewksbury, Mass., 112 F.3d 19, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nHaving jailed Ringuette and left him in the cell, the\r\npolice not only assumed a duty of reasonable care--which the city\r\nwas found to have breached--but also in their later supervision\r\narguably exhibited a deliberate indifference to Ringuette's medical\r\nneeds so as to subject them to potential liability under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976);\r\nGaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, Mass., 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).  The latter was at best a debatable claim since the\r\ndeliberate indifference standard is more than negligence.  Manaritev. City of Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 956 (1st Cir. 1992).  In any\r\ncase, the jury squarely rejected it in its verdict in favor of the\r\npolice officers.\r\nBecause the offers to Ringuette to release him and his\r\nrefusals are of importance, we note that these \"facts\" were not\r\nentirely undisputed.  Ringuette's brief refers to, but does not\r\ndevelop, testimony by his medical expert at trial suggesting that\r\nRinguette was clearly incapacitated and perhaps incapable of speech\r\nfor the last several hours of his confinement and may have been so\r\nincapacitated at an earlier period.  Depending on how the doctor's\r\nsomewhat ambiguous testimony is read, it might be argued that this\r\ntestimony is in conflict with that of the two officers who said\r\nthat Ringuette was offered the opportunity to leave but twice\r\napparently declined.\r\nIf so, the district court, in dismissing the Fourth\r\nAmendment claim on qualified immunity grounds, resolved the dispute\r\nin favor of the officers, concluding that the testimony\r\n\"demonstrated that . . . when attempts were made to release\r\nRinguette, he expressed a desire to remain there, or responded in\r\na way which the police officers believed indicated consent.\"  906\r\nF. Supp. at 58.  This finding is supported by testimony of two\r\ndifferent police officers, one of them not a defendant in the case,\r\nand it is not directly challenged on appeal.\r\nSomething of a \"black hole\" exists in the law as to how\r\nto resolve factual disputes pertaining to qualified immunity when\r\nthey cannot be resolved on summary judgment prior to trial.  To\r\navoid duplication, judges have sometimes deferred a decision until\r\nthe trial testimony was in or even submitted the factual issues to\r\nthe jury.  See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 n.1\r\n(1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1017 (1996).  In all\r\nevents, the district judge's procedure here, which is not\r\nchallenged on appeal, seems to us to have been eminently sensible.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

In the aftermath, Police Chief McDonald filed charges against Paradis and Levesque and after a hearing, both were found liable of derelictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1993, Ringuette filed a 17-count complaint in the district court, asserting various state law claims and federal claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  The defendants named in the complaint were the city, Chief McDonald, officer Paradis and Sergeant Levesque.  On summary judgment, defendants obtained a dismissal of a number of claims, Ringuette v. City of Fall River, 888 F.Supp. 258 (D.Mass.1995), but several claims were reserved for trial, and the issue of qualified immunity was not resolved.  This summary judgment decision is not directly challenged on this appeal, and we confine ourselves solely to the remaining claims that were not then dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the summary judgment decision, the claim against the city for negligence was left standing (state law barred such a claim against the police officers).  McDonald had been dismissed from the case on summary judgment, but two constitutional claims remained against Paradis and Levesque:  a so-called \"Fourth Amendment\" claim based on unlawful seizure, and a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause for deliberate indifference to Ringuette's medical needs while in police custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As to these claims, the district court said that it could not resolve qualified immunity issues without factfinding and sent the claims to trial.  888 F.Supp. at 266, 270.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried over a number of days in October and November, 1995.  After the evidence was presented but before submitting the case to the jury, the court withdrew the Fourth Amendment claim on qualified immunity grounds, granting the officers' motions for judgment as a matter of law;  the court's reasoning is set forth in a published memorandum.  906 F.Supp. 55 (D.Mass.1995).  The court then submitted to the jury, together with a special verdict form, the Fourteenth Amendment claims against the officers and the negligence claim against the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By special verdict, the jury denied recovery against the officers, finding that Ringuette had failed to prove that either officer acted with \"such recklessness as to constitute deliberate indifference to Ringuette's serious medical needs.\"   As to the city, the jury found that it was liable for negligence and eventually set damages at $1,780,360.  Based on a statutory cap, the court later reduced damages to $100,000.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &#167; 2.  Ringuette now appeals, urging that the district court erred in dismissing the Fourth Amendment claim against the officers on grounds of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue on appeal is whether the district judge properly sustained the defense of qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claim, but we first face a threshold issue:  Ringuette says that while Levesque pleaded the defense in his answer to the complaint, Paradis failed to do so and therefore waived it.  Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), and an affirmative offense is generally lost unless it is raised in the pleadings.  5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1278 (2d ed.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Ringuette waived his own procedural objection by failing to assert it in the district court when the officers moved for judgment as a matter of law on grounds of qualified immunity.  Apparently, no one realized that Paradis had failed to assert this defense.  When Levesque's counsel renewed a general motion for judgment as a matter of law after the close of evidence, a motion previously joined in by all defendants, the district judge held both officers protected by qualified immunity without distinguishing between them.  906 F.Supp. at 58.   After the jury verdict, Ringuette's counsel moved for reconsideration on the qualified immunity issue but argued it again on the merits without suggesting that Paradis had waived the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paradis' failure to assert the defense in his answer to the complaint did not prejudice Ringuette, because Ringuette's position on qualified immunity is the same as to both officers, and he presented it to the district court both before the summary judgment decision and after the ruling at trial.  Had the waiver objection been raised in the district court, Paradis would have had a good chance of persuading the district judge to allow the defense by an amendment to the answer.  The issue, in short, was presented to the court without objection and decided on the merits.  Accordingly, Ringuette's procedural objection fails.  Manchester Gardens, Inc. v. Great West Life Assur. Co., 205 F.2d 872, 877 (D.C.Cir.1953);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the qualified immunity defense, ably analyzed by the district judge in her published opinion, are more troublesome.  At issue are Ringuette's claims that he was \"seized\" by being detained by the police in protective custody, and that this seizure became \"unreasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment when a twelve-hour time limit under state law expired.  On this double premise, he sought damages for the medical injuries he suffered on the ground that they flowed from a state actor's violation of his federal constitutional right under color of state law.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), the police in their arrest and detention functions are normally \"shielded from liability for civil damages\" under federal law insofar as their conduct does not violate \"clearly established\" rights of which \"a reasonable person would have known.\"   It is not enough for the constitutional right to be \"clearly established\" at a highly abstract level;  what matters is whether in the circumstances faced by the official, he should reasonably have understood that his conduct violated clearly established law.  Berthiaume v. Caron, 142 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1998) . This qualified immunity standard leaves \"ample room for mistaken judgments.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 343, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court said that while the issue was \"far from clear cut,\" \"Ringuette's re-PC [i.e., the renewal of the protective custody order after the first twelve hours] was a Fourth Amendment seizure conducted without lawful authority, and therefore, was unreasonable.\"  906 F.Supp. at 57.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And while not every violation of a state statute bearing on detention would necessarily constitute an \"unreasonable\" seizure under the Fourth Amendment, we agree with the district court that the statute's twelve-hour limitation on protective custody was intended as a fundamental limitation on state authority to detain Ringuette.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Ringuette had gotten up after twelve hours and demanded to be released, it is likely that a refusal to let him out would have constituted not only a violation of the Fourth Amendment but one that a reasonable Massachusetts police officer should have known to be such a violation.  Even without any direct precedent, the explicit limitation in the state statute arguably made further involuntary detention a constitutional violation clear enough--on most facts--so as to negate any police claim of a reasonable mistake.  United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1227-28, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty for Ringuette is that this leaves out half of the story.  Ringuette was not a citizen demanding to be released from confinement.  He was, from all appearances, still drunk or otherwise incapacitated, and--according to the district court findings--he rebuffed two offers to release him, one made shortly before the end of the twelve-hour period and one made not long thereafter.  Nor did he later ask to leave.  The notion that police officers should simply have put Ringuette out on the street against his will in his then-apparent condition is implausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, while Ringuette's further \"confinement\" can be called an unreasonable seizure once the twelve-hour period had passed, the unreasonableness was obviously mitigated by the offers to release him, the belief that he remained incapacitated, and the implicit willingness to let him go whenever he said he was ready.  The police decision was neither at odds with \"clearly established\" case law under the Fourth Amendment, nor so manifestly unreasonable a \"seizure\" that any reasonable police officer should have regarded it as such.  That is enough for qualified immunity.  Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, Mass., 112 F.3d 19, 22-23 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having jailed Ringuette and left him in the cell, the police not only assumed a duty of reasonable care--which the city was found to have breached--but also in their later supervision arguably exhibited a deliberate indifference to Ringuette's medical needs so as to subject them to potential liability under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976);  Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, Mass., 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir.1990).  The latter was at best a debatable claim since the deliberate indifference standard is more than negligence.  Manarite v. City of Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 956 (1st Cir.1992).  In any case, the jury squarely rejected it in its verdict in favor of the police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the offers to Ringuette to release him and his refusals are of importance, we note that these \"facts\" were not entirely undisputed.  Ringuette's brief refers to, but does not develop, testimony by his medical expert at trial suggesting that Ringuette was clearly incapacitated and perhaps incapable of speech for the last several hours of his confinement and may have been so incapacitated at an earlier period.  Depending on how the doctor's somewhat ambiguous testimony is read, it might be argued that this testimony is in conflict with that of the two officers who said that Ringuette was offered the opportunity to leave but twice apparently declined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If so, the district court, in dismissing the Fourth Amendment claim on qualified immunity grounds, resolved the dispute in favor of the officers, concluding that the testimony \"demonstrated that ... when attempts were made to release Ringuette, he expressed a desire to remain there, or responded in a way which the police officers believed indicated consent.\"  906 F.Supp. at 58.   This finding is supported by testimony of two different police officers, one of them not a defendant in the case, and it is not directly challenged on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Something of a \"black hole\" exists in the law as to how to resolve factual disputes pertaining to qualified immunity when they cannot be resolved on summary judgment prior to trial.  To avoid duplication, judges have sometimes deferred a decision until the trial testimony was in or even submitted the factual issues to the jury.  See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 n. 1 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1017, 116 S.Ct. 2548, 135 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1996).  In all events, the district judge's procedure here, which is not challenged on appeal, seems to us to have been eminently sensible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The \"booking officer\" on the shift is the officer immediately responsible for booking persons, cell checks and the feeding of prisoners.

He recovered a judgment against the city for negligence, but the district court dismissed on qualified immunity grounds a \"Fourth Amendment\" claim against two police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Save in one significant respect, the background facts pertinent to the appeal are undisputed.  On July 27, 1992, at about 7 p.m., police in Fall River, Massachusetts, responded to a report of a disabled person and found Ringuette slumped over a car in a stupor.  According to the officers, Ringuette was unsteady on his feet, had bloodshot eyes, and smelled of alcohol.  Believing him to be drunk, the police asked if he wanted a ride home.  He replied, \"to my brother's\" but gave no address.  Asked if he wanted to go to \"detox,\" he gave the same answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later evidence indicates that Ringuette was suffering from an overdose of prescription pills, although the police did not know this at any relevant time.  Not knowing how to contact Ringuette's brother, the police took Ringuette into protective custody pursuant to the Massachusetts Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 111B, &#167; 8.  The police handcuffed him, put him in the police car and drove him to the station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 8 of the Act, a person incapacitated by alcohol is to be taken with or without his consent to his own residence, to a treatment facility, or to a police station.  If taken to a police station, the officer in charge is to transfer him to the nearest treatment facility, if available.  The statute continues:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>No person assisted to a police station pursuant to this section shall be held in protective custody against his will;  provided, however, that if suitable treatment at a [treatment] facility is not available, an incapacitated person may be held in protective custody at a police station until he is no longer incapacitated or for a period not longer than twelve hours, whichever is shorter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Ringuette remained at the facility for more than twelve hours--whether he was \"held\" after twelve hours is a different question--and during this period he suffered serious injury.  Ringuette was booked into the police station at 7:19 p.m. and assisted to a cell which was neither monitored by video camera nor directly observable by the booking officer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  No call was made to the local treatment center;  but according to later evidence, no bed was then available, and the center had not admitted anyone from the police station on short notice in the previous seven years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the night of July 27-28, Ringuette was monitored by an officer at 15-minute intervals, as required by department regulations.  According to the officer, at around 5 a.m., the officer found Ringuette standing in his cell and asked if he was ready to be released;  in reply, Ringuette swore at him.  The officer further testified that at the officer's last check, at 6:20 a.m., Ringuette said he was not ready to leave and was told that he would nevertheless be released when the officer of the next shift came on in about 15 minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Paradis, one of the three individuals named as a defendant in this case, took over as booking officer at 6:50 a.m. on July 28 and was told of the prior conversation with Ringuette.  Paradis knew Ringuette from prior periods of protective custody.  According to Paradis, shortly after he came on duty, he asked Ringuette if he wanted to leave, and Ringuette replied in \"slurred\" speech:  \"I've got nowhere to go and I'm still half in the bag.\"   Told of these events, Sergeant Levesque, who was then the supervising sergeant, authorized Paradis to fill out a second protective custody form, although the statute makes no reference to a second form and provides for protective custody \"for a period of not longer than twelve hours.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that Paradis then checked on Ringuette only a couple of times in the succeeding eight hours between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m., when Paradis was relieved by another officer.  Throughout his time at the police station, Ringuette was given neither food nor water, despite the department handbook's policy requiring the feeding of persons kept in protective custody for more than five hours.  At around 3 p.m., a new officer took over and found Ringuette sitting and then lying on the floor.  At this point, Ringuette refused food and mumbled incoherently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, at around 6 p.m. on the evening of July 28, after Ringuette had been in the cell for almost 24 hours, the police officer on duty realized that Ringuette was moaning and making gurgling noises.  Levesque called a medical technician who arrived almost immediately and found that Ringuette was in a state of shock, lying motionless in a pool of vomit, with eyes dilated and his pulse racing.  At the hospital, doctors found him to be in severe shock--that is, having no measurable blood pressure--severely dehydrated with several vital bodily functions impaired, and suffering from a drug overdose of prescription pills and from first and second degree burns (which are unexplained).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ringuette now suffers from seriously impaired use of his left arm and left leg, caused by \"compartmental syndrome.\"   This is a muscle-tissue condition associated with tissue compression, in this case due to lying in the same position for a long period and compounded by the drug overdose.  Expert testimony at trial indicated that the condition likely occurred within three to six hours prior to the technician's arrival.  In the aftermath, Police Chief McDonald filed charges against Paradis and Levesque and after a hearing, both were found liable of derelictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1993, Ringuette filed a 17-count complaint in the district court, asserting various state law claims and federal claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  The defendants named in the complaint were the city, Chief McDonald, officer Paradis and Sergeant Levesque.  On summary judgment, defendants obtained a dismissal of a number of claims, Ringuette v. City of Fall River, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

McDonald had been dismissed from the case on summary judgment, but two constitutional claims remained against Paradis and Levesque:  a so-called \"Fourth Amendment\" claim based on unlawful seizure, and a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause for deliberate indifference to Ringuette's medical needs while in police custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As to these claims, the district court said that it could not resolve qualified immunity issues without factfinding and sent the claims to trial.  888 F.Supp. at 266, 270.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried over a number of days in October and November, 1995.

Based on a statutory cap, the court later reduced damages to $100,000.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, &#167; 2.  Ringuette now appeals, urging that the district court erred in dismissing the Fourth Amendment claim against the officers on grounds of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue on appeal is whether the district judge properly sustained the defense of qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claim, but we first face a threshold issue:  Ringuette says that while Levesque pleaded the defense in his answer to the complaint, Paradis failed to do so and therefore waived it.  Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), and an affirmative offense is generally lost unless it is raised in the pleadings.  5 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1278 (2d ed.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Ringuette waived his own procedural objection by failing to assert it in the district court when the officers moved for judgment as a matter of law on grounds of qualified immunity.  Apparently, no one realized that Paradis had failed to assert this defense.  When Levesque's counsel renewed a general motion for judgment as a matter of law after the close of evidence, a motion previously joined in by all defendants, the district judge held both officers protected by qualified immunity without distinguishing between them.  906 F.Supp. at 58.

Had the waiver objection been raised in the district court, Paradis would have had a good chance of persuading the district judge to allow the defense by an amendment to the answer.  The issue, in short, was presented to the court without objection and decided on the merits.  Accordingly, Ringuette's procedural objection fails.  Manchester Gardens, Inc. v. Great West Life Assur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"232187\"><a href=\"/opinion/232187/manchester-gardens-inc-v-great-west-life-assur-co-great-west-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span>, 877 (D.C.Cir.1953);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the qualified immunity defense, ably analyzed by the district judge in her published opinion, are more troublesome.  At issue are Ringuette's claims that he was \"seized\" by being detained by the police in protective custody, and that this seizure became \"unreasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment when a twelve-hour time limit under state law expired.  On this double premise, he sought damages for the medical injuries he suffered on the ground that they flowed from a state actor's violation of his federal constitutional right under color of state law.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Harlow v.

Even without any direct precedent, the explicit limitation in the state statute arguably made further involuntary detention a constitutional violation clear enough--on most facts--so as to negate any police claim of a reasonable mistake.  United States v. Lanier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ringuette was not a citizen demanding to be released from confinement.  He was, from all appearances, still drunk or otherwise incapacitated, and--according to the district court findings--he rebuffed two offers to release him, one made shortly before the end of the twelve-hour period and one made not long thereafter.  Nor did he later ask to leave.  The notion that police officers should simply have put Ringuette out on the street against his will in his then-apparent condition is implausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, while Ringuette's further \"confinement\" can be called an unreasonable seizure once the twelve-hour period had passed, the unreasonableness was obviously mitigated by the offers to release him, the belief that he remained incapacitated, and the implicit willingness to let him go whenever he said he was ready.  The police decision was neither at odds with \"clearly established\" case law under the Fourth Amendment, nor so manifestly unreasonable a \"seizure\" that any reasonable police officer should have regarded it as such.  That is enough for qualified immunity.  Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, Mass., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739950\"><a href=\"/opinion/739950/joanne-joyce-individually-and-as-of-the-estate-of-james-d-joyce-v-town/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22-23 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having jailed Ringuette and left him in the cell, the police not only assumed a duty of reasonable care--which the city was found to have breached--but also in their later supervision arguably exhibited a deliberate indifference to Ringuette's medical needs so as to subject them to potential liability under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Estelle v.

The latter was at best a debatable claim since the deliberate indifference standard is more than negligence.  Manarite v. City of Springfield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578608\"><a href=\"/opinion/578608/jessica-a-manarite-by-and-through-her-next-friend-carla-manarite-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir.1992).  In any case, the jury squarely rejected it in its verdict in favor of the police officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the offers to Ringuette to release him and his refusals are of importance, we note that these \"facts\" were not entirely undisputed.  Ringuette's brief refers to, but does not develop, testimony by his medical expert at trial suggesting that Ringuette was clearly incapacitated and perhaps incapable of speech for the last several hours of his confinement and may have been so incapacitated at an earlier period.  Depending on how the doctor's somewhat ambiguous testimony is read, it might be argued that this testimony is in conflict with that of the two officers who said that Ringuette was offered the opportunity to leave but twice apparently declined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If so, the district court, in dismissing the Fourth Amendment claim on qualified immunity grounds, resolved the dispute in favor of the officers, concluding that the testimony \"demonstrated that ... when attempts were made to release Ringuette, he expressed a desire to remain there, or responded in a way which the police officers believed indicated consent.\"  906 F.Supp. at 58.   This finding is supported by testimony of two different police officers, one of them not a defendant in the case, and it is not directly challenged on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Something of a \"black hole\" exists in the law as to how to resolve factual disputes pertaining to qualified immunity when they cannot be resolved on summary judgment prior to trial.  To avoid duplication, judges have sometimes deferred a decision until the trial testimony was in or even submitted the factual issues to the jury.  See St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709033\"><a href=\"/opinion/709033/kathy-st-hilaire-etc-v-city-of-laconia/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 n. 1 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In all events, the district judge's procedure here, which is not challenged on appeal, seems to us to have been eminently sensible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The \"booking officer\" on the shift is the officer immediately responsible for booking persons, cell checks and the feeding of prisoners.
