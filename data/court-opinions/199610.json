The district court denied the\n\nhabeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 of Hung Tan Vo,\n\nwho was convicted of murder in state court and sentenced to\n\nlife imprisonment.\n\n         Vo asserts on habeas that he was not competent to\n\nstand trial as of the point in his murder trial when he\n\nlearned his girlfriend, Maureen Ambrose, was living with\n\nanother man, and that the conclusion of the state courts that\n\nhe was competent was wrong.   He also argues that his counsel\n\nwas constitutionally ineffective, inter alia, in permitting\n\nthe trial to go forward.   Finally, he claims that jury\n\ninstructions on malice aforethought and deliberate\n\npremeditation (not objected to at trial) were constitutionally\n\noffensive.   He asserts that the state court decisions ruling\n\nagainst him on these points were contrary to, and an\n\nunreasonable application of, established federal\n\nconstitutional law.\n\n         Vo’s murder conviction was affirmed on appeal by the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Commonwealth v. Vo, 427\n\n\n                              -2-\n\fMass. 464, 693 N.E.2d 1374 (1998). The trial judge’s\n\ndetermination, made after an evidentiary hearing more than\n\nthree years after trial, that Vo was not incompetent was also\n\naffirmed.    Id. at 467-69.\n\n            This case is a tragedy originating in a love\n\ntriangle and culminating with one man dead and another in\n\nprison for life.    The woman involved, Ambrose, testified for\n\nthe state and was, apparently, never charged for her role.\n\nThe facts underlying the conviction and the analysis of the\n\nissues on habeas are set forth ably in the Magistrate Judge’s\n\nreport and recommendation, which was adopted by the district\n\ncourt in a succinct Memorandum Order.     Both courts were\n\ncorrect in their decision to deny the habeas petition and\n\nthere is no need to repeat their analysis.     The state supreme\n\ncourt decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable\n\napplication of, established federal constitutional law.\n\n            We add only this.   This petition is brought within\n\nthe constraints on federal habeas power established by the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n\n(\"AEDPA\"). Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified as\n\namended in scattered sections of 8, 18, 22, 28, 40 and 42\n\n                                 -3-\n\fU.S.C.).   A habeas petition may not be granted unless the\n\nstate court decision: 1) \"was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\n\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" or 2)\n\n\"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n\nlight of the evidence presented in the State court\n\nproceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (Supp. II 1996).\n\n           The primary issue argued on habeas concerns the\n\ncompetency determination.   The determination of whether Vo was\n\ncompetent to stand trial was essentially a fact determination.\n\nThompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 111 (1995), citing Maggio v.\n\nFulford, 462 U.S. 111, 117 (1983) (per curiam).   AEDPA\n\nestablished a presumption of correctness of \"a determination\n\nof a factual issue made by a State court\" as provided in 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(e)(1):\n\n           In a proceeding instituted by an application for a\n           writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody\n           pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a\n           determination of a factual issue made by a State\n           court shall be presumed to be correct. The\n           applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the\n           presumption of correctness by clear and convincing\n           evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fVo thus must show error in the state court’s factual\n\ndetermination of competency \"by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.\"   This he has not done.    That factual determination\n\nwas made by the judge who presided over the trial, saw Vo\n\ntestify, and who later evaluated      the witnesses as to the\n\ncompetency issue.     Credibility determinations are committed to\n\nthe sound discretion of the trial judge.     The trial judge's\n\nconclusion that Vo was competent finds ample support in the\n\nrecord.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
