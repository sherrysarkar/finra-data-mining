PHOENIX,\n\n                    Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                       JAMES MATESANZ,\n\n                    Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         ERRATA SHEET\n\n\n     The opinion of this Court issued on December 1, 2000, is\namended as follows:\n\n    On p. 10, line 29 through p. 11, line 23, should read:\n\n\"Phoenix v. Commonwealth, No. SJ-96-0571, at 4-5 (SJC Memorandum,\nFried, J., May 8, 1997).\n\n     The strategy to which Justice Fried referred was described in\nthe prior decision of the full SJC, see Commonwealth v. Phoenix, 409\nMass. 408, 421 n.8 (1991), as well as in a subsequent Superior Court\ndecision refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on the issue, see\nCommonwealth v. Phoenix, No. 87-068, at 6-7 (Superior Court\nMemorandum, Moriarty, J., March 18, 1996) [hereinafter Phoenix, March\n18 Memorandum]. In denying leave to admit into the record on direct\nappeal the Wraxall affidavit, the SJC referred to defendant's\narguments that he did not have Wraxall testify because of the expense\nand because of his belief that Schanfield's testimony would expose\nthe unreliability of the critical test. The SJC concluded that\n\"[t]hese considerations were purely ones of trial strategy, and,\ntherefore, there is no reason to permit the filing of the affidavit.\"\nPhoenix, 409 Mass. at 421 n.8. Similarly, although Judge Moriarty\nformally relied on waiver in denying defendant's request for an\n\fevidentiary   hearing on ineffective assistance, he made it quite clear\nthat he did   not think the failure to call Wraxall was ineffective\nassistance,   and, more generally, he praised trial counsel's\nperformance   in general and at the trial. Phoenix, March 18\nMemorandum,   at 7.\n\n     As for the fingerprint evidence, Judge Moriarty plainly found\nthat the failure to call MacDonell was a strategic one. See Phoenix,\nMarch 18 Memorandum, at 8 (\"[Bennett] made a tactical decision - and\nprobably a wise one.\").\n\n     Hence, we must assess whether the respective state court\napplications of Strickland to these ineffective assistance claims was\nin fact objectively unreasonable. We make this assessment ...\"\n\n    On p. 14, lines 14-21, should read:\n\n     \"We also cannot conclude that Bennett's failure to send\nMacDonnell additional photographs for review during and after trial\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Although it turned\nout that MacDonnell's opinion of the additional photographs would\nprobably have been helpful at trial, Bennett's choice not to pursue\nfurther investigation on this front was a reasonable one at trial.\nMacDonnell's partially provided expert opinion had lowered Bennett's\nexpectations and Bennett had adequately cross-examined ...\"\n\n    On p. 17, lines 12-19, should read:\n\n\"defense witness). Upon consideration of the record and Wraxall's\naffidavit, we agree with the district court's determination that\nBennett's action was within the bounds of permissible strategic\nchoice. Given this independent assessment, we cannot say that the\nsame conclusion by the state court was objectively unreasonable, even\nif it may not have satisfied the formal requirements of a Strickland\nanalysis. Thus we may not grant a writ of habeas corpus on this\nbasis.\"\n\n    On p. 18, lines 21-24, should read:\n\n     \"The district court thoroughly and carefully considered\nPhoenix's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with\nits analysis and conclusion, and therefore affirm the denial of the\nwrit of habeas corpus.\"\n\f",
