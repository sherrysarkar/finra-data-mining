Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                      Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Zobel,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n      Víctor P. Miranda-Corrada, on brief, for appellant.\n      Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Guillermo\nGil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, Chief, Criminal Division, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n*   Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\fDecember 10, 2001\n\n\n\n\n       -2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Following a criminal trial, a jury\n\nconvicted defendant-appellant José A. Otero-Méndez (\"Otero-Méndez\") of\n\n(1) aiding and abetting an attempted carjacking, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2119(2) and (3), and (2) aiding and abetting the use and\n\ncarrying of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1) and (2). On appeal, Otero-Méndez\n\nchallenges several elements of the convictions, including: (1) the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for acquittal; (2) various\n\nevidentiary rulings of the district court; (3) the jury instructions\n\ngiven by the district court; and (4) the applicability of the federal\n\ncarjacking statute to Puerto Rico.       We affirm.\n\n                                  I\n\n          In the late evening hours of April 4, 1996, Otero-Méndez,\n\ntogether with four companions, was driving his car in the San Juan\n\nmetropolitan area. Next to him, in the passenger's seat, was Giovani\n\nCastro-Ayala (\"Castro-Ayala\").     In the rear seat, Jomary Alemán-\n\nGonzález (\"Alemán-González\") sat in the middle with Hanson Wilson-\n\nMillán   (\"Wilson-Millán\")   to   her   left   and   Javier   Betancourt\n\n(\"Betancourt\") to her right.\n\n          As they were returning home, a white Nissan 300ZX (\"the\n\n300ZX\") automobile passed them. Previously, Otero-Méndez, Wilson-\n\nMillán, and Betancourt had discussed finding new wheel rims for Otero-\n\nMéndez's car. Upon seeing the 300ZX, they decided that they would\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fforcibly take its wheel rims, so Otero-Méndez turned his car around and\n\nfollowed the 300ZX. When the 300ZX stopped in front of a residence,\n\nOtero-Méndez pulled up next to it. Betancourt and Wilson-Millán got\n\nout of the car, pulled out their weapons, and approached the 300ZX.\n\nShots were fired by Betancourt, Wilson-Millán, and the driver of the\n\n300ZX. Hit by multiple gunshots, the driver of the 300ZX died. Then,\n\nboth Betancourt and Wilson-Millán got back into appellant's car.\n\nAppellant took Betancourt, Alemán-González, and Castro-Ayala to a local\n\nhospital because Betancourt had also been shot. He subsequently died.\n\n          A few days after the incident, appellant, having dyed his\n\nhair and using eyeglasses and a fictitious name, left Puerto Rico\n\nthrough the Aguadilla Airport.    He was subsequently apprehended in\n\nConnecticut and transferred to Puerto Rico where he was indicted. He\n\nwas then convicted of aiding and abetting an attempted carjacking and\n\naiding and abetting in the use of a firearm.\n\n                                  II\n\n          Appellant moved at the end of his trial for an acquittal,\n\nclaiming that the government failed to prove its case beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. In regard to the carjacking conviction, appellant\n\ncontends the government did not meet its burden of proof in two ways:\n\n(1) the government did not prove that the 300ZX had been transported or\n\nshipped in interstate or foreign commerce (the \"jurisdictional element\"\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2119); and (2) the government failed to show that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fappellant had the requisite intent under 18 U.S.C. § 2119. In regard\n\nto the weapons conviction, appellant argues that the government failed\n\nto prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          When addressing sufficiency of the evidence claims, we review\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and review\n\nde novo the district court's determination that the jury reasonably\n\nfound each element of the crime to have been proven beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. See United States v. Colón-Muñoz, 192 F.3d 210, 219 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1055 (2000); see also United States v.\n\nHernández, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998). Our role in this review is\n\nlimited: \"An appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal\n\nconviction rests.\" United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 266\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, No. 01-6313, 2001 WL 1117904 (U.S. Oct. 15,\n\n2001). We find that the prosecution did present sufficient evidence on\n\nall of the challenged points to allow a reasonable jury to find the\n\ndefendant guilty.\n\n          A.   Jurisdictional element of § 2119\n\n          Otero-Méndez argues that the government failed to prove that\n\nthe car involved had been transported, shipped, or received in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce. The jurisdictional element of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119 requires that the government prove that the car in\n\nquestion has been moved in interstate commerce, at some time. See\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fUnited States v. Johnson, 22 F.3d 106, 108-09 (6th Cir. 1994). We find\n\nthat the testimony of FBI Agent Thomas Oates satisfied the\n\njurisdictional element.\n\n          Agent Oates testified that all automobiles arrive by ship\n\ninto Puerto Rico and that he was unaware of any automobiles\n\nmanufactured in Puerto Rico. This testimony went unchallenged. In\n\nUnited States v. Lake, a police officer testified that no motor\n\nvehicles are manufactured in the U.S. Virgin Islands and all cars must\n\nbe shipped into the territory. 150 F.3d 269, 273 (3d Cir. 1998). The\n\nThird Circuit held this testimony to be sufficient to establish the\n\njurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. § 2119. Id. The court also noted\n\nthat it was reasonable for the district court judge to admit this\n\ntestimony as within the personal knowledge of the witness. Id. Like\n\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico is an island and not a\n\nparticularly large one. It is entirely reasonable that a federal agent\n\nworking in Puerto Rico would know about the lack of any manufacturing\n\nfacilities for cars on the island. Therefore, the district court acted\n\nwithin its discretion when admitting Agent Oates' testimony, and a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude on the basis of his testimony that the\n\n300ZX had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce.1\n\n1 Appellant also argues that the district court erred in allowing Agent\nOates to testify that the 300ZX had been manufactured in Japan. He\nbased this conclusion of a search of the National Insurance Crime\nBureau (\"NICB\") database. Because we hold the jurisdiction element\nsatisfied otherwise, we find it unnecessary to decide whether this\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          B.    Intent element of § 2119\n\n          Appellant claims that the government failed to prove he\n\nshared any intent to cause death or serious bodily injury as required\n\nunder § 2119.     As an aider and abetter, appellant must have\n\n\"consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying\n\ncriminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" United States v.\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995). Under 18 U.S.C. § 2119, the\n\ngovernment must prove that the defendant intended to cause death or\n\nserious bodily injury. See United States v. Hernández, 146 F.3d 30, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). We find that a reasonable jury could have found that\n\nappellant had the requisite intent.\n\n          It is difficult to articulate a precise intent standard for\n\nan aider and abetter. See United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 236-\n\n40 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing the differing intent standards\n\narticulated, at various times, for aiders and abettors).        For a\n\nspecific intent crime, like aiding and abetting, the defendant must\n\nhave consciously shared some knowledge of the principal's criminal\n\nintent. See United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 591 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\ntestimony was properly admitted under the residual exception to the\nhearsay rule. Fed. R. Evid. 807. If it was error, it was harmless\nerror. Appellant also objects to other elements of Agent Oates'\ntestimony, including that Agent Oates never identified the vehicle\nidentification number (\"VIN\") he entered into the NICB database, the\nVIN of the 300ZX was never conclusively established, and that Agent\nOates was not qualified as an expert witness. We find all these\narguments to be without merit.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fA generalized suspicion is not enough. See id. at 591 (citing United\n\nStates v. Labat, 905 F.2d 18, 23 (2d Cir. 1990)); see also Spinney, 65\n\nF.3d at 237 (holding that if the defendant did not have actual\n\nknowledge of the principal's intent, there must be at least \"enhanced\n\nconstructive knowledge\"). We have previously required evidence that\n\nthe defendant was \"on notice.\" United States v. Rosario-Díaz, 202 F.3d\n\n54, 63 (1st Cir. 2000). However, we have declined to decide whether\n\nthe evidence must show the defendant knew to a \"practical certainty.\"\n\nId. We need not decide this issue today, as a reasonable jury could\n\nhave found that appellant knew to a practical certainty that Betancourt\n\nand Wilson-Millán intended death or serious bodily injury.\n\n          Appellant argues that the lack of any discussion or\n\nconversation regarding the use of guns or force to take the car or\n\nwheel rims demonstrates that any intent to cause death or serious\n\nbodily injury could not have been formed until after Betancourt and\n\nWilson-Millán exited appellant's car. While no conversation took place\n\nabout the use of force, Castro-Ayala testified that Betancourt and\n\nWilson-Millán pulled out their guns as they exited appellant's car.\n\nAppellant himself testified that he knew that Betancourt and Wilson-\n\nMillán were carrying guns when they got into his car.2 Appellant also\n\ntestified that shots were fired immediately after Betancourt and\n\n\n\n2 Appellant's testimony from the trial of Wilson-Millán was admitted\ninto evidence.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fWilson-Millán exited his car. This uncontradicted testimony provides\n\nsufficient grounds for a reasonable jury to find that appellant knew to\n\na practical certainty that Betancourt and Wilson-Millán intended to use\n\ndeadly force.\n\n          C.    Weapons charge\n\n          Appellant argues that his conviction for aiding and abetting\n\nin the use or carrying of a firearm in connection with a carjacking, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924 (c)(1) and (2), cannot be sustained because the\n\ngovernment failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In\n\nsupport of this proposition, appellant points to the facts that he did\n\nnot carry a firearm during the commission of the carjacking, did not\n\nprovide firearms to his associates, did not have access to a weapon\n\nduring the commission of the crime, and only helped dispose of a\n\nweapon. As a result, he argues that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsustain a conviction for aiding and abetting in the use of a firearm.\n\n          Appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting in the use of\n\na firearm during a crime of violence can be sustained under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2, which provides for punishment as a principal if a defendant is\n\nconvicted of aiding and abetting a crime. To satisfy the requirements\n\nof section 2, the prosecution must prove that appellant knew a firearm\n\nwould be carried or used in a crime of violence and that he willingly\n\ntook some action to facilitate that carriage or use. See United States\n\nv. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 1996). The evidence shows that\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fappellant knew that Betancourt and Wilson-Millán were illegally\n\ncarrying weapons as he drove them to the scene of the crime.\n\nAdditionally, appellant saw Betancourt fire shots at the victim's car,\n\nand appellant later disposed of Betancourt's gun.       This evidence\n\nsupports the inferences that appellant both knew that firearms would be\n\ncarried or used during the carjacking and actively facilitated their\n\nuse.   Therefore, we affirm appellant's conviction on this count.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f                                 III\n\n          Appellant contends that the district court made a series of\n\nerroneous evidentiary rulings which cumulatively denied appellant his\n\nright to a fair trial.     We review each of the district court's\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See United States v.\n\nReeder, 170 F.3d 93, 107 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Williams v. Drake,\n\n146 F.3d 44, 46 (1st Cir. 1998). We find the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion.\n\n          A.   Evidence of appellant's flight and disguise\n\n          Appellant argues that the district court should not have\n\nadmitted evidence of appellant's flight and disguise during that\n\nflight. In regard to the flight itself, appellant concedes that flight\n\ncan be evidence of a guilty conscience, but argues that evidence of\n\nflight in this case was unfairly prejudicial. In addition, appellant\n\nasserts that introducing evidence of his use of a false identity is\n\nequivalent to impeaching his credibility because it calls into question\n\nhis honesty.\n\n          The law of this circuit clearly allows the district court to\n\nadmit evidence of both flight and use of a false identity if probative\n\nof a guilty conscience: \"Evidence of a defendant's flight and attempts\n\nto conceal or falsify identity may be presented at trial as probative\n\nof a guilty mind if there is an adequate factual predicate creating an\n\ninference of guilt of the crime charged.\" United States v. Candelaria-\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fSilva, 162 F.3d 698, 705 (1st Cir. 1998). Here, the uncontradicted\n\nevidence shows not only that appellant was present during the attempted\n\ncarjacking, but that appellant was the one who pursued the 300ZX and\n\nwho desired the wheel rims. Appellant let Betancourt and Wilson-Millán\n\nout of his car, knowing that they intended to take the other car and\n\nthat they carried illegal weapons. This evidence clearly establishes\n\nan adequate factual predicate of guilt. Therefore, the trial court\n\nproperly admitted evidence of appellant's flight and false identity.\n\n          As to appellant's argument that the evidence of flight was\n\nunfairly prejudicial, the district court found the probative value\n\nsubstantially outweighed any significant prejudice. Rule 403 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence allows relevant evidence to be excluded if\n\n\"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice.\" In reviewing Rule 403 challenges, we are extremely\n\ndeferential to the district court's determination. See United States\n\nv. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58, 70 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S.\n\n1103 (2001) (\"district court's Rule 403 balancing stands unless it is\n\nan abuse of discretion.\"); see also United States v. Rosario-Peralta,\n\n199 F.3d 552, 561 (1st Cir. 1999). In assessing the probative value of\n\nthe evidence, the district court specifically pointed to appellant's\n\nprior statement in which he explained his flight and disguise as an\n\neffort to avoid being connected to the attempted carjacking. In light\n\nof this statement, we agree with the district court's finding that\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fevidence of appellant's flight and disguise is probative of a guilty\n\nconscience and not unfairly prejudicial.3 We certainly cannot find an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n          As for appellant's argument that the evidence relating to his\n\ndisguise attacked his credibility and was an impermissible character\n\nattack, we find this argument to be without merit. The evidence was\n\nadmitted as probative of appellant's guilty conscience, not as a\n\ncharacter attack. The reasoning underlying appellant's challenge would\n\nconvert all evidence relating to use of disguises and false names into\n\nimpermissible character attacks.       Given the absurdity of such a\n\nposition, we decline to adopt it.\n\n          B.   Appellant's prior testimony\n\n          Appellant contests the introduction into evidence of his\n\nprior testimony given at the severed trial of his co-defendant. He\n\nargues that this testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial and\n\nshould have been barred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of\n\n3 Appellant also challenges the jury instruction given on flight and\nconcealment of identity. However, appellant does not identify, in this\nappeal, any separate grounds on which he objects to this instruction.\nIn fact, the challenged jury instruction only tempers the evidence of\nflight and disguise. The instruction counseled the jury that\nintentional flight does not create a presumption of guilt, but is only\na basis to infer a guilty conscience. Additionally, the instruction\nreminded jurors that flight may be consistent with innocence. As we\nfind the admission of evidence relating to appellant's flight and use\nof disguise not to be an abuse of discretion, we do not find the jury\ninstruction given on this point to be an abuse of discretion. See\nUnited States v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458, 460 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that\nwe review challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion).\n\n                                -13-\n\fEvidence.    First, we note that appellant's prior statements are\n\nadmissible as party admissions.      See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A)\n\n(providing that an out-of-court statement is not hearsay if it is\n\noffered against the party and it is the party's own statement). Next,\n\nwe turn to the Rule 403 balancing question. Here, the prior testimony\n\nbears on appellant's flight, which was relevant as discussed above.\n\nAlso, the testimony is appellant's version of the events, made with the\n\nconsent of his attorney after being advised of his constitutional\n\nrights.     As such, its high probative value cannot be said to be\n\noutweighed by its asserted unfair prejudice, and its introduction does\n\nnot constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n            C.   Testimony of decedents' relatives\n\n            Appellant argues that the testimony given by the decedents'\n\nrelatives4 should have been barred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules\n\nof Evidence because it was both irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\n\nSpecifically, he charges that this testimony was introduced only to\n\ninflame the jury since the identities of the deceased were not at\n\nissue. We agree with the district court that the identities of the\n\ndeceased were relevant. See Fed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant\n\nevidence as \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any\n\nfact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\n\n\n\n4 Luis González-Pérez, the father of the driver of the 300ZX, and Delma\nBetancourt-Betancourt, the mother of Betancourt, testified.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fprobable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\").\n\nAppellant was charged, and convicted, of aiding and abetting in a\n\ndeadly carjacking. Appellant had not stipulated to the identities of\n\nthe decedents, and, indeed, when a prior witness identified a picture\n\nof the body of the driver of the 300ZX, appellant did not contest that\n\ntestimony for relevance. As to whether the contested testimony was\n\nunfairly prejudicial so as to outweigh the probative value, we find no\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n          D.   Toxicology report for Betancourt\n\n          Appellant also contests the admission of a toxicology report\n\nshowing various drugs in Betancourt's body at the time of death,\n\nclaiming that this report had limited probative value and was unfairly\n\nprejudicial. First, the fact that Betancourt was under the influence\n\nof drugs when he and Wilson-Millán attempted to take the 300ZX bears on\n\nBetancourt's state of mind, as a principal in the crime. Second, the\n\nunfair prejudice created here, associating the appellant with a drug\n\nuser, is not very substantial.         Therefore, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the trial judge in admitting this evidence. Moreover,\n\nthe admission of such evidence, even if erroneous, would not be\n\nsufficient to disturb appellant's conviction.\n\n                                  IV\n\n          Appellant contends that the district court erred when it\n\nrefused to give the jury an accessory-after-the-fact instruction as\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\frequested by the appellant. We review challenges to jury instructions\n\nfor abuse of discretion. See Beatty v. Michael Mach. Bus. Corp., 172\n\nF.3d 117, 121 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Smith, 145 F.3d at 460. We\n\nfind no abuse of discretion.\n\n          Appellant concedes that here an accessory-after-the-fact\n\ncharge is not a lesser included offense. See United States v. Rivera-\n\nFigueroa, 149 F.3d 1, 6 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding \"the accessory\n\noffense is not a lesser included offense because it requires proof that\n\nthe principal offense does not, namely, that the defendant assisted\n\nafter the principal crime was committed\") (emphasis in original).\n\nTherefore, appellant is not entitled to this instruction as a matter of\n\nlaw.   See id. at 6.\n\n          However, appellant contends that the accessory-after-the-fact\n\ninstruction was essential to his defense and sufficient evidence\n\nsupported the instruction, and, therefore, the district court's denial\n\nof the instruction is reversible error. United States v. Rosario-\n\nPeralta, 199 F.3d 552, 567 (1st Cir. 1999), addressed a similar\n\nsituation, a failure to give an accessory-after-the-fact instruction in\n\na carjacking prosecution. There, we set out a four-part test to judge\n\nwhether a defendant is entitled to a particular instruction:\n\n          . . . a trial court's failure to deliver a theory\n          of defense instruction will result in reversal\n          only if: (1) the requested instruction correctly\n          describes the applicable law; (2) sufficient\n          evidence is produced at trial to warrant the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          instruction; (3) the charge actually delivered\n          does not fairly present the defense; and (4) the\n          requested instruction was essential to the\n          effective presentation of the particular defense.\n\nId. (citing United States v. Montañez, 105 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)). Appellant argues that all four requirements are met here,5 but\n\nwe disagree. The evidence presented was insufficient to warrant the\n\nrequested instruction.\n\n          In support of his argument, appellant points to several\n\nfacts: (1) the desired wheel rims would not actually fit on appellant's\n\ncar; (2) the evidence as to appellant's interest in the wheel rims was\n\ncontradictory; (3) one of the witnesses was surprised when she heard\n\nshots; (4) no one discussed how to dispose of the car; and (5) no one\n\nspoke of hurting the driver of the car. None of the evidence to which\n\nappellant points contradicts the facts that (1) appellant expressed a\n\ndesire for new wheel rims; (2) appellant voluntarily turned his car\n\naround and followed the victim's car; (3) appellant voluntarily let\n\nBetancourt and Wilson-Millán out of the car so they could take the\n\nvictim's car; (4) appellant knew that Betancourt and Wilson-Millán had\n\nguns; and (5) appellant waited for Betancourt and Wilson-Millán to\n\nreturn after they began firing at the driver of the 300ZX. Therefore,\n\n\n\n5  However, appellant concedes a legal error in his submitted\ninstruction. His submitted instruction implied that the jury could\nfind appellant guilty of being an accessory-after-the-fact, but\nappellant had not been charged with this offense. We will ignore the\nimplications of this error as they are not necessary to our holding.\n\n                                 -17-\n\flike in Rivera-Figueroa, the evidence here that appellant was only an\n\naccessory-after-the-fact is insufficient to warrant the requested\n\ninstruction.\n\n          In addition, the requested instruction had the potential to\n\nconfuse the jury. In Rivera-Figueroa, we determined that giving the\n\naccessory-after-the-fact instruction was likely to confuse the jury\n\nbecause it requires giving the jury an additional set of elements for\n\nan uncharged crime of which the defendant cannot be convicted. 149\n\nF.3d at 7. That same risk of confusion exists here. Therefore, we\n\ncannot find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing\n\nappellant's requested instruction, much less that any such error was\n\nreversible error.\n\n                                  V\n\n          Finally, appellant argues that federal jurisdiction is\n\nlacking in this case. He alleges that Congress lacks authority to\n\nextend 18 U.S.C. § 2119 to Puerto Rico because the Insular Cases6 bar\n\nthe application of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico.7 In Trailer\n\nMarine Transport Corporation v. Rivera-Vázquez, we noted that the\n\n\n\n6 Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 42 S. Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627\n(1922); Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 21 S. Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088\n(1901); Dooley v. United States, 182 U.S. 222, 21 S. Ct. 762, 45 L.Ed.\n1074 (1901); DeLima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1, 21 S. Ct. 743, 45 L.Ed.\n1041 (1901).\n7 In Rivera-Figueroa, we upheld the power of Congress to enact 18\nU.S.C. § 2119 under the Commerce Clause. 149 F.3d at 3-4.\n\n                                -18-\n\fSupreme Court and this circuit have long recognized the power of\n\nCongress, under the Commerce Clause, to legislate for Puerto Rico. 977\n\nF.2d 1, 7 n.3 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Secretary of Agric. v. Cent. Roig\n\nRef. Co., 338 U.S. 604, 616 (1950)). Therefore, we find appellant's\n\ncontention without merit.\n\n                                  VI\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Otero-Méndez's\n\nconvictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f",

Following a criminal trial, a jury\n\nconvicted defendant-appellant José A. Otero-Méndez (\"Otero-Méndez\") of\n\n(1) aiding and abetting an attempted carjacking, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2119(2) and (3), and (2) aiding and abetting the use and\n\ncarrying of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1) and (2). On appeal, Otero-Méndez\n\nchallenges several elements of the convictions, including: (1) the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for acquittal; (2) various\n\nevidentiary rulings of the district court; (3) the jury instructions\n\ngiven by the district court; and (4) the applicability of the federal\n\ncarjacking statute to Puerto Rico.       We affirm.\n\n                                  I\n\n          In the late evening hours of April 4, 1996, Otero-Méndez,\n\ntogether with four companions, was driving his car in the San Juan\n\nmetropolitan area. Next to him, in the passenger's seat, was Giovani\n\nCastro-Ayala (\"Castro-Ayala\").     In the rear seat, Jomary Alemán-\n\nGonzález (\"Alemán-González\") sat in the middle with Hanson Wilson-\n\nMillán   (\"Wilson-Millán\")   to   her   left   and   Javier   Betancourt\n\n(\"Betancourt\") to her right.\n\n          As they were returning home, a white Nissan 300ZX (\"the\n\n300ZX\") automobile passed them. Previously, Otero-Méndez, Wilson-\n\nMillán, and Betancourt had discussed finding new wheel rims for Otero-\n\nMéndez's car. Upon seeing the 300ZX, they decided that they would\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fforcibly take its wheel rims, so Otero-Méndez turned his car around and\n\nfollowed the 300ZX. When the 300ZX stopped in front of a residence,\n\nOtero-Méndez pulled up next to it. Betancourt and Wilson-Millán got\n\nout of the car, pulled out their weapons, and approached the 300ZX.\n\nShots were fired by Betancourt, Wilson-Millán, and the driver of the\n\n300ZX. Hit by multiple gunshots, the driver of the 300ZX died. Then,\n\nboth Betancourt and Wilson-Millán got back into appellant's car.\n\nAppellant took Betancourt, Alemán-González, and Castro-Ayala to a local\n\nhospital because Betancourt had also been shot. He subsequently died.\n\n          A few days after the incident, appellant, having dyed his\n\nhair and using eyeglasses and a fictitious name, left Puerto Rico\n\nthrough the Aguadilla Airport.    He was subsequently apprehended in\n\nConnecticut and transferred to Puerto Rico where he was indicted. He\n\nwas then convicted of aiding and abetting an attempted carjacking and\n\naiding and abetting in the use of a firearm.\n\n                                  II\n\n          Appellant moved at the end of his trial for an acquittal,\n\nclaiming that the government failed to prove its case beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. In regard to the carjacking conviction, appellant\n\ncontends the government did not meet its burden of proof in two ways:\n\n(1) the government did not prove that the 300ZX had been transported or\n\nshipped in interstate or foreign commerce (the \"jurisdictional element\"\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2119); and (2) the government failed to show that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fappellant had the requisite intent under 18 U.S.C. § 2119. In regard\n\nto the weapons conviction, appellant argues that the government failed\n\nto prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n          When addressing sufficiency of the evidence claims, we review\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and review\n\nde novo the district court's determination that the jury reasonably\n\nfound each element of the crime to have been proven beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.

We find that the prosecution did present sufficient evidence on\n\nall of the challenged points to allow a reasonable jury to find the\n\ndefendant guilty.\n\n          A.   Jurisdictional element of § 2119\n\n          Otero-Méndez argues that the government failed to prove that\n\nthe car involved had been transported, shipped, or received in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce. The jurisdictional element of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2119 requires that the government prove that the car in\n\nquestion has been moved in interstate commerce, at some time. See\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fUnited States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668266\"><a href=\"/opinion/668266/united-states-v-eric-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108-09 (6th Cir. 1994). We find\n\nthat the testimony of FBI Agent Thomas Oates satisfied the\n\njurisdictional element.\n\n          Agent Oates testified that all automobiles arrive by ship\n\ninto Puerto Rico and that he was unaware of any automobiles\n\nmanufactured in Puerto Rico. This testimony went unchallenged. In\n\nUnited States v. Lake, a police officer testified that no motor\n\nvehicles are manufactured in the U.S. Virgin Islands and all cars must\n\nbe shipped into the territory. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756448\"><a href=\"/opinion/756448/united-states-v-hilton-a-lake-hilton-a-lake/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (3d Cir. 1998). The\n\nThird Circuit held this testimony to be sufficient to establish the\n\njurisdictional element of 18 U.S.C. § 2119. Id. The court also noted\n\nthat it was reasonable for the district court judge to admit this\n\ntestimony as within the personal knowledge of the witness. Id. Like\n\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico is an island and not a\n\nparticularly large one. It is entirely reasonable that a federal agent\n\nworking in Puerto Rico would know about the lack of any manufacturing\n\nfacilities for cars on the island. Therefore, the district court acted\n\nwithin its discretion when admitting Agent Oates' testimony, and a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude on the basis of his testimony that the\n\n300ZX had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce.1\n\n1 Appellant also argues that the district court erred in allowing Agent\nOates to testify that the 300ZX had been manufactured in Japan. He\nbased this conclusion of a search of the National Insurance Crime\nBureau (\"NICB\") database. Because we hold the jurisdiction element\nsatisfied otherwise, we find it unnecessary to decide whether this\n\n                                 -6-\n\f          B.    Intent element of § 2119\n\n          Appellant claims that the government failed to prove he\n\nshared any intent to cause death or serious bodily injury as required\n\nunder § 2119.     As an aider and abetter, appellant must have\n\n\"consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying\n\ncriminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" United States v.\n\nTaylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975 (1st Cir. 1995). Under 18 U.S.C. § 2119, the\n\ngovernment must prove that the defendant intended to cause death or\n\nserious bodily injury. See United States v. Hernández, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198013\"><a href=\"/opinion/198013/united-states-v-hernandez-favale/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). We find that a reasonable jury could have found that\n\nappellant had the requisite intent.\n\n          It is difficult to articulate a precise intent standard for\n\nan aider and abetter. See United States v. Spinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236-\n\n40 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing the differing intent standards\n\narticulated, at various times, for aiders and abettors).        For a\n\nspecific intent crime, like aiding and abetting, the defendant must\n\nhave consciously shared some knowledge of the principal's criminal\n\nintent. See United States v. Loder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\ntestimony was properly admitted under the residual exception to the\nhearsay rule. Fed. R. Evid. 807. If it was error, it was harmless\nerror. Appellant also objects to other elements of Agent Oates'\ntestimony, including that Agent Oates never identified the vehicle\nidentification number (\"VIN\") he entered into the NICB database, the\nVIN of the 300ZX was never conclusively established, and that Agent\nOates was not qualified as an expert witness. We find all these\narguments to be without merit.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fA generalized suspicion is not enough. See id. at 591 (citing United\n\nStates v. Labat, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542937\"><a href=\"/opinion/542937/united-states-v-alfred-labat/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (2d Cir. 1990)); see also Spinney, 65\n\nF.3d at 237 (holding that if the defendant did not have actual\n\nknowledge of the principal's intent, there must be at least \"enhanced\n\nconstructive knowledge\"). We have previously required evidence that\n\nthe defendant was \"on notice.\" United States v. Rosario-Díaz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767458\"><a href=\"/opinion/767458/united-states-v-ralph-rosario-diaz-aka-juni-united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (1st Cir. 2000). However, we have declined to decide whether\n\nthe evidence must show the defendant knew to a \"practical certainty.\"\n\nId. We need not decide this issue today, as a reasonable jury could\n\nhave found that appellant knew to a practical certainty that Betancourt\n\nand Wilson-Millán intended death or serious bodily injury.\n\n          Appellant argues that the lack of any discussion or\n\nconversation regarding the use of guns or force to take the car or\n\nwheel rims demonstrates that any intent to cause death or serious\n\nbodily injury could not have been formed until after Betancourt and\n\nWilson-Millán exited appellant's car. While no conversation took place\n\nabout the use of force, Castro-Ayala testified that Betancourt and\n\nWilson-Millán pulled out their guns as they exited appellant's car.\n\nAppellant himself testified that he knew that Betancourt and Wilson-\n\nMillán were carrying guns when they got into his car.2 Appellant also\n\ntestified that shots were fired immediately after Betancourt and\n\n\n\n2 Appellant's testimony from the trial of Wilson-Millán was admitted\ninto evidence.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fWilson-Millán exited his car. This uncontradicted testimony provides\n\nsufficient grounds for a reasonable jury to find that appellant knew to\n\na practical certainty that Betancourt and Wilson-Millán intended to use\n\ndeadly force.\n\n          C.    Weapons charge\n\n          Appellant argues that his conviction for aiding and abetting\n\nin the use or carrying of a firearm in connection with a carjacking, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 924 (c)(1) and (2), cannot be sustained because the\n\ngovernment failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In\n\nsupport of this proposition, appellant points to the facts that he did\n\nnot carry a firearm during the commission of the carjacking, did not\n\nprovide firearms to his associates, did not have access to a weapon\n\nduring the commission of the crime, and only helped dispose of a\n\nweapon. As a result, he argues that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsustain a conviction for aiding and abetting in the use of a firearm.\n\n          Appellant's conviction for aiding and abetting in the use of\n\na firearm during a crime of violence can be sustained under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2, which provides for punishment as a principal if a defendant is\n\nconvicted of aiding and abetting a crime. To satisfy the requirements\n\nof section 2, the prosecution must prove that appellant knew a firearm\n\nwould be carried or used in a crime of violence and that he willingly\n\ntook some action to facilitate that carriage or use. See United States\n\nv. Bennett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196545\"><a href=\"/opinion/196545/united-states-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1st Cir. 1996). The evidence shows that\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fappellant knew that Betancourt and Wilson-Millán were illegally\n\ncarrying weapons as he drove them to the scene of the crime.\n\nAdditionally, appellant saw Betancourt fire shots at the victim's car,\n\nand appellant later disposed of Betancourt's gun.       This evidence\n\nsupports the inferences that appellant both knew that firearms would be\n\ncarried or used during the carjacking and actively facilitated their\n\nuse.   Therefore, we affirm appellant's conviction on this count.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f                                 III\n\n          Appellant contends that the district court made a series of\n\nerroneous evidentiary rulings which cumulatively denied appellant his\n\nright to a fair trial.     We review each of the district court's\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See United States v.\n\nReeder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762263\"><a href=\"/opinion/762263/united-states-v-george-wayneti-reeder-aka-wayne-reeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Williams v.

We find the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion.\n\n          A.   Evidence of appellant's flight and disguise\n\n          Appellant argues that the district court should not have\n\nadmitted evidence of appellant's flight and disguise during that\n\nflight. In regard to the flight itself, appellant concedes that flight\n\ncan be evidence of a guilty conscience, but argues that evidence of\n\nflight in this case was unfairly prejudicial. In addition, appellant\n\nasserts that introducing evidence of his use of a false identity is\n\nequivalent to impeaching his credibility because it calls into question\n\nhis honesty.\n\n          The law of this circuit clearly allows the district court to\n\nadmit evidence of both flight and use of a false identity if probative\n\nof a guilty conscience: \"Evidence of a defendant's flight and attempts\n\nto conceal or falsify identity may be presented at trial as probative\n\nof a guilty mind if there is an adequate factual predicate creating an\n\ninference of guilt of the crime charged.\" United States v. Candelaria-\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fSilva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198241\"><a href=\"/opinion/198241/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 705 (1st Cir. 1998). Here, the uncontradicted\n\nevidence shows not only that appellant was present during the attempted\n\ncarjacking, but that appellant was the one who pursued the 300ZX and\n\nwho desired the wheel rims. Appellant let Betancourt and Wilson-Millán\n\nout of his car, knowing that they intended to take the other car and\n\nthat they carried illegal weapons. This evidence clearly establishes\n\nan adequate factual predicate of guilt. Therefore, the trial court\n\nproperly admitted evidence of appellant's flight and false identity.\n\n          As to appellant's argument that the evidence of flight was\n\nunfairly prejudicial, the district court found the probative value\n\nsubstantially outweighed any significant prejudice. Rule 403 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence allows relevant evidence to be excluded if\n\n\"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice.\" In reviewing Rule 403 challenges, we are extremely\n\ndeferential to the district court's determination.

Rosario-Peralta,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 (1st Cir. 1999). In assessing the probative value of\n\nthe evidence, the district court specifically pointed to appellant's\n\nprior statement in which he explained his flight and disguise as an\n\neffort to avoid being connected to the attempted carjacking. In light\n\nof this statement, we agree with the district court's finding that\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fevidence of appellant's flight and disguise is probative of a guilty\n\nconscience and not unfairly prejudicial.3 We certainly cannot find an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n          As for appellant's argument that the evidence relating to his\n\ndisguise attacked his credibility and was an impermissible character\n\nattack, we find this argument to be without merit. The evidence was\n\nadmitted as probative of appellant's guilty conscience, not as a\n\ncharacter attack. The reasoning underlying appellant's challenge would\n\nconvert all evidence relating to use of disguises and false names into\n\nimpermissible character attacks.       Given the absurdity of such a\n\nposition, we decline to adopt it.\n\n          B.   Appellant's prior testimony\n\n          Appellant contests the introduction into evidence of his\n\nprior testimony given at the severed trial of his co-defendant. He\n\nargues that this testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial and\n\nshould have been barred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of\n\n3 Appellant also challenges the jury instruction given on flight and\nconcealment of identity. However, appellant does not identify, in this\nappeal, any separate grounds on which he objects to this instruction.\nIn fact, the challenged jury instruction only tempers the evidence of\nflight and disguise. The instruction counseled the jury that\nintentional flight does not create a presumption of guilt, but is only\na basis to infer a guilty conscience. Additionally, the instruction\nreminded jurors that flight may be consistent with innocence. As we\nfind the admission of evidence relating to appellant's flight and use\nof disguise not to be an abuse of discretion, we do not find the jury\ninstruction given on this point to be an abuse of discretion. See\nUnited States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that\nwe review challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion).\n\n                                -13-\n\fEvidence.    First, we note that appellant's prior statements are\n\nadmissible as party admissions.      See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A)\n\n(providing that an out-of-court statement is not hearsay if it is\n\noffered against the party and it is the party's own statement). Next,\n\nwe turn to the Rule 403 balancing question. Here, the prior testimony\n\nbears on appellant's flight, which was relevant as discussed above.\n\nAlso, the testimony is appellant's version of the events, made with the\n\nconsent of his attorney after being advised of his constitutional\n\nrights.     As such, its high probative value cannot be said to be\n\noutweighed by its asserted unfair prejudice, and its introduction does\n\nnot constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n            C.   Testimony of decedents' relatives\n\n            Appellant argues that the testimony given by the decedents'\n\nrelatives4 should have been barred under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules\n\nof Evidence because it was both irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\n\nSpecifically, he charges that this testimony was introduced only to\n\ninflame the jury since the identities of the deceased were not at\n\nissue. We agree with the district court that the identities of the\n\ndeceased were relevant. See Fed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant\n\nevidence as \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any\n\nfact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\n\n\n\n4 Luis González-Pérez, the father of the driver of the 300ZX, and Delma\nBetancourt-Betancourt, the mother of Betancourt, testified.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fprobable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\").\n\nAppellant was charged, and convicted, of aiding and abetting in a\n\ndeadly carjacking. Appellant had not stipulated to the identities of\n\nthe decedents, and, indeed, when a prior witness identified a picture\n\nof the body of the driver of the 300ZX, appellant did not contest that\n\ntestimony for relevance. As to whether the contested testimony was\n\nunfairly prejudicial so as to outweigh the probative value, we find no\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n          D.   Toxicology report for Betancourt\n\n          Appellant also contests the admission of a toxicology report\n\nshowing various drugs in Betancourt's body at the time of death,\n\nclaiming that this report had limited probative value and was unfairly\n\nprejudicial. First, the fact that Betancourt was under the influence\n\nof drugs when he and Wilson-Millán attempted to take the 300ZX bears on\n\nBetancourt's state of mind, as a principal in the crime. Second, the\n\nunfair prejudice created here, associating the appellant with a drug\n\nuser, is not very substantial.         Therefore, we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion by the trial judge in admitting this evidence. Moreover,\n\nthe admission of such evidence, even if erroneous, would not be\n\nsufficient to disturb appellant's conviction.\n\n                                  IV\n\n          Appellant contends that the district court erred when it\n\nrefused to give the jury an accessory-after-the-fact instruction as\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\frequested by the appellant. We review challenges to jury instructions\n\nfor abuse of discretion. See Beatty v. Michael Mach. Bus. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762749\"><a href=\"/opinion/762749/kevin-p-beatty-and-cynthia-l-beatty-v-michael-business-machines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Smith, 145 F.3d at 460. We\n\nfind no abuse of discretion.\n\n          Appellant concedes that here an accessory-after-the-fact\n\ncharge is not a lesser included offense. See United States v. Rivera-\n\nFigueroa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755755\"><a href=\"/opinion/755755/united-states-v-rafael-rivera-figueroa-united-states-of-america-v-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding \"the accessory\n\noffense is not a lesser included offense because it requires proof that\n\nthe principal offense does not, namely, that the defendant assisted\n\nafter the principal crime was committed\") (emphasis in original).\n\nTherefore, appellant is not entitled to this instruction as a matter of\n\nlaw.   See id. at 6.\n\n          However, appellant contends that the accessory-after-the-fact\n\ninstruction was essential to his defense and sufficient evidence\n\nsupported the instruction, and, therefore, the district court's denial\n\nof the instruction is reversible error. United States v. Rosario-\n\nPeralta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567 (1st Cir. 1999), addressed a similar\n\nsituation, a failure to give an accessory-after-the-fact instruction in\n\na carjacking prosecution. There, we set out a four-part test to judge\n\nwhether a defendant is entitled to a particular instruction:\n\n          . . . a trial court's failure to deliver a theory\n          of defense instruction will result in reversal\n          only if: (1) the requested instruction correctly\n          describes the applicable law; (2) sufficient\n          evidence is produced at trial to warrant the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f          instruction; (3) the charge actually delivered\n          does not fairly present the defense; and (4) the\n          requested instruction was essential to the\n          effective presentation of the particular defense.\n\nId. (citing United States v. Montañez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197177\"><a href=\"/opinion/197177/united-states-v-montanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)). Appellant argues that all four requirements are met here,5 but\n\nwe disagree. The evidence presented was insufficient to warrant the\n\nrequested instruction.\n\n          In support of his argument, appellant points to several\n\nfacts: (1) the desired wheel rims would not actually fit on appellant's\n\ncar; (2) the evidence as to appellant's interest in the wheel rims was\n\ncontradictory; (3) one of the witnesses was surprised when she heard\n\nshots; (4) no one discussed how to dispose of the car; and (5) no one\n\nspoke of hurting the driver of the car. None of the evidence to which\n\nappellant points contradicts the facts that (1) appellant expressed a\n\ndesire for new wheel rims; (2) appellant voluntarily turned his car\n\naround and followed the victim's car; (3) appellant voluntarily let\n\nBetancourt and Wilson-Millán out of the car so they could take the\n\nvictim's car; (4) appellant knew that Betancourt and Wilson-Millán had\n\nguns; and (5) appellant waited for Betancourt and Wilson-Millán to\n\nreturn after they began firing at the driver of the 300ZX. Therefore,\n\n\n\n5  However, appellant concedes a legal error in his submitted\ninstruction. His submitted instruction implied that the jury could\nfind appellant guilty of being an accessory-after-the-fact, but\nappellant had not been charged with this offense. We will ignore the\nimplications of this error as they are not necessary to our holding.\n\n                                 -17-\n\flike in Rivera-Figueroa, the evidence here that appellant was only an\n\naccessory-after-the-fact is insufficient to warrant the requested\n\ninstruction.\n\n          In addition, the requested instruction had the potential to\n\nconfuse the jury. In Rivera-Figueroa, we determined that giving the\n\naccessory-after-the-fact instruction was likely to confuse the jury\n\nbecause it requires giving the jury an additional set of elements for\n\nan uncharged crime of which the defendant cannot be convicted. 149\n\nF.3d at 7. That same risk of confusion exists here. Therefore, we\n\ncannot find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing\n\nappellant's requested instruction, much less that any such error was\n\nreversible error.\n\n                                  V\n\n          Finally, appellant argues that federal jurisdiction is\n\nlacking in this case. He alleges that Congress lacks authority to\n\nextend 18 U.S.C. § 2119 to Puerto Rico because the Insular Cases6 bar\n\nthe application of the Commerce Clause to Puerto Rico.7 In Trailer\n\nMarine Transport Corporation v.
