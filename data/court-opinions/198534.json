COPPOLA, ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nLeonard Petricca and Lawrence Petricca on brief pro se.\r\nJoyce Frank, Katharine I. Goree and Kopelman and Paige, P.C.\r\non Motion for Summary Disposition for appellees Dennis Comee and\r\nCity of Gardner.\r\n\nJune 28, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  We have carefully reviewed the record on appeal\r\nas well as the appellants' brief and the memorandum of law\r\nsubmitted by appellees Dennis Comee and the City of Gardner.  We\r\naffirm essentially for the reasons stated in the district court's\r\nmemorandum and order, dated May 27, 1998.  Nothing in appellants'\r\nproffer suggests that any amendment would state a viable claim\r\npursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983.\r\nThe district court's order of dismissal is affirmed.\r\nThe motion for reconsideration of our order of February 16,\r\n1999 is denied.\r\nTreating appellants' \"formal complaint\" as a motion for\r\nsanctions, it is denied.\n",
