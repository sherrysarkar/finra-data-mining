Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n          Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Steven Musone on brief pro se.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart   and Gerard B. Sullivan, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 3, 2001\n\f              Per Curiam. The district court issued a certificate\n\nof appealability to Mr. Musone limited to the question of\n\nwhether he received effective assistance of counsel at his\n\nsentencing.       The      claim     of   ineffective       assistance     rests\n\nsolely   on    defense      counsel's      failure     to    raise    a   double\n\njeopardy argument.              Mr. Musone contends that because his\n\nsentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was\n\ndetermined with reference to the guidelines for arson, the\n\nimposition of the statutory enhancement for use-of-fire in\n\nthe   commission      of    a    felony,   under   18    U.S.C.      §    844(h),\n\nconstitutes multiple punishment for the same offense, a\n\nresult not intended by Congress.\n\n              Mr. Musone was convicted on six counts, including\n\none of conspiracy to commit arson and mail fraud.                             The\n\nfederal appellate courts that have addressed the issue agree\n\nthat conspiracy to commit arson is not the same offense as\n\nuse-of-fire      in   the       commission    of   a    felony.      Under    the\n\nGuidelines, Mr. Musone's sentence on the arson-related group\n\nof charges was properly based on the offense level of the\n\nsubstantive      offense        of   arson.   Congress       has   provided     a\n\nmandatory enhancement under § 844(h) for the use of fire in\n\nthe commission of a felony and the courts have no power to\n\ndisregard it. The fact that Mr. Musone committed arson as\n\fwell as other offenses does not insulate him from punishment\n\nfor the separate offenses of conspiracy and use-of-fire to\n\ncommit a felony. Defense counsel's decision not to raise an\n\nargument not supported by the law of this or any other court\n\nof appeals does not constitute deficient representation\n\nunder Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The\n\njudgment denying the petition brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2255\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -3-\n\f",
