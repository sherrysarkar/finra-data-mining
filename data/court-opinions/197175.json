He  is disabled, he\r\n\nasserts, because his diagnosed depressive disorder interferes\r\n\nwith his ability to  interact with others.  That  ability, he\r\n\nsays,   is  a   \"major  life   activit[y]\"  which   has  been\r\n\n\"substantially  limit[ed]\" within the meaning of the ADA.  42\r\n\nU.S.C.   12102(2).

The  facts are described  in the light\r\n\nmost  favorable to  Soileau, the  party against  whom summary\r\n\njudgment  was  entered.     Hoeppner  v.  Crotched   Mountain\r                                                                         \r\n\nRehabilitation Ctr., Inc., 31 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1994)\r                                     \r\n\n          Soileau worked  in various capacities  for Guilford\r\n\nfrom 1979 until April 22, 1994.  In 1986, he began working in\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthe  industrial  engineering  department  as   a  time  study\r\n\nanalyst, which involved timing various aspects  of production\r\n\nat Guilford.   A subset  of his duties  involved facilitating\r\n\nProcess Activity Analysis (\"PAA\")  meetings, at which ways of\r\n\nimproving  department efficiency  were discussed.    In 1992,\r\n\nSoileau began working for a new supervisor, Matt Earnest, who\r\n\nfound  areas  of Soileau's  performance  not  to his  liking.\r\n\nAround this time, Soileau requested a pay raise which was not\r\n\ngranted; after this, Earnest perceived a marked deterioration\r\n\nin Soileau's attitude.   The relationship between Soileau and\r\n\nEarnest quickly soured, with Soileau feeling that Earnest was\r\n\nharassing him.   While  rating Soileau's work  performance as\r\n\naverage to above average, Earnest consistently cautioned that\r\n\nSoileau needed to gain credibility and the respect of his co-\r\n\nworkers.\r\n\n          On  May 10,  1993,  Earnest gave  Soileau a  verbal\r\n\nwarning  about  his  negative  attitude  at  work.    Earnest\r\n\nrequested that  Soileau elicit  his co-workers' views  on his\r\n\nperformance, which  Soileau did.  When  Earnest asked Soileau\r\n\nto come up with  a plan to address the  weaknesses identified\r\n\nin this survey,  Soileau refused, because he  felt the survey\r\n\ndid not show  any problem areas.  On March  22, 1994, Earnest\r\n\ninstructed Soileau  to train a  co-worker to perform  some of\r\n\nSoileau's duties in preparation for expanding the PAA program\r\n\nto other departments.  When Soileau did not do so (because he\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nfelt the request  was not authorized  by the pertinent  plant\r\n\ncommittees), a dispute arose between the two men.\r\n\n          After consulting with the company's human resources\r\n\nmanager,    Earnest   issued   Soileau   a   \"Final   Written\r\n\nWarning/Suspension\" on  March 23, 1994.   This warning listed\r\n\nfour performance deficiencies, ordered  a two day suspension,\r\n\nand required Soileau to evaluate his own performance and come\r\n\nback  with an improvement plan.  The warning said there would\r\n\nbe  a four  week  period during  which Soileau's  performance\r\n\nwould be monitored.   Failure to improve would lead  to other\r\n\nconsequences, which could  include job termination.   Earnest\r\n\nexplained all of this to Soileau that day.\r\n\n          The  final  warning proved,  understandably,  to be\r\n\nvery  stressful  for Soileau.    On  March 28,  Soileau  told\r\n\nEarnest  that he had been suicidal  several years earlier and\r\n\nthat he feared he was becoming  ill again.  Earnest had  been\r\n\nunaware  of Soileau's condition; all he had known was that in\r\n\n1990 Soileau had taken a disability leave for stress.\r\n\n          On April 6, Soileau went to see a psychologist, Dr.\r\n\nDannel Starbird, whom he had seen four years earlier during a\r\n\ndepressive episode which had been precipitated in part by his\r\n\ndeteriorating relationship with his girlfriend.  In 1990, Dr.\r\n\nStarbird had  diagnosed  Soileau with  dysthymia,  a  chronic\r\n\ndepressive  disorder characterized  by intermittent  bouts of\r\n\ndepression.  On Dr. Starbird's advice, Soileau had sought and\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nreceived  a five  week disability  leave from  work.   He had\r\n\nreturned  to  work without  restriction  and  had no  further\r\n\npsychological counselling  until just after  he received  the\r\n\nfinal warning in March 1994.\r\n\n          Soileau  told  Dr. Starbird  that  his  job was  in\r\n\njeopardy.  Dr. Starbird diagnosed Soileau as suffering from a\r\n\nbout  of depression, a condition  that was probably caused by\r\n\nreceiving the warning.  On April 7, Soileau told Earnest that\r\n\nhe was  having a difficult time interacting with other people\r\n\nand  having a  particularly  hard time  facilitating the  PAA\r\n\nmeetings.  Earnest  agreed that, for the time  being, Soileau\r\n\nwould be  relieved of  his responsibilities for  facilitating\r\n\nmeetings and would mainly do clerical work.  That was done.\r\n\n          On April 12,  Dr. Starbird wrote to  Guilford.  The\r\n\nletter asked that Soileau's work duties be \"restricted  so as\r\n\nto   avoid   responsibilities   which   require   significant\r\n\ninteraction with  other employees,\" and  advised that Soileau\r\n\n\"should not be ridiculed, provoked or startled by or in front\r\n\nof supervisors or other employees.\"\r\n\n          Earnest and  Soileau met on April  21; Earnest said\r\n\nhe felt the  accommodations already made met  the requests in\r\n\nthe doctor's letter.   At no time during that  meeting or the\r\n\nfour  week trial  period did  Soileau present  an improvement\r\n\nplan  to  address  the  four  points  raised  in the  written\r\n\nwarning.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On April 22,  Soileau's employment was  terminated.\r\n\nEarnest told  Soileau  it  was  because  there  had  been  no\r\n\nimprovement in the four problem areas and because Soileau had\r\n\nnot  submitted an  improvement plan.   In May,  Soileau began\r\n\nlooking for another job.   He looked for full-time employment\r\n\nand placed no restrictions on the type of work sought.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n          Review  of entry  of summary  judgment is  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nWood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 927 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r                           \r\n\n          As the district court noted, interpretation of  the\r\n\nADA and of the Maine Human  Rights Act have proceeded hand in\r\n\nhand,  and so we discuss the ADA, which has provided guidance\r\n\nto Maine  courts in interpreting the state  statute.  Winston\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Maine Technical College Sys., 631 A.2d 70, 74 (Me. 1993),\r                                            \r\n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1643 (1994).  \r                        \r\n\n          Soileau's  initial claim under  the ADA  depends on\r\n\nhis establishing  that he suffers from  a \"disability\" within\r\n\nthe meaning of the statute.  Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n96  F.3d  506, 511  (1st Cir.  1996);  see also  42  U.S.C.  \r                                                           \r\n\n12112(a).  The definition of disability must be understood in\r\n\nlight of congressional objectives in enacting the ADA.  In an\r\n\neffort to eliminate  discrimination against individuals  with\r\n\ndisabilities,   the   statute   prohibits    employers   from\r\n\ndiscriminating  against   \"a  qualified  individual   with  a\r\n\ndisability because of the disability.\"  42 U.S.C.   12112(a).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nThe antidiscrimination obligation  is unusual in the  context\r\n\nof  federal civil  rights statutes.   It  imposes not  only a\r\n\nprohibition against discrimination,  but also, in appropriate\r\n\ncircumstances,  a  positive  obligation  to  make  reasonable\r\n\naccommodations.  Absent a disability, however, no obligations\r\n\nare triggered for the employer.\r\n\n          Only  one   of  the  ADA's  three   definitions  of\r\n\n\"disability\"  is  pertinent here:    Soileau  claims that  he\r\n\nsuffered   from  \"a  physical   or  mental   impairment  that\r\n\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities\r\n\nof such  individual.\"   Id.   12102(2)(A); see  Katz v.  City\r                                                                         \r\n\nMetal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                     \r\n\n          To make  out a  prima facie case  of discrimination\r\n\nbased  on   this  definition  of  disability,   Soileau  must\r\n\nestablish  three elements:    (1)that he  had a  \"physical or\r\n\nmental impairment\"  that  (2) \"substantially  limits\" (3)  \"a\r\n\nmajor  life activity.\"  42 U.S.C.   12102(2)(A).  Soileau has\r\n\nsuccessfully  shown  that  he  met  the  first  element;  his\r\n\ndiagnosed dysthymia is a mental impairment within the meaning\r\n\nof  the statute.  See 29 C.F.R.   1630.2(h)(2).  However, the\r                                 \r\n\nevidence Soileau  produced does not  suffice, as a  matter of\r\n\nlaw,  for   a  reasonable  jury  to  conclude   that  he  was\r\n\nsubstantially  impaired in  a major  life activity.   Soileau\r\n\nconstructs his  argument by saying  that the  ability to  get\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nalong with others is the major life activity2 in  which he is\r\n\nsubstantially  impaired.  The  regulations promulgated by the\r\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission  under the ADA do not\r\n\nlist  such an  ability  among  the  exemplars of  major  life\r\n\nactivities.3  Id.   1630.2(i).  \r                             \r\n\n          The concept  of \"ability to get  along with others\"\r\n\nis  remarkably  elastic, perhaps  so much  so  as to  make it\r\n\nunworkable as a definition.  While such an ability is a skill\r\n\nto  be  prized, it  is different  in  kind from  breathing or\r\n\nwalking,  two exemplars  which are  used in  the regulations.\r\n\nFurther, whether a person has such an ability may be a matter\r\n\nof  subjective judgment; and the ability may or may not exist\r\n\ndepending on  context.  Here, Soileau's  alleged inability to\r\n\ninteract  with others  came  and went  and  was triggered  by\r\n\nvicissitudes  of  life  which  are   normally  stressful  for\r\n\nordinary people -- losing a girlfriend or being criticized by\r\n\na  supervisor.   Soileau's last  depressive episode  was four\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Although Soileau  also argued to the  district court that\r\nhis ability to work was the major life activity that had been\r\nimpaired,  he has not pursued  this claim on  appeal.  In any\r\nevent, this claim would fail because  he has not shown he  is\r\nunable to work.  See 29 C.F.R.   1630.2(j)(3).\r                                \r\n\n3.  The  EEOC Compliance  Manual  does list  interacting with\r\nothers as  a  major life  activity.   EEOC Compliance  Manual\r\n(CCH)   902.3,   6883, at 5311 (1995).  While  this court has\r\nfound reference to the  EEOC Compliance Manual to be  helpful\r\non occasion,  see, e.g., Katz, 87  F.3d at 31, the  manual is\r                                         \r\nhardly  binding.  Cf. Schmidt  v. Safeway Inc.,  864 F. Supp.\r                                                         \r\n991,  1001 (D.  Or.  1994) (noting  that  the EEOC  Technical\r\nAssistance Manual \"is not law\" and \"does [not] have the force\r\nof law\").\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nyears earlier, and  he had  no apparent  difficulties in  the\r\n\ninterim.  To impose legally enforceable duties on an employer\r\n\nbased  on such an amorphous concept would be problematic.  It\r\n\nmay  be  that  a  more  narrowly  defined  concept  going  to\r\n\nessential  attributes of  human  communication  could,  in  a\r\n\nparticular  setting,  be  understood   to  be  a  major  life\r\n\nactivity, but we need not address that question here.\r\n\n          But  even  assuming,  dubitante,  that  a colorable\r                                                     \r\n\nclaim may be made that \"ability to get  along with others\" is\r\n\nor may be (on specific facts) a major life activity under the\r\n\nADA,  the  evidence  here   does  not  show  any  substantial\r\n\nlimitation.  Under the  relevant ADA regulation an individual\r\n\nfaces a \"substantial limitation\" when he is:\r\n\n          (i)    Unable  to perform  a  major  life\r\n          activity that the  average person in  the\r\n          general population can perform; or\r\n          (ii)  Significantly restricted as  to the\r\n          condition, manner or duration under which\r\n          an  individual  can perform  a particular\r\n          major  life activity  as compared  to the\r\n          condition,  manner,   or  duration  under\r\n          which the  average person in  the general\r\n          population  can  perform that  same major\r\n          life activity.\r\n\nId.      1630.2(j)(l).    One  factor  to  be  considered  in\r               \r\n\ndetermining whether an individual is substantially limited in\r\n\na major life  activity is  \"the nature and  severity\" of  the\r\n\nimpairment.   Id.   1630.2(j)(2)(i).   The evidence  does not\r                             \r\n\nestablish   that  Soileau   had   particular  difficulty   in\r\n\ninteracting   with   others,  except   for   his  supervisor.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nImpairment  is to be measured in relation to normalcy, or, in\r\n\nany event, to what  the average person does.   Soileau claims\r\n\nhe had to  leave pubs  and stores when  they became  crowded.\r\n\nBut there is nothing extraordinary about preferring uncrowded\r\n\nplaces.   Soileau  performed  his normal  daily chores,  went\r\n\ngrocery  shopping, and visited pubs.   That he  left pubs and\r\n\nstores  when  he felt  there were  too  many people  does not\r\n\nestablish that the nature and severity of his impairment were\r\n\nsubstantial.\r\n\n          Another  factor to  be  considered is  the expected\r\n\nduration of the  impairment.  Id.   1630.2(j)(2)(ii).   While\r                                             \r\n\nDr.  Starbird  believes  that Soileau's  underlying  disorder\r\n\n(dysthymia) will be a life-long condition, Soileau has failed\r\n\nto  adduce any  evidence that  his impairment  -- the  acute,\r\n\nepisodic  depression   --  will  be  long-term.     His  last\r\n\ndepressive  episode, in 1990, required  only a five week work\r\n\nabsence  before he was able  to return to  his duties without\r\n\nrestriction.     During   the  1994  episode,   Dr.  Starbird\r\n\nsuggested, at most, that Soileau not have to run meetings for\r\n\na  four  month  period.     Considering  these  factors  both\r\n\nseparately and together, Soileau has not met his burden.  The\r\n\nimpairment  must be  a significant one  to trigger  the Act's\r\n\nobligation.\r\n\n                             III\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Soileau  asserts  an  independent  claim  that  his\r\n\nemployment  was terminated in  retaliation for his requesting\r\n\nan accommodation.   He may  assert such  a claim even  if the\r\n\nunderlying  claim of  disability fails.   Mesnick  v. General\r                                                                         \r\n\nElec.,  Co., 950 F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n504 U.S. 985 (1992).\r\n\n          The   ADA   prohibits  discrimination   against  an\r\n\nindividual \"because  such individual  has opposed any  act or\r\n\npractice  made  unlawful  by  this chapter  or  because  such\r\n\nindividual   made   a   charge,   testified,   assisted,   or\r\n\nparticipated in any  manner in an  investigation, proceeding,\r\n\nor hearing under this chapter.\"  42 U.S.C.   12203(a).\r\n\n          It is questionable whether  Soileau fits within the\r\n\nliteral language of  the statute:   he filed  no charge,  nor\r\n\nparticipated  in any  investigation.   Moreover,  he did  not\r\n\nliterally oppose any act or practice, but simply requested an\r\n\naccommodation,  which was  given.   It would  seem anomalous,\r\n\nhowever, to think Congress intended no retaliation protection\r\n\nfor employees who request  a reasonable accommodation  unless\r\n\nthey also file a  formal charge.  This would  leave employees\r\n\nunprotected  if an  employer  granted  the accommodation  and\r\n\nshortly  thereafter terminated  the employee  in retaliation.\r\n\nAnd so,  without addressing  the issue  any further,  we will\r\n\nassume arguendo that Soileau's  request brings him within the\r                           \r\n\ncoverage of 42 U.S.C.   12203(a).\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          The ADA incorporates the procedures and enforcement\r\n\nmechanisms  of  Title  VII,  the  basic  statute  prohibiting\r\n\ndiscrimination   in  employment.      See  id.      12117(a).\r                                                          \r\n\nAccordingly, guidance on the proper analysis of Soileau's ADA\r\n\nretaliation  claim is  found in  Title VII  cases.

City of Boston, 35  F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir. 1994) (per\r                                   \r\n\ncuriam); Hoeppner, 31 F.3d at 14.  \r                             \r\n\n          Soileau relies  primarily on the timing  of events,\r\n\nsaying  he  was  discharged  right  after  he  asked  for  an\r\n\naccommodation.   True enough.   But that narrow focus ignores\r\n\nthe larger sequence of events and also the larger truth.  The\r\n\nlarger picture undercuts any claim of causation.\r\n\n          Soileau was  disciplined and warned of discharge if\r\n\nhis  performance did not  improve and if he  did not submit a\r\n\nperformance plan.  The discipline and warning happened before\r\n\nGuilford  ever  knew  that   Soileau  was  asserting  he  was\r\n\npresently   disabled  and  before   Soileau  asked   for  the\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\naccommodation of not  running meetings.4   Accordingly,  that\r\n\ndiscipline   and  explicit  warning   could  not   have  been\r\n\nmotivated, even in part, by a request for an accommodation.5\r\n\n          There is  no other evidence tending  to support the\r\n\nretaliation claim.   Soileau admitted at  his deposition that\r\n\nhe never formulated any improvement plan for Earnest.  He had\r\n\nbeen told that termination  was a possible outcome if  he did\r\n\nnot  submit a  plan.   On  appeal,  Soileau argues  that  his\r\n\nseeking  psychological   counselling  was,  in   essence,  an\r\n\nimprovement plan.  If so, he never said that to his employer,\r\n\nwho knew only that no plan had been provided.  Further, it is\r\n\nundisputed  that  in the  interim  Guilford  did provide  the\r\n\naccommodation which Soileau  and his psychologist  requested.\r\n\nSoileau  no longer  had to  run meetings.   Evidence  that an\r\n\nemployer  willingly  granted  an  employee's request  for  an\r\n\naccommodation, though by no  means dispositive of the matter,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Soileau had not claimed earlier that he  was disabled and\r\nthe employer is  not put  on notice of  a present  disability\r\nmerely because an employee  some years in the past  has taken\r\nmedical leave or has sought psychological counselling.\r\n\n5.  A  danger of the line of argument presented by Soileau is\r\nthat it  would  permit  an  employee  already  on  notice  of\r\nperformance problems to  seek shelter in  a belated claim  of\r\ndisability.   The ADA was not meant to prevent employers from\r\ntaking  steps to  address  poor  performance by  non-disabled\r\nemployees.  As  Judge Sporkin  has said in  rejecting an  ADA\r\nretaliation claim, \"To  allow the antidiscrimination laws  to\r\nbe used  by poorly performing employees  will eventually work\r\nto the detriment of those who have a  legitimate need for the\r\nprotection of  the laws.\"  Henry v.

Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4551 et seq.   He first claims that Guilford discriminated against him because of his disability.  He is disabled, he asserts, because his diagnosed depressive disorder interferes with his ability to interact with others.  That ability, he says, is a \"major life activit[y]\" which has been \"substantially limit[ed]\" within the meaning of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2).  Secondly, he says, the termination of his employment was in retaliation for his requesting a reasonable accommodation.  His claims were rejected on summary judgment by the trial court in a carefully reasoned opinion, Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 928 F.Supp. 37 (D.Me.1996).

In 1986, he began working in the industrial engineering department as a time study analyst, which involved timing various aspects of production at Guilford.  A subset of his duties involved facilitating Process Activity Analysis (\"PAA\") meetings, at which ways of improving department efficiency were discussed.  In 1992, Soileau began working for a new supervisor, Matt Earnest, who found areas of Soileau's performance not to his liking.  Around this time, Soileau requested a pay raise which was not granted;  after this, Earnest perceived a marked deterioration in Soileau's attitude.  The relationship between Soileau and Earnest quickly soured, with Soileau feeling that Earnest was harassing him.  While rating Soileau's work performance as average to above average, Earnest consistently cautioned that Soileau needed to gain credibility and the respect of his co-workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 1993, Earnest gave Soileau a verbal warning about his negative attitude at work.  Earnest requested that Soileau elicit his co-workers' views on his performance, which Soileau did.  When Earnest asked Soileau to come up with a plan to address the weaknesses identified in this survey, Soileau refused, because he felt the survey did not show any problem areas.  On March 22, 1994, Earnest instructed Soileau to train a co-worker to perform some of Soileau's duties in preparation for expanding the PAA program to other departments.  When Soileau did not do so (because he felt the request was not authorized by the pertinent plant committees), a dispute arose between the two men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consulting with the company's human resources manager, Earnest issued Soileau a \"Final Written Warning/Suspension\" on March 23, 1994.  This warning listed four performance deficiencies, ordered a two day suspension, and required Soileau to evaluate his own performance and come back with an improvement plan.  The warning said there would be a four week period during which Soileau's performance would be monitored.  Failure to improve would lead to other consequences, which could include job termination.  Earnest explained all of this to Soileau that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final warning proved, understandably, to be very stressful for Soileau.  On March 28, Soileau told Earnest that he had been suicidal several years earlier and that he feared he was becoming ill again.  Earnest had been unaware of Soileau's condition;  all he had known was that in 1990 Soileau had taken a disability leave for stress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, Soileau went to see a psychologist, Dr. Dannel Starbird, whom he had seen four years earlier during a depressive episode which had been precipitated in part by his deteriorating relationship with his girlfriend.  In 1990, Dr. Starbird had diagnosed Soileau with dysthymia, a chronic depressive disorder characterized by intermittent bouts of depression.  On Dr. Starbird's advice, Soileau had sought and received a five week disability leave from work.  He had returned to work without restriction and had no further psychological counselling until just after he received the final warning in March 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau told Dr. Starbird that his job was in jeopardy.  Dr. Starbird diagnosed Soileau as suffering from a bout of depression, a condition that was probably caused by receiving the warning.  On April 7, Soileau told Earnest that he was having a difficult time interacting with other people and having a particularly hard time facilitating the PAA meetings.  Earnest agreed that, for the time being, Soileau would be relieved of his responsibilities for facilitating meetings and would mainly do clerical work.  That was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, Dr. Starbird wrote to Guilford.  The letter asked that Soileau's work duties be \"restricted so as to avoid responsibilities which require significant interaction with other employees,\" and advised that Soileau \"should not be ridiculed, provoked or startled by or in front of supervisors or other employees.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earnest and Soileau met on April 21;  Earnest said he felt the accommodations already made met the requests in the doctor's letter.  At no time during that meeting or the four week trial period did Soileau present an improvement plan to address the four points raised in the written warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, Soileau's employment was terminated.  Earnest told Soileau it was because there had been no improvement in the four problem areas and because Soileau had not submitted an improvement plan.  In May, Soileau began looking for another job.  He looked for full-time employment and placed no restrictions on the type of work sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of entry of summary judgment is de novo.

Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir.1996);  see also 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).  The definition of disability must be understood in light of congressional objectives in enacting the ADA.  In an effort to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities, the statute prohibits employers from discriminating against \"a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).  The antidiscrimination obligation is unusual in the context of federal civil rights statutes.  It imposes not only a prohibition against discrimination, but also, in appropriate circumstances, a positive obligation to make reasonable accommodations.  Absent a disability, however, no obligations are triggered for the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only one of the ADA's three definitions of \"disability\" is pertinent here:  Soileau claims that he suffered from \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\"  Id. &#167; 12102(2)(A);  see Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 30-31 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make out a prima facie case of discrimination based on this definition of disability, Soileau must establish three elements:  (1) that he had a \"physical or mental impairment\" that (2) \"substantially limits\" (3) \"a major life activity.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A).  Soileau has successfully shown that he met the first element;  his diagnosed dysthymia is a mental impairment within the meaning of the statute.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(h)(2).  However, the evidence Soileau produced does not suffice, as a matter of law, for a reasonable jury to conclude that he was substantially impaired in a major life activity.  Soileau constructs his argument by saying that the ability to get along with others is the major life activity<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in which he is substantially impaired.  The regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under the ADA do not list such an ability among the exemplars of major life activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Id. &#167; 1630.2(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concept of \"ability to get along with others\" is remarkably elastic, perhaps so much so as to make it unworkable as a definition.  While such an ability is a skill to be prized, it is different in kind from breathing or walking, two exemplars which are used in the regulations.  Further, whether a person has such an ability may be a matter of subjective judgment;  and the ability may or may not exist depending on context.  Here, Soileau's alleged inability to interact with others came and went and was triggered by vicissitudes of life which are normally stressful for ordinary people--losing a girlfriend or being criticized by a supervisor.  Soileau's last depressive episode was four years earlier, and he had no apparent difficulties in the interim.  To impose legally enforceable duties on an employer based on such an amorphous concept would be problematic.  It may be that a more narrowly defined concept going to essential attributes of human communication could, in a particular setting, be understood to be a major life activity, but we need not address that question here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even assuming, dubitante, that a colorable claim may be made that \"ability to get along with others\" is or may be (on specific facts) a major life activity under the ADA, the evidence here does not show any substantial limitation.  Under the relevant ADA regulation an individual faces a \"substantial limitation\" when he is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 1630.2(j)(1).  One factor to be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity is \"the nature and severity\" of the impairment.  Id. &#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(i).  The evidence does not establish that Soileau had particular difficulty in interacting with others, except for his supervisor.  Impairment is to be measured in relation to normalcy, or, in any event, to what the average person does.  Soileau claims he had to leave pubs and stores when they became crowded.  But there is nothing extraordinary about preferring uncrowded places.  Soileau performed his normal daily chores, went grocery shopping, and visited pubs.  That he left pubs and stores when he felt there were too many people does not establish that the nature and severity of his impairment were substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor to be considered is the expected duration of the impairment.  Id. &#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(ii).  While Dr. Starbird believes that Soileau's underlying disorder (dysthymia) will be a life-long condition, Soileau has failed to adduce any evidence that his impairment--the acute, episodic depression--will be long-term.  His last depressive episode, in 1990, required only a five week work absence before he was able to return to his duties without restriction.  During the 1994 episode, Dr. Starbird suggested, at most, that Soileau not have to run meetings for a four month period.  Considering these factors both separately and together, Soileau has not met his burden.  The impairment must be a significant one to trigger the Act's obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau asserts an independent claim that his employment was terminated in retaliation for his requesting an accommodation.  He may assert such a claim even if the underlying claim of disability fails.  Mesnick v. General Elec., Co., 950 F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prohibits discrimination against an individual \"because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is questionable whether Soileau fits within the literal language of the statute:  he filed no charge, nor participated in any investigation.  Moreover, he did not literally oppose any act or practice, but simply requested an accommodation, which was given.  It would seem anomalous, however, to think Congress intended no retaliation protection for employees who request a reasonable accommodation unless they also file a formal charge.  This would leave employees unprotected if an employer granted the accommodation and shortly thereafter terminated the employee in retaliation.  And so, without addressing the issue any further, we will assume arguendo that Soileau's request brings him within the coverage of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA incorporates the procedures and enforcement mechanisms of Title VII, the basic statute prohibiting discrimination in employment.  See id. &#167; 12117(a).  Accordingly, guidance on the proper analysis of Soileau's ADA retaliation claim is found in Title VII cases.   Carparts Distrib.  Ctr., Inc. v. Automotive Wholesaler's Assoc. of New England, Inc., 37 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By analogy to Title VII, to establish a claim of retaliation Soileau must show that he was engaged in protected conduct, that he was discharged, and that there was a causal connection between the discharge and the conduct.  Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam);  Hoeppner, 31 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau relies primarily on the timing of events, saying he was discharged right after he asked for an accommodation.  True enough.  But that narrow focus ignores the larger sequence of events and also the larger truth.  The larger picture undercuts any claim of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau was disciplined and warned of discharge if his performance did not improve and if he did not submit a performance plan.  The discipline and warning happened before Guilford ever knew that Soileau was asserting he was presently disabled and before Soileau asked for the accommodation of not running meetings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, that discipline and explicit warning could not have been motivated, even in part, by a request for an accommodation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no other evidence tending to support the retaliation claim.  Soileau admitted at his deposition that he never formulated any improvement plan for Earnest.  He had been told that termination was a possible outcome if he did not submit a plan.  On appeal, Soileau argues that his seeking psychological counselling was, in essence, an improvement plan.  If so, he never said that to his employer, who knew only that no plan had been provided.  Further, it is undisputed that in the interim Guilford did provide the accommodation which Soileau and his psychologist requested.  Soileau no longer had to run meetings.  Evidence that an employer willingly granted an employee's request for an accommodation, though by no means dispositive of the matter, tends to militate against making an inference of retaliation in a case like this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the timing dictates against concluding that the request for accommodation caused the termination, and nothing else provides evidence from which such an inference may be drawn.  While the discipline of termination was swift, and even harsh, the evidence does not support a retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of summary judgment for the defendant is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Soileau also argued to the district court that his ability to work was the major life activity that had been impaired, he has not pursued this claim on appeal.  In any event, this claim would fail because he has not shown he is unable to work.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The EEOC Compliance Manual does list interacting with others as a major life activity.  EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) &#167; 902.3, p 6883, at 5311 (1995).  While this court has found reference to the EEOC Compliance Manual to be helpful on occasion, see, e.g., Katz, 87 F.3d at 31, the manual is hardly binding.  Cf. Schmidt v. Safeway Inc., 864 F.Supp. 991, 1001 (D.Or.1994) (noting that the EEOC Technical Assistance Manual \"is not law\" and \"does [not] have the force of law\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Soileau had not claimed earlier that he was disabled and the employer is not put on notice of a present disability merely because an employee some years in the past has taken medical leave or has sought psychological counselling</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> A danger of the line of argument presented by Soileau is that it would permit an employee already on notice of performance problems to seek shelter in a belated claim of disability.  The ADA was not meant to prevent employers from taking steps to address poor performance by non-disabled employees.  As Judge Sporkin has said in rejecting an ADA retaliation claim, \"To allow the antidiscrimination laws to be used by poorly performing employees will eventually work to the detriment of those who have a legitimate need for the protection of the laws.\"  Henry v.

Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4551 et seq.   He first claims that Guilford discriminated against him because of his disability.  He is disabled, he asserts, because his diagnosed depressive disorder interferes with his ability to interact with others.  That ability, he says, is a \"major life activit[y]\" which has been \"substantially limit[ed]\" within the meaning of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2).  Secondly, he says, the termination of his employment was in retaliation for his requesting a reasonable accommodation.  His claims were rejected on summary judgment by the trial court in a carefully reasoned opinion, Soileau v.

In 1986, he began working in the industrial engineering department as a time study analyst, which involved timing various aspects of production at Guilford.  A subset of his duties involved facilitating Process Activity Analysis (\"PAA\") meetings, at which ways of improving department efficiency were discussed.  In 1992, Soileau began working for a new supervisor, Matt Earnest, who found areas of Soileau's performance not to his liking.  Around this time, Soileau requested a pay raise which was not granted;  after this, Earnest perceived a marked deterioration in Soileau's attitude.  The relationship between Soileau and Earnest quickly soured, with Soileau feeling that Earnest was harassing him.  While rating Soileau's work performance as average to above average, Earnest consistently cautioned that Soileau needed to gain credibility and the respect of his co-workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 1993, Earnest gave Soileau a verbal warning about his negative attitude at work.  Earnest requested that Soileau elicit his co-workers' views on his performance, which Soileau did.  When Earnest asked Soileau to come up with a plan to address the weaknesses identified in this survey, Soileau refused, because he felt the survey did not show any problem areas.  On March 22, 1994, Earnest instructed Soileau to train a co-worker to perform some of Soileau's duties in preparation for expanding the PAA program to other departments.  When Soileau did not do so (because he felt the request was not authorized by the pertinent plant committees), a dispute arose between the two men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consulting with the company's human resources manager, Earnest issued Soileau a \"Final Written Warning/Suspension\" on March 23, 1994.  This warning listed four performance deficiencies, ordered a two day suspension, and required Soileau to evaluate his own performance and come back with an improvement plan.  The warning said there would be a four week period during which Soileau's performance would be monitored.  Failure to improve would lead to other consequences, which could include job termination.  Earnest explained all of this to Soileau that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final warning proved, understandably, to be very stressful for Soileau.  On March 28, Soileau told Earnest that he had been suicidal several years earlier and that he feared he was becoming ill again.  Earnest had been unaware of Soileau's condition;  all he had known was that in 1990 Soileau had taken a disability leave for stress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, Soileau went to see a psychologist, Dr. Dannel Starbird, whom he had seen four years earlier during a depressive episode which had been precipitated in part by his deteriorating relationship with his girlfriend.  In 1990, Dr. Starbird had diagnosed Soileau with dysthymia, a chronic depressive disorder characterized by intermittent bouts of depression.  On Dr. Starbird's advice, Soileau had sought and received a five week disability leave from work.  He had returned to work without restriction and had no further psychological counselling until just after he received the final warning in March 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau told Dr. Starbird that his job was in jeopardy.  Dr. Starbird diagnosed Soileau as suffering from a bout of depression, a condition that was probably caused by receiving the warning.  On April 7, Soileau told Earnest that he was having a difficult time interacting with other people and having a particularly hard time facilitating the PAA meetings.  Earnest agreed that, for the time being, Soileau would be relieved of his responsibilities for facilitating meetings and would mainly do clerical work.  That was done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, Dr. Starbird wrote to Guilford.  The letter asked that Soileau's work duties be \"restricted so as to avoid responsibilities which require significant interaction with other employees,\" and advised that Soileau \"should not be ridiculed, provoked or startled by or in front of supervisors or other employees.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earnest and Soileau met on April 21;  Earnest said he felt the accommodations already made met the requests in the doctor's letter.  At no time during that meeting or the four week trial period did Soileau present an improvement plan to address the four points raised in the written warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, Soileau's employment was terminated.  Earnest told Soileau it was because there had been no improvement in the four problem areas and because Soileau had not submitted an improvement plan.  In May, Soileau began looking for another job.  He looked for full-time employment and placed no restrictions on the type of work sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of entry of summary judgment is de novo.

The definition of disability must be understood in light of congressional objectives in enacting the ADA.  In an effort to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities, the statute prohibits employers from discriminating against \"a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).  The antidiscrimination obligation is unusual in the context of federal civil rights statutes.  It imposes not only a prohibition against discrimination, but also, in appropriate circumstances, a positive obligation to make reasonable accommodations.

Soileau has successfully shown that he met the first element;  his diagnosed dysthymia is a mental impairment within the meaning of the statute.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(h)(2).  However, the evidence Soileau produced does not suffice, as a matter of law, for a reasonable jury to conclude that he was substantially impaired in a major life activity.

Under the relevant ADA regulation an individual faces a \"substantial limitation\" when he is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 1630.2(j)(1).  One factor to be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity is \"the nature and severity\" of the impairment.  Id. &#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(i).  The evidence does not establish that Soileau had particular difficulty in interacting with others, except for his supervisor.  Impairment is to be measured in relation to normalcy, or, in any event, to what the average person does.  Soileau claims he had to leave pubs and stores when they became crowded.  But there is nothing extraordinary about preferring uncrowded places.  Soileau performed his normal daily chores, went grocery shopping, and visited pubs.  That he left pubs and stores when he felt there were too many people does not establish that the nature and severity of his impairment were substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another factor to be considered is the expected duration of the impairment.  Id. &#167; 1630.2(j)(2)(ii).  While Dr. Starbird believes that Soileau's underlying disorder (dysthymia) will be a life-long condition, Soileau has failed to adduce any evidence that his impairment--the acute, episodic depression--will be long-term.  His last depressive episode, in 1990, required only a five week work absence before he was able to return to his duties without restriction.  During the 1994 episode, Dr. Starbird suggested, at most, that Soileau not have to run meetings for a four month period.  Considering these factors both separately and together, Soileau has not met his burden.  The impairment must be a significant one to trigger the Act's obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau asserts an independent claim that his employment was terminated in retaliation for his requesting an accommodation.  He may assert such a claim even if the underlying claim of disability fails.  Mesnick v. General Elec., Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 827 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2965</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></span> (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prohibits discrimination against an individual \"because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is questionable whether Soileau fits within the literal language of the statute:  he filed no charge, nor participated in any investigation.  Moreover, he did not literally oppose any act or practice, but simply requested an accommodation, which was given.  It would seem anomalous, however, to think Congress intended no retaliation protection for employees who request a reasonable accommodation unless they also file a formal charge.  This would leave employees unprotected if an employer granted the accommodation and shortly thereafter terminated the employee in retaliation.  And so, without addressing the issue any further, we will assume arguendo that Soileau's request brings him within the coverage of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA incorporates the procedures and enforcement mechanisms of Title VII, the basic statute prohibiting discrimination in employment.  See id. &#167; 12117(a).  Accordingly, guidance on the proper analysis of Soileau's ADA retaliation claim is found in Title VII cases.   Carparts Distrib.  Ctr., Inc. v. Automotive Wholesaler's Assoc. of New England, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679526\"><a href=\"/opinion/679526/carparts-distribution-center-inc-v-automotive-wholesalers-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By analogy to Title VII, to establish a claim of retaliation Soileau must show that he was engaged in protected conduct, that he was discharged, and that there was a causal connection between the discharge and the conduct.  Wyatt v. City of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195603\"><a href=\"/opinion/195603/wyatt-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam);  Hoeppner, 31 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau relies primarily on the timing of events, saying he was discharged right after he asked for an accommodation.  True enough.  But that narrow focus ignores the larger sequence of events and also the larger truth.  The larger picture undercuts any claim of causation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soileau was disciplined and warned of discharge if his performance did not improve and if he did not submit a performance plan.  The discipline and warning happened before Guilford ever knew that Soileau was asserting he was presently disabled and before Soileau asked for the accommodation of not running meetings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Accordingly, that discipline and explicit warning could not have been motivated, even in part, by a request for an accommodation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no other evidence tending to support the retaliation claim.  Soileau admitted at his deposition that he never formulated any improvement plan for Earnest.  He had been told that termination was a possible outcome if he did not submit a plan.  On appeal, Soileau argues that his seeking psychological counselling was, in essence, an improvement plan.  If so, he never said that to his employer, who knew only that no plan had been provided.  Further, it is undisputed that in the interim Guilford did provide the accommodation which Soileau and his psychologist requested.  Soileau no longer had to run meetings.  Evidence that an employer willingly granted an employee's request for an accommodation, though by no means dispositive of the matter, tends to militate against making an inference of retaliation in a case like this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the timing dictates against concluding that the request for accommodation caused the termination, and nothing else provides evidence from which such an inference may be drawn.  While the discipline of termination was swift, and even harsh, the evidence does not support a retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of summary judgment for the defendant is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Soileau also argued to the district court that his ability to work was the major life activity that had been impaired, he has not pursued this claim on appeal.  In any event, this claim would fail because he has not shown he is unable to work.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The EEOC Compliance Manual does list interacting with others as a major life activity.  EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH) &#167; 902.3, p 6883, at 5311 (1995).  While this court has found reference to the EEOC Compliance Manual to be helpful on occasion, see, e.g., Katz, 87 F.3d at 31, the manual is hardly binding.  Cf. Schmidt v. Safeway Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></span>, 1001 (D.Or.1994) (noting that the EEOC Technical Assistance Manual \"is not law\" and \"does [not] have the force of law\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Soileau had not claimed earlier that he was disabled and the employer is not put on notice of a present disability merely because an employee some years in the past has taken medical leave or has sought psychological counselling</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> A danger of the line of argument presented by Soileau is that it would permit an employee already on notice of performance problems to seek shelter in a belated claim of disability.  The ADA was not meant to prevent employers from taking steps to address poor performance by non-disabled employees.  As Judge Sporkin has said in rejecting an ADA retaliation claim, \"To allow the antidiscrimination laws to be used by poorly performing employees will eventually work to the detriment of those who have a legitimate need for the protection of the laws.\"  Henry v.
