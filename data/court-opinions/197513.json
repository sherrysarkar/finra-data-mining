S 621  et seq., and Puerto Rico \"Law 100,\" 29\r\n\nL.P.R.A. S 146 et seq. As we conclude that appellants failed to\r\n\ngenerate a trialworthy dispute regarding their federal claims, we\r\n\naffirm the district court judgment.\r\n\n                               I  \r\n\n                           BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In 1985, appellant Ivan Ruiz began work as a housekeeper\r\n\nat the \"Hotel San Juan &amp; Casino\" (\"Hotel\"), owned by Posadas, a New\r\n\nYork corporation. By 1987 Ruiz had been promoted to Team Leader,\r\n\nHousekeeping Department, responsible for supervising housekeeping\r\n\nin Hotel \"public areas\" (\r                                  e.g., offices, meeting rooms, gymnasium).\r\n\nBeginning in 1991, he worked five nights a week on the 8:00 p.m. to\r\n\n4:00 a.m. shift.\r\n\n          As a Team Leader, Ruiz received mixed performance\r\n\nratings. During the period from 1987 through 1993, the average\r\n\nannual performance rating Ruiz received ranged from lows of 3.30 in\r\n\n     The material facts in genuine dispute are related in the light\r\nmost favorable to appellants, who opposed summary judgment. \r                                                                     Velez-\r\nGomez v. SMA Life Assur. Co., 8 F.3d 873, 875 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n1987 and 1989, to a high of 4.02 in 1990. Ruiz received regular\r\n\nsalary increases throughout his tenure. In addition, he received\r\n\nthree merit certificates for excellent supervisory performance and\r\n\na \"good\" overall rating in 1992. \r\n\n          During his tenure, however, Ruiz received some criticism.\r\n\nIn 1988, he was criticized by Felix Joseph, his supervisor at the\r\n\ntime, for \"total negligence . . . or total and complete disregard\r\n\nof \r            . . . \r                  Company Policy or both,\" following an unannounced one-day\r\n\nabsence from work. In 1990, a different supervisor, Eddie Ortiz,\r\n\nnoted \"major cleaning deficiencies\" in the areas for which Ruiz was\r\n\nresponsible    specifically, trash not picked up, rooms not\r\n\ncleaned, and furniture not dusted \r                                              as well as a general \"lack of\r\n\nattention\" to cleaning responsibilities in the Hotel corporate\r\n\noffices. Finally, in 1993, yet another supervisor, Jorge Serrano,\r\n\nwarned Ruiz about poor cleaning in the gymnasium and filed a\r\n\ncontemporaneous disciplinary report against him. \r\n\n          Ruiz, on the other hand, dates most of his employment\r\n\nproblems from late 1993, when Luis Rivera, age 32, became Hotel\r\n\nExecutive Housekeeper. Rivera regularly criticized Ruiz, verbally\r\n\nand in writing, on his job performance.  In March 1994, Rivera\r\n\n     On a scale of 1 to 5, \"3\" indicated that standard job\r\nrequirements were met; \"4\" that the requirements were exceeded \"in\r\nmany instances\"; \"5\" that the requirements were \"consistently\"\r\nexceeded. \r\n\n     For example, in February 1994 Rivera notified Ruiz that many\r\ncomplaints had been lodged regarding the Hotel offices and that\r\ninspection had disclosed failures to dust, pick up trash, clean\r\nwindow areas, and clean bathrooms. Rivera warned Ruiz that he\r\nexpected \"immediate action\" and that \"[f]ailure to comply\" would\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nrated Ruiz's performance for 1993 as \"need[ing] improvement\" in\r\n\nthree areas: accepting criticism, solving problems, and quality of\r\n\nperformance. Rivera noted that Ruiz blamed others for his own\r\n\ndeficiencies, responded lackadaisically to guest requests, and\r\n\nprovided inadequate supervision to subordinates. After Ruiz com-\r\n\nplained to Rivera, the performance evaluation was changed from\r\n\n\"need[ing] improvement\" to \"satisfactory,\" but Rivera did not\r\n\nsoften the negative written commentary. The average rating Ruiz\r\n\nreceived for 1993 was 3.69.  See supra note 2.\r\n\n          Beginning in 1993, Victoria Greber, Executive Assistant\r\n\nManager, \"Rooms Division,\" likewise complained that Hotel public\r\n\nareas were found to be untidy following Ruiz's shift. Felipe\r\n\nMercado, the night manager ultimately responsible for supervising\r\n\nRuiz, complained directly to Greber about uncleanliness in areas\r\n\nfor which Ruiz was responsible. Other unfavorable comments\r\n\nrelating to the untidiness of Hotel public areas following Ruiz's\r\n\nshift were noted in the Hotel log books    daily diaries describ-\r\n\n\"result in disciplinary action.\" \r\n\n     The annual ratings Ruiz received during his tenure were:\r\n\n          Evaluation Date     Score     Comparison   \r                                                              to   \r                                                                   Rivera's\r\n                                        Rating  \r                                                         of  \r                                                             Ruiz  \r                                                                  for  \r                                                                       1993\r\n                                        calendar year\r\n\n               03-02-94       3.69      the rating given by\r\n                                        Rivera\r\n               11-12-92       3.68      lower than Rivera's score\r\n               11-01-91       3.39      lower \"        \" \" \r\n               10-30-90       4.02      higher \"       \" \" \r\n               11-10-89       3.30      lower \"        \" \" \r\n               07-30-89       3.47      lower \"        \" \" \r\n               01-06-87       3.30      lower \"        \" \" \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ning, \r              inter \r                    alia, the physical condition of the Hotel \r                                                                 by various\r\n\nHotel employees including Rivera.\r\n\n          During the Spring of 1994, the occupancy rate at the\r\n\nHotel dropped dramatically, resulting in severe shortfalls in Hotel\r\n\nrevenues and prompting work-force reductions by the administration.\r\n\nIn May 1994, Greber met with Rivera and Egidio Colon, Human\r\n\nResources Director, to evaluate the personnel records of all\r\n\nemployees holding an employment position within any category\r\n\ntargeted for reduction, which included a Team Leader position in\r\n\nthe Housekeeping Department, \"Rooms Division.\"\r\n\n          After the personnel file on each Team Leader in the\r\n\nHousekeeping Department had been reviewed, and following receipt of\r\n\ninput from Colon and Rivera, Greber determined to discharge Ruiz.\r\n\nAccording to both Colon and Greber, the dispositive factors were\r\n\nthe negative written evaluations (Ruiz posted the lowest average\r\n\nscores of any Team Leader), the negative commentaries, the disci-\r\n\nplinary warnings, the complaints from night manager Felipe Mercado,\r\n\nand the negative log-book notations regarding the uncleanliness of\r\n\nthe public areas following Ruiz's shifts. \r\n\n          On June 2, 1994, Ruiz was fired, after being told that\r\n\nthe Hotel was undergoing \"reorganization,\" and \"adjustments\" in the\r\n\n     At the time, there were four Team Leaders in the Housekeeping\r\nDepartment: John Waters, age 61, Steven Rosado, age 27, Carlos\r\nCarrasquillo, age 34    all of whom worked the day shift     and\r\nRuiz, age 61, who worked the night shift only. Carrasquillo and\r\nRosado had less seniority in their respective Team Leader positions\r\nthan Ruiz. Rosado had been a Team Leader for only seven months,\r\nand Carrasquillo had become a Team Leader one year after Ruiz. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n\"Rooms Division\" were necessary. Following Ruiz's dismissal,\r\n\nsupervisory responsibility for the night shift was divided between\r\n\nCarrasquillo and Waters, both of whom continued to serve as Team\r\n\nLeaders on their daytime shifts as well. \r\n\n          On June 7, 1994, Ruiz filed age-discrimination charges\r\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the\r\n\nAntidiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor,\r\n\nrequesting reinstatement. On November 18, 1994, a preexisting Team\r\n\nLeader position in the Housekeeping Department became vacant when\r\n\nMr. Rosado, \r                     see \r                         supra note 5, was promoted to Public Areas Manager.\r\n\nThe Hotel did not inform Ruiz of the vacancy, however, instead\r\n\npromoting Alexis Vargas, age 26, to Team Leader.\r\n\n          On March 24, 1995, his administrative remedies exhausted\r\n\nand a \"right to sue\" letter in hand, Ruiz (and spouse) filed a\r\n\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the District of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, alleging that the Hotel, during 1993-94, had a policy\r\n\nof discharging older employees, in violation of the ADEA and \"Law\r\n\n100.\" Following extended discovery proceedings, the Hotel moved\r\n\nfor summary judgment. In their opposition, appellants asserted,\r\n\nfor the first time, that the Hotel's failure to rehire Ruiz, and\r\n\n     The Hotel fired ten employees in all; two within the protected\r\nage group, including Ruiz. Ruiz was the only Team Leader in the\r\nHousekeeping Department to be fired. Two nonsupervisory employees\r\nin the same department were fired, aged 25 and 29. \r\n     In addition, another 111 employees left the Hotel between\r\nApril and June, 1994. These included temporary employees whose\r\ncontracts were not renewed; retirements; resignations; and\r\nterminations for cause. Among these 111 employees, nine (\r                                                                  i.e., 8%)\r\nwere 40 years or older.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nits hiring of Vargas, likewise violated Puerto Rico \"Law 100.\"\r\n\nThereafter, appellants sought leave to amend their original\r\n\ncomplaint to state additional ADEA claims, alleging a failure to\r\n\nrehire based on age and claiming retaliation in response to Ruiz's\r\n\nfiling of administrative charges against the Hotel.\r\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment for the\r\n\nHotel, after determining that the proffered evidence on the ADEA\r\n\ndiscriminatory discharge claim was inadequate for a  prima  facie\r\n\nshowing that the Hotel either failed to treat age neutrally or\r\n\nreplaced Ruiz with a younger worker, \r                                             see \r                                                 McDonnell Douglas Corp.\r                                                                         v.\r\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792 (1973); Woodman v.

It also dismissed the pendent Commonwealth\r\n\nclaim under \"Law 100,\" as there was no longer an independent basis\r\n\nfor asserting federal jurisdiction. Finally, the court denied the\r\n\nmotion to amend the complaint, on the ground that its new allega-\r\n\ntions, \"even if supported, . . . [would] not sustain an ADEA claim.\r\n\nThat is, plaintiffs would [sic] have established a \r                                                           prima \r                                                                 facie case\r\n\nof age discrimination.\"\r\n\n                               II\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION\r\n\n     We consider the summary judgment ruling \r                                                       de \r                                                          novo, viewing the\r\nrecord in the light most favorable to Ruiz, the nonmoving party,\r\nand drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.

Id. We need not consider the fourth prong, however,\r\n\nincluding Ruiz's contention that the Hotel retained two younger\r\n\nemployees    i.e., Rosado and Carrasquillo    in the same occupa-\r\n\ntional classification, since there is an alternative ground for\r\n\naffirmance.  See Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d\r\n\n859, 860-61 (1st Cir. 1987).

First \r                                                 Nat'l \r                                                       Bank \r                                                            of \r                                                               Boston, 985\r\n\nF.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1993), which in turn requires that the\r\n\nemployee proffer enough competent evidence to support \r                                                              two findings:\r\n\n1) the employer's proffered reason was pretextual; \r                                                           and, 2) its true\r\n\nmotive was age discrimination. Udo v. \r                                               Tomes, 54 F.3d 9, 12-13 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1995). The burden of   persuasion remains on the plaintiff\r\n\nemployee at all times.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.\r\n\n          There is no dispute that the Hotel experienced signifi-\r\n\ncant financial difficulties in the Spring of 1994 and terminated\r\n\nten employees as part of a legitimate RIF.   Moreover, Victoria\r\n\nGreber, the executive directly responsible for the decision to\r\n\ndischarge Ruiz, attested that financial difficulties prompted the\r\n\nemployee discharges, both in her own department and throughout the\r\n\nHotel. She explained, again without contradiction, that she\r\n\ndetermined to discharge a Team Leader in the Housekeeping Depart-\r\n\nment because she considered it an expendable \"medial\" position\r\n\nbetween the housekeepers, who do the cleaning, and the Hotel\r\n\n     Ruiz so concedes on appeal.  See Brief for Appellants at 14\r\n(\"Ruiz does not contest that a reduction in force was necessary in\r\norder to confront the Hotel's economic problems. . . .\"). \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nmanagement. She further explained that Ruiz was selected for\r\n\ntermination because his employment record was the weakest among all\r\n\nTeam Leaders. Careful review bears out that Greber's explanation\r\n\nis entirely consistent with the undisputed documentary evidence\r\n\nthat Ruiz had received more disciplinary warnings, and the lowest\r\n\naverage evaluation ratings, of any Team Leader in the Housekeeping\r\n\nDepartment, as well as the only negative written commentary. Thus,\r\n\nthe Hotel met its burden of production under the second prong of\r\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas test.  See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 844-45.\r\n\n          Accordingly, the presumption of age discrimination has\r\n\nvanished, see id., and we inquire whether the evidence, \" in  its\r\n\nentirety,\" would permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that the\r\n\nproffered reason for the dismissal was pretextual \r                                                          and that the true\r\n\nreason was an age-based animus,   see id. (emphasis added). In\r\n\npursuing this inquiry, we focus on whether the employer believed\r\n\nthat its proffered reason was credible.   See Mesnick v.  General\r\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991). That is, Ruiz must\r\n\ndo more than cast doubt on the rationale proffered by the employer,\r\n\nsee \r             Connell v. \r                        Bank of Boston\r                                      , 924 F.2d 1169, 1172 (1st Cir. 1991),\r\n\nthe \"evidence must be of such strength and quality as to permit a\r\n\nreasonable finding that the . . . [termination] was obviously  or\r\n\nmanifestly unsupported.\"  Brown v. Trustees \r                                                      of \r                                                         Boston \r                                                                Univ., 891\r\n\nF.2d 337, 346 (1st Cir. 1989) (emphasis added) (internal quotation\r\n\nmarks omitted). The summary judgment record generated no\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\ntrialworthy issue on the ADEA wrongful discharge claim. \r\n\n          Ruiz attempted to demonstrate that Rivera was responsible\r\n\nfor an atmosphere of age-based discrimination, in the Housekeeping\r\n\nDepartment, which influenced the decision to terminate him. He\r\n\nrelied on an affidavit from Carmen Pena, age 54, formerly employed\r\n\nin the Housekeeping Department, who attested that Rivera expected\r\n\nmore from her than from younger workers; asked her age; stated that\r\n\nshe didn't look good for her age; inquired about her health and\r\n\nsuggested that a job change might be beneficial. Pena acknowl-\r\n\nedged, however, that Rivera never asked, let alone ordered, her to\r\n\ntransfer. Moreover, Pena attributed another remark to Rivera     \r\n\n     An affidavit from Miguel Moreales, formerly a housekeeper with\r\nthe Hotel, concludes that Ruiz was an excellent supervisor, but\r\ndoes not purport to compare Ruiz's work record with that of other\r\nTeam Leaders. Moreales also opines that Ruiz's disciplinary\r\nwarnings were unfounded because Ruiz always assigned a housekeeper\r\nto clean, and checked the area afterward. However, these\r\nconclusory statements did not demonstrate that the areas about\r\nwhich Ruiz was warned had been properly cleaned on the particular\r\noccasions identified in the warnings he received, much less that\r\nthe warnings were unfounded, nor that Victoria Greber    who made\r\nthe decision to fire Ruiz, see supra p. 5    could not reasonably\r\nhave believed that the disciplinary warnings were warranted.  Cf.\r\nMulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, \r                                      Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 674-75 (1st Cir.\r\n1996) (wherein plaintiff presented evidence that employer's cited\r\nreasons were pretextual).\r\n     Similarly, Ruiz attests that he was discharged due to his age,\r\na belief based on his judgment that he had a good employment\r\nrecord. Even assuming his employment record passed muster,\r\nhowever, Ruiz proffered no evidence which would enable a rational\r\njury to find that the Hotel's employment action was not soundly\r\nfounded on its determination that Ruiz possessed the least worthy\r\nwork-performance-record among all competing Team Leaders. \r\n     Finally, Ruiz alleged that the Hotel conducted a systematic\r\npurge of older workers, but admits he has no such personal\r\nknowledge or evidence. It is axiomatic that more is required than\r\nmere conclusory allegations and unsupported conjecture.       See\r\nLeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841; Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1116.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\nthat all female workers at the Hotel were \r                                                  overworked. In addition,\r\n\nthe Moreales affidavit states, inter alia, see also supra note 9,\r\n\nthat Rivera harbored an \"obvious\" bias toward younger workers. The\r\n\nonly explication Moreales offered for this conclusion, however, was\r\n\nthat Rivera had pressured older workers, unfairly reprimanded older\r\n\nworkers in front of younger ones, and treated two older supervi-\r\n\nsors, including Ms. Pena, in a \"disrespectful manner,\" but without\r\n\nproviding an evidentiary foundation upon which it might reasonably\r\n\nbe inferred that any pressure, reprimand, or disrespect was either\r\n\ndiscriminatory or age-based.  See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841.\r\n\n          Although we have allowed as how circumstantial evidence\r\n\nof a general discriminatory environment may add \"color\" to an\r\n\nemployer's decisionmaking process, see  Conway v. Electro \r                                                                     Switch\r\n\nCorp., 825 F.2d 593, 597 (1st Cir. 1987), we have explained that\r\n\n\"[p]roof of a general atmosphere of discrimination is not the\r\n\nequivalent of proof of discrimination against an individual,\"\r\n\nSweeney v. \r                    Board of Trustees of Keene State College\r                                                            , 604 F.2d 106,\r\n\n113 (1st Cir. 1979). In all events, these proffers failed to\r\n\nestablish a trialworthy claim that a \"general\" atmosphere of age-\r\n\nbased discrimination existed in the Housekeeping Department, let\r\n\nalone that Ruiz was \"riffed\" for any reason other than the relative\r\n\nweakness of his work record.  Instead, without confronting the\r\n\n      Ruiz presented no competent evidence that the Hotel \"riffed\"\r\nhim, or any other employee, \r                                     based \r                                           on \r                                              age. There is no evidence of\r\nany comment by anyone associated with the Hotel, including Rivera\r\nand Greber, about Ruiz's age or that age played     any  part in\r\ndetermining which employees would be let go. Moreover, the 1993\r\nannual rating received from Rivera was the second highest Ruiz ever\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\nevidence, Ruiz concludes that he   must have been discriminated\r\n\nagainst because his record had been improving before Rivera became\r\n\nhis supervisor and because his eight-year employment record cannot\r\n\nfairly be compared to the records of Team Leaders with less tenure.\r\n\nRuiz's logic escapes us on both scores. First, as already noted,\r\n\nRuiz received his next best performance rating ever from none other\r\n\nthan Rivera. Second, if Team Leaders with less tenure \r                                                                  \r                                                                  i.e. less\r\n\nexperience    received better performance ratings than the more\r\n\nexperienced Ruiz, it is difficult to discern how their superior\r\n\nperformance reflects less well on them.\r\n\n          Furthermore, as we have stated repeatedly, we do not\r\n\nassume the role of a \"super personnel department[], assessing the\r\n\nmerits \r                   or even the rationality \r                                             of employers' nondiscriminato-\r\n\nry business decisions.\"   Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825;     see  also\r\n\nLeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 846 (similar).

Nor did Ruiz address the undisputed evidence that all\r\nbut two employees \"riffed\" by the Hotel were under forty, \r                                                                  see \r                                                                      supra\r\nnote 6, which tends to suggest that the alleged systematic purge of\r\nemployees was age-blind. Cf. \r                                       Hebert v. \r                                                Mohawk Rubber Co.\r                                                                 , 872 F.2d\r\n1104, 1114 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting \"rather startling\" statistical\r\nevidence that 76% of all older employees were \"riffed\"). Finally,\r\nand most importantly, Ruiz proffered no evidence that he, among all\r\nemployees holding a targeted Team Leader position, had not received\r\nthe most disciplinary warnings, negative written comments,\r\ncomplaints from the night manager, and the lowest average annual\r\nperformance rating    an average compiled from ratings given by\r\nvarious supervisors in addition to Rivera. \r\n\n                               13\r\r\n\nunless the facts and circumstances indicate that discriminatory\r\n\nanimus was the reason for the decision\"). \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Ruiz failed to\r\n\nproffer competent evidence adequate to ward off summary judgment on\r\n\nthe ADEA claim for wrongful discharge.\r\n\nB.   The Motion to Amend \r\n\n          Ruiz next contends that the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying the motion to amend the complaint, \r                                                    see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15,\r\n\nto include ADEA claims based on the Hotel's allegedly discriminato-\r\n\nry and retaliatory failure to rehire him.  See supra p. 6. \r\n\n          1.   Standard of Review\r\n\n          As Ruiz did not propose the amended complaint until seven\r\n\nmonths after the Hotel had moved for summary judgment, we treat the\r\n\nmotion to amend as \"an attempt to alter the shape of the case in\r\n\norder to defeat summary judgment.\"    Glassman v.  Computervision\r\n\nCorp., 90 F.3d 617, 623, (1st Cir. 1996). Consequently, Ruiz must\r\n\n\"demonstrate . . . that the proposed amendments were supported by\r\n\nsubstantial and convincing evidence,\"  Resolution \r                                                            Trust \r                                                                  Corp. v.\r\n\nGold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994) (citations and internal\r\n\nquotation marks omitted). Under the abuse of discretion standard,\r\n\nany sound reason apparent from the record is sufficient to support\r\n\nthe district court ruling, see id., including but not limited to\r\n\nundue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, and the futility of the\r\n\n      We review the ruling on the motion to amend for \"abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\" Resolution Trust Corp.\r                                              v. \r                                                Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st\r\nCir. 1994).\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\namendment, \r                    see \r                        Grant v. \r                                 News Group Boston, Inc.\r                                                        , 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1995).\r\n\n          2.   The District Court Ruling \r\n\n          Ruiz contends that the district court confused the\r\n\nrequirements an ADEA plaintiff must meet to establish a \r                                                                prima \r                                                                      facie\r\n\ndiscriminatory discharge claim, with the separate standards for\r\n\nestablishing prima facie claims of retaliation and discriminatory\r\n\nfailure to rehire. He points to the district court's statement\r\n\nthat the retaliation and failure-to-rehire claims, \"even if\r\n\nsupported, will not sustain an ADEA claim. That is, plaintiffs\r\n\nwould [sic] have established a \r                                        prima \r                                              facie case of age discrimina-\r\n\ntion[,]\" and argues that the district court erroneously ruled that\r\n\nRuiz could not prevail on the proposed \r                                                retaliation and \r                                                                failure-to-\r\n\nrehire claims because he could not meet the  prima facie showing\r\n\nrequired for a \r                        discriminatory \r                                       discharge claim. We need not address\r\n\nthis contention, however, as the record discloses an adequate\r\n\nalternative ground for affirmance. See \r                                                 Resolution Trust Corp.\r                                                                       , 30\r\n\nF.3d at 253.\r\n\n          Given the tardiness of the motion to amend, the question\r\n\nbefore us is whether Ruiz supported the proposed amended complaint\r\n\nwith enough \"substantial and convincing evidence,\" \r                                                            id., of an age-\r\n\nbased discriminatory animus.   See Woods v.  Friction \r                                                                 Materials,\r\n\nInc., 30 F.3d 255, 260 (1st Cir. 1994) (stating that plaintiff must\r\n\nshow discriminatory animus in failure-to-hire case);  Fennell v.\r\n\nFirst Step Designs, Ltd.\r                                 , 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating\r\n\nthat employee must demonstrate retaliatory animus); see also  id.\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\n(stating that court may dispense with burden-shifting framework,\r\n\nand focus instead on whether the \"evidence as a whole was suffi-\r\n\ncient to generate a jury question on pretext and discriminatory\r\n\nanimus\"). First of all, it must be noted that the mere fact Ruiz\r\n\nwas not rehired does not itself afford a basis for inferring age\r\n\ndiscrimination.  See Udo, 54 F.3d at 14 (stating that failure to\r\n\nrehire may simply show employer did not want to rehire employee).\r\n\nSecond, though the timing of the decision to hire Vargas \r                                                                     coming\r\n\nas it did five months after Ruiz filed administrative charges    \r\n\ntends to favor Ruiz, it does    not amount to \"substantial and\r\n\nconvincing evidence\" of an age-based animus. See \r                                                           Resolution Trust\r\n\nCorp., 30 F.3d at 253. \r\n\n          In addition, the essential thrust of the proposed amended\r\n\ncomplaint is that    coupled with Rivera's alleged discriminatory\r\n\nanimus toward older employees     the decision to hire Vargas,\r\n\nrather than recall Ruiz, was patently irrational and, therefore,\r\n\nmust have been a pretext for discrimination. However, the underly-\r\n\ning thesis    that Vargas's qualifications were so inferior that\r\n\nthe Hotel \r                   could \r                         only have been engaging in age-based discrimination\r\n\nand/or retaliation against Ruiz when it chose not to notify or\r\n\nrehire him    is seriously flawed.\r\n\n          First, Ruiz did not proffer sufficient evidence to enable\r\n\na finding of discriminatory animus, either in the Housekeeping\r\n\nDepartment at large or toward him in particular. \r                                                          See \r                                                              supra pp. 11-\r\n\n14. Second, the fact that Ruiz, based on experience and past\r\n\nperformance, may have been   qualified to hold the Team Leader\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nposition which was given to Vargas, is \r                                                not evidence that the Hotel\r\n\nwas motivated by an age-based animus in withholding it from Ruiz.\r\n\nSee Woods, 30 F.3d at 262.\r\n\n          In conclusion, whether or not it was short-sighted to\r\n\nbypass Ruiz in favor of Vargas, who had never received a disciplin-\r\n\nary warning, it cannot be said that it was so absurd as to defy\r\n\nrational belief. See \r                               Lehman v. \r                                         Prudential Ins.

(quoted in  Lehman, 74\r\n\nF.3d at 329).\r\n\n      Moreover, Vargas also received several commendations for work\r\nperformance in the Housekeeping Department, the Hotel laundry, and\r\nas a driver and chauffeur, as well as performance ratings \r                                                                   at \r                                                                      least\r\ncomparable to those received by Ruiz. Vargas earned the following\r\nannual performance ratings: 1987, 4.4; 1988, 3.74; 1989, 3.1;\r\n1990, 4.0; 1991, 4.48; 1992, 4.3; 1993, 3.45; 1994, 3.59.     See\r\nalso supra note 4. In addition, Vargas had worked the day shift,\r\nwhich was regarded by Hotel management as more demanding than the\r\nnight shift worked by Ruiz. \r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\n          Therefore, as Ruiz proffered insufficient evidence from\r\n\nwhich an age-based discriminatory animus might reasonably be\r\n\ninferred in connection with the Hotel's decision to promote Vargas,\r\n\nrather than rehire Ruiz, see Smith, 40 F.3d at 16, he has not met\r\n\nthe heavy burden of establishing that the proposed amended\r\n\ncomplaint was supported by \"substantial and convincing evidence.\"\r\n\nResolution Trust Corp., 30 F.3d at 253.\r\n\n                               18\r\r\n\n                               III\r\n\n                           CONCLUSION\r\n\n          Finally, since the district court supportably dismissed\r\n\nthe federal claims, it permissibly declined to retain,    see 28\r\n\nU.S.C.

By 1987 Ruiz had been promoted to Team Leader,\r\n\nHousekeeping Department, responsible for supervising housekeeping\r\n\nin Hotel \"public areas\" (\r                                  e.g., offices, meeting rooms, gymnasium).\r\n\nBeginning in 1991, he worked five nights a week on the 8:00 p.m. to\r\n\n4:00 a.m. shift.\r\n\n          As a Team Leader, Ruiz received mixed performance\r\n\nratings. During the period from 1987 through 1993, the average\r\n\nannual performance rating Ruiz received ranged from lows of 3.30 in\r\n\n     The material facts in genuine dispute are related in the light\r\nmost favorable to appellants, who opposed summary judgment. \r                                                                     Velez-\r\nGomez v.

Ruiz received regular\r\n\nsalary increases throughout his tenure. In addition, he received\r\n\nthree merit certificates for excellent supervisory performance and\r\n\na \"good\" overall rating in 1992. \r\n\n          During his tenure, however, Ruiz received some criticism.\r\n\nIn 1988, he was criticized by Felix Joseph, his supervisor at the\r\n\ntime, for \"total negligence . . . or total and complete disregard\r\n\nof \r            . . . \r                  Company Policy or both,\" following an unannounced one-day\r\n\nabsence from work. In 1990, a different supervisor, Eddie Ortiz,\r\n\nnoted \"major cleaning deficiencies\" in the areas for which Ruiz was\r\n\nresponsible    specifically, trash not picked up, rooms not\r\n\ncleaned, and furniture not dusted \r                                              as well as a general \"lack of\r\n\nattention\" to cleaning responsibilities in the Hotel corporate\r\n\noffices. Finally, in 1993, yet another supervisor, Jorge Serrano,\r\n\nwarned Ruiz about poor cleaning in the gymnasium and filed a\r\n\ncontemporaneous disciplinary report against him. \r\n\n          Ruiz, on the other hand, dates most of his employment\r\n\nproblems from late 1993, when Luis Rivera, age 32, became Hotel\r\n\nExecutive Housekeeper. Rivera regularly criticized Ruiz, verbally\r\n\nand in writing, on his job performance.  In March 1994, Rivera\r\n\n     On a scale of 1 to 5, \"3\" indicated that standard job\r\nrequirements were met; \"4\" that the requirements were exceeded \"in\r\nmany instances\"; \"5\" that the requirements were \"consistently\"\r\nexceeded. \r\n\n     For example, in February 1994 Rivera notified Ruiz that many\r\ncomplaints had been lodged regarding the Hotel offices and that\r\ninspection had disclosed failures to dust, pick up trash, clean\r\nwindow areas, and clean bathrooms. Rivera warned Ruiz that he\r\nexpected \"immediate action\" and that \"[f]ailure to comply\" would\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nrated Ruiz's performance for 1993 as \"need[ing] improvement\" in\r\n\nthree areas: accepting criticism, solving problems, and quality of\r\n\nperformance. Rivera noted that Ruiz blamed others for his own\r\n\ndeficiencies, responded lackadaisically to guest requests, and\r\n\nprovided inadequate supervision to subordinates. After Ruiz com-\r\n\nplained to Rivera, the performance evaluation was changed from\r\n\n\"need[ing] improvement\" to \"satisfactory,\" but Rivera did not\r\n\nsoften the negative written commentary. The average rating Ruiz\r\n\nreceived for 1993 was 3.69.  See supra note 2.\r\n\n          Beginning in 1993, Victoria Greber, Executive Assistant\r\n\nManager, \"Rooms Division,\" likewise complained that Hotel public\r\n\nareas were found to be untidy following Ruiz's shift. Felipe\r\n\nMercado, the night manager ultimately responsible for supervising\r\n\nRuiz, complained directly to Greber about uncleanliness in areas\r\n\nfor which Ruiz was responsible. Other unfavorable comments\r\n\nrelating to the untidiness of Hotel public areas following Ruiz's\r\n\nshift were noted in the Hotel log books    daily diaries describ-\r\n\n\"result in disciplinary action.\" \r\n\n     The annual ratings Ruiz received during his tenure were:\r\n\n          Evaluation Date     Score     Comparison   \r                                                              to   \r                                                                   Rivera's\r\n                                        Rating  \r                                                         of  \r                                                             Ruiz  \r                                                                  for  \r                                                                       1993\r\n                                        calendar year\r\n\n               03-02-94       3.69      the rating given by\r\n                                        Rivera\r\n               11-12-92       3.68      lower than Rivera's score\r\n               11-01-91       3.39      lower \"        \" \" \r\n               10-30-90       4.02      higher \"       \" \" \r\n               11-10-89       3.30      lower \"        \" \" \r\n               07-30-89       3.47      lower \"        \" \" \r\n               01-06-87       3.30      lower \"        \" \" \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ning, \r              inter \r                    alia, the physical condition of the Hotel \r                                                                 by various\r\n\nHotel employees including Rivera.\r\n\n          During the Spring of 1994, the occupancy rate at the\r\n\nHotel dropped dramatically, resulting in severe shortfalls in Hotel\r\n\nrevenues and prompting work-force reductions by the administration.\r\n\nIn May 1994, Greber met with Rivera and Egidio Colon, Human\r\n\nResources Director, to evaluate the personnel records of all\r\n\nemployees holding an employment position within any category\r\n\ntargeted for reduction, which included a Team Leader position in\r\n\nthe Housekeeping Department, \"Rooms Division.\"\r\n\n          After the personnel file on each Team Leader in the\r\n\nHousekeeping Department had been reviewed, and following receipt of\r\n\ninput from Colon and Rivera, Greber determined to discharge Ruiz.\r\n\nAccording to both Colon and Greber, the dispositive factors were\r\n\nthe negative written evaluations (Ruiz posted the lowest average\r\n\nscores of any Team Leader), the negative commentaries, the disci-\r\n\nplinary warnings, the complaints from night manager Felipe Mercado,\r\n\nand the negative log-book notations regarding the uncleanliness of\r\n\nthe public areas following Ruiz's shifts. \r\n\n          On June 2, 1994, Ruiz was fired, after being told that\r\n\nthe Hotel was undergoing \"reorganization,\" and \"adjustments\" in the\r\n\n     At the time, there were four Team Leaders in the Housekeeping\r\nDepartment: John Waters, age 61, Steven Rosado, age 27, Carlos\r\nCarrasquillo, age 34    all of whom worked the day shift     and\r\nRuiz, age 61, who worked the night shift only. Carrasquillo and\r\nRosado had less seniority in their respective Team Leader positions\r\nthan Ruiz. Rosado had been a Team Leader for only seven months,\r\nand Carrasquillo had become a Team Leader one year after Ruiz. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n\"Rooms Division\" were necessary. Following Ruiz's dismissal,\r\n\nsupervisory responsibility for the night shift was divided between\r\n\nCarrasquillo and Waters, both of whom continued to serve as Team\r\n\nLeaders on their daytime shifts as well. \r\n\n          On June 7, 1994, Ruiz filed age-discrimination charges\r\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the\r\n\nAntidiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor,\r\n\nrequesting reinstatement. On November 18, 1994, a preexisting Team\r\n\nLeader position in the Housekeeping Department became vacant when\r\n\nMr. Rosado, \r                     see \r                         supra note 5, was promoted to Public Areas Manager.\r\n\nThe Hotel did not inform Ruiz of the vacancy, however, instead\r\n\npromoting Alexis Vargas, age 26, to Team Leader.\r\n\n          On March 24, 1995, his administrative remedies exhausted\r\n\nand a \"right to sue\" letter in hand, Ruiz (and spouse) filed a\r\n\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the District of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, alleging that the Hotel, during 1993-94, had a policy\r\n\nof discharging older employees, in violation of the ADEA and \"Law\r\n\n100.\" Following extended discovery proceedings, the Hotel moved\r\n\nfor summary judgment. In their opposition, appellants asserted,\r\n\nfor the first time, that the Hotel's failure to rehire Ruiz, and\r\n\n     The Hotel fired ten employees in all; two within the protected\r\nage group, including Ruiz. Ruiz was the only Team Leader in the\r\nHousekeeping Department to be fired.

The burden of   persuasion remains on the plaintiff\r\n\nemployee at all times.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.\r\n\n          There is no dispute that the Hotel experienced signifi-\r\n\ncant financial difficulties in the Spring of 1994 and terminated\r\n\nten employees as part of a legitimate RIF.   Moreover, Victoria\r\n\nGreber, the executive directly responsible for the decision to\r\n\ndischarge Ruiz, attested that financial difficulties prompted the\r\n\nemployee discharges, both in her own department and throughout the\r\n\nHotel. She explained, again without contradiction, that she\r\n\ndetermined to discharge a Team Leader in the Housekeeping Depart-\r\n\nment because she considered it an expendable \"medial\" position\r\n\nbetween the housekeepers, who do the cleaning, and the Hotel\r\n\n     Ruiz so concedes on appeal.  See Brief for Appellants at 14\r\n(\"Ruiz does not contest that a reduction in force was necessary in\r\norder to confront the Hotel's economic problems. . . .\"). \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nmanagement. She further explained that Ruiz was selected for\r\n\ntermination because his employment record was the weakest among all\r\n\nTeam Leaders. Careful review bears out that Greber's explanation\r\n\nis entirely consistent with the undisputed documentary evidence\r\n\nthat Ruiz had received more disciplinary warnings, and the lowest\r\n\naverage evaluation ratings, of any Team Leader in the Housekeeping\r\n\nDepartment, as well as the only negative written commentary. Thus,\r\n\nthe Hotel met its burden of production under the second prong of\r\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas test.  See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 844-45.\r\n\n          Accordingly, the presumption of age discrimination has\r\n\nvanished, see id., and we inquire whether the evidence, \" in  its\r\n\nentirety,\" would permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that the\r\n\nproffered reason for the dismissal was pretextual \r                                                          and that the true\r\n\nreason was an age-based animus,   see id.

The summary judgment record generated no\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\ntrialworthy issue on the ADEA wrongful discharge claim. \r\n\n          Ruiz attempted to demonstrate that Rivera was responsible\r\n\nfor an atmosphere of age-based discrimination, in the Housekeeping\r\n\nDepartment, which influenced the decision to terminate him. He\r\n\nrelied on an affidavit from Carmen Pena, age 54, formerly employed\r\n\nin the Housekeeping Department, who attested that Rivera expected\r\n\nmore from her than from younger workers; asked her age; stated that\r\n\nshe didn't look good for her age; inquired about her health and\r\n\nsuggested that a job change might be beneficial. Pena acknowl-\r\n\nedged, however, that Rivera never asked, let alone ordered, her to\r\n\ntransfer. Moreover, Pena attributed another remark to Rivera     \r\n\n     An affidavit from Miguel Moreales, formerly a housekeeper with\r\nthe Hotel, concludes that Ruiz was an excellent supervisor, but\r\ndoes not purport to compare Ruiz's work record with that of other\r\nTeam Leaders. Moreales also opines that Ruiz's disciplinary\r\nwarnings were unfounded because Ruiz always assigned a housekeeper\r\nto clean, and checked the area afterward. However, these\r\nconclusory statements did not demonstrate that the areas about\r\nwhich Ruiz was warned had been properly cleaned on the particular\r\noccasions identified in the warnings he received, much less that\r\nthe warnings were unfounded, nor that Victoria Greber    who made\r\nthe decision to fire Ruiz, see supra p. 5    could not reasonably\r\nhave believed that the disciplinary warnings were warranted.

Even assuming his employment record passed muster,\r\nhowever, Ruiz proffered no evidence which would enable a rational\r\njury to find that the Hotel's employment action was not soundly\r\nfounded on its determination that Ruiz possessed the least worthy\r\nwork-performance-record among all competing Team Leaders. \r\n     Finally, Ruiz alleged that the Hotel conducted a systematic\r\npurge of older workers, but admits he has no such personal\r\nknowledge or evidence. It is axiomatic that more is required than\r\nmere conclusory allegations and unsupported conjecture.

In addition,\r\n\nthe Moreales affidavit states, inter alia, see also supra note 9,\r\n\nthat Rivera harbored an \"obvious\" bias toward younger workers. The\r\n\nonly explication Moreales offered for this conclusion, however, was\r\n\nthat Rivera had pressured older workers, unfairly reprimanded older\r\n\nworkers in front of younger ones, and treated two older supervi-\r\n\nsors, including Ms. Pena, in a \"disrespectful manner,\" but without\r\n\nproviding an evidentiary foundation upon which it might reasonably\r\n\nbe inferred that any pressure, reprimand, or disrespect was either\r\n\ndiscriminatory or age-based.

In all events, these proffers failed to\r\n\nestablish a trialworthy claim that a \"general\" atmosphere of age-\r\n\nbased discrimination existed in the Housekeeping Department, let\r\n\nalone that Ruiz was \"riffed\" for any reason other than the relative\r\n\nweakness of his work record.

Second, if Team Leaders with less tenure \r                                                                  \r                                                                  i.e. less\r\n\nexperience    received better performance ratings than the more\r\n\nexperienced Ruiz, it is difficult to discern how their superior\r\n\nperformance reflects less well on them.\r\n\n          Furthermore, as we have stated repeatedly, we do not\r\n\nassume the role of a \"super personnel department[], assessing the\r\n\nmerits \r                   or even the rationality \r                                             of employers' nondiscriminato-\r\n\nry business decisions.\"   Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825;     see  also\r\n\nLeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 846 (similar).

The District Court Ruling \r\n\n          Ruiz contends that the district court confused the\r\n\nrequirements an ADEA plaintiff must meet to establish a \r                                                                prima \r                                                                      facie\r\n\ndiscriminatory discharge claim, with the separate standards for\r\n\nestablishing prima facie claims of retaliation and discriminatory\r\n\nfailure to rehire. He points to the district court's statement\r\n\nthat the retaliation and failure-to-rehire claims, \"even if\r\n\nsupported, will not sustain an ADEA claim. That is, plaintiffs\r\n\nwould [sic] have established a \r                                        prima \r                                              facie case of age discrimina-\r\n\ntion[,]\" and argues that the district court erroneously ruled that\r\n\nRuiz could not prevail on the proposed \r                                                retaliation and \r                                                                failure-to-\r\n\nrehire claims because he could not meet the  prima facie showing\r\n\nrequired for a \r                        discriminatory \r                                       discharge claim. We need not address\r\n\nthis contention, however, as the record discloses an adequate\r\n\nalternative ground for affirmance.

First of all, it must be noted that the mere fact Ruiz\r\n\nwas not rehired does not itself afford a basis for inferring age\r\n\ndiscrimination.  See Udo, 54 F.3d at 14 (stating that failure to\r\n\nrehire may simply show employer did not want to rehire employee).\r\n\nSecond, though the timing of the decision to hire Vargas \r                                                                     coming\r\n\nas it did five months after Ruiz filed administrative charges    \r\n\ntends to favor Ruiz, it does    not amount to \"substantial and\r\n\nconvincing evidence\" of an age-based animus. See \r                                                           Resolution Trust\r\n\nCorp., 30 F.3d at 253. \r\n\n          In addition, the essential thrust of the proposed amended\r\n\ncomplaint is that    coupled with Rivera's alleged discriminatory\r\n\nanimus toward older employees     the decision to hire Vargas,\r\n\nrather than recall Ruiz, was patently irrational and, therefore,\r\n\nmust have been a pretext for discrimination. However, the underly-\r\n\ning thesis    that Vargas's qualifications were so inferior that\r\n\nthe Hotel \r                   could \r                         only have been engaging in age-based discrimination\r\n\nand/or retaliation against Ruiz when it chose not to notify or\r\n\nrehire him    is seriously flawed.\r\n\n          First, Ruiz did not proffer sufficient evidence to enable\r\n\na finding of discriminatory animus, either in the Housekeeping\r\n\nDepartment at large or toward him in particular. \r                                                          See \r                                                              supra pp. 11-\r\n\n14. Second, the fact that Ruiz, based on experience and past\r\n\nperformance, may have been   qualified to hold the Team Leader\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nposition which was given to Vargas, is \r                                                not evidence that the Hotel\r\n\nwas motivated by an age-based animus in withholding it from Ruiz.\r\n\nSee Woods, 30 F.3d at 262.\r\n\n          In conclusion, whether or not it was short-sighted to\r\n\nbypass Ruiz in favor of Vargas, who had never received a disciplin-\r\n\nary warning, it cannot be said that it was so absurd as to defy\r\n\nrational belief.
