Soares on brief pro se.\r\n Gary W. Cruickshank on brief for appellee Brockton Credit\r\nUnion.\r\n\nOctober 22, 1998\r\n\n  Per Curiam.  Appellant Napolean Soares seeks appellate\r\nreview of a bankruptcy court order granting relief from the\r\nautomatic stay.  See 11 U.S.C.  362(d).  Such order was issued\r\nupon motion of appellee Brockton Credit Union (BCU) following\r\nremand from this court.  See Soares v. Brockton Credit Union,\r\n107 F.3d 969 (1997).  Soares appealed from that order to the\r\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP), but failed to secure a stay\r\npending appeal.  In due course, BCU obtained a second judgment\r\nof foreclosure in state court and thereafter conducted a second\r\nforeclosure sale.  As a result of the sale, the BAP dismissed\r\nthe pending appeal as moot.  Soares has now appealed from that\r\nruling.\r\n    We agree that the property's sale has rendered the appeal\r\nmoot.  Generally, \"when the debtor fails to obtain a stay\r\npending appeal of the bankruptcy court's ... order setting\r\naside an automatic stay and allowing a creditor to foreclose on\r\nproperty, the subsequent foreclosure and sale of the property\r\nrenders moot any appeal.\"  In re Matos, 790 F.2d 864, 865 (11th\r\nCir. 1986); accord, e.g., In re 225 Park Plaza Assocs. Ltd.\r\nPartnership, 100 F.3d 1214, 1216-1218 (6th Cir. 1996); Greylock\r\nGlen Corp. v. Community Savings Bank, 656 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\r\n1981) (applying former Bankr. Rule 805); cf. In re Stadium\r\nManag. Corp., 895 F.2d 845, 847-49 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying 11\r\nU.S.C.  363(m)).  Whether any exceptions might exist to this\r\nrule, see, e.g., In re Mann, 907 F.2d 923, 926 (9th Cir. 1990),\r\nis a matter we need not address, inasmuch as Soares has made no\r\nreference thereto and (from all that appears) would derive no\r\nbenefit therefrom.\r\n    An affirmance is plainly warranted on the merits in any\r\nevent.  Soares has provided no grounds for questioning the\r\nfinding that \"cause\" existed for lifting the automatic stay\r\nunder  362(d).  And the various challenges he has advanced\r\nprove unavailing.  For example, the bankruptcy judge's action\r\nand the other proceedings below, rather than contravening this\r\ncourt's mandate from the earlier appeal, were in full\r\nconformance therewith.  Absent a stay, BCU was free to seek a\r\nnew foreclosure judgment while the BAP appeal was pending. \r\nWhether the first judgment of foreclosure was or should have\r\nbeen vacated as a matter of state law is of no pertinence here. \r\nAnd it is undisputed that the second foreclosure sale occurred\r\nonly after the second judgment was obtained. \r\n    The stay of eviction ordered by this court on September 4,\r\n1998 is hereby lifted, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel's\r\norder of dismissal is affirmed.\r\n",
