Defendants-appellants Mark\n\nDaniel Marin-Canales and Alexander Rodriguez-Miranda request\n\nthat   this   court   vacate    their    pleas   of    guilty    to    cocaine\n\npossession    charges   and    challenge    various     aspects       of   their\n\nsentences.    Finding no errors in the trial court's acceptance of\n\ndefendants' guilty pleas or imposition of their sentences, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                        I.    Factual Background\n\n       On May 9, 1997, a United States Customs Service airplane\n\nobserved a low-flying Cessna 210 aircraft proceeding from South\n\nAmerica into the United States.         The aircraft entered the United\n\nStates over Ponce, Puerto Rico, and it was pursued to the\n\nvicinity of Cidra, Puerto Rico, although it evaded pursuers by\n\nflying    under   electrical    wires.       The      Puerto    Rico       Police\n\nDepartment received three anonymous calls collectively stating\n\nthat a low-flying plane was throwing out bales to a farm in\n\nCidra where a Mitsubishi Expo van and a BMW waited and that some\n\nof the bales had been placed in the trunk of the BMW.                  At least\n\none caller provided the license plate numbers of the vehicles.\n\n       The Puerto Rico police first located the BMW, occupied by\n\nMarin and another participant, and upon stopping and searching\n\nit, discovered 28 kilograms of cocaine in the trunk wrapped\n\nidentically to the 150 kilograms of cocaine found on the farm.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fThe van, occupied by Rodriguez and another participant, was\n\nsubsequently   stopped       and    two    nine-millimeter       semi-automatic\n\npistols were later found by a subcontractor maintaining the\n\nimpounded vehicle for the United States Customs Service.\n\n    Both defendants entered into plea agreements with the United\n\nStates under which they pled guilty to possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), in\n\nexchange for the dismissal of other counts.1              In each, there was\n\nno agreement as to the defendant's criminal history category\n\n(CHC).   Marin's plea agreement stated that if his CHC were I and\n\nif he qualified for the \"safety valve\" provision of U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2,2 the pertinent sentencing range would be 87 to 108 months\n\nand the government would recommend 87 months.                 Rodriguez's plea\n\nagreement    stated    that    if    his    CHC   were   I,    the     applicable\n\nsentencing range would be 168 to 210 months and the government\n\nwould    recommend    168.     Both       agreements     spoke    in    terms   of\n\ncontingencies – in both, the defendant was promised only that\n\nthe government would recommend a sentence at the lower end of\n\n\n\n    1Marin pled guilty to count IV of the five-count indictment,\nwhich charged possession of 28 kilograms of cocaine, and\nRodriguez pled guilty to count V, which charged possession of\n150 kilograms.\n    2The \"safety valve\" provision releases the minimum mandatory\nsentence when a defendant meets certain criteria, including\nhaving a CHC of I. See U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(1).\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe applicable range, whatever that might be.               Both defendants\n\nagreed that their sentences would be within the sound discretion\n\nof the sentencing judge and would be imposed in accordance with\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.3\n\n       The court accepted defendants' guilty pleas and sentenced\n\nthem       pursuant     to   the   United   States   Sentencing   Guidelines.\n\nBecause Marin's CHC was II, he was not eligible for the safety\n\nvalve and the applicable sentencing range was 121 to 151 months.\n\nThe court accepted the government's recommendation of a sentence\n\nat the lower end, 121 months.               Because Rodriguez's CHC was II,\n\nthe applicable sentencing range was 188 to 235 months.                    The\n\ncourt accepted the government's recommendation of 188 months.\n\n             II.    Denial of Rodriguez's Motion to Suppress\n\n       Prior       to   pleading     guilty,    Rodriguez   moved   for   the\n\nsuppression of his warrantless arrest and all evidence flowing\n\nfrom the arrest, arguing that the arrest was effected without\n\nprobable cause in            violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nSee Beck v.         Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964). The court denied\n\n\n\n       3\n      Both agreements explained that \"defendant . . . is aware\nthat his sentence is within the sound discretion of the\nsentencing judge and will be imposed in accordance with the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines.\"    Marin's plea agreement\nalso declared: \"Defendant . . . is fully aware . . . that if his\ncriminal history is greater than I, his sentence will be\nincreased accordingly, and that the Court is not bound by this\nplea agreement.\"\n\n                                        -6-\n\fRodriguez's motion and he subsequently entered into the plea\n\nagreement.      It   is   well   established   that    by   entering   an\n\nunconditional    guilty    plea,    a    defendant    waives   all   non-\n\njurisdictional defects.     See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258,\n\n267 (1973) (explaining that after a defendant has pled guilty,\n\n\"he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the\n\ndeprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the\n\nentry of the guilty plea\"); Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961\n\nF.2d 305, 307 (lst Cir. 1992) (\"It is clear that a plea of\n\nguilty to an indictment is an admission of guilt and a waiver of\n\nall non-jurisdictional defects.\").        Because the issues raised by\n\nRodriguez are non-jurisdictional, he has waived the opportunity\n\nfor appellate review by entering an unconditional guilty plea.4\n\n        III.    Voluntariness of Defendants' Guilty Pleas\n\n    Both defendants seek to have their guilty pleas vacated due\n\nto what they define as defects in the plea hearing proceedings,\n\nallegedly in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.              The advisory\n\ncommittee's note to Fed. R. Crim. P. 32, which authorizes plea\n\n\n    4After filing his brief, Marin requested that he be allowed\nto adopt the arguments made by Rodriguez with regard to the\nmotion to suppress. Because Marin was not a party to the motion\nto suppress, he cannot appeal its denial or raise the issues it\npresented. See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of\nPuerto Rico, 906 F.2d 25, 40 (lst Cir. 1990) (arguments not made\nbefore district court or raised too late on appeal are waived).\nEven if he had been a party to the motion, his arguments were\nwaived when he pled guilty, as we have explained.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fwithdrawal motions, explains that when a defendant moves for the\n\nfirst time on direct appeal to set aside his guilty plea, \"the\n\napplicable standard is that stated in Hill v. United States, 368\n\nU.S. 424 (1962): 'a fundamental defect which inherently results\n\nin    a   complete    miscarriage   of     justice'    or   'an    omission\n\ninconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.'\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32 advisory committee's note; see also Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(h) (\"Any variance from the procedures required by\n\nthis rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be\n\ndisregarded.\").       We acknowledge, as we did in United States v.\n\nCarrington, 96 F.3d 1 (lst Cir. 1996), that the standard upon\n\nwhich we base our review of the defendant's request to vacate\n\nhis   guilty   plea   is   \"'somewhat     cloudy.'\"   See   id.   at   5   n.2\n\n(quoting United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1219\n\n(lst Cir. 1995)).      In other cases, we have applied the harmless\n\nerror standard.       See, e.g., United States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936\n\nF.2d 588, 598 & n.24 (lst Cir. 1991).          Because we find no error\n\nat all in the Rule 11 proceedings, we need not decide this\n\nissue.\n\n      We consider primarily four factors when reviewing a request\n\nto withdraw a guilty plea:\n\n      (1) the plausibility of the reasons prompting the\n      requested change of plea; (2) the timing of the\n      defendant's motion; (3) the existence or nonexistence\n      of an assertion of innocence; and (4) whether, when\n\n                                    -8-\n\f    viewed in light of the emergent circumstances, the\n    defendant's plea appropriately may be characterized as\n    involuntary, in derogation of the requirements imposed\n    by Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, or otherwise legally suspect.\n\nUnited States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371 (lst Cir.\n\n1994) (footnote omitted).\n\n    Regarding the first factor, defendants proffer no particular\n\nreason    for   requesting   changes      of   plea,   other   than    alleged\n\ninvoluntariness.       Second, their requests were made thirteen\n\nmonths after their change of plea hearings and nine months after\n\nsentencing without explanation for the delay.5 We have explained\n\nthat \"the more a request is delayed – even if made before\n\nsentence is imposed – the more we will regard it with disfavor.\"\n\nUnited States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 838 (lst Cir. 1996).                Third,\n\ndefendants do not assert their innocence, which weights the\n\nbalance against allowing them to withdraw their pleas.                 See id.\n\nat 839.\n\n    Mindful      of   the   fact   that    defendants    start   from     this\n\ndisadvantaged point, we consider the final factor.                    Our main\n\nconcern here is whether defendants' guilty pleas were \"knowing,\n\n\n    5Although both defendants filed notices of appeal in June\n1998, they did not allege error in the Rule 11 proceedings until\nfiling their March 1999 statement of issues. We recognize that\nthe delay in receiving transcripts hindered some aspects of\ndefendants' arguments with regard to the Rule 11 proceedings,\nbut other aspects – for example, that the plea agreements were\nmisleading – could easily have been identified prior to the\nreceipt of transcripts.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fvoluntary and intelligent within the meaning of [Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure] 11.\"       United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (lst Cir. 1995).       Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 11(d) states:\n\n    The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo\n    contendere without first, by addressing the defendant\n    personally in open court, determining that the plea is\n    voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of\n    promises apart from a plea agreement. The court shall\n    also inquire as to whether the defendant's willingness\n    to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior\n    discussions between the attorney for the government\n    and the defendant or the defendant's attorney.\n\nThe rule encompasses three \"core concerns\": \"1) absence of\n\ncoercion; 2) the defendant's understanding of the charges; and\n\n3) the defendant's knowledge of the consequences of the guilty\n\nplea.\"\n\nUnited   States   v.   Gray,    63   F.3d   57,   60   (lst     Cir.   1995).\n\nFurthermore,   we    review    the   \"totality    of   the     circumstances\n\nsurrounding the Rule 11 hearing, rather than apply a 'talismanic\n\ntest.'\" Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4-5 (citation omitted).\n\n    A.    Rodriguez\n\n    Defendant Rodriguez makes only general allegations that the\n\ncourt erred in accepting his guilty plea and points us to no\n\nspecific error.      Assuming that he has preserved this argument,\n\nwe peruse the Rule 11 proceedings for general error and we find\n\nnone.     Instead,     we   discover    that   the     court    conducted   a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f\"comprehensive inquiry,\" akin to that upheld in Isom, 85 F.3d at\n\n835-37.\n\n      The court ascertained that Rodriguez had signed the petition\n\nto   change   his     plea    to   guilty,     had     fully    answered       a   plea\n\nquestionnaire, and had signed the plea agreement.                          Rodriguez\n\nresponded affirmatively to the court's questions about whether\n\nhe had discussed the indictment against him with his counsel,\n\nwhether he understood the nature of the charge to which he was\n\npleading    guilty,     and    whether    he   understood        that     he   waived\n\ncertain fundamental rights by pleading guilty (such as the\n\nrights to remain silent, be assisted by counsel, confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses against him, present witnesses on his\n\nown behalf, and       hold the prosecution to its burden of proving\n\nhim guilty beyond a reasonable doubt).                     After this, Rodriguez\n\nconfirmed     that    he     had   no    doubts      about     pleading        guilty.\n\nRodriguez     affirmatively         answered         the    court's       particular\n\nquestions     about    his    understanding       of   the     way   in   which     his\n\nsentence would be determined and that a 168 month sentence was\n\ncontingent upon a CHC of I.             Further, Rodriguez indicated that\n\nhe understood that the only agreement was that which was in\n\nwriting, that the plea agreement had been translated to him,\n\nthat he had not been intimidated, threatened, or coerced in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fregard to his guilty plea, and that he pled guilty freely,\n\nwillingly, knowingly, and voluntarily.\n\n      Thus, the court addressed the three core concerns that must\n\nbe considered when a defendant wishes to enter a guilty plea;\n\nthe court's questions confirmed that Rodriguez had not been\n\ncoerced, that he understood the charges, and that he understood\n\nthe   consequences   of    his   guilty   plea,   including   sentencing\n\nprocedures and possibilities.\n\n      B.   Marin\n\n      Defendant    Marin   makes   more   particularized      contentions\n\nregarding the Rule 11 proceeding.          He asserts that the court\n\nerred by setting deadlines for the filing of a change of plea\n\npetition that created undue pressure on him, making improper\n\ncomments during the hearing, failing to correctly apprise him of\n\nthe sentence he faced, neglecting to inquire about his failure\n\nto answer three questions on the plea questionnaire, and failing\n\nto order a presentence investigation prior to the acceptance of\n\nhis plea.\n\n      First, Marin complains about the plea filing deadlines set\n\nby the court pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(5).            Defendants\n\nwere indicted on May 14, 1997, and pled not guilty on that date.\n\nThe docket reflects that on January 27, 1998, the court set a\n\ndeadline for change of plea petitions of February 4, due to an\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fimpending trial date of February 9.           On February 6, Marin filed\n\nhis request.     In short, Marin had nearly nine months from his\n\nindictment and entry of a not guilty plea until the deadline to\n\nchange his plea, the court set a necessary deadline just prior\n\nto trial, and Marin apparently made no effort to seek additional\n\ntime.\n\n       Second, the specific comments of the court that Marin\n\ncomplains of, to the effect that he had a good attorney, could\n\nnot have indicated to Marin that he would receive a particular\n\nsentence nor could it have coerced Marin's plea in any way.              The\n\ncourt very clearly explained to Marin, and Marin acknowledged\n\nthat    he   understood,   that   the    87   month   sentence   would    be\n\napplicable only if he had a CHC of I and qualified for the\n\nsafety valve.     Further, the court asked Marin three times if he\n\nunderstood that if he failed to comply with the safety valve,\n\nhis minimum term of imprisonment would be 120 months, to which\n\nMarin responded affirmatively.          Marin relies on United States v.\n\nPadilla, 23 F.3d 1220 (7th Cir. 1994), in which we suggested\n\nthat the appropriate remedy when a defendant was never informed\n\non a mandatory minimum was to allow the defendant to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea.       See id. at 1224.           In the instant case,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fhowever, the court did apprise defendant of a 120 month minimum,\n\nonly one month less than defendant's actual sentence.6\n\n    Third, the three questions of the forty-four question plea\n\nquestionnaire which Marin failed to answer pertained to whether\n\nhe had been coerced, or induced by promises, to enter a plea of\n\nguilty.    Nevertheless, at Marin's change of plea hearing, the\n\ncourt questioned him as to whether he had been intimidated,\n\ncoerced,   or   forced    into   pleading    guilty   by   anyone,    and   he\n\nresponded negatively.\n\n    Fourth, Marin alleges that the court erroneously failed to\n\norder a presentence investigation prior to accepting his plea,\n\nrelying on U.S.S.G. § 6B1.1(c), which states that the court\n\n\"shall defer its decision to accept or reject any nonbinding\n\nrecommendation pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B), and the court's\n\ndecision to accept or reject any plea agreement pursuant to\n\nRules   11(e)(1)(A)      and   11(e)(1)(C)   until    there    has   been   an\n\nopportunity to consider the presentence report.\"              The commentary\n\n\n\n    6Marin’s argument suggests that of the defendant in United\nStates v. Hernandez-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1 (lst Cir. 1999), in which\nwe agreed with the defendant that the court had misled him to\nbelieve that he was eligible for the safety valve provision.\nSee id. at 6. In that case, however, the prosecutor, defense\ncounsel, and the court believed the defendant was eligible for\nthe safety valve and the court indicated that if defendant\ncomplied with certain conditions he would be eligible for the\nsafety valve, although ultimately his criminal history category\nprevented him from qualifying. See id. at 5-6.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fto the Guideline states that it is intended to parallel Rule\n\n11(e),    outlining     plea   agreement      procedure.     As    the   Fourth\n\nCircuit has explained, the Guidelines take this stance in order\n\nto \"carry out the Congressional intent that prosecutors do not\n\nundermine the workings of the Sentencing Guidelines.\"                    United\n\nStates v. Ewing, 957 F.2d 115, 117 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\n    In United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17 (lst Cir.\n\n1996), responding to the same argument, we explained that the\n\nflaw in the defendant's argument was that \"he offers no reason\n\nfor equating acceptance of his guilty plea with the acceptance\n\nof a plea agreement under § 6B1.1(c).\"               Id. at 24;      see also\n\nEwing, 957 F.2d at 118 (same).               Here, when accepting Marin's\n\nguilty plea at the change of plea hearing, the court repeatedly\n\nemphasized that his sentence was not definite and would be\n\ndetermined at his sentencing hearing.              By sentencing Marin in\n\naccord    with    the   Sentencing    Guidelines,    after   reviewing      his\n\npresentence report, the court fully accepted the plea agreement\n\nat the sentencing hearing.                   In addition, Marin has not\n\nexplained how his interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 6B1.1(c) can be\n\naligned    with    Fed.   R.   Crim.    P.    32(b)(3),    which    prohibits\n\ndisclosure of a presentence report unless the defendant has\n\nconsented, pled guilty or nolo contendere, or been found guilty,\n\nother     than    to    suggest      that    requiring     the    presentence\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\finvestigation at the change of plea hearing would benefit the\n\ndefendant.        See Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d at 25 (\"The overarching\n\npurpose served by the PSR is to assist the district court at\n\nsentencing.\").7           The district court's procedure was entirely in\n\naccord with the Sentencing Guidelines as well as the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n       Finally,      Marin      alleges   that   his    plea   was   involuntary.\n\nAgain, a review of the transcript of the proceedings establishes\n\nthat       the   court    engaged   in    a   comprehensive    inquiry.     Marin\n\nstated, in response to the court's questioning, that he had\n\ncompleted one year of college, that he had not consumed any\n\nmedication or alcohol in the prior twenty-four hours, and that\n\nhe   understood          the   proceedings.      He    acknowledged    having   an\n\nunderstanding of the indictment, satisfaction with his counsel's\n\nperformance, and awareness of the fundamental rights he was\n\nwaiving by pleading guilty. In addition, the court took pains to\n\nexplain the sentencing possibilities to Marin, which were laid\n\nout in the plea agreement, and which Marin affirmed that he\n\nunderstood.        Further, the court complied with Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\n       7\n      Marin makes the related argument that the court erred\nbecause it accepted the plea agreement before his CHC was\ndetermined.   As just explained, the court did not accept the\nplea agreement until sentencing when Marin's CHC was determined.\nFurther, the plea agreement explicitly stated that the parties\ndid not agree on Marin's CHC and based all subsequent sentencing\nprovisions on the contingency that his CHC would be I.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f11(f), contrary to Marin's claims, by determining that there was\n\na factual basis for his plea.             See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMartinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1220 (lst Cir. 1995) (\"If,\n\nduring the plea colloquy, the government's statement or the\n\ndefendant's own version of the facts sets forth all elements and\n\nconduct of the offense, admission to that conduct sufficiently\n\nestablishes the defendant's understanding of the charge.\").\n\nAgain,   the   court   addressed   the    three   core   concerns   –   that\n\nRodriguez had not been coerced, that he understood the charges,\n\nand that he comprehended the consequences of his guilty plea.\n\n    In conclusion, we hold that both defendants entered their\n\nguilty pleas knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.                 They\n\nhave failed to establish any reason why their guilty pleas\n\nshould be withdrawn.\n\n                           IV.     Sentencing\n\n    Both defendants assert that the court made various errors\n\nat sentencing.     \"We have repeatedly stated in the sentencing\n\ncontext, as well as in other areas, that issues not presented to\n\nthe district court will not be addressed for the first time on\n\nappeal.\"    United States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 10 (lst Cir.\n\n1992).     By not raising their arguments before the district\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fcourt, defendants have waived many of their arguments.8                     The one\n\nexception regards their requests for downward departures in\n\ntheir criminal history categories.                  Only when a sentencing\n\ncourt's decision not to depart is based upon a mistaken view\n\nthat it lacks authority do we have jurisdiction to review it.\n\nSee United States v. Leblanc, 24 F.3d 340, 348 (lst Cir. 1994).\n\n      Both defendants argued to the district court that their CHCs\n\nbe reduced to I pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3 because their\n\ncriminal history categories overrepresented the seriousness of\n\ntheir     criminal      pasts   and    the    likelihood    of    future    crimes.\n\nRodriguez suggested that his CHC of IV was excessive because\n\nseveral     of    the    convictions     were    for   juvenile      offenses      or\n\nmisdemeanors.        The district court agreed with Rodriguez to an\n\nextent, reducing his CHC to II rather than I.                    In Marin's case,\n\nthe   court      refused   to   make    the    departure,    stating       that   the\n\nGuidelines dictated the sentence \"unless there is reason to\n\ndepart or I find some reason to [grant] a downward departure in\n\n\n\n      8\n     Marin complains that the court in effect vacated a binding\nplea agreement between himself and the prosecutor.          This\nargument is baseless because the plea agreement itself stated\nthat its sentencing recommendations were not binding on the\ncourt.  Further, the plea agreement did not purport to set a\ndefinite sentence in the event that his CHC was not I.\nMoreover, in the plea agreement, Marin admitted to understanding\nthat if his CHC was not I and he did not qualify for the safety\nvalue provision, he would face a minimum mandatory sentence of\n120 months.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fthis case.\" By making the departure in Rodriguez's case, the\n\nsame   day   that   he   sentenced    Marin,   the   court   revealed   its\n\nunderstanding of its authority.        See, e.g., id. (concluding that\n\nsentencing court understood that it had authority to depart\n\nbecause it entertained the defendant's argument before denying\n\ndeparture).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f                 V.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n      Lastly, Marin claims that he was denied the effective\n\nassistance of counsel in violation of his Sixth Amendment right.\n\n\"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that\n\nfact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their\n\ndebut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather,\n\nmust be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\"\n\nUnited States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (lst Cir. 1993) (citing\n\ncases).    We have allowed exceptions only when the facts are not\n\nin dispute and the record is sufficiently developed for us to\n\nmake a reasoned evaluation of the defendant's claims.                  See id.\n\n      In   the   instant    case,    the    record    is   not   sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to permit reasoned consideration of Marin's claims.\n\nHis   allegations,     consisting    mainly    of    counsel's    failure     to\n\nsecure a CHC in the plea agreement, to bring attention to\n\nMarin's    failure    to   respond   to    three    questions    in   the   plea\n\nquestionnaire, and to seek to set aside Marin's guilty plea\n\nafter it became evident that his CHC would be II not I, are\n\nneither based on undisputed facts nor sufficiently developed for\n\nthis court to pass judgment on counsel's performance.                       This\n\nclaim must be brought first before the district court via a\n\nrequest for post-conviction relief.\n\n                              VI. Conclusion\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f     We hold that the issues raised in Rodriguez's appeal of the\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress have been waived.      Further, we\n\ndeny defendants' requests to withdraw their guilty pleas because\n\nwe   conclude   that   they   were     entered   into   knowingly,\n\nintelligently, and voluntarily.      We also find no errors in the\n\ncourt's sentencing of defendants.      Finally, we dismiss Marin's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                              -21-\n\f",

Finding no errors in the trial court's acceptance of\n\ndefendants' guilty pleas or imposition of their sentences, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                        I.    Factual Background\n\n       On May 9, 1997, a United States Customs Service airplane\n\nobserved a low-flying Cessna 210 aircraft proceeding from South\n\nAmerica into the United States.         The aircraft entered the United\n\nStates over Ponce, Puerto Rico, and it was pursued to the\n\nvicinity of Cidra, Puerto Rico, although it evaded pursuers by\n\nflying    under   electrical    wires.       The      Puerto    Rico       Police\n\nDepartment received three anonymous calls collectively stating\n\nthat a low-flying plane was throwing out bales to a farm in\n\nCidra where a Mitsubishi Expo van and a BMW waited and that some\n\nof the bales had been placed in the trunk of the BMW.                  At least\n\none caller provided the license plate numbers of the vehicles.\n\n       The Puerto Rico police first located the BMW, occupied by\n\nMarin and another participant, and upon stopping and searching\n\nit, discovered 28 kilograms of cocaine in the trunk wrapped\n\nidentically to the 150 kilograms of cocaine found on the farm.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fThe van, occupied by Rodriguez and another participant, was\n\nsubsequently   stopped       and    two    nine-millimeter       semi-automatic\n\npistols were later found by a subcontractor maintaining the\n\nimpounded vehicle for the United States Customs Service.\n\n    Both defendants entered into plea agreements with the United\n\nStates under which they pled guilty to possession with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), in\n\nexchange for the dismissal of other counts.1              In each, there was\n\nno agreement as to the defendant's criminal history category\n\n(CHC).   Marin's plea agreement stated that if his CHC were I and\n\nif he qualified for the \"safety valve\" provision of U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.2,2 the pertinent sentencing range would be 87 to 108 months\n\nand the government would recommend 87 months.                 Rodriguez's plea\n\nagreement    stated    that    if    his    CHC   were   I,    the     applicable\n\nsentencing range would be 168 to 210 months and the government\n\nwould    recommend    168.     Both       agreements     spoke    in    terms   of\n\ncontingencies – in both, the defendant was promised only that\n\nthe government would recommend a sentence at the lower end of\n\n\n\n    1Marin pled guilty to count IV of the five-count indictment,\nwhich charged possession of 28 kilograms of cocaine, and\nRodriguez pled guilty to count V, which charged possession of\n150 kilograms.\n    2The \"safety valve\" provision releases the minimum mandatory\nsentence when a defendant meets certain criteria, including\nhaving a CHC of I. See U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(1).\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe applicable range, whatever that might be.               Both defendants\n\nagreed that their sentences would be within the sound discretion\n\nof the sentencing judge and would be imposed in accordance with\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.3\n\n       The court accepted defendants' guilty pleas and sentenced\n\nthem       pursuant     to   the   United   States   Sentencing   Guidelines.\n\nBecause Marin's CHC was II, he was not eligible for the safety\n\nvalve and the applicable sentencing range was 121 to 151 months.\n\nThe court accepted the government's recommendation of a sentence\n\nat the lower end, 121 months.               Because Rodriguez's CHC was II,\n\nthe applicable sentencing range was 188 to 235 months.                    The\n\ncourt accepted the government's recommendation of 188 months.\n\n             II.    Denial of Rodriguez's Motion to Suppress\n\n       Prior       to   pleading     guilty,    Rodriguez   moved   for   the\n\nsuppression of his warrantless arrest and all evidence flowing\n\nfrom the arrest, arguing that the arrest was effected without\n\nprobable cause in            violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nSee Beck v.         Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (1964). The court denied\n\n\n\n       3\n      Both agreements explained that \"defendant . . . is aware\nthat his sentence is within the sound discretion of the\nsentencing judge and will be imposed in accordance with the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines.\"    Marin's plea agreement\nalso declared: \"Defendant . . . is fully aware . . . that if his\ncriminal history is greater than I, his sentence will be\nincreased accordingly, and that the Court is not bound by this\nplea agreement.\"\n\n                                        -6-\n\fRodriguez's motion and he subsequently entered into the plea\n\nagreement.      It   is   well   established   that    by   entering   an\n\nunconditional    guilty    plea,    a    defendant    waives   all   non-\n\njurisdictional defects.     See Tollett v.

Because the issues raised by\n\nRodriguez are non-jurisdictional, he has waived the opportunity\n\nfor appellate review by entering an unconditional guilty plea.4\n\n        III.    Voluntariness of Defendants' Guilty Pleas\n\n    Both defendants seek to have their guilty pleas vacated due\n\nto what they define as defects in the plea hearing proceedings,\n\nallegedly in violation of Fed.

In other cases, we have applied the harmless\n\nerror standard.       See, e.g., United States v. Parra-Ibanez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563642\"><a href=\"/opinion/563642/united-states-v-francisco-j-parra-ibanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598 & n.24 (lst Cir. 1991).          Because we find no error\n\nat all in the Rule 11 proceedings, we need not decide this\n\nissue.\n\n      We consider primarily four factors when reviewing a request\n\nto withdraw a guilty plea:\n\n      (1) the plausibility of the reasons prompting the\n      requested change of plea; (2) the timing of the\n      defendant's motion; (3) the existence or nonexistence\n      of an assertion of innocence; and (4) whether, when\n\n                                    -8-\n\f    viewed in light of the emergent circumstances, the\n    defendant's plea appropriately may be characterized as\n    involuntary, in derogation of the requirements imposed\n    by Fed.

Parrilla-Tirado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195328\"><a href=\"/opinion/195328/united-states-v-parrilla-tirado/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (lst Cir.\n\n1994) (footnote omitted).\n\n    Regarding the first factor, defendants proffer no particular\n\nreason    for   requesting   changes      of   plea,   other   than    alleged\n\ninvoluntariness.       Second, their requests were made thirteen\n\nmonths after their change of plea hearings and nine months after\n\nsentencing without explanation for the delay.5 We have explained\n\nthat \"the more a request is delayed – even if made before\n\nsentence is imposed – the more we will regard it with disfavor.\"\n\nUnited States v.

Third,\n\ndefendants do not assert their innocence, which weights the\n\nbalance against allowing them to withdraw their pleas.                 See id.\n\nat 839.\n\n    Mindful      of   the   fact   that    defendants    start   from     this\n\ndisadvantaged point, we consider the final factor.

Rodriguez\n\n    Defendant Rodriguez makes only general allegations that the\n\ncourt erred in accepting his guilty plea and points us to no\n\nspecific error.      Assuming that he has preserved this argument,\n\nwe peruse the Rule 11 proceedings for general error and we find\n\nnone.     Instead,     we   discover    that   the     court    conducted   a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f\"comprehensive inquiry,\" akin to that upheld in Isom, 85 F.3d at\n\n835-37.\n\n      The court ascertained that Rodriguez had signed the petition\n\nto   change   his     plea    to   guilty,     had     fully    answered       a   plea\n\nquestionnaire, and had signed the plea agreement.                          Rodriguez\n\nresponded affirmatively to the court's questions about whether\n\nhe had discussed the indictment against him with his counsel,\n\nwhether he understood the nature of the charge to which he was\n\npleading    guilty,     and    whether    he   understood        that     he   waived\n\ncertain fundamental rights by pleading guilty (such as the\n\nrights to remain silent, be assisted by counsel, confront and\n\ncross-examine witnesses against him, present witnesses on his\n\nown behalf, and       hold the prosecution to its burden of proving\n\nhim guilty beyond a reasonable doubt).                     After this, Rodriguez\n\nconfirmed     that    he     had   no    doubts      about     pleading        guilty.\n\nRodriguez     affirmatively         answered         the    court's       particular\n\nquestions     about    his    understanding       of   the     way   in   which     his\n\nsentence would be determined and that a 168 month sentence was\n\ncontingent upon a CHC of I.             Further, Rodriguez indicated that\n\nhe understood that the only agreement was that which was in\n\nwriting, that the plea agreement had been translated to him,\n\nthat he had not been intimidated, threatened, or coerced in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fregard to his guilty plea, and that he pled guilty freely,\n\nwillingly, knowingly, and voluntarily.\n\n      Thus, the court addressed the three core concerns that must\n\nbe considered when a defendant wishes to enter a guilty plea;\n\nthe court's questions confirmed that Rodriguez had not been\n\ncoerced, that he understood the charges, and that he understood\n\nthe   consequences   of    his   guilty   plea,   including   sentencing\n\nprocedures and possibilities.\n\n      B.   Marin\n\n      Defendant    Marin   makes   more   particularized      contentions\n\nregarding the Rule 11 proceeding.          He asserts that the court\n\nerred by setting deadlines for the filing of a change of plea\n\npetition that created undue pressure on him, making improper\n\ncomments during the hearing, failing to correctly apprise him of\n\nthe sentence he faced, neglecting to inquire about his failure\n\nto answer three questions on the plea questionnaire, and failing\n\nto order a presentence investigation prior to the acceptance of\n\nhis plea.\n\n      First, Marin complains about the plea filing deadlines set\n\nby the court pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(5).            Defendants\n\nwere indicted on May 14, 1997, and pled not guilty on that date.\n\nThe docket reflects that on January 27, 1998, the court set a\n\ndeadline for change of plea petitions of February 4, due to an\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fimpending trial date of February 9.           On February 6, Marin filed\n\nhis request.     In short, Marin had nearly nine months from his\n\nindictment and entry of a not guilty plea until the deadline to\n\nchange his plea, the court set a necessary deadline just prior\n\nto trial, and Marin apparently made no effort to seek additional\n\ntime.\n\n       Second, the specific comments of the court that Marin\n\ncomplains of, to the effect that he had a good attorney, could\n\nnot have indicated to Marin that he would receive a particular\n\nsentence nor could it have coerced Marin's plea in any way.              The\n\ncourt very clearly explained to Marin, and Marin acknowledged\n\nthat    he   understood,   that   the    87   month   sentence   would    be\n\napplicable only if he had a CHC of I and qualified for the\n\nsafety valve.     Further, the court asked Marin three times if he\n\nunderstood that if he failed to comply with the safety valve,\n\nhis minimum term of imprisonment would be 120 months, to which\n\nMarin responded affirmatively.          Marin relies on United States v.\n\nPadilla, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669729\"><a href=\"/opinion/669729/united-states-v-salvador-padilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1994), in which we suggested\n\nthat the appropriate remedy when a defendant was never informed\n\non a mandatory minimum was to allow the defendant to withdraw\n\nhis guilty plea.       See id. at 1224.           In the instant case,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fhowever, the court did apprise defendant of a 120 month minimum,\n\nonly one month less than defendant's actual sentence.6\n\n    Third, the three questions of the forty-four question plea\n\nquestionnaire which Marin failed to answer pertained to whether\n\nhe had been coerced, or induced by promises, to enter a plea of\n\nguilty.    Nevertheless, at Marin's change of plea hearing, the\n\ncourt questioned him as to whether he had been intimidated,\n\ncoerced,   or   forced    into   pleading    guilty   by   anyone,    and   he\n\nresponded negatively.\n\n    Fourth, Marin alleges that the court erroneously failed to\n\norder a presentence investigation prior to accepting his plea,\n\nrelying on U.S.S.G. § 6B1.1(c), which states that the court\n\n\"shall defer its decision to accept or reject any nonbinding\n\nrecommendation pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B), and the court's\n\ndecision to accept or reject any plea agreement pursuant to\n\nRules   11(e)(1)(A)      and   11(e)(1)(C)   until    there    has   been   an\n\nopportunity to consider the presentence report.\"              The commentary\n\n\n\n    6Marin’s argument suggests that of the defendant in United\nStates v.

In that case, however, the prosecutor, defense\ncounsel, and the court believed the defendant was eligible for\nthe safety valve and the court indicated that if defendant\ncomplied with certain conditions he would be eligible for the\nsafety valve, although ultimately his criminal history category\nprevented him from qualifying. See id. at 5-6.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fto the Guideline states that it is intended to parallel Rule\n\n11(e),    outlining     plea   agreement      procedure.

Sanchez-Barreto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196929\"><a href=\"/opinion/196929/united-states-v-sanchez-barreto/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (lst Cir.\n\n1996), responding to the same argument, we explained that the\n\nflaw in the defendant's argument was that \"he offers no reason\n\nfor equating acceptance of his guilty plea with the acceptance\n\nof a plea agreement under § 6B1.1(c).\"               Id. at 24;      see also\n\nEwing, 957 F.2d at 118 (same).               Here, when accepting Marin's\n\nguilty plea at the change of plea hearing, the court repeatedly\n\nemphasized that his sentence was not definite and would be\n\ndetermined at his sentencing hearing.              By sentencing Marin in\n\naccord    with    the   Sentencing    Guidelines,    after   reviewing      his\n\npresentence report, the court fully accepted the plea agreement\n\nat the sentencing hearing.                   In addition, Marin has not\n\nexplained how his interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 6B1.1(c) can be\n\naligned    with    Fed.   R.   Crim.    P.    32(b)(3),    which    prohibits\n\ndisclosure of a presentence report unless the defendant has\n\nconsented, pled guilty or nolo contendere, or been found guilty,\n\nother     than    to    suggest      that    requiring     the    presentence\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\finvestigation at the change of plea hearing would benefit the\n\ndefendant.        See Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d at 25 (\"The overarching\n\npurpose served by the PSR is to assist the district court at\n\nsentencing.\").7           The district court's procedure was entirely in\n\naccord with the Sentencing Guidelines as well as the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n       Finally,      Marin      alleges   that   his    plea   was   involuntary.\n\nAgain, a review of the transcript of the proceedings establishes\n\nthat       the   court    engaged   in    a   comprehensive    inquiry.     Marin\n\nstated, in response to the court's questioning, that he had\n\ncompleted one year of college, that he had not consumed any\n\nmedication or alcohol in the prior twenty-four hours, and that\n\nhe   understood          the   proceedings.      He    acknowledged    having   an\n\nunderstanding of the indictment, satisfaction with his counsel's\n\nperformance, and awareness of the fundamental rights he was\n\nwaiving by pleading guilty. In addition, the court took pains to\n\nexplain the sentencing possibilities to Marin, which were laid\n\nout in the plea agreement, and which Marin affirmed that he\n\nunderstood.        Further, the court complied with Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\n       7\n      Marin makes the related argument that the court erred\nbecause it accepted the plea agreement before his CHC was\ndetermined.   As just explained, the court did not accept the\nplea agreement until sentencing when Marin's CHC was determined.\nFurther, the plea agreement explicitly stated that the parties\ndid not agree on Marin's CHC and based all subsequent sentencing\nprovisions on the contingency that his CHC would be I.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f11(f), contrary to Marin's claims, by determining that there was\n\na factual basis for his plea.             See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMartinez-Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707600\"><a href=\"/opinion/707600/united-states-v-olivia-martinez-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1220 (lst Cir. 1995) (\"If,\n\nduring the plea colloquy, the government's statement or the\n\ndefendant's own version of the facts sets forth all elements and\n\nconduct of the offense, admission to that conduct sufficiently\n\nestablishes the defendant's understanding of the charge.\").\n\nAgain,   the   court   addressed   the    three   core   concerns   –   that\n\nRodriguez had not been coerced, that he understood the charges,\n\nand that he comprehended the consequences of his guilty plea.\n\n    In conclusion, we hold that both defendants entered their\n\nguilty pleas knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.

Only when a sentencing\n\ncourt's decision not to depart is based upon a mistaken view\n\nthat it lacks authority do we have jurisdiction to review it.\n\nSee United States v.

The district court agreed with Rodriguez to an\n\nextent, reducing his CHC to II rather than I.                    In Marin's case,\n\nthe   court      refused   to   make    the    departure,    stating       that   the\n\nGuidelines dictated the sentence \"unless there is reason to\n\ndepart or I find some reason to [grant] a downward departure in\n\n\n\n      8\n     Marin complains that the court in effect vacated a binding\nplea agreement between himself and the prosecutor.          This\nargument is baseless because the plea agreement itself stated\nthat its sentencing recommendations were not binding on the\ncourt.  Further, the plea agreement did not purport to set a\ndefinite sentence in the event that his CHC was not I.\nMoreover, in the plea agreement, Marin admitted to understanding\nthat if his CHC was not I and he did not qualify for the safety\nvalue provision, he would face a minimum mandatory sentence of\n120 months.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fthis case.\" By making the departure in Rodriguez's case, the\n\nsame   day   that   he   sentenced    Marin,   the   court   revealed   its\n\nunderstanding of its authority.
