BYARD, in his capacity\r\n             as Superintendent of Schools,\r\n       and the BELCHERTOWN PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM,\r\n\n                Defendants, Appellants.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRegina Williams Tate, with whom Mary L. Gallant, and Murphy,\r\nHesse, Toomey &amp; Lehane, were on brief for appellants.\r\nClaire L. Thompson, with whom Doherty, Wallace, Pillsbury and\r\nMurphy P.C. were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nNovember 25, 1998\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal by\r\ndefendants-appellants, the Belchertown Public School System and\r\nRobert B. Byard, Superintendent of Schools, from a summary judgment\r\nof the district court awarding attorney's fees and costs to\r\nplaintiffs-appellees, Alison H., p/p/a Donald H.\r\nThe attorney's fees award was the aftermath of a dispute\r\nbetween plaintiffs and defendants over the special education\r\nservices to be provided Alison H. by defendants.  The settlement,\r\nwhich is not attacked by plaintiffs, was entered into prior to a\r\nhearing before the Massachusetts Bureau of Special Education\r\nAppeals.  After settlement, plaintiffs demanded attorney's fees\r\nfrom defendants on the basis that they were the prevailing parties\r\nand were therefore entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to 20\r\nU.S.C.  1415(i)(3)(B).  After defendants rejected the demand for\r\nattorney's fees, suit was brought seeking an order awarding\r\nplaintiffs attorney's fees.\r\n                           I.\r\nDefendants raise five issues on appeal.  The only one we\r\ndiscuss is dispositive of the appeal so we do not consider the\r\nothers, interesting and intriguing as they may be.  We find and\r\nrule that plaintiffs waived the claim to attorney's fees under the\r\nterms of the settlement agreement.  Because this is an appeal from\r\na grant of summary judgment our standard of review is de novo. \r\nDeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 305 (1st Cir. 1997); Dubois v.\r\nUnited States Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1283 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\ncert. denied,   U.S.   , 117 S. Ct. 2510 (1997); Coyne v. Taber\r\nPartners I, 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nPlaintiffs cite a host of Massachusetts cases to the\r\neffect that \"abuse of discretion\" is the standard of review in\r\nMassachusetts.  Because the standard of review is a procedural\r\nmatter, not a substantive one, we are bound by federal law.  It\r\nmakes no difference, however, in this case because we rule that the\r\ndistrict made an error of law on the issue before us.  This\r\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.  In Klonoski v. Mahlab, 156\r\nF.3d 255, 276 (1st Cir. 1998), in which we said:\r\nAs the Supreme Court has stated, '[a] district\r\ncourt by definition abuses its discretion when\r\nit makes an error of law.'  Koon v. UnitedStates, 518 U.S. 81, 94-102, 116 S. Ct. 2035,\r\n135 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1996); see United States v.\r\nMarroquin, 136 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nGolas v. Home View, Inc., 106 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).\r\n\n                       The Facts\r\nAlison H. is a minor female who resides with her parents\r\nin Belchertown, Massachusetts.  The Belchertown Public School\r\nSystem is responsible for providing special education to students\r\nwith learning disabilities.  It began providing special education\r\nservices to Alison at the beginning of the fifth grade; they were\r\ndiscontinued halfway through grade five.  From then on, Alison's\r\nparents had a running dispute with the school as to the special\r\neducation services Alison should receive and where they would be\r\ngiven.  No agreement could be reached on an appropriate\r\nindividualized educational plan (IEP) for Alison.\r\nOn January 30, 1996, plaintiffs retained Attorney Claire\r\nThompson to represent them in the dispute with the school.  She\r\nfiled a request for a hearing with the Bureau of Education Appeals. \r\nThereafter Attorney Thompson negotiated for the parents on the\r\nquestion of an appropriate IEP for Alison.  During the\r\nnegotiations, the plaintiffs made clear that they thought that\r\nWhite Oak School was the most appropriate placement for Alison and\r\nwould meet their IEP demands.  White Oak School is a private\r\ninstitution specializing in special education for children with\r\nlearning disabilities.\r\nDefendants sent a proposed new IEP for Alison on June 28,\r\n1996 to Attorney Thompson.  She replied on July 31, 1996, making\r\nadditional demands and proposing further conditions.  On August 21,\r\n1996, the attorney for the school faxed the following letter to\r\nAttorney Thompson:\r\n   Rick McInerney received a copy of your\r\nletter in which you requested additional\r\nchanges in the IEP for Allison.  After Mr.\r\nMcInerney's review of your letter and\r\nrequested changes, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was unlikely that you or your clients\r\nwould ever be satisfied with the IEP developed\r\nby Belchertown or the educational program\r\nprovided by Belchertown.  Therefore, he\r\ncontacted White Oak School in order to\r\nascertain if it had an available place for\r\nAllison to attend school starting in September\r\n1996.  He has confirmed that White Oak does\r\nhave a space available for Allison and\r\ntherefore, would offer to Mr. and Mrs. H. the\r\nopportunity for Allison to attend White Oak\r\nfor the 1996-1997 school year.  As a condition\r\nof finalizing this agreement, Belchertown\r\nwould be looking for the withdrawal of the\r\nrequest for hearing, which hearing is\r\nscheduled for September 11, 1996, as well as a\r\nrelease of any and all claims arising prior to\r\nthe execution of the agreement.  If your\r\nclients are interested in this offer, please\r\ncontact me by Friday, August 23, 1996, since\r\nWhite Oak is requiring an answer by that date\r\nin order to continue to hold a place for\r\nAllison for the 1996-1997 school year.\r\n\n   Should you have any further questions,\r\nplease feel free to contact me.  \r\n\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n\nWithin a matter of hours Attorney Thompson replied by\r\nfax:\r\nOn behalf of Don and Judy H., I hereby accept\r\nBelchertown's offer to place Alison at White\r\nOak School for the 1996-1997 school year. \r\nPlease forward a new I.E.P. for the H's\r\nsignature.\r\n\nThe school prepared a new IEP for Alison's attendance at\r\nWhite Oak School.  It was accepted by the parents on September 3,\r\n1996.  The scheduled hearing before the Bureau of Special Education\r\nAppeals was canceled.  Alison attended White Oak School for the\r\n1996-97 school year.  Belchertown School paid a total of $22,295.20\r\nfor Alison's tuition and transportation.\r\nBy letter dated November 6, 1996 Attorney Thompson asked\r\nthat Belchertown School pay her attorney's fees \"totaling $6,112.40\r\nthrough August 26, 1996.\"  The letter also stated:\r\n   Unless the parties are able to negotiate\r\nsettlement by November 30, 1996, I will be\r\ncompelled to file a Complaint for attorney's\r\nfees in U.S. District Court.  (Emphasis in\r\noriginal.)\r\n\nBelchertown rejected the demand for attorney's fees.  Defendants\r\ntook the position that plaintiffs had waived any claim for\r\nattorney's fees by accepting Belchertown's offer to place Alison in\r\nWhite Oak School.  Plaintiff's complaint asserting their right to\r\nattorney's fees was filed on December 6, 1996.\r\n                          II.\r\nThe issue is a classic one of contract construction:  did\r\nplaintiffs' acceptance of Belchertown's offer to place Alison in\r\nWhite Oak School subject to the condition that there be \"a release\r\nof any and all claims arising prior to the execution of the\r\nagreement\" constitute a waiver of plaintiffs' claim for attorney's\r\nfees.  The district court ruled that there was no waiver.  After\r\nfinding that the plaintiffs were the prevailing parties, it stated:\r\n   Second, I do not believe that there was any\r\nwaiver here.  There was never a release sent\r\nby the defendants to the plaintiffs.  The\r\nlanguage refers to things occurring prior to\r\nthis agreement while the entitlement to\r\nattorney's fees did not really arise until\r\nafter the agreement was executed.  The\r\ndrafting was ambiguous and my normal tenets of\r\nconstruction is that these ambiguities should\r\nbe construed in the plaintiffs' favor and\r\nagainst the drafter.\r\n\n   In addition, the plaintiffs' response to\r\nthe offer, it seems to me, clearly only\r\naccepted the offer to place Alison at White\r\nOak School and did not even purport to give up\r\nanything else, so there was no waiver.\r\n\nWith respect, we disagree.  We analyze the ruling\r\nsentence by sentence.  It is true that a release was never sent by\r\ndefendants to plaintiffs for execution.  It would have been better\r\nif this had been done.  But the offer letter neither states nor\r\nsuggests that a release would be sent.  We think, moreover, that\r\nthe plain and unambiguous language of the offer meant that\r\nacceptance by the plaintiffs meant they had released the defendants\r\nfrom \"any and all claims arising prior to the execution of the\r\nagreement.\"  Surely the phrase \"any and all claims\" encompasses\r\nattorney's fees which are a major factor and bone of contention in\r\nthis type of litigation.  See e.g., Kathleen H. v. Massachusetts\r\nDep't of Educ., 154 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir. 1998); Fowler v. Unified\r\nSch. Dist. No. 259, 128 F.3d 1431, 1439 (10th Cir. 1997); County of\r\nSan Diego v. California Special Educ. Hearing Office, 93 F.3d 1458,\r\n1468 (9th Cir. 1996).  \r\nThe next sentence is puzzling.  The court, after noting\r\nthat \"[t]he language refers to things occurring prior to this\r\nagreement,\" states that the \"entitlement to attorney's fees did not\r\nreally arise until after the agreement was executed.\" It is true\r\nthat a claimant cannot collect attorney's fees in such a case until\r\nit prevails, but the amount of the entitlement was based on\r\nservices rendered prior to execution of the settlement.  It is what\r\nwas asked for in the First Amended Complaint.  Paragraph A asks\r\nthat the court:\r\n   A.     Award the plaintiffs their reasonable\r\n          attorney's fees and costs in the sum of\r\n          $6,112.40 through August 26, 1996;  \r\n\n(Emphasis ours.)\r\n\nState of New Hampshire v. Adams, No. 98-1244, slip op. at 6-7 (1st\r\nCir. Nov. 12, 1998).\r\nThe court then found the contract ambiguous and construed\r\nit in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.  We rule\r\nto the contrary.\r\nWe realize that the question of ambiguity is a judgment\r\ncall, but there are established guidelines that lead to a well\r\ntrodden path.  A contract is formed upon acceptance of an offer. \r\nIsmert and Assocs., Inc. v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 801\r\nF.2d 536, 541 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\n   \"The question of whether a contract term is\r\nambiguous is one of law for the judge.\"  Allen,\r\n967 F.2d at 698; accord Boston Five Cents Sav.\r\nBank, 768 F.2d at 8; Jefferson Ins. Co. v.\r\nHolyoke, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 503 N.E.2d\r\n474, 476 n.4, rev. denied, 399 Mass. 1104, 506\r\nN.E.2d 146 (1987).  A contract is not\r\nambiguous simply because litigants disagree\r\nabout its proper interpretation.  See Papago\r\nTribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F.2d 950, 955\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1241,\r\n104 S. Ct. 3511, 82 L. Ed. 2d 820 (1984). \r\nRather, a contract, or a set of documents\r\nwhich in the ensemble comprise a contract, is\r\nconsidered ambiguous only when the language \"is\r\nreasonably prone to different interpretations.\" \r\nFowler v. Boise Cascade Corp., 948 F.2d 49, 54\r\n(1st Cir. 1991).  Stated another way, contract\r\nlanguage which \"is susceptible to differing,\r\nbut nonetheless plausible, constructions . . .\r\nis ambiguous.\"  Allen, 967 F.2d at 700; see\r\nalso Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892\r\nF.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\nFDIC v. Singh, 977 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nUnder Massachusetts law, \"[w]here the wording\r\nof the contract is unambiguous, the contract\r\nmust be enforced according to its terms.\" \r\nEdmonds v. United States, 642 F.2d 877, 881\r\n(1st Cir. 1981).  We see no basis for\r\nrewriting the contract whether or not, as an\r\noriginal proposition, it could have been\r\nbetter written as [Liberty] now proposes.\r\n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gibbs, 773 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nIn the final sentence of this ruling, the court held that\r\n\"the plaintiff's response to the offer . . . clearly only accepted\r\nthe offer to place Alison at White Oak School and did not even\r\npurport to give up anything else, so there was no waiver.\"  This\r\nreads out of the offer letter the phrase, \"as a condition of\r\nfinalizing this agreement . . . .\"  One of the conditions was \"a\r\nrelease of any and all claims arising prior to the execution of\r\nthis agreement.\"  It was the plaintiffs who had a duty to object or\r\nat least raise a question about the conditions imposed upon them by\r\nthe offer.  Indeed, the last sentence of the offer letter states\r\nclearly:  \"Should you have any further questions, please feel free\r\nto contact me.\"\r\nIt was not until long after the new IEP had been accepted\r\n(Sept. 3, 1996) and Alison had been placed in White Oak School and\r\nthe hearing before the Bureau of Special Education Appeals had been\r\ndismissed (Sept. 23, 1996) that Attorney Thompson made a demand for\r\nattorney's fees (Nov. 6, 1996).  If there was going to be a demand\r\nfor attorney's fees, it should have been made before the clear\r\nconditional offer of defendants was accepted.  We do not think that\r\nplaintiffs should be able take advantage of defendant's clear\r\nconditional offer and more than two months later make a demand for\r\nattorney's fees. \r\nWe hold that the offer letter and its prompt acceptance\r\nby plaintiffs constituted a contract between the parties.  We rule\r\nthat the contract was unambiguous.  The phrase \"a release of any\r\nand all claims arising prior to the execution of the agreement\"\r\nclearly encompasses plaintiff's attorney's fees.  Plaintiffs\r\nreceived the benefits of the contract.  To enable them to avoid the\r\nrelease obligation of the contract would be unjust and contrary to\r\nthe basic principles of contract law.\r\nThe judgment below is reversed.  Judgment shall enter for\r\nthe defendants.  Costs on appeal awarded to defendants.  So\r\nordered.\n",

Defendants took the position that plaintiffs had waived any claim for attorney's fees by accepting Belchertown's offer to place Alison in White Oak School.  Plaintiff's complaint asserting their right to attorney's fees was filed on December 6, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is a classic one of contract construction:  did plaintiffs' acceptance of Belchertown's offer to place Alison in White Oak School subject to the condition that there be \"a release of any and all claims arising prior to the execution of the agreement\" constitute a waiver of plaintiffs' claim for attorney's fees.  The district court ruled that there was no waiver.  After finding that the plaintiffs were the prevailing parties, it stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, I do not believe that there was any waiver here.  There was never a release sent by the defendants to the plaintiffs.  The language refers to things occurring prior to this agreement while the entitlement to attorney's fees did not really arise until after the agreement was executed.  The drafting was ambiguous and my normal tenets of construction is that these ambiguities should be construed in the plaintiffs' favor and against the drafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the plaintiffs' response to the offer, it seems to me, clearly only accepted the offer to place Alison at White Oak School and did not even purport to give up anything else, so there was no waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect, we disagree.  We analyze the ruling sentence by sentence.  It is true that a release was never sent by defendants to plaintiffs for execution.  It would have been better if this had been done.  But the offer letter neither states nor suggests that a release would be sent.  We think, moreover, that the plain and unambiguous language of the offer meant that acceptance by the plaintiffs meant they had released the defendants from \"any and all claims arising prior to the execution of the agreement.\"   Surely the phrase \"any and all claims\" encompasses attorney's fees which are a major factor and bone of contention in this type of litigation.  See, e.g., State of New Hampshire v. Adams, 159 F.3d 680, 683-84 (1st Cir.1998).  Kathleen H. v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., 154 F.3d 8, 14 (1st Cir.1998);  Fowler v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 259, 128 F.3d 1431, 1439 (10th Cir.1997);  County of San Diego v. California Special Educ. Hearing Office, 93 F.3d 1458, 1468 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next sentence is puzzling.  The court, after noting that \"[t]he language refers to things occurring prior to this agreement,\" states that the \"entitlement to attorney's fees did not really arise until after the agreement was executed.\"   It is true that a claimant cannot collect attorney's fees in such a case until it prevails, but the amount of the entitlement was based on services rendered prior to execution of the settlement.  It is what was asked for in the First Amended Complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Paragraph A asks that the court:A. Award the plaintiffs their reasonable attorney's fees and costs in the sum of $6,112.40 through August 26, 1996;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then found the contract ambiguous and construed it in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.

A contract is formed upon acceptance of an offer.  Ismert and Assocs., Inc. v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 801 F.2d 536, 541 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The question of whether a contract term is ambiguous is one of law for the judge.\"  Allen, 967 F.2d at 698;  accord Boston Five Cents Sav.

A contract is not ambiguous simply because litigants disagree about its proper interpretation.  See Papago Tribal Util.  Auth. v.

Boise Cascade Corp., 948 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir.1991).  Stated another way, contract language which \"is susceptible to differing, but nonetheless plausible, constructions ... is ambiguous.\"  Allen, 967 F.2d at 700;  see also Fashion House, Inc. v.

Indeed, the last sentence of the offer letter states clearly:  \"Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not until long after the new IEP had been accepted (Sept. 3, 1996) and Alison had been placed in White Oak School and the hearing before the Bureau of Special Education Appeals had been dismissed (Sept. 23, 1996) that Attorney Thompson made a demand for attorney's fees (Nov. 6, 1996).  If there was going to be a demand for attorney's fees, it should have been made before the clear conditional offer of defendants was accepted.  We do not think that plaintiffs should be able take advantage of defendant's clear conditional offer and more than two months later make a demand for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the offer letter and its prompt acceptance by plaintiffs constituted a contract between the parties.  We rule that the contract was unambiguous.  The phrase \"a release of any and all claims arising prior to the execution of the agreement\" clearly encompasses plaintiff's attorney's fees.  Plaintiffs received the benefits of the contract.

The Belchertown Public School System is responsible for providing special education to students with learning disabilities.  It began providing special education services to Alison at the beginning of the fifth grade;  they were discontinued halfway through grade five.  From then on, Alison's parents had a running dispute with the school as to the special education services Alison should receive and where they would be given.  No agreement could be reached on an appropriate individualized educational plan (IEP) for Alison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1996, plaintiffs retained Attorney Claire Thompson to represent them in the dispute with the school.  She filed a request for a hearing with the Bureau of Education Appeals.  Thereafter Attorney Thompson negotiated for the parents on the question of an appropriate IEP for Alison.  During the negotiations, the plaintiffs made clear that they thought that White Oak School was the most appropriate placement for Alison and would meet their IEP demands.  White Oak School is a private institution specializing in special education for children with learning disabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants sent a proposed new IEP for Alison on June 28, 1996 to Attorney Thompson.  She replied on July 31, 1996, making additional demands and proposing further conditions.  On August 21, 1996, the attorney for the school faxed the following letter to Attorney Thompson:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rick McInerney received a copy of your letter in which you requested additional changes in the IEP for Allison.  After Mr. McInerney's review of your letter and requested changes, he came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that you or your clients would ever be satisfied with the IEP developed by Belchertown or the educational program provided by Belchertown.  Therefore, he contacted White Oak School in order to ascertain if it had an available place for Allison to attend school starting in September 1996.  He has confirmed that White Oak does have a space available for Allison and therefore, would offer to Mr. and Mrs. H. the opportunity for Allison to attend White Oak for the 1996-1997 school year.  As a condition of finalizing this agreement, Belchertown would be looking for the withdrawal of the request for hearing, which hearing is scheduled for September 11, 1996, as well as a release of any and all claims arising prior to the execution of the agreement.   If your clients are interested in this offer, please contact me by Friday, August 23, 1996, since White Oak is requiring an answer by that date in order to continue to hold a place for Allison for the 1996-1997 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a matter of hours Attorney Thompson replied by fax:On behalf of Don and Judy H., I hereby accept Belchertown's offer to place Alison at White Oak School for the 1996-1997 school year.

The court, after noting that \"[t]he language refers to things occurring prior to this agreement,\" states that the \"entitlement to attorney's fees did not really arise until after the agreement was executed.\"   It is true that a claimant cannot collect attorney's fees in such a case until it prevails, but the amount of the entitlement was based on services rendered prior to execution of the settlement.  It is what was asked for in the First Amended Complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Paragraph A asks that the court:A.

If there was going to be a demand for attorney's fees, it should have been made before the clear conditional offer of defendants was accepted.  We do not think that plaintiffs should be able take advantage of defendant's clear conditional offer and more than two months later make a demand for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the offer letter and its prompt acceptance by plaintiffs constituted a contract between the parties.

Plaintiffs received the benefits of the contract.  To enable them to avoid the release obligation of the contract would be unjust and contrary to the basic principles of contract law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is reversed.
