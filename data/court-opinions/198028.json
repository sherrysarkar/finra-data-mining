Frank H. Freedman, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n          Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Ronald Nacamuli, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\r\n   Jennifer Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nJune 25, 1998\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Charles Nunez\r\nasserts that we should set aside his conviction for, inter alia,\r\ntrafficking in destructive devices (in this case, pipe bombs)\r\nbecause the government behaved badly.  Secondarily, he mounts\r\nclaims of trial and sentencing error.  Because Nunez's arguments\r\nare unpersuasive, we affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nWhile conducting an ongoing investigation into gang\r\nactivity in western Massachusetts, the authorities learned of a\r\nperson called \"the Mexican,\" who had a reputation for building and\r\ndistributing pipe bombs in exchange for drugs or money.  The\r\ngovernment concluded that Nunez was this individual and focused its\r\nprobe accordingly.\r\nAt the authorities' instigation, a cooperating drug\r\ndealer, Jose Colon, approached Nunez and told him that he \"needed\r\n[some pipe bombs] to blow up [a rival gang].\"  Nunez acquiesced,\r\nbut said that the task required raw materials.  Colon, Nunez, and\r\nan undercover officer thereafter drove to Connecticut and filled\r\nNunez's shopping list at government expense.\r\nNunez constructed the pipe bombs and Colon purchased nine\r\nof them for cash.  Nunez, literally and figuratively, was hoist by\r\nhis own petard.  After he had been arrested and advised of his\r\nrights, he proclaimed that, although \"he didn't mean to hurt\r\nanyone,\"  the pipe bombs were intended \"for the gangs\" because he\r\n\"didn't like the gangs and wanted to hurt gangs.\"\r\nThe government's case at trial was compelling.  It\r\nfeatured Colon's testimony and tape-recordings of certain\r\nconversations.  It also included the testimony of an FBI explosives\r\nexpert to the effect that all nine pipe bombs were \"destructive\r\ndevice[s]\" as defined in 26 U.S.C.  5845(f).  The jury convicted\r\nNunez of possessing unregistered destructive devices, transferring\r\nsuch devices, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 26\r\nU.S.C.  5861(d) &amp; (e) (1994); 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1) (1994).  At\r\nthe disposition hearing, Judge Freedman sentenced Nunez to a 120-\r\nmonth prison term.  This appeal followed.\r\nII.  DISCUSSION\r\nThe appellant advances three separate and distinct\r\nassignments of error.  We deal with each of them in turn.\r\n                  A.  Government Misconduct.\r\nThe appellant's flagship argument targets the district\r\ncourt's denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on\r\nthe ground of egregious government misconduct.  The question of\r\nwhether the government committed misconduct so outrageous as to\r\nwarrant the dismissal of charges is a question of law which we\r\nreview de novo.  See United States v. Hudson, 982 F.2d 160, 163\r\n(5th Cir. 1993).\r\nTo the extent that it survives at all, the legal doctrine\r\non which the appellant's argument hinges is of extremely limited\r\napplication.  The doctrine holds that the government commits\r\noutrageous misconduct when it behaves in a manner that violates\r\n\"fundamental fairness\" and \"shock[s] . . . the universal sense of\r\njustice.\"  United States v. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Courts\r\noccasionally have applied (or talked about applying) the doctrine\r\nin instances in which the government subjects a suspect to\r\nintolerable abuses and those in which \"law enforcement personnel\r\nbecome so overinvolved in a felonious venture that they can fairly\r\nbe said either to have created the crime or to have coerced the\r\ndefendant's participation in it.\"  Id. at 4-5 (citations and\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  The appellant depicts his case\r\nas involving both prototypes.\r\nThere is no tidy test to determine whether government\r\nconduct qualifies as outrageous.  Thus, we have acknowledged that\r\n\"outrageousness, by its nature, requires an ad hoc determination.\" \r\nId. at 6.  Here, however, the appellant's trial counsel raised the\r\npoint only in a pretrial motion, bereft of any particularized\r\nevidentiary submissions and unaccompanied by a request for a voir\r\ndire or other evidentiary hearing.  Consequently, the motion lacked\r\na sufficient factual predicate, and the district court's denial of\r\nit hardly can be faulted.  See id. (explaining that \"[t]he calculus\r\n[for determining the legitimacy of a claim of outrageous government\r\nmisconduct] must be rooted in the record\").\r\nEven were we disposed to accept the belated factual\r\nproffer contained in Nunez's appellate brief   a proffer which\r\nloosely incorporates the trial evidence, but laces that evidence\r\nwith considerable conjecture   the result would be the same.  The\r\nappellant complains that the government's pursuit of him involved\r\nthe decision to use a drug dealer to negotiate with a drug addict,\r\nand that the relationship between dealer and addict is so one-sided\r\nas to undermine the independence of his decision to fill Colon's\r\nrequest for pipe bombs.  Passing the fact that Colon was at most an\r\noccasional supplier of drugs to Nunez (who had other, more reliable\r\nsources), this version of an addiction defense cannot stand.  See,\r\ne.g., United States v. Harris, 997 F.2d 812, 817-18 (10th Cir.\r\n1993); United States v. Lyons, 731 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir. 1984)\r\n(en banc); United States v. Moore, 486 F.2d 1139, 1146 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1973) (en banc); cf. United States v. Ford, 918 F.2d 1343, 1348-50\r\n(8th Cir. 1990).  To put matters bluntly, the appellant cannot\r\nstrip himself of all moral agency by virtue of his drug addiction.\r\nNunez also maintains that the government acted\r\noutrageously by becoming overinvolved in the conception and\r\ncommission of the crime.  This asseveration rests on facts such as\r\nColon's request for the pipe bombs, the escort afforded to Nunez\r\nwhen he purchased the raw materials, and the fact that the\r\ngovernment fronted the cost.  The record does not bear out the\r\nclaim that this conduct crossed the line of impropriety.\r\nThe government had information from multiple sources that\r\nNunez previously had sold pipe bombs to gang members.  The\r\ngovernment therefore did not create the crime, but, rather,\r\nconducted a conventional undercover \"sting\" operation in an attempt\r\nto confirm or refute this information.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nMatiz, 14 F.3d 79 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Panitz, 907\r\nF.2d 1267 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1 (1st\r\nCir. 1985).  The jury rejected Nunez's entrapment defense at trial,\r\nand there is simply no credible evidence either that Nunez was an\r\nunready participant or that the government coerced him in any way.\r\nWe summarize succinctly.  Although an occasional early\r\ncase espoused the doctrine of outrageous government misconduct, we\r\nrecently described it as \"moribund\" and predicted that a defense\r\npremised upon it will rarely, if ever, bear fruit.  Santana, 6 F.3d\r\nat 4 (reviewing the doctrine's history and concluding that \"[t]he\r\nbanner of outrageous misconduct is often raised but seldom\r\nsaluted\").  The instant case discloses no significant evidence of\r\ngovernment misconduct and clearly falls within this general rule,\r\nnot within the long-odds exception to it.  Thus, the appellant's\r\nclaim fails on the merits.\r\n\n               B.  The Prosecutor's Summation.\r\nThe appellant next posits that the prosecutor's summation\r\nexceeded the bounds of permissible argument and thus violated due\r\nprocess.  He cites twenty-two allegedly improper remarks.  As his\r\ntrial counsel did not object contemporaneously to any of these\r\nstatements, our review is for plain error.  See United States v.\r\nMejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 272 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 52(b).  Plain-error analysis discourages quibbles.  Under\r\nit, we will consider only those errors that \"seriously affect the\r\nfundamental fairness and basic integrity of the proceedings\r\nconducted below.\"  United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st\r\nCir. 1987) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nWe have scrutinized the prosecutor's summation in light\r\nof the transcript as a whole and have paid special attention to the\r\ntwenty-two specific instances spotlighted by Nunez's appellate\r\ncounsel.  We see no need to recount book and verse.  The\r\nappellant's claims cover an array of supposed peccadilloes   for\r\nexample, vouching for witnesses, mischaracterizing evidence, and\r\ninvading the jury's province   but none of them are substantial. \r\nThe prosecutor gave a vigorous summation, not an unfair one.  It is\r\nentirely proper for prosecutors to argue their cases zealously as\r\nlong as they do not stray into forbidden terrain   and the\r\nprosecutor's remarks in this case, taken in context, reflect no\r\nmore than acceptable zeal.  In the last analysis, the  appellant\r\nconfuses hard blows (which are permitted to a prosecutor) with foul\r\nblows (which are proscribed).\r\nIf more were needed   and we do not think that it is   we\r\nnote that, on plain-error review, the defendant has the burden of\r\ndemonstrating that impermissible statements \"likely infected the\r\njury . . . and mere possibilities are not enough.\"  United Statesv. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21, 31 (1st Cir. 1996).  Nunez has wholly\r\nfailed to carry this burden.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the\r\nprosecutor on occasion sailed too close to the wind, the appellant\r\nhas presented no chain of logic that proceeds from prosecutorial\r\ncomment to likely jury influence.  Absent such a linkage, even\r\nproblematic statements would not constitute grounds for reversal.\r\nTo say more on this point would be supererogatory. \r\nBecause the statements made by the prosecutor, whether viewed\r\nsingly or in the ensemble, did not threaten the fundamental\r\nfairness of the trial, we reject this assignment of error.\r\n                       C.  Sentencing.\r\nThe appellant's claim of sentencing error focuses on the\r\ndistrict court's conferment of a four-level upward adjustment\r\npursuant to USSG 2K2.1(b)(5) (1995).  An enhancement under section\r\n2K2.1(b)(5) lies if the defendant possessed a firearm or explosive\r\n\"with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used\r\nin or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\"   The\r\nappellant offers a host of reasons to support his claim that the\r\ndistrict court improperly invoked this guideline.  These reasons\r\nboil down to three general contentions, namely, (1) that the\r\ngovernment adduced no evidence to show that Nunez possessed the\r\nrequisite guilty knowledge; (2) that there was no possible chance\r\nthat the bombs would be used or possessed in connection with a\r\nfelony because they were purchased by the government during an\r\nundercover operation; and (3) that the guideline provision requires\r\na showing that the bombs were to be used to perpetrate a specificcrime (or, if not, the provision is at least ambiguous in this\r\nrespect, thus entitling Nunez to the benefit of a \"specific crime\"\r\ninterpretation under the rule of lenity)   and the government made\r\nno such showing.\r\nWe start with the appellant's fact-based contention.  Our\r\nstandard of review is familiar:  an appellate court reviews a\r\ndistrict court's factual determinations under the sentencing\r\nguidelines for clear error.  See United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d\r\n51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nIn computing a defendant's guideline sentencing range,\r\nthe sentencing judge is entitled to rely on trial testimony.  SeeUnited States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990).  In this\r\ncase, Colon testified that he told Nunez he wanted the pipe bombs\r\nfor use against a rival gang.  The district court apparently\r\ncredited Colon's account.  We believe that this testimony  \r\nsubstantiated by Nunez's post-arrest admission that he had\r\nmanufactured the pipe bombs because he \"wanted to hurt gangs\"  \r\nadequately grounds Judge Freedman's finding that Nunez had \"reason\r\nto believe\" the bombs would be used for the purpose of committing\r\nanother felony.  Thus, the appellant's fact-based challenge\r\ncrumbles.\r\nThe appellant's \"impossibility\" theory fares no better. \r\nSection 2K2.1(b)(5) focuses on a defendant's state of mind, not on\r\nthe feasibility of the venture that he proposes to undertake.  SeeUnited States v. Gilmore, 60 F.3d 392, 393-94 (7th Cir. 1995)\r\n(discussing mental state necessary to trigger section 2K2.1(b)(5)). \r\nConsequently, the fact that Nunez delivered the bombs as part of a\r\npolice-controlled undercover operation is legally irrelevant.\r\nThis leaves us with the appellant's statutory arguments. \r\nWe review a district court's construction of a sentencing guideline\r\nde novo, see United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 9 n.1 (1st Cir.\r\n1997), and its application of a sentencing guideline to the facts\r\nin the same manner, see United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 41 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).\r\nThe appellant argues vociferously that the government\r\nmust show that the defendant knew, intended, or had reason to\r\nbelieve that the explosive device would be used in connection with\r\nsome specific felony offense.  We do not agree.  The plain language\r\nof the provision encompasses other felonies generally, without the\r\nadditional requirement that some specific offense be identified. \r\nAccord United States v. Cutler, 36 F.3d 406, 408 (4th Cir. 1994). \r\nSentencing guidelines, like statutes, should be read as they are\r\nwritten.  Therefore, we decline to insert into this guideline an\r\nunwritten limitation plucked from thin air.  That ends the matter: \r\nas USSG 2K2.1(b)(5) is unambiguous, the rule of lenity has no\r\nbearing.  See Cutler, 36 F.3d at 408; see also United States v.\r\nNippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997), cert.denied. 118 S. Ct. 865 (1998).\r\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  The government neither behaved\r\noutrageously nor otherwise committed misconduct requiring dismissal\r\nof the indictment.  Because Nunez was charged appropriately, tried\r\nfairly, and punished lawfully, his conviction and sentence must be\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

An enhancement under section 2K2.1(b)(5) lies if the defendant possessed a firearm or explosive \"with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used in or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\"   The appellant offers a host of reasons to support his claim that the district court improperly invoked this guideline.  These reasons boil down to three general contentions, namely, (1) that the government adduced no evidence to show that Nunez possessed the requisite guilty knowledge;  (2) that there was no possible chance that the bombs would be used or possessed in connection with a felony because they were purchased by the government during an undercover operation; and (3) that the guideline provision requires a showing that the bombs were to be used to perpetrate a specific crime (or, if not, the provision is at least ambiguous in this respect, thus entitling Nunez to the benefit of a \"specific crime\" interpretation under the rule of lenity)--and the government made no such showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the appellant's fact-based contention.

See United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990).  In this case, Colon testified that he told Nunez he wanted the pipe bombs for use against a rival gang.  The district court apparently credited Colon's account.  We believe that this testimony--substantiated by Nunez's post-arrest admission that he had manufactured the pipe bombs because he \"wanted to hurt gangs\"--adequately grounds Judge Freedman's finding that Nunez had \"reason to believe\" the bombs would be used for the purpose of committing another felony.

We do not agree.  The plain language of the provision encompasses other felonies generally, without the additional requirement that some specific offense be identified.  Accord United States v. Cutler, 36 F.3d 406, 408 (4th Cir.1994).  Sentencing guidelines, like statutes, should be read as they are written.  Therefore, we decline to insert into this guideline an unwritten limitation plucked from thin air.  That ends the matter:  as USSG &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) is unambiguous, the rule of lenity has no bearing.  See Cutler, 36 F.3d at 408;  see also United States v. Nippon Paper Indus.

Secondarily, he mounts claims of trial and sentencing error.  Because Nunez's arguments are unpersuasive, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While conducting an ongoing investigation into gang activity in western Massachusetts, the authorities learned of a person called \"the Mexican,\" who had a reputation for building and distributing pipe bombs in exchange for drugs or money.  The government concluded that Nunez was this individual and focused its probe accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the authorities' instigation, a cooperating drug dealer, Jose Colon, approached Nunez and told him that he \"needed [some pipe bombs] to blow up [a rival gang].\"  Nunez acquiesced, but said that the task required raw materials.  Colon, Nunez, and an undercover officer thereafter drove to Connecticut and filled Nunez's shopping list at government expense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nunez constructed the pipe bombs and Colon purchased nine of them for cash.  Nunez, literally and figuratively, was hoist by his own petard.  After he had been arrested and advised of his rights, he proclaimed that, although \"he didn't mean to hurt anyone,\" the pipe bombs were intended \"for the gangs\" because he \"didn't like the gangs and wanted to hurt gangs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case at trial was compelling.  It featured Colon's testimony and tape-recordings of certain conversations.  It also included the testimony of an FBI explosives expert to the effect that all nine pipe bombs were \"destructive device[s]\" as defined in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(f).  The jury convicted Nunez of possessing unregistered destructive devices, transferring such devices, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) &amp; (e) (1994);  18 U.S.C. &#167;   922(g)(1) (1994).  At the disposition hearing, Judge Freedman sentenced Nunez to a 120-month prison term.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant advances three separate and distinct assignments of error.  We deal with each of them in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>A. Government Misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's flagship argument targets the district court's denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of egregious government misconduct.  The question of whether the government committed misconduct so outrageous as to warrant the dismissal of charges is a question of law which we review de novo.  See United States v. Hudson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597159\"><a href=\"/opinion/597159/united-states-v-thomas-hudson/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 163 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that it survives at all, the legal doctrine on which the appellant's argument hinges is of extremely limited application.  The doctrine holds that the government commits outrageous misconduct when it behaves in a manner that violates \"fundamental fairness\" and \"shock[s] ... the universal sense of justice.\"  United States v. Santana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654192\"><a href=\"/opinion/654192/united-states-v-rafael-santana-and-francis-fuentes/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Courts occasionally have applied (or talked about applying) the doctrine in instances in which the government subjects a suspect to intolerable abuses and those in which \"law enforcement personnel become so overinvolved in a felonious venture that they can fairly be said either to have created the crime or to have coerced the defendant's participation in it.\"  Id. at 4-5 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The appellant depicts his case as involving both prototypes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no tidy test to determine whether government conduct qualifies as outrageous.  Thus, we have acknowledged that \"outrageousness, by its nature, requires an ad hoc determination.\"  Id. at 6. Here, however, the appellant's trial counsel raised the point only in a pretrial motion, bereft of any particularized evidentiary submissions and unaccompanied by a request for a voir dire or other evidentiary hearing.  Consequently, the motion lacked a sufficient factual predicate, and the district court's denial of it hardly can be faulted.  See id.  (explaining that \"[t]he calculus [for determining the legitimacy of a claim of outrageous government misconduct] must be rooted in the record\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we disposed to accept the belated factual proffer contained in Nunez's appellate brief--a proffer which loosely incorporates the trial evidence, but laces that evidence with considerable conjecture--the result would be the same.  The appellant complains that the government's pursuit of him involved the decision to use a drug dealer to negotiate with a drug addict, and that the relationship between dealer and addict is so one-sided as to undermine the independence of his decision to fill Colon's request for pipe bombs.  Passing the fact that Colon was at most an occasional supplier of drugs to Nunez (who had other, more reliable sources), this version of an addiction defense cannot stand.  See, e.g., United States v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610706\"><a href=\"/opinion/610706/united-states-v-chris-d-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 817-18 (10th Cir.1993);  United States v.

Moore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"314281\"><a href=\"/opinion/314281/united-states-v-raymond-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1139</span></a></span>, 1146 (D.C.Cir.1973) (en banc);  cf.  United States v. Ford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551514\"><a href=\"/opinion/551514/united-states-v-william-george-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1343</span></a></span>, 1348-50 (8th Cir.1990).  To put matters bluntly, the appellant cannot strip himself of all moral agency by virtue of his drug addiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nunez also maintains that the government acted outrageously by becoming overinvolved in the conception and commission of the crime.  This asseveration rests on facts such as Colon's request for the pipe bombs, the escort afforded to Nunez when he purchased the raw materials, and the fact that the government fronted the cost.  The record does not bear out the claim that this conduct crossed the line of impropriety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government had information from multiple sources that Nunez previously had sold pipe bombs to gang members.  The government therefore did not create the crime, but, rather, conducted a conventional undercover \"sting\" operation in an attempt to confirm or refute this information.  See, e.g., United States v. Matiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195125\"><a href=\"/opinion/195125/united-states-v-esperanza-matiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Panitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544607\"><a href=\"/opinion/544607/united-states-v-solomon-philip-panitz-united-states-of-america-v-andrew/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990);  United States v.

The jury rejected Nunez's entrapment defense at trial, and there is simply no credible evidence either that Nunez was an unready participant or that the government coerced him in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly.  Although an occasional early case espoused the doctrine of outrageous government misconduct, we recently described it as \"moribund\" and predicted that a defense premised upon it will rarely, if ever, bear fruit.  Santana, 6 F.3d at 4 (reviewing the doctrine's history and concluding that \"[t]he banner of outrageous misconduct is often raised but seldom saluted\").  The instant case discloses no significant evidence of government misconduct and clearly falls within this general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it.  Thus, the appellant's claim fails on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>B. The Prosecutor's Summation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next posits that the prosecutor's summation exceeded the bounds of permissible argument and thus violated due process.  He cites twenty-two allegedly improper remarks.  As his trial counsel did not object contemporaneously to any of these statements, our review is for plain error.  See United States v. Mejia-Lozano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494593\"><a href=\"/opinion/494593/united-states-v-martha-mejia-lozano/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 272 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).

McDonald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 n. 1 (1st Cir.1997), and its application of a sentencing guideline to the facts in the same manner, see United States v. Muniz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195951\"><a href=\"/opinion/195951/united-states-v-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues vociferously that the government must show that the defendant knew, intended, or had reason to believe that the explosive device would be used in connection with some specific felony offense.  We do not agree.  The plain language of the provision encompasses other felonies generally, without the additional requirement that some specific offense be identified.  Accord United States v. Cutler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678826\"><a href=\"/opinion/678826/united-states-v-otis-cutler-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 408 (4th Cir.1994).  Sentencing guidelines, like statutes, should be read as they are written.  Therefore, we decline to insert into this guideline an unwritten limitation plucked from thin air.  That ends the matter:  as USSG &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) is unambiguous, the rule of lenity has no bearing.  See Cutler, 36 F.3d at 408;  see also United States v. Nippon Paper Indus.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738221\"><a href=\"/opinion/738221/united-states-v-nippon-paper-industries-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1997), cert. denied.  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></span> (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The government neither behaved outrageously nor otherwise committed misconduct requiring dismissal of the indictment.  Because Nunez was charged appropriately, tried fairly, and punished lawfully, his conviction and sentence must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
