Speer, Committee for Public Counsel Services,\r\nPublic Defender Division, was on brief, for petitioner.\r\nSusanne Levsen, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Bureau,\r\nwith whom Scott Harshbarger, Attorney General, was on brief, for\r\nrespondents.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                                               TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant Pedro F.\r\nTorres (\"Torres\") filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  2254.  The sole issue before us is whether the\r\njury instructions in Torres's state court murder trial violated his\r\ndue process rights by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof. \r\nLike the district court before us, we find that the jury\r\ninstructions did not violate Torres's due process rights under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment, and we therefore affirm the district court's\r\ndismissal of the petition for writ of habeas corpus.\r\n                       BACKGROUND\r\n    The events that led to the murder charge in this case are\r\ndetailed in the prior decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\nMassachusetts (\"SJC\").  See Commonwealth v. Torres, 651 N.E.2d 360\r\n(Mass. 1995).  In brief, during the evening of December 14, 1990,\r\nthe defendant and his sister went to visit an individual who\r\nresided in a second-floor apartment over the Harborview Caf, a bar\r\nlocated in New Bedford.  Shortly after midnight, the defendant's\r\nsister and another woman went downstairs to purchase beer at the\r\nbar.  When the sister returned, she told the defendant that the\r\nvictim, Jos Fernndes, had bothered her while she was in the bar.\r\nThe defendant then entered the bar and confronted the victim.  The\r\ntwo men stepped outside and began to argue about improper remarks\r\nthe victim allegedly had made to the defendant's sister.  After the\r\ndefendant pushed him, Fernndes pulled a knife from his rear\r\npocket, placed it on the ground, and challenged the defendant to\r\nfight \"man to man.\"  The defendant indicated that he did not want\r\nto fight.  Fernndes, the defendant, and his sister then returned\r\nto the bar.\r\n    Shortly thereafter, Fernndes displayed the knife again\r\nand started to threaten the defendant's sister.  The bartender\r\nyelled at Fernndes to stop, and Fernndes put away the knife.  The\r\ndefendant then pulled out a gun and fired three shots at Fernndes. \r\nThe first shot, fired from a range of six to eighteen inches, hit\r\nthe victim in the face.  The other two shots entered the victim's\r\nback.  When the defendant realized that the bartender had\r\ntelephoned the police, he ran out of the bar.  He and his sister\r\ntelephoned a taxi and returned home, where the defendant ate dinner\r\nand went to sleep.\r\n    Later that morning, an officer with the New Bedford\r\npolice department arrested the defendant and transported him to the\r\npolice station.  On route to the station, the defendant asked the\r\nofficer whether the victim had died.  When the officer did not\r\nrespond, the defendant asked whether the victim had \"died right\r\naway, or did he talk to you cops.\"  The officer advised the\r\ndefendant of his Miranda rights and told him that if he wished to\r\nspeak with the officer, he could do so at the police station.  The\r\ndefendant then stated that he wished to speak with the officer\r\nabout the incident, and that the victim \"had no respect and\r\ndeserved what he got.\"  At the station, the officer booked the\r\ndefendant and again advised him of his Miranda rights.  The\r\ndefendant then gave a statement.  He claimed that the victim had a\r\nknife when the two men had been standing outside the bar.  Once\r\ninside the bar, the defendant heard Fernndes threaten his sister. \r\nThe sister shoved the victim, and the victim responded by pushing\r\nher in the face with his hand.  At this point, the defendant walked\r\nover to Fernndes and shot him in the face.  When Fernndes tried\r\nto run away, the defendant pursued him and shot him twice in the\r\nback.  The defendant agreed to repeat this statement and have it\r\nvideotaped.  The videotape was admitted in evidence and viewed by\r\nthe jury.\r\n    The defense offered no evidence, conceding the homicide\r\nand defending solely on a theory of manslaughter, rather than\r\nmurder in the first degree by deliberate premeditation, as the\r\nprosecution claimed.  The jury convicted the defendant of\r\npremeditated murder in the first degree, and the trial judge\r\nsentenced him to life imprisonment.\r\n    Torres appealed, asserting several alleged errors in the\r\njudge's instructions to the jury.  The Supreme Judicial Court \r\naffirmed his conviction,  see id., and Torres brought this petition\r\nfor writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of\r\nMassachusetts.  The district court found that the jury instructions\r\ndid not violate Torres' due process rights.  However, the district\r\ncourt issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether\r\nthe trial judge's jury instructions improperly shifted the burden\r\nof proof.  This appeal ensued.                            DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Procedural Default\r\n    Federal habeas review is precluded if the state court\r\nreached its decision on an adequate and independent state-law\r\nground when affirming Torres's conviction.  See Burks v. DuBois, 55\r\nF.3d 712, 716 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S.\r\n722, 729 (1991); Harris v. DuBois, 489 U.S. 255 (1989); and Ortizv. DuBois, 19 F.3d 708, 714 (1st Cir. 1994)).  One such ground in\r\nthis case may be Massachusetts' \"contemporaneous objection\" rule. \r\nCommonwealth v. Fluker, 385 N.E.2d 256 (Mass. 1979) (failure to\r\nobject specifically to trial deficiency \"precludes appellate\r\nreview\");  see also McLaughlin v. Gabriel, 726 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir.\r\n1984) (in Massachusetts, \"defendant normally cannot challenge an\r\nallegedly defective charge unless he has objected to the specific\r\ninstruction at trial\").  Torres did not object to the giving of the\r\ncontested jury instruction at trial.\r\n    We normally find a waiver of this state ground where the\r\nstate courts, after reviewing a conviction, affirm it, not on the\r\nbasis of the \"contemporaneous objection rule,\" but on the basis of\r\ntheir own analysis of federal law.  See Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d\r\n1197, 1200 (1st Cir. 1987) (waiver only occurs if court reaches \r\n\"gist of the federal constitutional question\"); McCown v. Callahan,\r\n726 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1984) (waiver if Supreme Judicial Court\r\nconducts \"detailed examination of federal law and federal cases\r\n. . . necessary to decide a specific question of federal law\"). \r\nSometimes it is difficult to determine whether or not the state\r\ncourts have relied on the \"contemporaneous objection rule,\" or on\r\ntheir view of federal law, particularly where, as here, the state\r\nSupreme Judicial Court exercised its special statutory power to\r\nreview verdicts in capital cases, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278,\r\n33E, in order to determine whether there was a \"substantial risk\r\nof a miscarriage of justice.\"  This special discretionary review,\r\nin a sense, always overlooks a failure to raise an objection at\r\ntrial, but it does so only in the context of applying a specially\r\nstringent standard of review.  See  Doucette v. Vose, 842 F.2d 538,\r\n539 (1st Cir. 1988).  We have held that the mere fact that the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court engages in such review does not\r\nautomatically waive -- for federal habeas purposes -- its \"adequate\r\nstate  ground.\"  Id.  Nonetheless, if, in the course of such\r\nreview, the Supreme Judicial Court makes reasonably clear that its\r\nreasons for affirming a conviction rest upon its view of federal\r\nlaw, we will find a waiver.  See id.  That is the case here.  In\r\nour view, the Supreme Judicial Court reached, and decided, the\r\nfederal issue.\r\n    Because it may be useful for the reader to see the kind\r\nof state court discussion that will lead us to find a waiver, and\r\nbecause the discussion clearly explains the federal law issue, we\r\nset forth that discussion in full:\r\n    c. Reasonable provocation instruction.  The\r\n    defendant next asserts that, because the judge\r\n    mingled correct with incorrect instructions\r\n    regarding the mitigating circumstance of heat\r\n    of passion, without any explanation of the\r\n    \"constitutionally infirm\" instructions, the\r\n    portion of the charge addressing \"reasonable\r\n    provocation\" denied the defendant his\r\n    Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.  We\r\n    agree that the judge misstated the law when he\r\n    instructed that \"in order to prove the\r\n    defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter,\r\n    the Commonwealth must prove . . . [that] the\r\n    defendant injured the victim as a result of a\r\n    sudden combat or in the heat of passion.\"\r\n    Nevertheless, we conclude that the error did\r\n    not violate the  defendant's Federal due\r\n    process rights, nor did it create a\r\n    substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of\r\n    justice.\r\n\n  The due process clause of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\r\n\"protects the accused against conviction\r\nexcept upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of\r\nevery fact necessary to constitute the crime\r\nwith which he is charged.\"  Francis v.\r\nFranklin, 471 U.S. 307, 313 (1985), quoting In\r\nre Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970).  This\r\nfundamental principle prohibits a judge from\r\nusing \"evidentiary presumptions in a jury\r\ncharge that have the effect of relieving the\r\nState of its burden of persuasion beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt of every essential element of\r\na crime.\" Francis v. Franklin, supra.  See\r\nSandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 520-524\r\n(1979); Commonwealth v. Lykus, 406 Mass. 135,\r\n143 (1989).  In order to determine whether a\r\njury instruction fails to meet constitutional\r\nmuster, a reviewing court first must focus on\r\nthe specific language challenged.  California\r\nv. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 541 (1987), citing\r\nFrancis v. Franklin, supra at 315.  If that\r\nlanguage, considered in isolation, \"could\r\nreasonably have been understood as creating a\r\npresumption that relieves the State of its\r\nburden of persuasion on an element of an\r\noffense,\" Francis v. Franklin, supra, then the\r\nreviewing court must examine the charge as a\r\nwhole to see if the entire charge delivered a\r\ncorrect interpretation of the law.  SeeCalifornia v. Brown, supra at 541.  See alsoBoyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 378 (1990),\r\nquoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141 (1973)\r\n(\"we accept at the outset the well-established\r\nproposition that a single instruction to a\r\njury may not be judged in artificial\r\nisolation, but must be viewed in the context\r\nof the  overall charge\").\r\n\n  The defendant cites Francis v. Franklin,\r\nsupra, in support of his claim.  In that case,\r\nthe United States Supreme Court stated that\r\n\"[l]anguage that merely contradicts and does\r\nnot explain a constitutionally infirm\r\ninstruction will not suffice to absolve the\r\ninfirmity\" because \"[a] reviewing court has no\r\nway of knowing which of the two irreconcilable\r\ninstructions the jurors applied in reaching\r\ntheir verdict\" (footnote omitted).  Id. at\r\n322.  Francis v. Franklin does not assist the\r\ndefendant for two reasons.  First, although,\r\nat one point, the judge misstated the\r\nCommonwealth's burden, we do not believe that\r\nthe error had \"the effect of relieving the\r\n[Commonwealth] of its burden of persuasion\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of every essential\r\nelement of [the] crime [charged],\" id. at 313,\r\nnor did it shift any burden to the defendant. \r\nSee Sandstrom v. Montana, supra at 520-524. \r\nThe judge's misstatement, therefore, was not\r\n\"constitutionally infirm.\"  Second, even if we\r\nwere to conclude that the instruction was\r\nconstitutionally infirm, Francis v. Franklinaccepts the general principle that such an\r\ninstruction should be considered in the\r\ncontext of the entire charge.  See Estelle v.McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991), quoting Cuppv. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 147 (1973) \r\n(\"instruction 'may not be judged in artificial\r\nisolation,' but must be  considered in the\r\ncontext of the instructions as a whole\");\r\nCommonwealth v. Repoza, 400 Mass. 516, 519,\r\ncert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987) (\"jury\r\ninstructions are not to be viewed in isolation\r\nbut rather in the context of the charge as a\r\nwhole\").  Reviewing the whole charge,\r\nincluding the judge's emphatic and repeated\r\nstatements that only the Commonwealth--and\r\nnever the defendant--bore any burden, we\r\nbelieve that the jury could not have concluded\r\nthat the judge's misstatement created an\r\nunconstitutional presumption relieving the\r\nState of its burden of persuasion beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt of every element of\r\ndeliberately premeditated murder in the first\r\ndegree. The instruction did not violate the\r\ndefendant's Federal due process rights, nor\r\ndid it create a substantial likelihood of a\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\r\n\nTorres, 651 N.E.2d at 366-68 (footnotes in original).\r\nAlthough state law is cited in this discussion, federal\r\ncase law is preeminent.  Because the resolution of Torres's claim\r\nwas not based on an adequate and independent state-law ground, but\r\nrather on federal constitutional law, his claim is not in\r\nprocedural default.\r\nII.  Clearly Established Federal Law\r\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\r\n1996, Pub. L. 104-132, Title I,  104, 110 Stat. 1219, governs the\r\nissuance of writs of habeas corpus.  It states in part that: \r\n(d) [a]n application for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus on behalf of a person in custody\r\npursuant to the judgment of a State court\r\nshall not be granted with respect to any claim\r\nthat was adjudicated on the merits in State\r\ncourt proceedings unless the adjudication of\r\nthe claim-- \r\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\r\nto, or involved an unreasonable application\r\nof, clearly established Federal law, as\r\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates;  or \r\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on\r\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in\r\nlight of the evidence presented in the State\r\ncourt proceeding.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2254(d).\r\nFirst, we must determine whether \"the Supreme Court has\r\nprescribed a rule that governs the petitioner's claim.\"  Ortiz v.\r\nDuBois, 145 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir. 1998).  If so, we analyze whether\r\nthe state court decision is \"contrary to\" that prescribed rule. \r\nSee id.  \"To obtain relief . . . [the] petitioner must show that\r\nSupreme Court precedent requires an outcome contrary to that\r\nreached by the relevant state court.\"  Id. at 24-25.  Because we\r\nagree with the parties that Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307\r\n(1985), provides the governing rule, our discussion centers on that\r\nSupreme Court case.\r\nIn Franklin, the Supreme Court evaluated jury\r\ninstructions stating that: (1) \"[t]he acts of a person of sound\r\nmind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person's\r\nwill, but the presumption may be rebutted,\" id. at 309, and (2)\r\n\"[a] person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the\r\nnatural and probable consequences of his acts but the presumption\r\nmay be rebutted.\" Id.  At issue was \"whether these instructions,\r\nwhen read in the context of a jury charge as a whole, violate the\r\nFourteenth Amendment's requirement that the State prove every\r\nelement of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id. \r\nBecause these jury instructions directed \"the jury to presume an\r\nessential element of the offense,\" id. at 316, they undermined \"the\r\nfactfinder's responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by\r\nthe State to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \r\nId. \r\nHere, Torres complains that the judge's instruction on\r\nmitigating circumstances created an evidentiary presumption that\r\nhad the effect of relieving the Commonwealth of its burden to prove\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime charged against\r\nthe petitioner.  The contested instruction is as follows:\r\nThe crime of manslaughter involves certain\r\nmitigating circumstances which I will outline\r\nfor you, and these mitigating circumstances,\r\nif they exist to your satisfaction, operate to\r\nnegate the element of malice.\r\n\n(Emphasis added).  As demonstrated in the quotation from the SJC's\r\nopinion, see supra at 8, the state court recognized that this\r\ninstruction was a misstatement of the law, but the instruction did\r\nnot constitute error under Franklin because: (1) it did not relieve\r\nthe Commonwealth of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each element\r\nof the offense charged; and (2) it did not inappropriately shift\r\nany burden of proof to the petitioner.  We agree with the district\r\ncourt in this case that \"[t]he instruction merely pointed out that\r\nthe jury could find the lesser included offense of manslaughter if\r\nthe jury found, in the evidence, circumstances which mitigated one\r\nof the elements of murder.\"  Consequently, the petitioner has\r\nfailed to show that Supreme Court precedent requires an outcome\r\ncontrary to that reached by the Supreme Judicial Court.\r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\r\n",

In brief, during the evening of December 14, 1990,\r\nthe defendant and his sister went to visit an individual who\r\nresided in a second-floor apartment over the Harborview Caf, a bar\r\nlocated in New Bedford.  Shortly after midnight, the defendant's\r\nsister and another woman went downstairs to purchase beer at the\r\nbar.

The videotape was admitted in evidence and viewed by\r\nthe jury.\r\n    The defense offered no evidence, conceding the homicide\r\nand defending solely on a theory of manslaughter, rather than\r\nmurder in the first degree by deliberate premeditation, as the\r\nprosecution claimed.  The jury convicted the defendant of\r\npremeditated murder in the first degree, and the trial judge\r\nsentenced him to life imprisonment.\r\n    Torres appealed, asserting several alleged errors in the\r\njudge's instructions to the jury.  The Supreme Judicial Court \r\naffirmed his conviction,  see id., and Torres brought this petition\r\nfor writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of\r\nMassachusetts.  The district court found that the jury instructions\r\ndid not violate Torres' due process rights.  However, the district\r\ncourt issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether\r\nthe trial judge's jury instructions improperly shifted the burden\r\nof proof.  This appeal ensued.                            DISCUSSION\r\nI.

Gen. Laws ch. 278,\r\n33E, in order to determine whether there was a \"substantial risk\r\nof a miscarriage of justice.\"  This special discretionary review,\r\nin a sense, always overlooks a failure to raise an objection at\r\ntrial, but it does so only in the context of applying a specially\r\nstringent standard of review.  See  Doucette v. Vose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503430\"><a href=\"/opinion/503430/william-h-doucette-jr-v-george-vose/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n539 (1st Cir. 1988).  We have held that the mere fact that the\r\nSupreme Judicial Court engages in such review does not\r\nautomatically waive -- for federal habeas purposes -- its \"adequate\r\nstate  ground.\"  Id.  Nonetheless, if, in the course of such\r\nreview, the Supreme Judicial Court makes reasonably clear that its\r\nreasons for affirming a conviction rest upon its view of federal\r\nlaw, we will find a waiver.  See id.  That is the case here.  In\r\nour view, the Supreme Judicial Court reached, and decided, the\r\nfederal issue.\r\n    Because it may be useful for the reader to see the kind\r\nof state court discussion that will lead us to find a waiver, and\r\nbecause the discussion clearly explains the federal law issue, we\r\nset forth that discussion in full:\r\n    c. Reasonable provocation instruction.  The\r\n    defendant next asserts that, because the judge\r\n    mingled correct with incorrect instructions\r\n    regarding the mitigating circumstance of heat\r\n    of passion, without any explanation of the\r\n    \"constitutionally infirm\" instructions, the\r\n    portion of the charge addressing \"reasonable\r\n    provocation\" denied the defendant his\r\n    Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.  We\r\n    agree that the judge misstated the law when he\r\n    instructed that \"in order to prove the\r\n    defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter,\r\n    the Commonwealth must prove . . . [that] the\r\n    defendant injured the victim as a result of a\r\n    sudden combat or in the heat of passion.\"\r\n    Nevertheless, we conclude that the error did\r\n    not violate the  defendant's Federal due\r\n    process rights, nor did it create a\r\n    substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of\r\n    justice.\r\n\n  The due process clause of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution\r\n\"protects the accused against conviction\r\nexcept upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of\r\nevery fact necessary to constitute the crime\r\nwith which he is charged.\"  Francis v.\r\nFranklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111418\"><a href=\"/opinion/111418/francis-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (1985), quoting In\r\nre Winship, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (1970).  This\r\nfundamental principle prohibits a judge from\r\nusing \"evidentiary presumptions in a jury\r\ncharge that have the effect of relieving the\r\nState of its burden of persuasion beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt of every essential element of\r\na crime.\" Francis v.

In order to determine whether a\r\njury instruction fails to meet constitutional\r\nmuster, a reviewing court first must focus on\r\nthe specific language challenged.  California\r\nv.

Franklin,\r\nsupra, in support of his claim.  In that case,\r\nthe United States Supreme Court stated that\r\n\"[l]anguage that merely contradicts and does\r\nnot explain a constitutionally infirm\r\ninstruction will not suffice to absolve the\r\ninfirmity\" because \"[a] reviewing court has no\r\nway of knowing which of the two irreconcilable\r\ninstructions the jurors applied in reaching\r\ntheir verdict\" (footnote omitted).  Id. at\r\n322.  Francis v. Franklin does not assist the\r\ndefendant for two reasons.  First, although,\r\nat one point, the judge misstated the\r\nCommonwealth's burden, we do not believe that\r\nthe error had \"the effect of relieving the\r\n[Commonwealth] of its burden of persuasion\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of every essential\r\nelement of [the] crime [charged],\" id. at 313,\r\nnor did it shift any burden to the defendant. \r\nSee Sandstrom v. Montana, supra at 520-524. \r\nThe judge's misstatement, therefore, was not\r\n\"constitutionally infirm.\"  Second, even if we\r\nwere to conclude that the instruction was\r\nconstitutionally infirm, Francis v. Franklinaccepts the general principle that such an\r\ninstruction should be considered in the\r\ncontext of the entire charge.  See Estelle v.McGuire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112660\"><a href=\"/opinion/112660/estelle-v-mcguire/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1991), quoting Cuppv.

Reviewing the whole charge,\r\nincluding the judge's emphatic and repeated\r\nstatements that only the Commonwealth--and\r\nnever the defendant--bore any burden, we\r\nbelieve that the jury could not have concluded\r\nthat the judge's misstatement created an\r\nunconstitutional presumption relieving the\r\nState of its burden of persuasion beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt of every element of\r\ndeliberately premeditated murder in the first\r\ndegree. The instruction did not violate the\r\ndefendant's Federal due process rights, nor\r\ndid it create a substantial likelihood of a\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\r\n\nTorres, 651 N.E.2d at 366-68 (footnotes in original).\r\nAlthough state law is cited in this discussion, federal\r\ncase law is preeminent.  Because the resolution of Torres's claim\r\nwas not based on an adequate and independent state-law ground, but\r\nrather on federal constitutional law, his claim is not in\r\nprocedural default.\r\nII.  Clearly Established Federal Law\r\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\r\n1996, Pub. L. 104-132, Title I,  104, 110 Stat. 1219, governs the\r\nissuance of writs of habeas corpus.  It states in part that: \r\n(d) [a]n application for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus on behalf of a person in custody\r\npursuant to the judgment of a State court\r\nshall not be granted with respect to any claim\r\nthat was adjudicated on the merits in State\r\ncourt proceedings unless the adjudication of\r\nthe claim-- \r\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\r\nto, or involved an unreasonable application\r\nof, clearly established Federal law, as\r\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates;  or \r\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on\r\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in\r\nlight of the evidence presented in the State\r\ncourt proceeding.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2254(d).\r\nFirst, we must determine whether \"the Supreme Court has\r\nprescribed a rule that governs the petitioner's claim.\"  Ortiz v.\r\nDuBois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197969\"><a href=\"/opinion/197969/obrien-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1st Cir. 1998).  If so, we analyze whether\r\nthe state court decision is \"contrary to\" that prescribed rule. \r\nSee id.  \"To obtain relief . . . [the] petitioner must show that\r\nSupreme Court precedent requires an outcome contrary to that\r\nreached by the relevant state court.\"  Id. at 24-25.  Because we\r\nagree with the parties that Francis v. Franklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111418\"><a href=\"/opinion/111418/francis-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1985), provides the governing rule, our discussion centers on that\r\nSupreme Court case.\r\nIn Franklin, the Supreme Court evaluated jury\r\ninstructions stating that: (1) \"[t]he acts of a person of sound\r\nmind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person's\r\nwill, but the presumption may be rebutted,\" id. at 309, and (2)\r\n\"[a] person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the\r\nnatural and probable consequences of his acts but the presumption\r\nmay be rebutted.\" Id.  At issue was \"whether these instructions,\r\nwhen read in the context of a jury charge as a whole, violate the\r\nFourteenth Amendment's requirement that the State prove every\r\nelement of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id. \r\nBecause these jury instructions directed \"the jury to presume an\r\nessential element of the offense,\" id. at 316, they undermined \"the\r\nfactfinder's responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by\r\nthe State to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \r\nId. \r\nHere, Torres complains that the judge's instruction on\r\nmitigating circumstances created an evidentiary presumption that\r\nhad the effect of relieving the Commonwealth of its burden to prove\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime charged against\r\nthe petitioner.  The contested instruction is as follows:\r\nThe crime of manslaughter involves certain\r\nmitigating circumstances which I will outline\r\nfor you, and these mitigating circumstances,\r\nif they exist to your satisfaction, operate to\r\nnegate the element of malice.\r\n\n(Emphasis added).  As demonstrated in the quotation from the SJC's\r\nopinion, see supra at 8, the state court recognized that this\r\ninstruction was a misstatement of the law, but the instruction did\r\nnot constitute error under Franklin because: (1) it did not relieve\r\nthe Commonwealth of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each element\r\nof the offense charged; and (2) it did not inappropriately shift\r\nany burden of proof to the petitioner.  We agree with the district\r\ncourt in this case that \"[t]he instruction merely pointed out that\r\nthe jury could find the lesser included offense of manslaughter if\r\nthe jury found, in the evidence, circumstances which mitigated one\r\nof the elements of murder.\"  Consequently, the petitioner has\r\nfailed to show that Supreme Court precedent requires an outcome\r\ncontrary to that reached by the Supreme Judicial Court.\r\n                       CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\r\n</pre>",
