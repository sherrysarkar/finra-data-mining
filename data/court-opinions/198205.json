After carefully reviewing the parties'\r\nbriefs and the record, we find that the decision of the\r\nMassachusetts Appeals Court affirming petitioner's conviction\r\nwas not \"contrary to\" the rule set out in Jackson v. Virginia,\r\n443 U.S. 307 (1979), for analyzing sufficiency of the evidence\r\nclaims.  See 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1); O'Brien v. DuBois, 145\r\nF.3d 16, 24, 25 &amp; n.6 (1st Cir. 1998).  We therefore affirm the\r\njudgment of the district court denying petitioner's  2254\r\npetition for essentially the reasons stated in that court's\r\nMemorandum and Order, dated April 8, 1998.\r\n          Affirmed.
