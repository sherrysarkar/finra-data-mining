Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n John P. Crowley III and Hobbins, Gardner, Gardner &amp; Murphy,\r\nLLC on brief for appellant.\r\n\nJuly 31, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the appellant's\r\nbrief, we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial\r\nissue and is appropriate for summary disposition.  See 1st Cir.\r\nLoc. R. 27.1.  Accordingly, we sever this appeal (No. 97-2431)\r\nfrom the other appeals (Nos. 97-2193, 97-2312, 97-2363, and 97-\r\n2432) with which it previously was consolidated.\r\n          We reject appellant's contention that the district\r\ncourt erred in applying the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \r\n2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a dangerous weapon during a drug\r\noffense.  Appellant and his co-conspirator were involved in\r\ndistributing substantial quantities of cocaine; appellant\r\nadmittedly knew that his co-conspirator possessed a gun; and\r\nthe gun was found in appellant's condominium, along with drugs,\r\ncash, and ammunition.  On those facts, the district court did\r\nnot clearly err in applying the enhancement to appellant's\r\nsentence.  See United States v. Bianco, 922 F.2d, 910, 912 (1st\r\nCir. 1991). \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
