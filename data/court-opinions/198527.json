Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Julio C. Padin-Torres on brief pro se.\r\n   Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney General, Guillermo Gil,\r\nUnited States Attorney, Michael F. Hertz, Stephen D. Altman,\r\nDouglas N. Letter, and Michael D. Granston, Attorneys, Civil\r\nDivision, Department of Justice, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 16, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  In 1991, appellant Julio Cesar Padin-\r\nTorres (Padin) pled guilty to three offenses arising out of his\r\noperation of Prudential Mortgage Corporation (Prudential), a\r\nmortgage lending institution participating in the \"mortgage-\r\nbacked securities program\" of the Government National Mortgage\r\nAssociation (GNMA).  See United States v. Padin-Torres, 988\r\nF.2d 280 (1st Cir. 1993).  The government thereafter filed the\r\ninstant action against Padin and Prudential, seeking damages\r\npursuant to, inter alia, the False Claims Act (FCA).  31 U.S.C.\r\n 3729-32.  From an award of summary judgment under the FCA in\r\nthe government's favor, Padin now appeals on a pro se basis. \r\nHaving reviewed his arguments in detail, we summarily affirm.\r\n          Padin has not seriously contested any of the issues\r\naddressed by the magistrate-judge.  For example, he has not\r\nbothered to cite to the key decision supporting the\r\ngovernment's theory of recovery.  United States v. Rivera, 55\r\nF.3d 703 (1st Cir. 1995).  Nor has he challenged the ruling that\r\nthe government's \"statement of material facts\" would be deemed\r\nadmitted because of his noncompliance with a local rule.  See,\r\ne.g., Laracuente v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 891 F.2d 17, 19 (1st\r\nCir. 1989) (endorsing such a ruling).  We find the magistrate-\r\njudge's reasoning to be fully supportable and therefore adopt\r\nthat analysis here.  \r\n          Padin has advanced various other arguments that were\r\nnot presented to the magistrate-judge.  Some (such as whether\r\nthe 1986 amendments to the FCA apply) were first raised before\r\nthe district judge; others (such as whether the action is\r\nbarred on double jeopardy grounds) are being articulated for\r\nthe first time on appeal.  These contentions have thus been\r\nwaived.  See, e.g., Borden v. Secretary of HHS, 836 F.2d 4, 6\r\n(1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (warning that parties must take\r\n\"not only their 'best shot' but all of their shots\" before the\r\nmagistrate-judge) (internal quotation omitted); Malave v.\r\nCarney Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 222 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that\r\n\"except in the most extraordinary circumstances ..., matters\r\nnot raised in the trial court cannot be hawked for the first\r\ntime on appeal\").  No justification has been offered for\r\noverlooking these requirements here.  We find Padin's\r\ncontentions to be without merit in any event.\r\n          Finally, the instant case presents no occasion to\r\nundertake a second review of Padin's criminal conviction.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  The \"emergency\r\ninformative motion\" is denied.\n",
