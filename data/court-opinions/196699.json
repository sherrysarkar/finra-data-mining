Plaintiff-appellant Timothy Davis, an\r                                 \r\n\nemployee of the Massachusetts State Lottery  Commission, sued\r\n\nthe  Commission  and  Daniel  Kinney,  his  supervisor,   for\r\n\nviolation  of civil rights, racial discrimination, infliction\r\n\nof emotional distress, and improper layoff, stemming from his\r\n\ndismissal  by the  Commission  on May  1, 1991.1   Defendants\r\n\nmoved  to dismiss  for failure  to state  a claim  upon which\r\n\nrelief could be granted.   The court granted the  motion, but\r\n\nlater   allowed   plaintiff's  Motion   for  Reconsideration,\r\n\npermitting him to  file an amended  complaint adding a  count\r\n\n(Count  VI)  seeking compensatory  and  punitive damages  for\r\n\nviolation of  his federally  protected rights after  November\r\n\n21, 1991, the date of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1981a(b)(1).   In due course, defendants  moved for summary\r\n\njudgment  on all  claims.   This  motion, also,  was granted,\r\n\nincorporating,  but simply by  reference, the court's earlier\r\n\nMemorandum and Order.  We affirm.\r\n\n           The obligatory appendix  which plaintiff filed for\r\n\nthis  appeal  totally  disregards Federal  Rule  of Appellate\r\n\nProcedure  30.  Except  for a copy  of Count VI,  none of the\r\n\nrequired  items  is present.    Instead  are some  60  pages,\r\n\nlargely  memoranda of law filed in the district court.

Plaintiff  did attach  to his  appellate\r\n\nbrief  the court's Memorandum  and Decision  granting summary\r\n\njudgment for  defendants on Count  VI, but failed  to include\r\n\nanywhere  the court's earlier memorandum dismissing Counts I-\r\n\nV.  FRAP 30(a)(3).\r\n\n          In   granting   defendants'   motion  for   summary\r\n\njudgment, the  court set  the course for  plaintiff's appeal:\r\n\n\"I find that he has failed to meet his burden of establishing\r\n\na prima facie case  of unlawful discrimination after November\r\n\n21,  1991.\"   Plaintiff's filings  do not  enable us  to find\r\n\notherwise.   The (very) occasional references in his brief to\r\n\nalleged  evidence  of  continuing  discrimination  after  his\r\n\nreinstatement consist of cryptic allusions to: \"Davis Depo.\";\r\n\n\"A copy of his  affidavit in this regard is  annexed hereto.\"\r\n\n(It was not); \"Kelly  Depo., p. 38-51\" (also not  included in\r\n\nthe appendix);  and \"Memorandum  in Support of  Opposition to\r\n\nthe Motion for Summary Judgment  . . . pages 12 through  16.\"\r\n\nFinally, in an attempt to rebut the court's exposition of how\r\n\nhe  failed  to  make out  a  prima  facie case  on  Count VI,\r                                                     \r\n\nplaintiff points to his  amended complaint as \"establish[ing]\r\n\ngenuine issues of material fact which render summary judgment\r\n\ninappropriate.\"    He  states  he has  \"detailed  harassment,\r\n\nretaliation,   and  continuing  acts   of  discrimination  by\r\n\nDefendants,\" without  reference to the record  other than the\r\n\ncomplaint.   In lieu, \"Davis  respectfully refers to pages 16\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthrough 19 of his  Memorandum,\" which, as already  noted, was\r\n\nimproperly filed.\r\n\n          All  this is  meaningless.   Fundamentally, without\r\n\nspecific facts,  the non-moving  party  (plaintiff) \"may  not\r\n\nrest upon the  mere allegations of [its]  pleading\" to defend\r\n\nagainst  summary judgment  for the  defendant.
