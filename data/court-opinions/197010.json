Defendant was  convicted of  unlawful\r                                \r\n\nre-entry  by  a deported  alien in  violation  of 8  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1326(b)(2).  He was sentenced  to 100 months imprisonment and\r\n\nfined $500.  On appeal he argues for the first  time that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in imposing the fine where the defendant\r\n\nwas financially  unable to pay.   This  objection not  having\r\n\nbeen made below, it  is reviewed for  plain error only.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States  v.

See  U.S.S.G.     5E1.2(a)(b).    When  a\r                                   \r\n\nsentencing court  finds a  defendant unable  to pay  the fine\r\n\nestablished by the guidelines, \"the court may impose a lesser\r\n\nfine or  waive the  fine.\"  U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(f).   Here, the\r\n\ndistrict court expressly found that, based on the defendant's\r\n\nfinancial  condition, \"the  imposition of  a fine  within the\r\n\nrequired range is  not viable,\"  and, instead  of imposing  a\r\n\nfine  within the  applicable  range of  $10,000 to  $100,000,\r\n\nfined  the defendant $500.   The court was  authorized by the\r\n\nguidelines to do so.  See U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(f).   There was no\r                                     \r\n\nplain error.   Cf. United States v. Rivera, 68 F.3d 5, 8 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1995)  (no  plain  error  in imposing  fine  well  below\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nguideline minimum where  defendant lacked apparent source  of\r\n\nfunds).\r\n\n          Affirmed.
