The Union exercises the collective bargaining authority\r\n\nof its constituent locals in negotiating a CBA, known as a Master\r\n\nAgreement (\"MA\"), with several  multiemployer associations.  Once\r\n\na MA  has been negotiated with  these multiemployer associations,\r\n\nthe Union customarily offers the same MA to other area employers,\r\n\nincluding those which neither  belong to a multiemployer associa-\r\n\ntion nor otherwise participate in negotiations.  These nonpartic-\r\n\nipating employers may bind themselves to the negotiated MA simply\r\n\nby executing what are  known as \"me too\" acceptances,  which give\r\n\nrise to prehire agreements authorized under NLRA   8(f).1 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     129 U.S.C.    158(f) (1994).   See C.E.K.  Indus. Mechanical\r                                                                           \r\nContractors  v. NLRB, 921 F.2d 350, 356-59 (1st Cir. 1990), for a\r                              \r\ndiscussion of prehire agreements.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Curry  was  formed in  1990  and, on  August  23, 1990,\r\n\nbecame a \"me too\" signatory to its first MA with the Union, which\r\n\ncovered Curry's  four unionized  installers but not  its thirteen\r\n\nnonunion  architectural millworkers.   The  Union and  the multi-\r\n\nemployer  associations subsequently  executed  a new  MA for  the\r\n\nperiod August  1, 1991 to  May 31,  1993, which  Curry joined  on\r\n\nAugust 14, 1991.  In  order to foreclose any continuation  of the\r\n\n1991-93 MA beyond its term, in March 1993 the Union advised Curry\r                                    \r\n\nthat it intended to negotiate changes in the next MA.  As the May\r\n\n31, 1993, expiration  date approached, the  Union and the  multi-\r\n\nemployer associations again negotiated a  successor MA    for the\r\n\nperiod June 1, 1993, through September 30, 1997.\r\n\n          On  May 28,  1993,  the Union  offered  the new  MA  to\r\n\napproximately  135  \"me  too\"  employers,  including  Curry,  and\r\n\nadvised:  \"Unless this  office receives a duly authorized  Accep-\r\n\ntance of Agreement by June 4,  1993, your company will be consid-\r                                                                           \r\n\nered not  to  have a  collective  bargaining agreement  with  the\r                                                                           \r\n\n[Union].\"   (emphasis added).   On June 22,  Curry signed, dated,\r                                                    \r\n\nand mailed its Acceptance of Agreement to the Union.  On June 23,\r\n\na  Union  representative  called  Curry to  inquire  whether  its\r\n\nacceptance form had been signed.  Although the  Union representa-\r\n\ntive voiced no concern or objection upon learning that the accep-\r\n\ntance  had been mailed, the  Union never executed  a successor MA\r\n\nwith Curry. \r\n\n          Curry continued to utilize its unionized  installers to\r\n\nperform work throughout June  and July 1993, before the  wage and\r                                                             \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nbenefit  increases under  the new  MA  were to  take effect.   On\r\n\nAugust 2, however, one  day after the wage and  benefit increases\r\n\nunder  the new MA  went into  effect, the  Union refused  to sell\r\n\nCurry  fringe benefit stamps, which  employers include in the pay\r\n\nenvelopes  of  their unionized  employees  as  evidence that  the\r\n\nemployer has  made the  appropriate contributions to  the Union's\r\n\ncollection agency.  As a practical matter, without fringe benefit\r\n\nstamps Curry was unable  to retain the services of  its unionized\r\n\ninstallers.2   Curry complained  to Union  officials but  was ad-\r\n\nvised  that  the Union  believed it  had  no legal  obligation to\r\n\nexecute a new MA with  Curry, and would not do so  unless Curry's\r\n\narchitectural millworkers were unionized. \r\n\n          After Curry  filed  an  unfair  labor  practice  charge\r\n\nagainst the Union, the Board issued a complaint alleging that the\r\n\nUnion had violated NLRA   8(b)(3) by failing to execute and honor\r\n\nthe  terms of  the new MA.3   The  Union denied  the charge.   An\r\n\nadministrative law judge (\"ALJ\") concluded that the May 28 letter\r\n\ndid not  constitute a  binding offer  by the Union,  and, in  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Although the new MA  had not been executed with  four other\r\nemployers  by August  1,  those employers  eventually worked  out\r\ntheir differences with the Union.  In the end, Curry was the only\r\nformer  signatory with  which the  Union did  not enter  into the\r\n1993-97 MA. \r\n\n     3\"It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organiza-\r\ntion or its agents .  . . to refuse to bargain  collectively with\r\nan employer . . . .\"  29 U.S.C.    158(b)(3) (1994).

The\r\n\nALJ found  this language  sufficiently definite to  terminate the\r\n\nright to  accept on  June 4.   The  Board disagreed, because  the\r\n\n\"letter  does not state specifically that execution by June 4 was\r                                              \r\n\na condition of acceptance or that the offer would be withdrawn on\r\n\nthat date.\"   Carpenters Local 33,  316 N.L.R.B. at 369,  1995 WL\r                                           \r\n\n72412, at *4 (emphasis added).  \r\n\n          As the Board supportably determined, there is a signif-\r\n\nicant difference    particularly  in the context of this  case   \r\n\nbetween stating  that the parties  will not be  cooperating under\r\n\nany  CBA unless  Curry accepts  the  Union offer  by  June 4  and\r\n\nstating that  the offer to enter  into a new CBA  expires on June\r                                                      \r\n\n4.4   The Board  reasonably construed  the temporal  reference in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4At oral argument,  the Board conceded that  the Union would\r\nhave had no obligation to enter into a new MA  with Curry had its\r\nMay 28 letter expressly stated that the offer expired on  June 4.\r\nIts concession is consistent  with the Board precedents discussed\r\nabove.  See supra p. 8.\r                           \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthe  Union  offer  to  mean that  the  parties'  labor-management\r\n\nrelations would be subject neither to the MA which expired on May\r\n\n31, nor to the proposed new MA, unless the offer were accepted by\r\n\nCurry by  June 4.  The  Union, on the other  hand, interprets the\r\n\nMay  28 letter as  foreclosing any  subsequent acceptance  of the\r\n\nUnion offer by Curry after June 4.  Although  the language itself\r\n\nmight accommodate either interpretation, depending on the context\r\n\nin which used, it  is the Union interpretation, not  the Board's,\r\n\nwhich  goes somewhat  beyond the  literal purport  of the  offer.\r\n\nThat is to say, in a nutshell, the literal language  of the offer\r\n\nwas ambiguous as to  the consequences of an offeree's  failure to\r                                               \r\n\naccept by June  4.  As to this critical  matter, it was eminently\r\n\nreasonable for the Board  to look to any relevant prior course of\r\n\ndealing among the parties.\r\n\n          2. The Course of Dealing\r                    2. The Course of Dealing\r                                            \r\n\n          Accordingly, the Board examined relevant prior dealings\r\n\namong the  parties with a  view to informing the  language of the\r\n\noffer, especially their prior practice regarding \"late\" acceptan-\r\n\nces.   Their prior practice provided strong support for the Board\r\n\nfinding that the May  28 offer is most faithfully  interpreted as\r\n\nenabling its acceptance for a reasonable time after June 4 unless\r\n\nwithdrawn  by the Union before acceptance.  For example, the 1991\r\n\nUnion offer,  expressed in  virtually identical terms,  stated as\r\n\nfollows:  \"Unless this  office receives a duly authorized  Accep-\r\n\ntance of Agreement by July 31, 1991, your company will be consid-\r\n\nered  to be a company which does not have a collective bargaining\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nagreement with the [Union].\"  Significantly, Curry did not accept\r\n\nthe  1991 offer until August 14, 1991.   Given the parties' prior\r\n\npractice of submitting and  honoring \"late\" acceptances, we think\r\n\nthe Board permissibly  concluded that the Union had not unambigu-\r\n\nously announced in  its May 28 offer an intention  to depart from\r\n\nits prior practice regarding \"late\" acceptances.   \r\n\n          Other  circumstantial evidence lends similar support to\r\n\nthe Board decision.   First, the Union anticipated that  it would\r\n\nreceive  acceptances  before and  after  June  4, and  ultimately\r\n\nexecuted the new  MA with  every employer except  Curry, some  of\r\n\nwhom accepted well after  Curry.  Second, the Union's  efforts to\r\n\ncontact  Curry, and other companies that had not accepted by June\r\n\n4,  likewise indicates that the Union did  not regard June 4 as a\r\n\nfirm deadline for acceptance.  Although the other evidence is not\r\n\nentirely inconsistent  with the  Union contention that  the Curry\r\n\nacceptance was untimely, neither the evidence nor the language of\r\n\nthe  offer clearly indicated  that the Union  offer terminated on\r\n\nJune 4.   In such a case, we  will not disturb the Board's choice\r\n\nbetween  permissible conflicting  views, C.E.K.

Finally, the strong public policy favoring\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreements  as  the  preferred  means  of\r\n\nfostering  industrial  peace appears  well  served  by the  Board\r\n\nruling in the instant context.

The  Union and  the multi-\r\n\nemployer  associations subsequently  executed  a new  MA for  the\r\n\nperiod August  1, 1991 to  May 31,  1993, which  Curry joined  on\r\n\nAugust 14, 1991.  In  order to foreclose any continuation  of the\r\n\n1991-93 MA beyond its term, in March 1993 the Union advised Curry\r                                    \r\n\nthat it intended to negotiate changes in the next MA.  As the May\r\n\n31, 1993, expiration  date approached, the  Union and the  multi-\r\n\nemployer associations again negotiated a  successor MA    for the\r\n\nperiod June 1, 1993, through September 30, 1997.\r\n\n          On  May 28,  1993,  the Union  offered  the new  MA  to\r\n\napproximately  135  \"me  too\"  employers,  including  Curry,  and\r\n\nadvised:  \"Unless this  office receives a duly authorized  Accep-\r\n\ntance of Agreement by June 4,  1993, your company will be consid-\r                                                                           \r\n\nered not  to  have a  collective  bargaining agreement  with  the\r                                                                           \r\n\n[Union].\"   (emphasis added).   On June 22,  Curry signed, dated,\r                                                    \r\n\nand mailed its Acceptance of Agreement to the Union.  On June 23,\r\n\na  Union  representative  called  Curry to  inquire  whether  its\r\n\nacceptance form had been signed.  Although the  Union representa-\r\n\ntive voiced no concern or objection upon learning that the accep-\r\n\ntance  had been mailed, the  Union never executed  a successor MA\r\n\nwith Curry. \r\n\n          Curry continued to utilize its unionized  installers to\r\n\nperform work throughout June  and July 1993, before the  wage and\r                                                             \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nbenefit  increases under  the new  MA  were to  take effect.   On\r\n\nAugust 2, however, one  day after the wage and  benefit increases\r\n\nunder  the new MA  went into  effect, the  Union refused  to sell\r\n\nCurry  fringe benefit stamps, which  employers include in the pay\r\n\nenvelopes  of  their unionized  employees  as  evidence that  the\r\n\nemployer has  made the  appropriate contributions to  the Union's\r\n\ncollection agency.  As a practical matter, without fringe benefit\r\n\nstamps Curry was unable  to retain the services of  its unionized\r\n\ninstallers.2   Curry complained  to Union  officials but  was ad-\r\n\nvised  that  the Union  believed it  had  no legal  obligation to\r\n\nexecute a new MA with  Curry, and would not do so  unless Curry's\r\n\narchitectural millworkers were unionized. \r\n\n          After Curry  filed  an  unfair  labor  practice  charge\r\n\nagainst the Union, the Board issued a complaint alleging that the\r\n\nUnion had violated NLRA   8(b)(3) by failing to execute and honor\r\n\nthe  terms of  the new MA.3   The  Union denied  the charge.   An\r\n\nadministrative law judge (\"ALJ\") concluded that the May 28 letter\r\n\ndid not  constitute a  binding offer  by the Union,  and, in  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Although the new MA  had not been executed with  four other\r\nemployers  by August  1,  those employers  eventually worked  out\r\ntheir differences with the Union.  In the end, Curry was the only\r\nformer  signatory with  which the  Union did  not enter  into the\r\n1993-97 MA. \r\n\n     3\"It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organiza-\r\ntion or its agents .  . . to refuse to bargain  collectively with\r\nan employer . . . .\"  29 U.S.C.    158(b)(3) (1994).

The\r\n\nALJ found  this language  sufficiently definite to  terminate the\r\n\nright to  accept on  June 4.   The  Board disagreed, because  the\r\n\n\"letter  does not state specifically that execution by June 4 was\r                                              \r\n\na condition of acceptance or that the offer would be withdrawn on\r\n\nthat date.\"   Carpenters Local 33,  316 N.L.R.B. at 369,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r                                           \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">72412</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (emphasis added).  \r\n\n          As the Board supportably determined, there is a signif-\r\n\nicant difference    particularly  in the context of this  case   \r\n\nbetween stating  that the parties  will not be  cooperating under\r\n\nany  CBA unless  Curry accepts  the  Union offer  by  June 4  and\r\n\nstating that  the offer to enter  into a new CBA  expires on June\r                                                      \r\n\n4.4   The Board  reasonably construed  the temporal  reference in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4At oral argument,  the Board conceded that  the Union would\r\nhave had no obligation to enter into a new MA  with Curry had its\r\nMay 28 letter expressly stated that the offer expired on  June 4.\r\nIts concession is consistent  with the Board precedents discussed\r\nabove.  See supra p. 8.\r                           \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthe  Union  offer  to  mean that  the  parties'  labor-management\r\n\nrelations would be subject neither to the MA which expired on May\r\n\n31, nor to the proposed new MA, unless the offer were accepted by\r\n\nCurry by  June 4.  The  Union, on the other  hand, interprets the\r\n\nMay  28 letter as  foreclosing any  subsequent acceptance  of the\r\n\nUnion offer by Curry after June 4.  Although  the language itself\r\n\nmight accommodate either interpretation, depending on the context\r\n\nin which used, it  is the Union interpretation, not  the Board's,\r\n\nwhich  goes somewhat  beyond the  literal purport  of the  offer.\r\n\nThat is to say, in a nutshell, the literal language  of the offer\r\n\nwas ambiguous as to  the consequences of an offeree's  failure to\r                                               \r\n\naccept by June  4.  As to this critical  matter, it was eminently\r\n\nreasonable for the Board  to look to any relevant prior course of\r\n\ndealing among the parties.\r\n\n          2. The Course of Dealing\r                    2. The Course of Dealing\r                                            \r\n\n          Accordingly, the Board examined relevant prior dealings\r\n\namong the  parties with a  view to informing the  language of the\r\n\noffer, especially their prior practice regarding \"late\" acceptan-\r\n\nces.   Their prior practice provided strong support for the Board\r\n\nfinding that the May  28 offer is most faithfully  interpreted as\r\n\nenabling its acceptance for a reasonable time after June 4 unless\r\n\nwithdrawn  by the Union before acceptance.  For example, the 1991\r\n\nUnion offer,  expressed in  virtually identical terms,  stated as\r\n\nfollows:  \"Unless this  office receives a duly authorized  Accep-\r\n\ntance of Agreement by July 31, 1991, your company will be consid-\r\n\nered  to be a company which does not have a collective bargaining\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nagreement with the [Union].\"  Significantly, Curry did not accept\r\n\nthe  1991 offer until August 14, 1991.   Given the parties' prior\r\n\npractice of submitting and  honoring \"late\" acceptances, we think\r\n\nthe Board permissibly  concluded that the Union had not unambigu-\r\n\nously announced in  its May 28 offer an intention  to depart from\r\n\nits prior practice regarding \"late\" acceptances.   \r\n\n          Other  circumstantial evidence lends similar support to\r\n\nthe Board decision.   First, the Union anticipated that  it would\r\n\nreceive  acceptances  before and  after  June  4, and  ultimately\r\n\nexecuted the new  MA with  every employer except  Curry, some  of\r\n\nwhom accepted well after  Curry.  Second, the Union's  efforts to\r\n\ncontact  Curry, and other companies that had not accepted by June\r\n\n4,  likewise indicates that the Union did  not regard June 4 as a\r\n\nfirm deadline for acceptance.  Although the other evidence is not\r\n\nentirely inconsistent  with the  Union contention that  the Curry\r\n\nacceptance was untimely, neither the evidence nor the language of\r\n\nthe  offer clearly indicated  that the Union  offer terminated on\r\n\nJune 4.   In such a case, we  will not disturb the Board's choice\r\n\nbetween  permissible conflicting  views, C.E.K.

Finally, the strong public policy favoring\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreements  as  the  preferred  means  of\r\n\nfostering  industrial  peace appears  well  served  by the  Board\r\n\nruling in the instant context.

Viewed  in its  entirety, the  record\r\n\ncontains  substantial evidentiary support  for the interpretation\r\n\nthat the Union offer did  not expire by its own terms on  June 4.\r\n\nMoreover,  viewed in light of  the prior dealings  among the par-\r\n\nties, especially their prior  practice of submitting and honoring\r\n\n\"late\" acceptances, as well as  the strong public policy favoring\r\n\ncollective bargaining, we conclude that the June 22 acceptance by\r\n\nCurry was not time-barred.  \r\n\n          Accordingly, the petition for enforcement is GRANTED.\r                    Accordingly, the petition for enforcement is GRANTED.\r                                                                        \r\n\n          SO ORDERED.\r                    SO ORDERED.\r                              \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n</pre>",
