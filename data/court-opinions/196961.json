Roby,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Appellant Chukwu  Azubuko appeals from\r                                \r\r\n\nthe  dismissal  of  his complaint  pursuant  to  28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1915(d).  We agree with the district court, for the reason it\r\n\ngave,  that appellant cannot premise a right of action on the\r\n\ncriminal statutes he cited.   We affirm the dismissal  of the\r\n\ncomplaint as to  the rest of appellant's  claims, however, on\r\n\nreasons  different than  those  relied upon  by the  district\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n          Appellant asserts  that  his driver's  license  was\r\n\nsuspended  by the  Registrar  of Motor  Vehicles without  due\r\n\nprocess in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In Bell v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBurson,  402 U.S. 535 (1971), the Supreme Court addressed the\r                  \r\n\nquestion in what circumstances a hearing is required prior to\r\n\nthe suspension  of a driver's license.   Georgia law provided\r\n\nfor  the  suspension  of  an  uninsured  motorist's  driver's\r\n\nlicense  when  that  driver  was involved  in  an  automobile\r\n\naccident and could not  post security to cover the  amount of\r\n\ndamages claimed by others in the accident report.  Although a\r\n\nhearing was conducted prior  to the suspension, the uninsured\r\n\nmotorist could not raise  the issue of fault.   Thus, such  a\r\n\nmotorist was required  to post  security or lose  his or  her\r\n\nlicense even though he or she might not have been responsible\r\n\nfor the accident.\r\n\n          The Court held that once a state granted a driver's\r\n\nlicense, it could  not take  it away without  due process  of\r\n\nlaw.   Id. at  539.   It then  held that since  fault was  an\r                      \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nimportant factor in  the decision to  suspend a license,  due\r\n\nprocess  required a  predeprivation hearing  which considered\r\n\nwhether  there  was  a  reasonable  probability  of judgments\r\n\nagainst the driver in the amounts claimed.  Id. at 540-41.\r                                                           \r\n\n          In  the  case  before us,  appellant's  license was\r\n\nsuspended  after a trial in which  appellant was found liable\r\n\nfor  the damages  resulting from  the automobile  accident in\r\n\nwhich he was involved.   Thus, unlike Bell -- where there was\r                                                      \r\n\nno  predeprivation hearing  regarding liability  -- appellant\r              \r\n\nreceived a full, judicial adjudication regarding fault before\r                                                                         \r\n\nhis license  was suspended  for failing to  pay the  judgment\r\n\nrendered at the trial.  Moreover, M.G.L.c. 90,   22A provides\r\n\nfor  another,  administrative  hearing prior  to  the  actual\r\n\nsuspension.   The  Court of  Appeals for  the Fourth  Circuit\r\n\nfound  constitutional a statutory scheme similar    22A  even\r\n\nthough   it   did   not   provide   for   an   administrative\r                                   \r\n\npredeprivation hearing.  See Tomai-Minogue v. State Farm Mut.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAuto. Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 1228, 1230 (4th Cir. 1985).  Thus,  \r                          \r\n\n22A itself appears to provide all that due process requires.\r\n\n          Appellant also  claims that  the suspension  of his\r\n\nlicense impaired his fundamental right to travel and violated\r\n\nthe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   We\r\n\nreject  both  challenges.   See Ross v.  Gunaris, 395 F.Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\n623, 627-28 (D.Mass. 1975)  (  22A does not impede  the right\r\n\nto   travel   because   it   limits  only   one   method   of\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ntransportation, nor does it deny equal  protection of the law\r\n\nto those unable to satisfy a property damage judgment).\r\n\n          For these reasons, appellant's claims, as set forth\r\n\nin  both his  complaint and amended  complaint, are  based on\r\n\n\"indisputably   meritless  theor[ies].\"     See   Neitzke  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nWilliams,  490  U.S.  319, 327  (1989).    As  a result,  the\r                    \r\n\ndistrict court appropriately dismissed the action.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  In\r                                                                    \r\n\nso ruling, we decide only the appeal from district court case\r\n\nNo.  95-CV-10763.  No notice  of appeal was  ever docketed in\r\n\nNo. 95-CV-11661 and, thus, the later case is not before us.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
