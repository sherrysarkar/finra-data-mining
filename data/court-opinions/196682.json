We have  carefully reviewed  the parties'\r                            \r\r\n\nbriefs  and  district  court record  and  find  no reason  to\r\n\ndisturb the  summary judgment entered in  favor of defendant.\r\n\n     Contrary to  plaintiff's contention, the  district court\r\n\nproperly  struck plaintiff's  statement of  undisputed facts,\r\n\nbecause  it  contained  no   references  to  any   supporting\r\n\ndocuments and it was not responsive to defendant's statement.\r\n\nDistrict  Court Loc.  R. 56.1;  see, e.g.,  Rand  v. M/A-Com,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 824 F.Supp. 242,  266 (D.Mass. 1992).  As a result, the\r                \r\n\nfacts in defendant's statement were deemed admitted.\r\n\n     It  follows  that  summary  judgment  for  defendant was\r\n\nappropriate  because there  was no  genuine  issue as  to any\r\n\nmaterial fact  and defendant  was entitled  to judgment  as a\r\n\nmatter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Specifically,  as the\r\n\ndistrict court found, plaintiff did not sustain his burden to\r\n\npresent a  prima facie case of  discrimination, whether under\r\n\nthe  federal  standard  or  the  less rigorous  Massachusetts\r\n\nstandard.    He presented  no  admissible  evidence that  his\r\n\nfailure  to fulfill  the off-shifts  requirement was  not the\r\n\nreal reason for his termination or  that other employees were\r\n\ntreated  more  favorably.
