Will and Devine, Millimet\n& Branch, P.A. were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         March 19, 2002\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.       This case concerns a challenge on\n\nequal protection grounds to the vote requirements for issuance of\n\nbonds in certain New Hampshire school districts.                 For present\npurposes,   school    districts   in    New    Hampshire   are   treated    as\n\nmunicipalities.      N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 33:8 (2000).          While some\n\ncommunities use a \"city form\" of government where bond issues along\nwith legislation are approved by elected officials (e.g., a city\n\ncouncil), id. § 33:9, there are two other types of municipal\n\ngovernment recognized by state law where legislation including bond\n\nissues requires voter approval.\n\n            One such form of organization is the traditional town\n\nmeeting in which voters assemble on a regular basis to vote upon\n\nlegislation, including bond issues.           N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 39:1.\nIn a variation, other municipalities have retained direct voter\n\ncontrol but adopted a so-called \"official ballot\" regime in which\n\nresidents vote directly on legislation including bond issues not at\na town meeting but by paper ballot at the polls on a designated\n\nday.   Id. § 40:13 (2000 & Supp. 2001).         Voters in school districts\n\nmay alter their form of governance by a three-fifths vote.            Id.    §\n\n40:14.\n\n            Prior to 1999, state law required a super-majority of\n\ntwo-thirds of those voting, either in town meetings or by official\n\nballot, in order to approve local bond issues.             N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 33:8.   Then, in 1999, the state statute was amended so that\n\nthe two-thirds vote requirement was continued for town meeting\n\ndistricts, but the super-majority required for approval was reduced\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fto three-fifths in municipalities using the official ballot system.\n\nIn other words, a different super-majority is required depending on\n\nwhether the voters vote in a town meeting or official ballot school\ndistrict.\n\n            In June 2001, plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment\n\naction in federal district court in New Hampshire.       Each plaintiff\nclaimed to be a resident in one of the defendant school districts\n\nusing the official ballot method and further claimed that each of\n\nthe districts after the 1999 amendment had approved bond issues by\n\na vote greater than three-fifths but less than two-thirds.            The\n\ncomplaint sought a declaration that the lesser percentage required\n\nin official ballot districts, by contrast to the greater percentage\n\nrequired in town meeting districts, violated plaintiffs' rights\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by\n\naccording different weights to the votes of similarly situated\n\nvoters.1\n\n            The defendant school districts moved to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.      Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\nThey contended that voters in the two different types of district\n\nare   not   similarly   situated   and,    even   if   they   were,   the\n\nlegislature's vote-percentage distinction is rational and does not\n\nviolate equal protection standards.       In August 2001, the district\n\n      1\n      The state itself was not joined as a defendant. Because we\nfind that the challenged statute does not violate equal protection,\nwe bypass the question whether the state Attorney General is a\nnecessary party.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a); cf. Norwood v.\nHarrison,   581   F.2d   518,  519   (5th   Cir.  1978);   Liquifin\nAktiengesellschaft v. Brennan, 383 F. Supp. 978, 983-84 (S.D.N.Y.\n1974).\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcourt granted the motion to dismiss, ruling that voters residing in\n\nthe two different types of school district are not similarly\n\nsituated, that \"uniformity among a state's local subdivisions is\nnot a constitutional requisite,\" and that no equal protection claim\n\ncould    be   based   on   the   different   super-majority   requirements.\n\nPlaintiffs now appeal to this court.\n              On appeal, plaintiffs' central argument is that voters in\n\nofficial ballot and town meeting districts are similarly situated\n\nbecause even though each school district votes separately on its\n\nown bond issues, school financing in New Hampshire is inherently a\n\n\"state\" matter that requires uniformity across the state.               See\n\nClaremont Sch. Dist. v. Governor, 703 A.2d 1353 (N.H. 1997).\n\nDefendants say that the local districts are not similarly situated\nand distinguish Claremont; but they argue in any event that the\n\ndifferent super-majority requirements are rationally based and\n\ntherefore valid even if comparison is warranted.\n              Supreme Court cases have often described as the basic\n\nequal protection principle that \"all persons similarly situated\nshould be treated alike.\"2         This may lead one to suppose that an\n\nequal protection challenge automatically fails whenever there are\n\n\n     2\n      City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982) (\"The\nEqual Protection Clause directs that 'all persons similarly\ncircumstanced shall be treated alike.'\" (quoting F.S. Royster Guano\nCo. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920)); Atchison, Topeka &\nSanta Fe R.R. Co. v. Matthews, 174 U.S. 96, 104 (1899) (\"[T]he\nequal protection guaranteed by the Constitution forbids the\nlegislature to select a person, natural or artificial, and impose\nupon him or it burdens and liabilities which are not cast upon\nothers similarly situated.\").\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsubstantial differences between the two groups and without further\n\ninquiry into whether those differences justify the classification;\n\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision rejecting plaintiffs'\nchallenge to the 1999 amendment under the state equal protection\n\nclause may seem to support this view.                    McGraw v. Exeter Region\n\nCoop. Sch. Dist., 765 A.2d 710, 712 (N.H. 2001).                       But so far as\nfederal equal       protection       law   is    concerned,     this    is   an   over-\n\nsimplification.\n\n           Rather, putting aside the special problem of suspect\n\nclassifications, the underlying equal protection inquiry--at least\n\nunder federal law--is whether different treatment of two separately\n\nclassified groups is at least marginally reasonable. Thus, Supreme\n\nCourt cases       refer   to   the    \"similarly        situated\"   rubric     as      the\ncardinal principle but then implement it through the \"general rule\n\n. . . that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be\n\nsustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state interest.\"3\n\n           Decisions      may    sometimes        use    the    similarly    situated\n\nlanguage     to   conflate      the    two       inquiries--by      pointing      to     a\n\ndifferentiating characteristic so self-evidently a basis for a\n\nreasonable    classification          as   to    show    both   dissimilarity          and\n\nreasonableness at the same time.                   Imagine state-enacted water\n\n\n     3\n      Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440; accord Plyler, 457 U.S. at 216\n(usual requirement is \"that the classification at issue bears some\nfair relationship to a legitimate public purpose\"); Tribe, American\nConstitutional Law §§ 16-1 to 16-2 (2d ed. 1988); Tussman &\ntenBroek, The Equal Protection of the Laws, 37 Cal. L. Rev. 341,\n346 (1949).\n\n                                           -5-\n\fconservation measures directed to any county with a drought but not\n\nto any with a rich supply of water.                  But in our case, merely to\n\npoint to a difference in voting mechanisms (between official\nballots      and    town   meetings)   is     to    identify    a   differentiating\n\ncharacteristic without automatically explaining why it justifies\n\nthe difference in treatment (different super-majorities).\n                 This does not make it irrelevant to ask whether two\n\ngroups       are   similarly     situated.         Our   own   cases   do     ask    this\n\nquestion.4         If there are no differences at all, that is likely to\n\nbe fatal to the classification; and if there are differences\n\nbetween the two groups, this will focus attention on distinctions\n\nthat may rationally justify the difference in treatment.                             But\n\nunless the distinctions are self-evidently a rational justification\nfor the discrepant treatment--which is not true in our case--the\n\njustification question remains to be addressed.\n\n                 The district court appears to have assumed that a per se\n\nrule exists that differential treatment of local units within a\n\nstate       is   always    and   everywhere    lawful     because      they    are   not\n\nsimilarly situated.          There may be a hint of this view in the oldest\n\nof the cases invoked,5 but the more recent case law appears to go\n\n     4\n      See Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. & Mortgage Fin.\nCorp., 246 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001); Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d\n906, 909-10 (1st Cir. 1995). The similarly situated rubric was\nalso used in The Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d\n13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989), for a quite different purpose, namely, to\nrefute a factual inference of race discrimination. Once again, the\nsame words may play different roles in different contexts.\n        5\n      Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 22, 30 (1879) (stating that equal\nprotection \"has not respect to local and municipal regulations that\ndo not injuriously affect or discriminate between persons or\n\n                                        -6-\n\fno further than to recognize that differential treatment of local\n\nunits may be easily justified.          Holt Civic Club v. City of\n\nTuscaloosa, 439 U.S. 60, 68-70 (1978); Salsburg v. Maryland, 346\nU.S. 545, 553 & n.9 (1954).         \"Normally\" is not the same as\n\n\"always\"; and it does not take too much imagination to conjure up\n\ndifferential treatment by the state of different communities that\nmight well raise equal protection concerns.\n\n          We note in passing that even if there were an independent\n\nsimilarly situated requirement, plaintiffs would not be helped by\n\nClaremont.     There, the state supreme court held that using widely\n\nvarying property tax rates for schools in different communities\n\nviolated a state constitutional requirement that state taxes be\n\n\"proportional and reasonable.\"      703 A.2d at 1355 (quoting N.H.\nConst. pt. 2 art. 5).    Although the court applied this requirement\n\nto locally prescribed and collected taxes, its concern was based on\n\nthe perceived impact of local discrepancies on public education\nwithin the state.     Id. at 1356-57.\n\n             In short, Claremont addressed a different constitutional\n\nprovision (the state's proportional and reasonable requirement), a\n\ndifferent subject (tax rates themselves as opposed to voting\n\nregimes for bond issuance), and a different concern (the impact of\n\ndifferential tax rates on state education). That it had nothing to\n\n\n\nclasses of persons within the places or municipalities for which\nsuch regulations are made\" (emphasis added)).    Even in Lewis,\nhowever, the Court went on to address justification, saying that\nthe state's establishment of a special court of appeals with\nexclusive jurisdiction over appeals from certain counties was\njustified by \"[c]onvenience, if not necessity.\" Id. at 30-31.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fdo with judging different voting regimes was made clear by the same\n\ncourt's later decision in McGraw, which brushed aside plaintiffs'\n\nstate equal protection challenge to the 1999 amendment.    765 A.2d\nat 712.\n\n             This brings us to the question of what test should be\n\nused in judging the different super-majorities in this case.\nSuper-majorities are not inherently unlawful for referenda, Gordon\n\nv. Lance, 403 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1971), but the issue here is unequal\n\ntreatment.     There is some indication that heightened scrutiny\n\nexists where a state distinguishes among voters within the relevant\n\njurisdiction.    See, e.g., Harper v. Va. Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S.\n\n663, 665 (1966).       Certainly, the Supreme Court has regularly\n\ninvalidated schemes of this kind, although more recent cases have\nsometimes allowed voting to be limited to or weighted unequally\n\ntoward specially affected residents.6\n\n             But here, New Hampshire has prescribed different voting\nregimes for decisions made separately in differently structured\n\nlocal communities, though admittedly for the same kind of decision.\n\n     6\n      Compare, e.g., Hill v. Stone, 421 U.S. 289 (1975)\n(invalidating \"dual box\" municipal bond election procedure that\nrequired majority of property taxpayers and majority of all\nvoters), and Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368 (1963) (invalidating\nGeorgia's county-unit method of voting, which gave disproportionate\nweight to rural voters), with Town of Lockport v. Citizens for\nCmty. Action, 430 U.S. 259 (1977) (holding that divergent interests\nof cities and towns justified requirement of majority of voters in\nboth to approve new county charter), and Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare\nLake Basin Water Dist., 410 U.S. 719 (1973) (allowing election for\nwater storage board, which oversaw distribution of water to farms,\nto be limited to landowners).      See generally Gelfand, Federal\nConstitutional Law and American Local Government § 1-3 (1984);\nBriffault, Who Rules at Home?: One Person/One Vote and Local\nGovernments, 60 U. Chi. L. Rev. 339, 345-369 (1993).\n\n                                 -8-\n\fThe   few   Supreme   Court   cases   in    point   indicate   that    in   this\n\nsituation, equal protection claims are properly tested by asking\n\nwhether there is a rational basis for the difference in treatment\nbased on some conceivable legitimate legislative objective.7                This\n\nseems fair enough:       the votes are on local bond issues and each\n\nvote within the district is counted equally.               There is no issue\nhere of a state-wide vote tabulated differently in constituent\n\ndistricts.     Cf. Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000).\n\n             The   defendants'   brief     refers   to   legislative   history\n\nindicating that the 1999 amendment was prompted by several related\n\nconcerns:     first, the need in town meeting districts for a larger\n\nsuper-majority rested in part on the risk of smaller turnouts at a\n\ntown meeting, whereas in ballot communities voting is much easier,\nlessening the need for a large super-majority; and, second, such\n\neasy voting in the latter districts had led to a substantial\n\ndecline in bond approvals in such communities because of a passive\nminority who might not trouble to attend town meetings but would\n\nvote no almost automatically on school financing under the official\n\nballot mechanism.8\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      Holt, 439 U.S. at 68-70; Salsburg, 346 U.S. at 553 & n.9; see\nNeuman, Territorial Discrimination, Equal Protection, and Self-\nDetermination, 135 U. Pa. L. Rev. 261, 273-75 (1987).\n      8\n      See, e.g., Hearing on H.B. 487 Before the Senate Comm. on\nEducation, 1999 Gen. Ct., 156th Sess. (N.H. June 9, 1999)\n(statements of Rep. Lynde and Dean Michener, Dir. of Gov't\nRelations, N.H. School Boards Ass'n); Public Hearing on H.B. 487\nBefore the House Comm. on Education, 1999 Gen. Ct., 156th Sess.\n(N.H. Mar. 24, 1999) (statement of Rep. Estabrook).\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            Although legislative history is by no means necessary to\n\nsustain a classification as rational, both distinctions articulated\n\nby the legislature seem plausible enough to satisfy the lenient\nrational basis test.      See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508\n\nU.S. 307, 313-15 (1993); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425-26\n\n(1961).    If the state legislature had allocated different super-\nmajority requirements at random, this would be a quite different\n\ncase.    But here, different requirements apply to different methods\n\nof voting, and the explanation as to why the different methods\n\nmight     warrant   the   small   adjustment   in   the   super-majority\n\nrequirement (amounting to an additional one-fifteenth of the vote\n\nin town meeting districts) can hardly be described as arbitrary on\n\nits face in view of legislative history.\n            We need not pursue the issue much farther because the\n\nplaintiffs have failed to make any serious effort to counter this\n\nclaim of rational basis.      Defendants moved in the district court\nfor a dismissal of the complaint on two separate grounds--the\n\nsimilarly situated rubric and the claim of rational basis.           The\n\ndistrict court did not reach the second ground, and therefore\n\nplaintiffs had no obligation to address the issue in their opening\n\nbrief.    But it is well-settled that on appeal the defendants may\n\ndefend the judgment below on any ground that would serve.            See\n\nRoeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc., 814 F.2d 22, 28, 30-31 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n            Accordingly, if the plaintiffs did not anticipate this\n\nalternative ground and address it in their opening brief, prudence\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fdictated that they counter with a reply brief showing that the\n\ndefendants    were   wrong      or   that   the   issue   was   not   subject   to\n\ndisposition on the pleadings.               Plaintiffs have made no serious\neffort to anticipate the issue, save for a claim, not seriously\n\ndeveloped and so disregarded, Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,\n\n142   F.3d   26,   43    (1st   Cir.    1998),    that    the   legislature     was\nimpermissibly trying to dilute the votes of bond issue opponents.\n\nAnd plaintiffs filed no reply brief at all.               Absent any sustained\n\nchallenge to defendants' rational basis claims, we have no cause to\n\ndoubt the defendants' proffered rationales.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f",

In a variation, other municipalities have retained direct voter control but adopted a so-called \"official ballot\" regime in which residents vote directly on legislation including bond issues not at a town meeting but by paper ballot at the polls on a designated day. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 40:13 (2000 &amp; Supp.2001). Voters in school districts may alter their form of governance by a three-fifths vote. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 40:14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to 1999, state law required a super-majority of two-thirds of those voting, either in town meetings or by official ballot, in order to approve local bond issues. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 33:8. Then, in 1999, the state statute was amended so that the two-thirds vote requirement was continued for town meeting districts, but the super-majority required for approval was reduced to three-fifths in municipalities using the official ballot system. In other words, a different super-majority is required depending on whether the voters vote in a town meeting or official ballot school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court in New Hampshire. Each plaintiff claimed to be a resident in one of the defendant school districts using the official ballot method and further claimed that each of the districts after the 1999 amendment had approved bond issues by a vote greater than three-fifths but less than two-thirds. The complaint sought a declaration that the lesser percentage required in official ballot districts, by contrast to the greater percentage required in town meeting districts, violated plaintiffs' rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by according different weights to the votes of similarly situated voters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant school districts moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). They contended that voters in the two different types of district are not similarly situated and, even if they were, the legislature's vote-percentage distinction is rational and does not violate equal protection standards. In August 2001, the district court granted the motion to dismiss, ruling that voters residing in the two different types of school district are not similarly situated, that \"uniformity among a state's local subdivisions is not a constitutional requisite,\" and that no equal protection claim could be based on the different super-majority requirements. Plaintiffs now appeal to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs' central argument is that voters in official ballot and town meeting districts are similarly situated because even though each school district votes separately on its own bond issues, school financing in New Hampshire is inherently a \"state\" matter that requires uniformity across the state. <i>See Claremont Sch. Dist. v. Governor,</i> 142 N.H. 462, 703 A.2d 1353 (N.H.1997). Defendants say that the local districts are not similarly situated and distinguish <i>Claremont;</i> but they argue in any event that the different super-majority requirements are rationally based and therefore valid even if comparison is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Supreme Court cases have often described as the basic equal protection principle that \"all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This may lead one to suppose that an equal protection challenge automatically fails whenever there are substantial differences between the two groups and without further inquiry into whether those differences justify the classification; the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision rejecting plaintiffs' challenge to the 1999 amendment under the <i>state</i> equal protection clause may seem to support this view. <i>McGraw v. Exeter Region Coop. Sch. Dist.,</i> 145 N.H. 709, 765 A.2d 710, 712 (N.H.2001). But so far as federal equal protection law is concerned, this is an over-simplification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, putting aside the special problem of suspect classifications, the underlying equal protection inquiry &#8212; at least under federal law &#8212; is whether different treatment of two separately classified groups is at least marginally <i>reasonable.</i> Thus, Supreme Court cases refer to the \"similarly situated\" rubric as the cardinal principle but then implement it through the \"general rule ... that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions may sometimes use the similarly situated language to conflate the two inquiries &#8212; by pointing to a differentiating characteristic so self-evidently a basis for a reasonable classification as to show both dissimilarity and reasonableness at the same time. Imagine state-enacted water conservation measures directed to any county with a drought but not to any with a rich supply of water. But in our case, merely to point to a difference in voting mechanisms (between official ballots and town meetings) is to identify a differentiating characteristic without automatically explaining why it justifies the difference in treatment (different super-majorities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not make it irrelevant to ask whether two groups are similarly situated. Our own cases do ask this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If there are no differences at all, that is likely to be fatal to the classification; and if there are differences between the two groups, this will focus attention on distinctions that may rationally justify the difference in treatment. But unless the distinctions are self-evidently a rational justification for the discrepant treatment &#8212; which is not true in our case &#8212; the justification question remains to be addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appears to have assumed that a <i>per se</i> rule exists that differential treatment of local units within a state is always and everywhere lawful because they are not similarly situated. There may be a hint of this view in the oldest of the cases invoked,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but the more recent case law appears to go no further than to recognize that differential treatment of local units may be easily justified. <i>Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa,</i> 439 U.S. 60, 68-70, 99 S.Ct. 383, 58 L.Ed.2d 292 (1978); <i>Salsburg v. Maryland,</i> 346 U.S. 545, 553 &amp; n. 9, 74 S.Ct. 280, 98 L.Ed. 281 (1954). \"Normally\" is not the same as \"always\"; and it does not take too much imagination to conjure up differential treatment by the state of different communities that might well raise equal protection concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note in passing that even if there were an independent similarly situated requirement, plaintiffs would not be helped by <i>Claremont.</i> There, the state supreme court held that using widely varying property tax rates for schools in different communities violated a state constitutional requirement that state taxes be \"proportional and reasonable.\" 703 A.2d at 1355 (quoting N.H. Const. pt. 2 art. 5). Although the court applied this requirement to locally prescribed and collected taxes, its concern was based on the perceived impact of local discrepancies on public education within the state. <i>Id.</i> at 1356-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, <i>Claremont</i> addressed a <i>different</i> constitutional provision (the state's proportional and reasonable requirement), a <i>different</i> subject (tax rates themselves as opposed to voting regimes for bond issuance), and a <i>different</i> concern (the impact of differential tax rates on state education). That it had nothing to do with judging different voting regimes was made clear by the same court's later decision in <i>McGraw,</i> which brushed aside plaintiffs' state equal protection challenge to the 1999 amendment. 765 A.2d at 712.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question of what test should be used in judging the different super-majorities in this case. Super-majorities are not inherently unlawful for referenda, <i>Gordon v. Lance,</i> 403 U.S. 1, 6-7, 91 S.Ct. 1889, 29 L.Ed.2d 273 (1971), but the issue here is unequal treatment. There is some indication that heightened scrutiny exists where a state distinguishes among voters <i>within</i> the relevant jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., Harper v. Va. Bd. of Elections,</i> 383 U.S. 663, 665, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966). Certainly, the Supreme Court has regularly invalidated schemes of this kind, although more recent cases have sometimes allowed voting to be limited to or weighted unequally toward specially affected residents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here, New Hampshire has prescribed different voting regimes for decisions made separately in differently structured local communities, though admittedly for the same <i>kind</i> of decision. The few Supreme Court cases in point indicate that in this situation, equal protection claims are properly tested by asking whether there is a rational basis for the difference in treatment based on some conceivable legitimate legislative objective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This seems fair enough: the votes are on <i>local</i> bond issues and each vote within the district is counted equally. There is no issue here of a state-wide vote tabulated differently in constituent districts. <i>Cf. Bush v. Gore,</i> 531 U.S. 98, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' brief refers to legislative history indicating that the 1999 amendment was prompted by several related concerns: first, the need in town meeting districts for a larger super-majority rested in part on the risk of smaller turnouts at a town meeting, whereas in ballot communities voting is much easier, lessening the need for a large super-majority; and, second, such easy voting in the latter districts had led to a substantial decline in bond approvals in such communities because of a passive minority who might not trouble to attend town meetings but would vote no almost automatically on school financing under the official ballot mechanism.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although legislative history is by no means necessary to sustain a classification as rational, both distinctions articulated by the legislature seem plausible enough to satisfy the lenient rational basis test. <i>See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 307, 313-15, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993); <i>McGowan v. Maryland,</i> 366 U.S. 420, 425-26, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). If the state legislature had allocated different super-majority requirements at random, this would be a quite different case. But here, different requirements apply to different methods of voting, and the explanation as to why the different methods might warrant the small adjustment in the super-majority requirement (amounting to an additional one-fifteenth of the vote in town meeting districts) can hardly be described as arbitrary on its face in view of legislative history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue the issue much farther because the plaintiffs have failed to make any serious effort to counter this claim of rational basis. Defendants moved in the district court for a dismissal of the complaint on two separate grounds &#8212; the similarly situated rubric and the claim of rational basis. The district court did not reach the second ground, and therefore plaintiffs had no obligation to address the issue in their opening brief. But it is well-settled that on appeal the defendants may defend the judgment below on any ground that would serve. <i>See Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc.,</i> 814 F.2d 22, 28, 30-31 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, if the plaintiffs did not anticipate this alternative ground and address it in their opening brief, prudence dictated that they counter with a reply brief showing that the defendants were wrong or that the issue was not subject to disposition on the pleadings. Plaintiffs have made no serious effort to anticipate the issue, save for a claim, not seriously developed and so disregarded, <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.1998), that the legislature was impermissibly trying to dilute the votes of bond issue opponents. And plaintiffs filed no reply brief at all. Absent any sustained challenge to defendants' rational basis claims, we have no cause to doubt the defendants' proffered rationales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the claim of \"impermissible motive\" is based on a misunderstanding. All super-majority requirements \"dilute\" the votes of those who would win if a bare majority sufficed. This is just another way of saying that the legislature (or Constitution drafter for that matter, <i>e.g.,</i> U.S. Const. art. II, &#167; 2, cl. 2; <i>id.</i> art. V) believed that the type of action should be attended by special caution and should be taken only with more support than a simple majority. Examples include the ratification of treaties, amendments to the Constitution, and votes to cut off Senate debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, when New Hampshire adopted and then modified a super-majority requirement for local bond issues, we assume with plaintiffs that its purpose was to weight voting and affect outcomes. But, contrary to plaintiffs' assumption, this does not, standing alone, condemn the measure or invite some form of special scrutiny. <i>See Gordon v. Lance,</i> 403 U.S. at 6-7, 91 S.Ct. 1889, 29 L.Ed.2d 273. Still less does the legislative action taken here&#8212;a <i>reduction</i> in the super-majority requirement (from two-thirds to three-fifths) for official ballot districts &#8212; require special justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The state itself was not joined as a defendant.

For present purposes, school districts in New Hampshire are treated as municipalities. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 33:8 (2000). While some communities use a \"city form\" of government where bond issues along with legislation are approved by elected officials (<i>e.g.,</i> a city council), <i>id.</i> &#167; 33:9, there are two other types of municipal government recognized by state law where legislation including bond issues requires voter approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such form of organization is the traditional town meeting in which voters assemble on a regular basis to vote upon legislation, including bond issues. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 39:1. In a variation, other municipalities have retained direct voter control but adopted a so-called \"official ballot\" regime in which residents vote directly on legislation including bond issues not at a town meeting but by paper ballot at the polls on a designated day. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 40:13 (2000 &amp; Supp.2001). Voters in school districts may alter their form of governance by a three-fifths vote. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 40:14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to 1999, state law required a super-majority of two-thirds of those voting, either in town meetings or by official ballot, in order to approve local bond issues. N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 33:8. Then, in 1999, the state statute was amended so that the two-thirds vote requirement was continued for town meeting districts, but the super-majority required for approval was reduced to three-fifths in municipalities using the official ballot system.

Each plaintiff claimed to be a resident in one of the defendant school districts using the official ballot method and further claimed that each of the districts after the 1999 amendment had approved bond issues by a vote greater than three-fifths but less than two-thirds. The complaint sought a declaration that the lesser percentage required in official ballot districts, by contrast to the greater percentage required in town meeting districts, violated plaintiffs' rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by according different weights to the votes of similarly situated voters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant school districts moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). They contended that voters in the two different types of district are not similarly situated and, even if they were, the legislature's vote-percentage distinction is rational and does not violate equal protection standards. In August 2001, the district court granted the motion to dismiss, ruling that voters residing in the two different types of school district are not similarly situated, that \"uniformity among a state's local subdivisions is not a constitutional requisite,\" and that no equal protection claim could be based on the different super-majority requirements. Plaintiffs now appeal to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs' central argument is that voters in official ballot and town meeting districts are similarly situated because even though each school district votes separately on its own bond issues, school financing in New Hampshire is inherently a \"state\" matter that requires uniformity across the state. <i>See Claremont Sch.

Imagine state-enacted water conservation measures directed to any county with a drought but not to any with a rich supply of water. But in our case, merely to point to a difference in voting mechanisms (between official ballots and town meetings) is to identify a differentiating characteristic without automatically explaining why it justifies the difference in treatment (different super-majorities).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not make it irrelevant to ask whether two groups are similarly situated. Our own cases do ask this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> If there are no differences at all, that is likely to be fatal to the classification; and if there are differences between the two groups, this will focus attention on distinctions that may rationally justify the difference in treatment.

Certainly, the Supreme Court has regularly invalidated schemes of this kind, although more recent cases have sometimes allowed voting to be limited to or weighted unequally toward specially affected residents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But here, New Hampshire has prescribed different voting regimes for decisions made separately in differently structured local communities, though admittedly for the same <i>kind</i> of decision. The few Supreme Court cases in point indicate that in this situation, equal protection claims are properly tested by asking whether there is a rational basis for the difference in treatment based on some conceivable legitimate legislative objective.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This seems fair enough: the votes are on <i>local</i> bond issues and each vote within the district is counted equally.

But here, different requirements apply to different methods of voting, and the explanation as to why the different methods might warrant the small adjustment in the super-majority requirement (amounting to an additional one-fifteenth of the vote in town meeting districts) can hardly be described as arbitrary on its face in view of legislative history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not pursue the issue much farther because the plaintiffs have failed to make any serious effort to counter this claim of rational basis. Defendants moved in the district court for a dismissal of the complaint on two separate grounds &#8212; the similarly situated rubric and the claim of rational basis. The district court did not reach the second ground, and therefore plaintiffs had no obligation to address the issue in their opening brief. But it is well-settled that on appeal the defendants may defend the judgment below on any ground that would serve. <i>See Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484931\"><a href=\"/opinion/484931/gilbert-roeder-etc-v-alpha-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28, 30-31 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, if the plaintiffs did not anticipate this alternative ground and address it in their opening brief, prudence dictated that they counter with a reply brief showing that the defendants were wrong or that the issue was not subject to disposition on the pleadings. Plaintiffs have made no serious effort to anticipate the issue, save for a claim, not seriously developed and so disregarded, <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1998), that the legislature was impermissibly trying to dilute the votes of bond issue opponents. And plaintiffs filed no reply brief at all. Absent any sustained challenge to defendants' rational basis claims, we have no cause to doubt the defendants' proffered rationales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the claim of \"impermissible motive\" is based on a misunderstanding. All super-majority requirements \"dilute\" the votes of those who would win if a bare majority sufficed. This is just another way of saying that the legislature (or Constitution drafter for that matter, <i>e.g.,</i> U.S. Const. art. II, &#167; 2, cl. 2; <i>id.</i> art. V) believed that the type of action should be attended by special caution and should be taken only with more support than a simple majority. Examples include the ratification of treaties, amendments to the Constitution, and votes to cut off Senate debate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, when New Hampshire adopted and then modified a super-majority requirement for local bond issues, we assume with plaintiffs that its purpose was to weight voting and affect outcomes. But, contrary to plaintiffs' assumption, this does not, standing alone, condemn the measure or invite some form of special scrutiny. <i>See Gordon v.
