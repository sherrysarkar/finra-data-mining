The brief makes a\r\nreference to Law No. 80,  suggesting implications for L pez' ADEA\r\nclaim,  but does  not actually  include an  argument for  a claim\r\nunder Puerto Rico  Law No.  80.  Therefore,  L pez and  Izquierdo\r\nhave waived  any issues regarding  the district court's  grant of\r\nsummary  judgment on  their Law  No. 80  claims.  See  Frazier v.\r                                                                        \r\nBailey, 957 F.2d  920, 932 n.4 (1st Cir. 1992)  (noting that \"[a]\r                \r\nstate law claim  which is not addressed  in a brief is  waived\").\r\nPages' Law No. 80 claim, however, has not been waived.\r\n\n   Similarly, appellants have not included any argument regarding\r\nPuerto Rico Law No.  100 beyond a passing reference  under Pages'\r\nPuerto Rico Law No. 80 claim.  As a result,  appellants have also\r\nwaived any issues regarding the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment on their Law No. 100 claims.  Id.\r                                                    \r\n\n   While appellants'  counsel asserted  at oral argument  that we\r\nshould  not  find  these   arguments  waived  because  the  facts\r\nnecessary to them were  argued in the context of  their appellate\r\nbrief's  ADEA argument, we must disagree.   In the absence of any\r\ndiscussion beyond citations to these Puerto Rico statutes, and in\r\nthe  absence of  any submitted argument,  we conclude  that these\r\narguments are waived.

BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  following  facts are  not  in dispute.    In 1992,\r\n\nIberia's  net loss for  its San Juan  operations was $14,305,504.\r\n\nFor the seven prior years, plus the year 1992, Iberia's  net loss\r\n\nin San Juan was $136,795,292.  Beginning in the year 1991, Iberia\r\n\nimplemented   a  worldwide  reorganization   of  its  operations,\r\n\nincluding  substantial cutbacks in Puerto Rico.   During the time\r\n\nperiod  from May  1991  to  November  1992,  14  of  Iberia's  32\r\n\nemployees in Puerto  Rico were  laid off or  otherwise ceased  to\r\n\nwork  for Iberia.  On September 30, 1992, the three appellants in\r\n\nthis case were discharged.\r\n\n          This  appeal  also  contains  several  disputed  facts.\r\n\nBecause we must determine  whether the disputes of fact  are both\r\n\ngenuine and  material, we  discuss  these disputed  facts in  the\r\n\ncourse of our discussion of the law.\r\n\n                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                               II.

As a result,  each of the Appellants was required to\r\n\nmake a prima  facie showing (1)  that he or  she fell within  the\r\n\nADEA's protected age  group -- that is, more than  forty years of\r\n\nage;  (2) that  he or  she  met  Iberia's legitimate  performance\r\n\nexpectations; (3)  that he or she  experienced adverse employment\r\n\naction;  and (4)  that  Iberia did  not  treat age  neutrally  or\r\n\nretained younger persons in  the same position.  See  Woodman, 51\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 1091; Vega v.

Thus, a district  court's grant of summary judgment to  an\r\n\nemployer  will  be upheld  if the  record  is devoid  of adequate\r\n\ndirect   or   circumstantial    evidence   of   the    employer's\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent.  \r\n\n                     2.

L pez and Izquierdo\r\n\n          We  treat L pez'  and  Izquierdo's  respective  appeals\r\n\ntogether because the same case law governs both.\r\n\n          The district court found that L pez failed to present a\r\n\nprima facie case.   It found that  while she satisfied the  first\r\n\nthree required elements of the prima facie case -- she belongs to\r\n\nthe protected  class, her job  performance was adequate,  and she\r\n\nwas discharged -- she failed to satisfy the fourth element.  That\r\n\nis, she  failed to  show either  that  Iberia did  not treat  age\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nneutrally  or  that younger  persons  were retained  in  the same\r\n\nposition.   Here we  assume, without  concluding, that  L pez has\r\n\ndemonstrated  a prima facie case,  since doing so  does not alter\r\n\nthe outcome of  our analysis.   In contrast,  the district  court\r\n\nconcluded  that Izquierdo  demonstrated a  prima facie  case, but\r\n\nthat he  failed to present  sufficient evidence for  a reasonable\r\n\ntrier  of fact to infer  that Iberia's decision  to terminate him\r\n\nwas motivated by age animus.\r\n\n          On appeal,  L pez argues that the  district court erred\r\n\nbecause, in fact, she  did produce evidence both that  Iberia did\r\n\nnot treat age neutrally and that younger persons were retained to\r\n\ndo  her functions.  With respect to age neutrality, L pez asserts\r\n\nthat Iberia  never considered  her seniority  in its decision  to\r\n\nterminate her, as she argues  is required by Puerto Rico Law  No.\r\n\n80.2   However, she cites no authority for the proposition, which\r\n\nwe reject,  that Puerto Rico Law  modifies the ADEA to  take into\r\n\naccount discrimination against  more senior  employees, not  just\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Law No. 80 provides, in relevant part, that\r\n\n            it shall  be the duty of  the employer to\r\n            retain   those   employees   of   greater\r\n            seniority  on  the  job with  preference,\r\n            provided  there  are positions  vacant or\r\n            filled by employees of less  seniority in\r\n            the   job   within   their   occupational\r\n            classification which may be held by them,\r\n            it being understood that preference shall\r\n            be given to  the employees discharged  in\r\n            the event that within the  six (6) months\r\n            following their layoff the employer needs\r\n            to employ  a  person in  like or  similar\r\n            work . . . .\r\n\n29 L.P.R.A.   185(c) (entitled \"Order of retaining employees\").\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nolder employees.  She  also points to  the fact that, during  the\r\n\nreduction in  force, she was not  offered employment alternatives\r\n\nmade  available to Galo Beltr n (\"Beltr n\")  (age 35) and Ernesto\r\n\nRodr guez  (\"Rodr guez\")  (age  48).    Furthermore,  L pez  also\r\n\nmaintains  that  her  functions  were  taken  over by  a  younger\r\n\nemployee,  Alga  Rivera (\"Rivera\")  (age  33),  hired soon  after\r\n\nL pez' termination.\r\n\n          Similarly, Izquierdo  (age 45) contends on  appeal that\r\n\nthe  fact that he was  not considered for  retention or immediate\r\n\nre-hiring  as  a Sales  Agent,  as Beltr n  and  Rodr guez3 were,\r\n\nshows that Iberia  did not treat age  neutrally in the course  of\r\n\nits  reduction in  force.   Izquierdo also  alludes to  a younger\r\n\nindividual  in  a  different   department  than  Sales,  who  was\r\n\nallegedly  offered the opportunity  to continue  work at  a lower\r\n\nsalary.   However, since Izquierdo failed to proffer any evidence\r\n\nthat  this other department experienced a reduction in force at a\r\n\nsimilar time  period, or  that Izquierdo was  qualified for  this\r\n\nposition, it would plainly be unreasonable to infer a lack of age\r\n\nneutrality from this  evidence.   As a result,  we consider  only\r\n\nIzquierdo's arguments  regarding Beltr n and Rodr guez.   We note\r\n\nthat Izquierdo  does not point to  evidence contravening Iberia's\r\n\nposition that Beltr n and Rodr guez were simply re-hired at lower\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Izquierdo argues that although Rodr guez  is older, Izquierdo\r\nwas  more  senior at  the time  of  his dismissal.    However, an\r\ninference of age  animus would be plainly  unreasonable where the\r\nretained  person  was  older.    And   Izquierdo  has  not  cited\r                                      \r\nauthority,  and we have not  found any, for  the proposition that\r\nmore  senior,  but  younger,  employees fall  within  the  ADEA's\r\nprotected class.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\npay  to do the same job they  had done previously.  Neither L pez\r\n\nor Izquierdo  has argued  or adduced  evidence that  Sales Agents\r\n\nBeltr n and Rodr guez were not, as the district  court concluded,\r\n\noccupying  positions  below  that  of  Coordinators   L pez4  and\r\n\nIzquierdo.\r\n\n          In  Holt v. Gamewell Corp.,  797 F.2d 36,  38 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1986),  we  confronted arguments  similar to  those of  L pez and\r\n\nIzquierdo.  In that  case, the appellant manager argued  that, in\r\n\nlieu of dismissing  him, his employer should  have discharged one\r\n\nof the employees he  supervised and given that job  to appellant.\r\n\nThus,  we   rejected  that  argument  as   unsupported  by  legal\r\n\nauthority,  as in  the instant  case, and  as requiring  that the\r\n\ncourt encroach too far  into areas which should  be left to  \"the\r\n\ncompany's legitimate management.\"  Id. at 38.\r                                                \r\n\n          The  Second Circuit's  opinion in  Parcinski v.

Considering  an argument\r                                        \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   L pez has also  argued that, while  she was appointed  to the\r\nposition  of \"Coordinator B\" of  the Sales Department  on May 25,\r\n1990, her title was fictitious, as she was actually an \"Executive\r\nSecretary.\"   This  contention  has several  problems.   Although\r\nargued to the court, it was never supported by a sworn statement.\r\nAdditionally, L pez herself contradicted this proposition; in her\r\ndeposition, she  stated that \"regardless  of what they  wanted to\r\ncall me, my work was [as a] Sales Coordinator.\"  Finally,  L pez'\r\nappointment to \"Coordinator  B\" took place  three years prior  to\r\nher discharge.   It seems  unlikely that Iberia  promoted her  to\r\nthis fictitious position  three years in advance  with the intent\r\nof  later using that  title to  discriminate against  her.   As a\r\nresult, we conclude that the district court correctly  found that\r\nthis  contention  could  not  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the\r\nevidence presented.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nresembling that of the instant case and of the appellant in Holt,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthe court stated that:\r\n\n            Assuming there were lower echelon, poorer\r\n            paying    jobs   in    the   restructured\r\n            enterprise   which   [appellants]    were\r\n            qualified to fill,  [the employer]  would\r\n            be  met  with  serious   morale  problems\r\n            arising out of the substantial reductions\r\n            in  responsibilities  and  salaries  that\r\n            would accompany such moves.\r\n\nId.; see Ridenour v. Lawson Co.,  791 F.2d 52, 57 (6th Cir. 1986)\r                                         \r\n\n(stating  that \"[w]here  an  employer reduces  his workforce  for\r\n\neconomic  reasons, it incurs no  duty to transfer  an employee to\r\n\nanother position within the  company\"); Sahadi v.

Even\r\n\nassuming, without holding, that  L pez and Izquierdo stated prima\r\n\nfacie  cases, we reject their  arguments that anti-age animus can\r\n\nbe reasonably inferred from  the fact that they were  not offered\r\n\nalternative  employment opportunities,  as Beltr n  and Rodr guez\r\n\nwere.     Accordingly,  we  also  reject   L pez'  argument  that\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus can be  reasonably inferred from the hiring\r\n\nof  Rivera  for a  position inferior  to  L pez' previous  job as\r\n\n\"Coordinator B.\"   Because we conclude that  the evidence adduced\r\n\nby  L pez and Izquierdo, taken as true, cannot suffice to support\r\n\na reasonable inference of anti-age animus, we uphold the district\r\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment on their ADEA claims.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n                            3.

Pages\r\n\n          The  district court  found  that  Pages demonstrated  a\r\n\nprima facie case, but failed to present sufficient  evidence from\r\n\nwhich  a  reasonable  factfinder  could  infer  anti-age  animus.\r\n\nBecause  it  does  not  change our  analysis,  we  assume without\r\n\nconcluding that the district court properly found that Pages (age\r\n\n51) carried  her burden of presenting  a prima facie case.   As a\r\n\nresult, we review her case to determine whether the evidence as a\r\n\nwhole was  sufficient to  support a  reasonable inference  of age\r\n\nanimus in the decision to dismiss her.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 836.\r                                                         \r\n\n          Pages argued  that  Iberia's anti-age  animus could  be\r\n\ninferred by comparing her  dismissal with the retention of:   (1)\r\n\nMar a  Garc a (\"Garc a\")  (age 61),  an Executive  Secretary; (2)\r\n\nSandra Medina (\"Medina\") (48), an Executive Secretary; (3) Rivera\r\n\n(33), a Sales  Assistant; and  (4) Nitza Al s  (\"Al s\") (30),  an\r\n\nemployee  of an  independent contractor  who performed  functions\r\n\nsimilar to  Pages'.   Even assuming that  three comparisons  with\r\n\nnon-discharged  employees could permit  an inference  of anti-age\r\n\nanimus in a  reduction in force  case as a  matter of law,  these\r\n\nthree particular  comparisons cannot.   First, Garc a is  in fact\r\n\nolder than Pages, a fact that  Pages does not dispute.  Second, a\r\n\nreasonable inference of  anti-age animus cannot be drawn from the\r\n\ncomparison of the retention of Medina, an  executive secretary at\r\n\nIberia's administrative offices in  Miramar, Puerto Rico, and the\r\n\ndischarge of Pages,  \"Secretary to the  Airport Manager,\" at  the\r\n\nairport  in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico.  Pages does not dispute that\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  position of Airport Manager  had been eliminated.   Thus, to\r\n\nretain  her rather than Medina, Iberia would have had to transfer\r\n\nPages  to another position  or location.   And,  as noted  in the\r\n\ndiscussion of  L pez and Izquierdo, Appellants  cite no authority\r\n\nfor  the proposition that  an employer conducting  a reduction in\r\n\nforce  must  offer  such transfers  or  relocations  --  in fact,\r\n\nauthority exists for the proposition that  employers face no such\r\n\nobligation.   See Holt, 797 F.2d at 38; Ridenour, 791 F.2d at 57;\r                                                          \r\n\nParcinski, 673 F.2d  at 37.  We must reject  any inference of age\r                   \r\n\nanimus drawn from  a comparison of Pages with Rivera for the same\r\n\nreason   we  rejected  comparisons   between  L pez  and  Rivera:\r\n\nemployers  conducting a reduction in force  face no obligation to\r\n\noffer  \"lower echelon,  poorer  paying jobs  in the  restructured\r\n\nenterprise\" to all older  employees.  Parcinski, 673 F.2d  at 37;\r                                                         \r\n\nsee Holt, 797 F.2d at 38.\r                  \r\n\n          Finally,  the comparison  with  Al s  cannot justify  a\r\n\nreasonable  inference of  anti-age  animus because  Al s was  not\r\n\nemployed  by  Iberia, but  by  another  company, G.M.D.,  with  a\r\n\ncontract  to perform  services  for  Iberia.   This  circuit  has\r\n\npreviously stated that\r\n\n            [a] discharged employee 'is  not replaced\r\n            when  another  employee  is  assigned  to\r\n            perform   the   plaintiff's   duties   in\r\n            addition  to other  duties,  or when  the\r\n            work   is   redistributed   among   other\r\n            existing  employees  already   performing\r\n            related  work.'    Rather, 'a  person  is\r\n            replaced  only  when another  employee is\r\n            hired  or  reassigned   to  perform   the\r\n            plaintiff's duties.'\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nLeBlanc,  6 F.3d  at 846 (citations  omitted) (quoting  Barnes v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGenCorp,  Inc., 896 F.2d 1457, 1465 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 498\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  878  (1990)).   Thus, to  reasonably  infer that  Pages was\r\n\nreplaced  by a younger employee,  we would have  to conclude that\r\n\nPages'  duties, and no others,  were allocated to  Al s, and that\r\n\nAl s  should  be  considered an  Iberia  employee.    However, in\r\n\nMitchell v. Worldwide  Underwriters Ins. Co.,  967 F.2d 565,  566\r                                                      \r\n\n(11th Cir. 1992), the court rejected as insufficient to establish\r\n\na  prima facie case, without  more, an employee's  claim that his\r\n\nemployer  assigned  his   work  to   an  independent   contractor\r\n\ncorporation that  decided to employ  younger employees to  do the\r\n\nwork.  What is more, the instant  case has a grave flaw that  was\r\n\nnot present  in Mitchell: Iberia's contract  with G.M.D. predates\r                                  \r\n\nthe  reduction in force  that gave rise  to Pages'  claim.  Since\r\n\nPages  has  failed to  present  evidence  suggesting that  Iberia\r\n\ncould, at its  discretion, retain her  and have G.M.D.  eliminate\r\n\nAl s, any inference of age animus drawn from Iberia's \"retention\"\r\n\nof Al s would be simply unreasonable.\r\n\n          As  a result,  we conclude  that the  comparisons Pages\r\n\npoints  to cannot support a reasonable inference of age animus on\r\n\nthe part of Iberia.\r\n\n             B.  Pages' Puerto Rico Law No. 80 Claim\r                       B.  Pages' Puerto Rico Law No. 80 Claim\r\n\n          Pages  also argues  that  the District  Court erred  in\r\n\ngranting summary  judgment for Iberia  on her claim  under Puerto\r\n\nRico Law No. 80.  Law No. 80 provides, in relevant part, that \r\n\n            [e]very employee in commerce, industry or\r\n            any  other   business  .   .  .   who  is\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n            discharged from his  [or her]  employment\r\n            without good cause,  shall be entitled to\r                                        \r\n            receive from his employer, in addition to\r\n            the salary he may have earned:\r\n\n            (a)  The  salary  corresponding   to  one\r\n            month, as indemnity;\r\n            (b)  An additional  progressive indemnity\r\n            equivalent to  one week for  each year of\r\n            service.\r\n\n29  L.P.R.A.   185a (emphasis added).  In response, Iberia argues\r\n\nthat it had \"good  cause\" to discharge Pages, pointing to   185b,\r\n\nwhich provides that \"[j]ust cause . . . shall be understood to be\r\n\n. . .  reorganization   changes  .  .  .   [or]  [r]eductions  in\r\n\nemployment made  necessary by a  reduction in the  anticipated or\r\n\nprevailing  volume of production, sales or profits at the time of\r\n\nthe  discharge.\"   29  L.P.R.A.    185b(e)-(f).   Pages  has  not\r\n\npresented evidence to rebut  Iberia's evidence that it eliminated\r\n\nits Sales Department after  it had incurred substantial operating\r\n\nlosses in San Juan.\r\n\n          However, Pages  points to   185c,  which provides that,\r\n\nwhere  employees  are  discharged  due  to  reorganization  or  a\r\n\nreduction  in production, sales or profits, \"it shall be the duty\r\n\nof the employer to retain those employees of greater seniority on\r\n\nthe job with preference,  provided there are positions  vacant or\r\n\nfilled by employees  of less  seniority in the  job within  their\r\n\noccupational classification  which may be  held by them .  . . .\"\r\n\n29  L.P.R.A.   185c.  In the context  of her Law No. 80 argument,\r\n\nPages  suggests  that a  comparison  of  her discharge  with  the\r\n\nretention  of Executive  Secretaries Garc a  and Medina  raises a\r\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether Iberia complied with\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nLaw No. 80.  According to Pages, she was more  senior than Garc a\r\n\nor Medina.\r\n\n          In  fact,  Pages  has  provided no  evidence  to  rebut\r\n\nGarc a's testimony, in  her sworn affidavit,  that Garc a has  in\r\n\nfact been with Iberia as long or longer than Pages.  We thus turn\r\n\nto  the comparison  with Medina,  since the record  evidence does\r\n\nsuggest that Medina  was less  senior than Pages.   Pages  argues\r\n\nthat even though  Medina's position was in Miramar,  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nand Pages'  was at the airport in  Isla Verde, Iberia should have\r\n\ngiven  Pages the option to transfer to Miramar to replace Medina.\r\n\nThis argument  neglects two different  provisions in Law  No. 80.\r\n\nFirst,  Law No.  80 states  that seniority  need not  be followed\r\n\nwhere \"there is a clear and conclusive difference in favor of the\r\n\nefficiency  or capacity  of the  workers compared  . .  . .\"   29\r\n\nL.P.R.A.    185c.    The relevant  evidence  shows that  Medina's\r\n\nposition at the Miramar office and Pages' position at the airport\r\n\nin Isla  Verde were not  fungible.  Medina had  worked in Miramar\r\n\nsince  1972, while  Pages had  worked in  Isla Verde  since 1970.\r\n\nWithout more  evidence, the district court could  have found that\r\n\nno genuine  issue of material fact was  raised as to the relative\r\n\nefficiency of  keeping Medina in  her own  position, rather  than\r\n\ntransferring Pages, as  it was Pages'  airport position that  was\r\n\nbeing eliminated.\r\n\n          Furthermore, Pages ignores    185c(a), which states  in\r\n\nrelevant part that\r\n\n            [i]n  the case  of discharges  or layoffs\r\n            . . .  in  companies  that  have  several\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n            offices . . . and whose usual and regular\r\n            practice  is  not  to transfer  employees\r\n            from  one office  . .  . to  another, and\r\n            that said units  operate in a  relatively\r\n            independent   manner   with   regard   to\r\n            personnel aspects, the  seniority of  the\r\n            employees    within    the   occupational\r\n            classification  subject   to  the  layoff\r\n            shall   be   computed   by  taking   into\r\n            consideration only those employees in the\r\n            office .  . . in which  said layoff shall\r\n            occur.\r\n\n29 L.P.R.A.   185c(a).  Iberia has argued throughout that all but\r\n\none  position at the Airport  has been eliminated  since 1991, in\r\n\naccord with its reorganization plan, and that  transfers were not\r\n\npossible  due  to the  different nature  of  the tasks  which the\r\n\nairport  employees performed  as compared  to the  Miramar office\r\n\nemployees.   The  only evidence  to which  Pages points  fails to\r\n\ngenerate an issue  of fact,  since neither she,  nor Medina,  nor\r\n\nGarc a, has  apparently been  transferred since 1970,  when Pages\r\n\nbegan work at Iberia.\r\n\n          As a  result, we affirm  the district court's  grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment to Iberia on Pages' Law No. 80 claim.\r\n\n             C.  L pez' Puerto Rico Law No. 379 Claim\r                       C.  L pez' Puerto Rico Law No. 379 Claim\r\n\n          L pez  also challenges  the district  court's grant  of\r\n\nsummary judgment on her  claim under Puerto Rico Law  No. 379 for\r\n\novertime pay she  contends Iberia owed her.  Puerto  Rico Law No.\r\n\n379  states,  in  pertinent  part,  that  \"forty  hours  of  work\r\n\nconstitute a  workweek,\" 29 L.P.R.A.   271,  \"extra working hours\r\n\nare . . . hours that an employee works for his employer in excess\r\n\nof  forty during any week,\"    273(b), and  \"[e]very employer who\r\n\nemploys  or permits an employee to work during extra hours, shall\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nbe  bound to pay  him for each  extra hour  a wage rate  equal to\r\n\ndouble the rate agreed upon for regular hours,\"   274.   \r\n\n          The  district   court,  however,  concluded   that  the\r\n\novertime  provisions did not apply  to L pez, since    288 states\r\n\nthat Law No. 379 does not  apply to exempt \"employees\" working as\r\n\n\"executives, administrators, or professionals, as these terms may\r\n\nbe defined by the Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board.\"  29 L.P.R.A.  \r\n\n288; see, e.g.,  Lehman v. Ehret Inc., 103 D.P.R.  264, 267 (P.R.\r                                               \r\n\n1975)  (discussing the  definition  of  \"administrator\").   L pez\r\n\nchallenges the  district court's application of  the Minimum Wage\r\n\nBoard's Regulations.\r\n\n          Under the  authority granted it  by   288,  the Minimum\r\n\nWage  Board promulgated  regulations  by  substantially  adopting\r\n\ndefinitions found in the federal  regulation on the same  matter.\r\n\nSee Santiago  v. Corco,  114 D.P.R.  267,  269 (P.R.  1983).   On\r                                \r\n\nappeal,  both  parties  argue   for,  and  we  agree   with,  the\r\n\napplication of the short test, since it is undisputed that Pages'\r\n\nweekly  salary  was  \"not  less than  $295,\"  as  the  regulation\r\n\nrequires for the  short test's application.   Regulation No.  13,\r\n\nArticle  III(f),  Fourth Revision,  Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico\r\n\nMinimum Wage Board (1990).  As a result, she is excluded from the\r\n\ncoverage of Law No. 379's provisions if:\r\n\n            (a) [she] perform[ed] office or nonmanual\r\n            field work directly related to management\r\n            policies    or   to    general   business\r\n            operations  of  the  employer  or  of the\r\n            customers of the employer; and\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n            (b)   [she]  customarily   and  regularly\r\n            exercise[d]  discretion  and  independent\r\n            judgment.\r\n\nId., Article III.\r             \r\n\n          L pez  argues that  a  genuine issue  of material  fact\r\n\nexisted as to whether she performed office  work directly related\r\n\nto  management  policies  or  general  business  operations,  and\r\n\nwhether she  customarily and  regularly exercised discretion  and\r\n\nindependent judgment.   She argues specifically that she  did not\r\n\nperform  supervisory  functions  and  that she  was  in  fact  an\r\n\n\"Executive  Secretary\"  despite  her  title of  \"Coordinator  B.\"\r\n\nHowever, Article III(a)  and (b) contain no  requirement that one\r\n\nperform  supervisory functions.  To be exempted from Law No. 379,\r\n\none need  only perform  \"office .  . .  work directly related  to\r\n\nmanagement policies or to  general business operations of [one's]\r\n\nemployer.\"  Article III(a).   Thus, L pez' first assertion,  even\r\n\nif  believed, cannot create a genuine issue that would preclude a\r\n\ngrant of summary judgment  for Iberia, since it fails  to respond\r\n\nto any relevant requirement in Regulation No. 13.\r\n\n          As  a result, we turn to L pez' contention that she was\r\n\nan Executive  Secretary rather than  a Coordinator, and  that Law\r\n\nNo.  379 cannot  apply to  her  as an  Executive  Secretary.   In\r\n\naddressing  this assertion  in the  ADEA context,  see  supra, we\r                                                                       \r\n\nrejected  this contention  as unsupported  by a  sworn statement,\r\n\nexplicitly and directly contradicted by her sworn deposition, and\r\n\nrebutted  by  evidence Iberia  proffered.   However, in  the ADEA\r\n\ncontext  the standard of review was whether L pez showed evidence\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nsufficient for the factfinder reasonably to conclude that she was\r\n\ndischarged due  to discriminatory  intent.   We noted  in passing\r\n\nthat because Iberia's alleged mistitling of her position occurred\r\n\nthree  years' before her discharge,  that fact, together with her\r\n\nlack  of  evidence,  rendered  any  age  inference  unreasonable.\r\n\nHowever,  while it would be unreasonable  for a finder of fact to\r\n\nthink that an employer mistitled an  employee's position to cloak\r\n\nits age  discrimination years  later, it would  not be  similarly\r\n\nunreasonable to  believe that  employers seeking to  avoid paying\r\n\novertime would mislabel a  position to take advantage of  Law No.\r\n\n379's exemptions for managers, professionals and administrators.\r\n\n          As  a result, we evaluate L pez'  argument that she was\r\n\nin fact  an \"executive  secretary,\"  assuming without  concluding\r\n\nthat she  adequately  proffered evidence  to raise  this issue.  \r\n\nNeither party has cited Puerto Rico case law interpreting Law No.\r\n\n379  with  respect  to supervisory  duties  or  to  the title  of\r\n\n\"Executive  Secretary.\"   To  determine whether  L pez' assertion\r\n\ncould create a triable issue of fact, we may consider the federal\r\n\nregulations which implement the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\r\n\nSee L pez Vega v. Vega Otero, Inc., 103 P.R.R. 243,  246-47 (P.R.\r                                            \r\n\n1974) (deciding  that where appellee  was an executive  under the\r\n\nprovisions of  the  Federal  Fair Labor  Standards  Act  and  its\r\n\nregulation,  he could not  maintain a claim  against his employer\r\n\nfor extra  hours); Rodr guez v.

As a result, even assuming\r\n\nthat  she was an  Executive Secretary, that  would not disqualify\r\n\nher from being an  exempt employee, assuming that she  did office\r\n\nwork  related   to  management  policies  and   general  business\r\n\noperations,  and that  she  customarily  and regularly  exercised\r\n\ndiscretion and independent judgment.  Iberia's submitted evidence\r\n\nand L pez' co-appellant Izquierdo's testimony as to L pez' duties\r\n\nboth presented ample evidence that L pez exercised discretion and\r\n\nindependent judgment.  In particular, Izquierdo stated that L pez\r\n\nhelped him supervise sales personnel; coordinated the work of the\r\n\nsalesmen; attended social and  civic activities \"to represent the\r\n\ncompany\"; and  exercised her own  discretion with respect  to her\r\n\nwork.    Because  L pez  failed  to  present  evidence  to  rebut\r\n\nIzquierdo's  testimony,  and  given  Iberia's  evidence that  she\r\n\nexercised discretion  and independent judgment,  we conclude that\r\n\nno  issue of fact existed regarding this  point.  As a result, we\r\n\nconclude that she falls under  Regulation No. 13's exemption from\r\n\nLaw No.  379,  and  thus  the district  court  correctly  granted\r\n\nsummary judgment on her overtime pay claim to Iberia.  \r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          As  a result  of  the foregoing,  the  judgment of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                            affirmed\r                                    \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n",

In 1992, Iberia's net loss for its San Juan operations was $14,305,504.   For the seven prior years, plus the year 1992, Iberia's net loss in San Juan was $136,795,292.   Beginning in the year 1991, Iberia implemented a worldwide reorganization of its operations, including substantial cutbacks in Puerto Rico.   During the time period from May 1991 to November 1992, 14 of Iberia's 32 employees in Puerto Rico were laid off or otherwise ceased to work for Iberia.   On September 30, 1992, the three appellants in this case were discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal also contains several disputed facts.   Because we must determine whether the disputes of fact are both genuine and material, we discuss these disputed facts in the course of our discussion of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence, and all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party resisting summary judgment.  Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1091 (1st Cir.1995);  see LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1398, 128 L.Ed.2d 72 (1994).   Summary judgment is properly granted where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  see LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841;  Goldman v. First National Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1116 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The ADEA Claims</p>\n    <p>1. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ADEA discrimination lawsuits, plaintiffs bear the ultimate burden of proving that their ages were the determinative factor in their discharge, \"that is, that [they] would not have been fired but for [their] age.\"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841;  see Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992).  \"At least where there is little overt evidence of age discrimination, the case usually follows the ritualized burden-shifting paradigm\" presented in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-26, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841.   See, e.g., Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 985 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir.1993);  Lawrence v. Northrop Corp., 980 F.2d 66, 68 (1st Cir.1992);  Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the McDonnell Douglas test, plaintiffs must open with a prima facie showing of certain standardized elements suggestive of possible discrimination.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.   It is undisputed that the employment actions that gave rise to the instant case took place as part of a reduction in Iberia's work force.   As a result, each of the Appellants was required to make a prima facie showing (1) that he or she fell within the ADEA's protected age group--that is, more than forty years of age;  (2) that he or she met Iberia's legitimate performance expectations;  (3) that he or she experienced adverse employment action;  and (4) that Iberia did not treat age neutrally or retained younger persons in the same position.   See Woodman, 51 F.3d at 1091;  Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Establishment of the prescribed prima facie case creates a presumption that the employer engaged in impermissible age discrimination.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842;  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117.   However, to rebut this presumption, the employer need only \"articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's termination.\"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842;  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117.   Once the employer meets this burden in an age discrimination case, however, \"the McDonnell Douglas presumption 'drops out of the picture.' \"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 843 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)).   The trier of fact then must simply determine, based on the evidence, whether the employer's decision to terminate the plaintiff was motivated by intentional age discrimination.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 843.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of a summary judgment proceeding, once the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse employment decision, the plaintiff, \"before becoming entitled to bring the case before the trier of fact, must show evidence sufficient for the factfinder reasonably to conclude that the employer's decision to discharge him or her was wrongfully based on age.\"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 843;  see Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117;  Lawrence, 980 F.2d at 69-70.   Direct or indirect evidence of discriminatory intent may suffice, but \"the evidence as a whole ... must be sufficient for a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer's decision was motivated by age animus.\"  Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169, 1172 n. 3 (1st Cir.1991);  see LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 836;  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117.   Thus, a district court's grant of summary judgment to an employer will be upheld if the record is devoid of adequate direct or circumstantial evidence of the employer's discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Lopez and Izquierdo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat Lopez' and Izquierdo's respective appeals together because the same case law governs both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Lopez failed to present a prima facie case.   It found that while she satisfied the first three required elements of the prima facie case--she belongs to the protected class, her job performance was adequate, and she was discharged--she failed to satisfy the fourth element.   That is, she failed to show either that Iberia did not treat age neutrally or that younger persons were retained in the same position.   Here we assume, without concluding, that Lopez has demonstrated a prima facie case, since doing so does not alter the outcome of our analysis.   In contrast, the district court concluded that Izquierdo demonstrated a prima facie case, but that he failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to infer that Iberia's decision to terminate him was motivated by age animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopez argues that the district court erred because, in fact, she did produce evidence both that Iberia did not treat age neutrally and that younger persons were retained to do her functions.   With respect to age neutrality, Lopez asserts that Iberia never considered her seniority in its decision to terminate her, as she argues is required by Puerto Rico Law No. 80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, she cites no authority for the proposition, which we reject, that Puerto Rico Law modifies the ADEA to take into account discrimination against more senior employees, not just older employees.   She also points to the fact that, during the reduction in force, she was not offered employment alternatives made available to Galo Beltran (\"Beltran\") (age 35) and Ernesto Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\") (age 48).   Furthermore, Lopez also maintains that her functions were taken over by a younger employee, Alga Rivera (\"Rivera\") (age 33), hired soon after Lopez' termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Izquierdo (age 45) contends on appeal that the fact that he was not considered for retention or immediate re-hiring as a Sales Agent, as Beltran and Rodriguez<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> were, shows that Iberia did not treat age neutrally in the course of its reduction in force.   Izquierdo also alludes to a younger individual in a different department than Sales, who was allegedly offered the opportunity to continue work at a lower salary.   However, since Izquierdo failed to proffer any evidence that this other department experienced a reduction in force at a similar time period, or that Izquierdo was qualified for this position, it would plainly be unreasonable to infer a lack of age neutrality from this evidence.   As a result, we consider only Izquierdo's arguments regarding Beltran and Rodriguez.   We note that Izquierdo does not point to evidence contravening Iberia's position that Beltran and Rodriguez were simply re-hired at lower pay to do the same job they had done previously.   Neither Lopez or Izquierdo has argued or adduced evidence that Sales Agents Beltran and Rodriguez were not, as the district court concluded, occupying positions below that of Coordinators Lopez<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Izquierdo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Holt v. Gamewell Corp., 797 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1986), we confronted arguments similar to those of Lopez and Izquierdo.   In that case, the appellant manager argued that, in lieu of dismissing him, his employer should have discharged one of the employees he supervised and given that job to appellant.   Thus, we rejected that argument as unsupported by legal authority, as in the instant case, and as requiring that the court encroach too far into areas which should be left to \"the company's legitimate management.\"  Id. at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit's opinion in Parcinski v. Outlet Co., 673 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir.1982), provides a strong statement of the concerns to which Holt alludes.   Considering an argument resembling that of the instant case and of the appellant in Holt, the court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Assuming there were lower echelon, poorer paying jobs in the restructured enterprise which [appellants] were qualified to fill, [the employer] would be met with serious morale problems arising out of the substantial reductions in responsibilities and salaries that would accompany such moves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.;  see Ridenour v. Lawson Co., 791 F.2d 52, 57 (6th Cir.1986) (stating that \"[w]here an employer reduces his workforce for economic reasons, it incurs no duty to transfer an employee to another position within the company\");  Sahadi v. Reynolds Chem., 636 F.2d 1116, 1117 (6th Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accord with the reasoning behind these cases, we conclude that we must reject Lopez' and Izquierdo's arguments comparing their dismissals to Iberia's treatment of Beltran and Rodriguez, and Lopez' argument with respect to Rivera.   Even assuming, without holding, that Lopez and Izquierdo stated prima facie cases, we reject their arguments that anti-age animus can be reasonably inferred from the fact that they were not offered alternative employment opportunities, as Beltran and Rodriguez were.   Accordingly, we also reject Lopez' argument that discriminatory animus can be reasonably inferred from the hiring of Rivera for a position inferior to Lopez' previous job as \"Coordinator B.\"   Because we conclude that the evidence adduced by Lopez and Izquierdo, taken as true, cannot suffice to support a reasonable inference of anti-age animus, we uphold the district court's grant of summary judgment on their ADEA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Pages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Pages demonstrated a prima facie case, but failed to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer anti-age animus.   Because it does not change our analysis, we assume without concluding that the district court properly found that Pages (age 51) carried her burden of presenting a prima facie case.   As a result, we review her case to determine whether the evidence as a whole was sufficient to support a reasonable inference of age animus in the decision to dismiss her.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 836.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pages argued that Iberia's anti-age animus could be inferred by comparing her dismissal with the retention of:  (1) Maria Garcia (\"Garcia\") (age 61), an Executive Secretary;  (2) Sandra Medina (\"Medina\") (48), an Executive Secretary;  (3) Rivera (33), a Sales Assistant;  and (4) Nitza Alos (\"Alos\") (30), an employee of an independent contractor who performed functions similar to Pages'.   Even assuming that three comparisons with non-discharged employees could permit an inference of anti-age animus in a reduction in force case as a matter of law, these three particular comparisons cannot.   First, Garcia is in fact older than Pages, a fact that Pages does not dispute.   Second, a reasonable inference of anti-age animus cannot be drawn from the comparison of the retention of Medina, an executive secretary at Iberia's administrative offices in Miramar, Puerto Rico, and the discharge of Pages, \"Secretary to the Airport Manager,\" at the airport in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico.   Pages does not dispute that the position of Airport Manager had been eliminated.   Thus, to retain her rather than Medina, Iberia would have had to transfer Pages to another position or location.   And, as noted in the discussion of Lopez and Izquierdo, Appellants cite no authority for the proposition that an employer conducting a reduction in force must offer such transfers or relocations--in fact, authority exists for the proposition that employers face no such obligation.   See Holt, 797 F.2d at 38;  Ridenour, 791 F.2d at 57;  Parcinski, 673 F.2d at 37.   We must reject any inference of age animus drawn from a comparison of Pages with Rivera for the same reason we rejected comparisons between Lopez and Rivera:  employers conducting a reduction in force face no obligation to offer \"lower echelon, poorer paying jobs in the restructured enterprise\" to all older employees.  Parcinski, 673 F.2d at 37;  see Holt, 797 F.2d at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the comparison with Alos cannot justify a reasonable inference of anti-age animus because Alos was not employed by Iberia, but by another company, G.M.D., with a contract to perform services for Iberia.   This circuit has previously stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>[a] discharged employee 'is not replaced when another employee is assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties in addition to other duties, or when the work is redistributed among other existing employees already performing related work.'   Rather, 'a person is replaced only when another employee is hired or reassigned to perform the plaintiff's duties.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 846 (citations omitted) (quoting Barnes v. GenCorp, Inc., 896 F.2d 1457, 1465 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 878, 111 S.Ct. 211, 112 L.Ed.2d 171 (1990)).   Thus, to reasonably infer that Pages was replaced by a younger employee, we would have to conclude that Pages' duties, and no others, were allocated to Alos, and that Alos should be considered an Iberia employee.   However, in Mitchell v. Worldwide Underwriters Ins. Co., 967 F.2d 565, 566 (11th Cir.1992), the court rejected as insufficient to establish a prima facie case, without more, an employee's claim that his employer assigned his work to an independent contractor corporation that decided to employ younger employees to do the work.   What is more, the instant case has a grave flaw that was not present in Mitchell:  Iberia's contract with G.M.D. predates the reduction in force that gave rise to Pages' claim.   Since Pages has failed to present evidence suggesting that Iberia could, at its discretion, retain her and have G.M.D. eliminate Alos, any inference of age animus drawn from Iberia's \"retention\" of Alos would be simply unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we conclude that the comparisons Pages points to cannot support a reasonable inference of age animus on the part of Iberia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Pages' Puerto Rico Law No. 80 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pages also argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for Iberia on her claim under Puerto Rico Law No. 80.   Law No. 80 provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[e]very employee in commerce, industry or any other business ... who is discharged from his [or her] employment without good cause, shall be entitled to receive from his employer, in addition to the salary he may have earned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(a) The salary corresponding to one month, as indemnity;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(b) An additional progressive indemnity equivalent to one week for each year of service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185a (emphasis added).   In response, Iberia argues that it had \"good cause\" to discharge Pages, pointing to &#167; 185b, which provides that \"[j]ust cause ... shall be understood to be ... reorganization changes ... [or] [r]eductions in employment made necessary by a reduction in the anticipated or prevailing volume of production, sales or profits at the time of the discharge.\"   29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185b(e)-(f).   Pages has not presented evidence to rebut Iberia's evidence that it eliminated its Sales Department after it had incurred substantial operating losses in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Pages points to &#167; 185c, which provides that, where employees are discharged due to reorganization or a reduction in production, sales or profits, \"it shall be the duty of the employer to retain those employees of greater seniority on the job with preference, provided there are positions vacant or filled by employees of less seniority in the job within their occupational classification which may be held by them....\"  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185c.   In the context of her Law No. 80 argument, Pages suggests that a comparison of her discharge with the retention of Executive Secretaries Garcia and Medina raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Iberia complied with Law No. 80.   According to Pages, she was more senior than Garcia or Medina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Pages has provided no evidence to rebut Garcia's testimony, in her sworn affidavit, that Garcia has in fact been with Iberia as long or longer than Pages.   We thus turn to the comparison with Medina, since the record evidence does suggest that Medina was less senior than Pages.   Pages argues that even though Medina's position was in Miramar, Puerto Rico, and Pages' was at the airport in Isla Verde, Iberia should have given Pages the option to transfer to Miramar to replace Medina.   This argument neglects two different provisions in Law No. 80.   First, Law No. 80 states that seniority need not be followed where \"there is a clear and conclusive difference in favor of the efficiency or capacity of the workers compared....\"  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185c.   The relevant evidence shows that Medina's position at the Miramar office and Pages' position at the airport in Isla Verde were not fungible.   Medina had worked in Miramar since 1972, while Pages had worked in Isla Verde since 1970.   Without more evidence, the district court could have found that no genuine issue of material fact was raised as to the relative efficiency of keeping Medina in her own position, rather than transferring Pages, as it was Pages' airport position that was being eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Pages ignores &#167; 185c(a), which states in relevant part that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>[i]n the case of discharges or layoffs ... in companies that have several offices ... and whose usual and regular practice is not to transfer employees from one office ... to another, and that said units operate in a relatively independent manner with regard to personnel aspects, the seniority of the employees within the occupational classification subject to the layoff shall be computed by taking into consideration only those employees in the office ... in which said layoff shall occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185c(a).   Iberia has argued throughout that all but one position at the Airport has been eliminated since 1991, in accord with its reorganization plan, and that transfers were not possible due to the different nature of the tasks which the airport employees performed as compared to the Miramar office employees.   The only evidence to which Pages points fails to generate an issue of fact, since neither she, nor Medina, nor Garcia, has apparently been transferred since 1970, when Pages began work at Iberia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to Iberia on Pages' Law No. 80 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Lopez' Puerto Rico Law No. 379 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez also challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment on her claim under Puerto Rico Law No. 379 for overtime pay she contends Iberia owed her.   Puerto Rico Law No. 379 states, in pertinent part, that \"forty hours of work constitute a workweek,\" 29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 271, \"extra working hours are ... hours that an employee works for his employer in excess of forty during any week,\" &#167; 273(b), and \"[e]very employer who employs or permits an employee to work during extra hours, shall be bound to pay him for each extra hour a wage rate equal to double the rate agreed upon for regular hours,\" &#167; 274.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, concluded that the overtime provisions did not apply to Lopez, since &#167; 288 states that Law No. 379 does not apply to exempt \"employees\" working as \"executives, administrators, or professionals, as these terms may be defined by the Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board.\"   29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 288;  see, e.g., Lehman v. Ehret Inc., 103 D.P.R. 264, 267 (P.R.1975) (discussing the definition of \"administrator\").   Lopez challenges the district court's application of the Minimum Wage Board's Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the authority granted it by &#167; 288, the Minimum Wage Board promulgated regulations by substantially adopting definitions found in the federal regulation on the same matter.   See Santiago v. Corco, 114 D.P.R. 267, 269 (P.R.1983).   On appeal, both parties argue for, and we agree with, the application of the short test, since it is undisputed that Pages' weekly salary was \"not less than &#167; 295,\" as the regulation requires for the short test's application.   Regulation No. 13, Article III(f), Fourth Revision, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board (1990).   As a result, she is excluded from the coverage of Law No. 379's provisions if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>(a) [she] perform[ed] office or nonmanual field work directly related to management policies or to general business operations of the employer or of the customers of the employer;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>(b) [she] customarily and regularly exercise[d] discretion and independent judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., Article III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez argues that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether she performed office work directly related to management policies or general business operations, and whether she customarily and regularly exercised discretion and independent judgment.   She argues specifically that she did not perform supervisory functions and that she was in fact an \"Executive Secretary\" despite her title of \"Coordinator B.\"   However, Article III(a) and (b) contain no requirement that one perform supervisory functions.   To be exempted from Law No. 379, one need only perform \"office ... work directly related to management policies or to general business operations of [one's] employer.\"   Article III(a).   Thus, Lopez' first assertion, even if believed, cannot create a genuine issue that would preclude a grant of summary judgment for Iberia, since it fails to respond to any relevant requirement in Regulation No. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we turn to Lopez' contention that she was an Executive Secretary rather than a Coordinator, and that Law No. 379 cannot apply to her as an Executive Secretary.   In addressing this assertion in the ADEA context, see supra, we rejected this contention as unsupported by a sworn statement, explicitly and directly contradicted by her sworn deposition, and rebutted by evidence Iberia proffered.   However, in the ADEA context the standard of review was whether Lopez showed evidence sufficient for the factfinder reasonably to conclude that she was discharged due to discriminatory intent.   We noted in passing that because Iberia's alleged mistitling of her position occurred three years' before her discharge, that fact, together with her lack of evidence, rendered any age inference unreasonable.   However, while it would be unreasonable for a finder of fact to think that an employer mistitled an employee's position to cloak its age discrimination years later, it would not be similarly unreasonable to believe that employers seeking to avoid paying overtime would mislabel a position to take advantage of Law No. 379's exemptions for managers, professionals and administrators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we evaluate Lopez' argument that she was in fact an \"executive secretary,\" assuming without concluding that she adequately proffered evidence to raise this issue.   Neither party has cited Puerto Rico case law interpreting Law No. 379 with respect to supervisory duties or to the title of \"Executive Secretary.\"   To determine whether Lopez' assertion could create a triable issue of fact, we may consider the federal regulations which implement the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.   See Lopez Vega v. Vega Otero, Inc., 103 P.R.R. 243, 246-47 (P.R.1974) (deciding that where appellee was an executive under the provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and its regulation, he could not maintain a claim against his employer for extra hours);  Rodriguez v. Concreto Mixto, Inc., 98 P.R.R. 568, 575-76 (P.R.1970) (determining whether or not an employee or worker is a person employed in a bona fide executive capacity by following the rules set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.1 et seq.).   These regulations, in describing those exempt as \"administrative\" employees, note that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[i]n modern industrial parlance there has been a steady and increasing use of persons who assist an executive in the performance of his duties without themselves having executive authority.   Typical titles of persons in this group [include] ... executive secretary....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.201 (emphasis added).   As a result, even assuming that she was an Executive Secretary, that would not disqualify her from being an exempt employee, assuming that she did office work related to management policies and general business operations, and that she customarily and regularly exercised discretion and independent judgment.   Iberia's submitted evidence and Lopez' co-appellant Izquierdo's testimony as to Lopez' duties both presented ample evidence that Lopez exercised discretion and independent judgment.   In particular, Izquierdo stated that Lopez helped him supervise sales personnel;  coordinated the work of the salesmen;  attended social and civic activities \"to represent the company\";  and exercised her own discretion with respect to her work.   Because Lopez failed to present evidence to rebut Izquierdo's testimony, and given Iberia's evidence that she exercised discretion and independent judgment, we conclude that no issue of fact existed regarding this point.   As a result, we conclude that she falls under Regulation No. 13's exemption from Law No. 379, and thus the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her overtime pay claim to Iberia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellants' brief only attempts to raise an argument under Puerto Rico Law No. 80 with respect to Pages.

Therefore, Lopez and Izquierdo have waived any issues regarding the district court's grant of summary judgment on their Law No. 80 claims.   See Frazier v.

Although argued to the court, it was never supported by a sworn statement.   Additionally, Lopez herself contradicted this proposition;  in her deposition, she stated that \"regardless of what they wanted to call me, my work was [as a] Sales Coordinator.\"   Finally, Lopez' appointment to \"Coordinator B\" took place three years prior to her discharge.   It seems unlikely that Iberia promoted her to this fictitious position three years in advance with the intent of later using that title to discriminate against her.

LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842.   It is undisputed that the employment actions that gave rise to the instant case took place as part of a reduction in Iberia's work force.   As a result, each of the Appellants was required to make a prima facie showing (1) that he or she fell within the ADEA's protected age group--that is, more than forty years of age;  (2) that he or she met Iberia's legitimate performance expectations;  (3) that he or she experienced adverse employment action;  and (4) that Iberia did not treat age neutrally or retained younger persons in the same position.

However, to rebut this presumption, the employer need only \"articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's termination.\"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842;  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117.   Once the employer meets this burden in an age discrimination case, however, \"the McDonnell Douglas presumption 'drops out of the picture.' \"  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 843 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.

The trier of fact then must simply determine, based on the evidence, whether the employer's decision to terminate the plaintiff was motivated by intentional age discrimination.

Direct or indirect evidence of discriminatory intent may suffice, but \"the evidence as a whole ... must be sufficient for a reasonable factfinder to infer that the employer's decision was motivated by age animus.\"  Connell v.

Thus, a district court's grant of summary judgment to an employer will be upheld if the record is devoid of adequate direct or circumstantial evidence of the employer's discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Lopez and Izquierdo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat Lopez' and Izquierdo's respective appeals together because the same case law governs both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Lopez failed to present a prima facie case.   It found that while she satisfied the first three required elements of the prima facie case--she belongs to the protected class, her job performance was adequate, and she was discharged--she failed to satisfy the fourth element.   That is, she failed to show either that Iberia did not treat age neutrally or that younger persons were retained in the same position.   Here we assume, without concluding, that Lopez has demonstrated a prima facie case, since doing so does not alter the outcome of our analysis.   In contrast, the district court concluded that Izquierdo demonstrated a prima facie case, but that he failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to infer that Iberia's decision to terminate him was motivated by age animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopez argues that the district court erred because, in fact, she did produce evidence both that Iberia did not treat age neutrally and that younger persons were retained to do her functions.   With respect to age neutrality, Lopez asserts that Iberia never considered her seniority in its decision to terminate her, as she argues is required by Puerto Rico Law No. 80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, she cites no authority for the proposition, which we reject, that Puerto Rico Law modifies the ADEA to take into account discrimination against more senior employees, not just older employees.   She also points to the fact that, during the reduction in force, she was not offered employment alternatives made available to Galo Beltran (\"Beltran\") (age 35) and Ernesto Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\") (age 48).   Furthermore, Lopez also maintains that her functions were taken over by a younger employee, Alga Rivera (\"Rivera\") (age 33), hired soon after Lopez' termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Izquierdo (age 45) contends on appeal that the fact that he was not considered for retention or immediate re-hiring as a Sales Agent, as Beltran and Rodriguez<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> were, shows that Iberia did not treat age neutrally in the course of its reduction in force.   Izquierdo also alludes to a younger individual in a different department than Sales, who was allegedly offered the opportunity to continue work at a lower salary.   However, since Izquierdo failed to proffer any evidence that this other department experienced a reduction in force at a similar time period, or that Izquierdo was qualified for this position, it would plainly be unreasonable to infer a lack of age neutrality from this evidence.   As a result, we consider only Izquierdo's arguments regarding Beltran and Rodriguez.   We note that Izquierdo does not point to evidence contravening Iberia's position that Beltran and Rodriguez were simply re-hired at lower pay to do the same job they had done previously.   Neither Lopez or Izquierdo has argued or adduced evidence that Sales Agents Beltran and Rodriguez were not, as the district court concluded, occupying positions below that of Coordinators Lopez<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and Izquierdo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Holt v.

In that case, the appellant manager argued that, in lieu of dismissing him, his employer should have discharged one of the employees he supervised and given that job to appellant.   Thus, we rejected that argument as unsupported by legal authority, as in the instant case, and as requiring that the court encroach too far into areas which should be left to \"the company's legitimate management.\"  Id. at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second Circuit's opinion in Parcinski v.

Even assuming, without holding, that Lopez and Izquierdo stated prima facie cases, we reject their arguments that anti-age animus can be reasonably inferred from the fact that they were not offered alternative employment opportunities, as Beltran and Rodriguez were.   Accordingly, we also reject Lopez' argument that discriminatory animus can be reasonably inferred from the hiring of Rivera for a position inferior to Lopez' previous job as \"Coordinator B.\"   Because we conclude that the evidence adduced by Lopez and Izquierdo, taken as true, cannot suffice to support a reasonable inference of anti-age animus, we uphold the district court's grant of summary judgment on their ADEA claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Pages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Pages demonstrated a prima facie case, but failed to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer anti-age animus.   Because it does not change our analysis, we assume without concluding that the district court properly found that Pages (age 51) carried her burden of presenting a prima facie case.   As a result, we review her case to determine whether the evidence as a whole was sufficient to support a reasonable inference of age animus in the decision to dismiss her.  LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 836.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pages argued that Iberia's anti-age animus could be inferred by comparing her dismissal with the retention of:  (1) Maria Garcia (\"Garcia\") (age 61), an Executive Secretary;  (2) Sandra Medina (\"Medina\") (48), an Executive Secretary;  (3) Rivera (33), a Sales Assistant;  and (4) Nitza Alos (\"Alos\") (30), an employee of an independent contractor who performed functions similar to Pages'.   Even assuming that three comparisons with non-discharged employees could permit an inference of anti-age animus in a reduction in force case as a matter of law, these three particular comparisons cannot.   First, Garcia is in fact older than Pages, a fact that Pages does not dispute.   Second, a reasonable inference of anti-age animus cannot be drawn from the comparison of the retention of Medina, an executive secretary at Iberia's administrative offices in Miramar, Puerto Rico, and the discharge of Pages, \"Secretary to the Airport Manager,\" at the airport in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico.   Pages does not dispute that the position of Airport Manager had been eliminated.   Thus, to retain her rather than Medina, Iberia would have had to transfer Pages to another position or location.   And, as noted in the discussion of Lopez and Izquierdo, Appellants cite no authority for the proposition that an employer conducting a reduction in force must offer such transfers or relocations--in fact, authority exists for the proposition that employers face no such obligation.   See Holt, 797 F.2d at 38;  Ridenour, 791 F.2d at 57;  Parcinski, 673 F.2d at 37.   We must reject any inference of age animus drawn from a comparison of Pages with Rivera for the same reason we rejected comparisons between Lopez and Rivera:  employers conducting a reduction in force face no obligation to offer \"lower echelon, poorer paying jobs in the restructured enterprise\" to all older employees.

Thus, to reasonably infer that Pages was replaced by a younger employee, we would have to conclude that Pages' duties, and no others, were allocated to Alos, and that Alos should be considered an Iberia employee.   However, in Mitchell v. Worldwide Underwriters Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585317\"><a href=\"/opinion/585317/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-754-59-empl-prac-dec-p-41645-clayton-earl/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 566 (11th Cir.1992), the court rejected as insufficient to establish a prima facie case, without more, an employee's claim that his employer assigned his work to an independent contractor corporation that decided to employ younger employees to do the work.   What is more, the instant case has a grave flaw that was not present in Mitchell:  Iberia's contract with G.M.D. predates the reduction in force that gave rise to Pages' claim.   Since Pages has failed to present evidence suggesting that Iberia could, at its discretion, retain her and have G.M.D. eliminate Alos, any inference of age animus drawn from Iberia's \"retention\" of Alos would be simply unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we conclude that the comparisons Pages points to cannot support a reasonable inference of age animus on the part of Iberia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Pages' Puerto Rico Law No. 80 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pages also argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for Iberia on her claim under Puerto Rico Law No. 80.   Law No. 80 provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>[e]very employee in commerce, industry or any other business ... who is discharged from his [or her] employment without good cause, shall be entitled to receive from his employer, in addition to the salary he may have earned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(a) The salary corresponding to one month, as indemnity;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(b) An additional progressive indemnity equivalent to one week for each year of service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185a (emphasis added).   In response, Iberia argues that it had \"good cause\" to discharge Pages, pointing to &#167; 185b, which provides that \"[j]ust cause ... shall be understood to be ... reorganization changes ... [or] [r]eductions in employment made necessary by a reduction in the anticipated or prevailing volume of production, sales or profits at the time of the discharge.\"   29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185b(e)-(f).   Pages has not presented evidence to rebut Iberia's evidence that it eliminated its Sales Department after it had incurred substantial operating losses in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Pages points to &#167; 185c, which provides that, where employees are discharged due to reorganization or a reduction in production, sales or profits, \"it shall be the duty of the employer to retain those employees of greater seniority on the job with preference, provided there are positions vacant or filled by employees of less seniority in the job within their occupational classification which may be held by them....\"  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185c.   In the context of her Law No. 80 argument, Pages suggests that a comparison of her discharge with the retention of Executive Secretaries Garcia and Medina raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Iberia complied with Law No. 80.   According to Pages, she was more senior than Garcia or Medina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Pages has provided no evidence to rebut Garcia's testimony, in her sworn affidavit, that Garcia has in fact been with Iberia as long or longer than Pages.   We thus turn to the comparison with Medina, since the record evidence does suggest that Medina was less senior than Pages.   Pages argues that even though Medina's position was in Miramar, Puerto Rico, and Pages' was at the airport in Isla Verde, Iberia should have given Pages the option to transfer to Miramar to replace Medina.   This argument neglects two different provisions in Law No. 80.   First, Law No. 80 states that seniority need not be followed where \"there is a clear and conclusive difference in favor of the efficiency or capacity of the workers compared....\"  29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185c.   The relevant evidence shows that Medina's position at the Miramar office and Pages' position at the airport in Isla Verde were not fungible.   Medina had worked in Miramar since 1972, while Pages had worked in Isla Verde since 1970.   Without more evidence, the district court could have found that no genuine issue of material fact was raised as to the relative efficiency of keeping Medina in her own position, rather than transferring Pages, as it was Pages' airport position that was being eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Pages ignores &#167; 185c(a), which states in relevant part that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>[i]n the case of discharges or layoffs ... in companies that have several offices ... and whose usual and regular practice is not to transfer employees from one office ... to another, and that said units operate in a relatively independent manner with regard to personnel aspects, the seniority of the employees within the occupational classification subject to the layoff shall be computed by taking into consideration only those employees in the office ... in which said layoff shall occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185c(a).   Iberia has argued throughout that all but one position at the Airport has been eliminated since 1991, in accord with its reorganization plan, and that transfers were not possible due to the different nature of the tasks which the airport employees performed as compared to the Miramar office employees.   The only evidence to which Pages points fails to generate an issue of fact, since neither she, nor Medina, nor Garcia, has apparently been transferred since 1970, when Pages began work at Iberia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to Iberia on Pages' Law No. 80 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Lopez' Puerto Rico Law No. 379 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez also challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment on her claim under Puerto Rico Law No. 379 for overtime pay she contends Iberia owed her.   Puerto Rico Law No. 379 states, in pertinent part, that \"forty hours of work constitute a workweek,\" 29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 271, \"extra working hours are ... hours that an employee works for his employer in excess of forty during any week,\" &#167; 273(b), and \"[e]very employer who employs or permits an employee to work during extra hours, shall be bound to pay him for each extra hour a wage rate equal to double the rate agreed upon for regular hours,\" &#167; 274.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, concluded that the overtime provisions did not apply to Lopez, since &#167; 288 states that Law No. 379 does not apply to exempt \"employees\" working as \"executives, administrators, or professionals, as these terms may be defined by the Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board.\"   29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 288;  see, e.g., Lehman v. Ehret Inc., 103 D.P.R. 264, 267 (P.R.1975) (discussing the definition of \"administrator\").   Lopez challenges the district court's application of the Minimum Wage Board's Regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the authority granted it by &#167; 288, the Minimum Wage Board promulgated regulations by substantially adopting definitions found in the federal regulation on the same matter.   See Santiago v. Corco, 114 D.P.R. 267, 269 (P.R.1983).   On appeal, both parties argue for, and we agree with, the application of the short test, since it is undisputed that Pages' weekly salary was \"not less than &#167; 295,\" as the regulation requires for the short test's application.   Regulation No. 13, Article III(f), Fourth Revision, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board (1990).   As a result, she is excluded from the coverage of Law No. 379's provisions if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>(a) [she] perform[ed] office or nonmanual field work directly related to management policies or to general business operations of the employer or of the customers of the employer;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>(b) [she] customarily and regularly exercise[d] discretion and independent judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., Article III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez argues that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether she performed office work directly related to management policies or general business operations, and whether she customarily and regularly exercised discretion and independent judgment.   She argues specifically that she did not perform supervisory functions and that she was in fact an \"Executive Secretary\" despite her title of \"Coordinator B.\"   However, Article III(a) and (b) contain no requirement that one perform supervisory functions.   To be exempted from Law No. 379, one need only perform \"office ... work directly related to management policies or to general business operations of [one's] employer.\"   Article III(a).   Thus, Lopez' first assertion, even if believed, cannot create a genuine issue that would preclude a grant of summary judgment for Iberia, since it fails to respond to any relevant requirement in Regulation No. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we turn to Lopez' contention that she was an Executive Secretary rather than a Coordinator, and that Law No. 379 cannot apply to her as an Executive Secretary.   In addressing this assertion in the ADEA context, see supra, we rejected this contention as unsupported by a sworn statement, explicitly and directly contradicted by her sworn deposition, and rebutted by evidence Iberia proffered.   However, in the ADEA context the standard of review was whether Lopez showed evidence sufficient for the factfinder reasonably to conclude that she was discharged due to discriminatory intent.   We noted in passing that because Iberia's alleged mistitling of her position occurred three years' before her discharge, that fact, together with her lack of evidence, rendered any age inference unreasonable.   However, while it would be unreasonable for a finder of fact to think that an employer mistitled an employee's position to cloak its age discrimination years later, it would not be similarly unreasonable to believe that employers seeking to avoid paying overtime would mislabel a position to take advantage of Law No. 379's exemptions for managers, professionals and administrators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we evaluate Lopez' argument that she was in fact an \"executive secretary,\" assuming without concluding that she adequately proffered evidence to raise this issue.   Neither party has cited Puerto Rico case law interpreting Law No. 379 with respect to supervisory duties or to the title of \"Executive Secretary.\"   To determine whether Lopez' assertion could create a triable issue of fact, we may consider the federal regulations which implement the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.   See Lopez Vega v. Vega Otero, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span>, 246-47 (P.R.1974) (deciding that where appellee was an executive under the provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and its regulation, he could not maintain a claim against his employer for extra hours);  Rodriguez v. Concreto Mixto, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></span>, 575-76 (P.R.1970) (determining whether or not an employee or worker is a person employed in a bona fide executive capacity by following the rules set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.1 et seq.).   These regulations, in describing those exempt as \"administrative\" employees, note that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[i]n modern industrial parlance there has been a steady and increasing use of persons who assist an executive in the performance of his duties without themselves having executive authority.   Typical titles of persons in this group [include] ... executive secretary....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 541.201 (emphasis added).   As a result, even assuming that she was an Executive Secretary, that would not disqualify her from being an exempt employee, assuming that she did office work related to management policies and general business operations, and that she customarily and regularly exercised discretion and independent judgment.   Iberia's submitted evidence and Lopez' co-appellant Izquierdo's testimony as to Lopez' duties both presented ample evidence that Lopez exercised discretion and independent judgment.   In particular, Izquierdo stated that Lopez helped him supervise sales personnel;  coordinated the work of the salesmen;  attended social and civic activities \"to represent the company\";  and exercised her own discretion with respect to her work.   Because Lopez failed to present evidence to rebut Izquierdo's testimony, and given Iberia's evidence that she exercised discretion and independent judgment, we conclude that no issue of fact existed regarding this point.   As a result, we conclude that she falls under Regulation No. 13's exemption from Law No. 379, and thus the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her overtime pay claim to Iberia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellants' brief only attempts to raise an argument under Puerto Rico Law No. 80 with respect to Pages.   The brief makes a reference to Law No. 80, suggesting implications for Lopez' ADEA claim, but does not actually include an argument for a claim under Puerto Rico Law No. 80.   Therefore, Lopez and Izquierdo have waived any issues regarding the district court's grant of summary judgment on their Law No. 80 claims.   See Frazier v. Bailey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578605\"><a href=\"/opinion/578605/kevin-frazier-v-edward-n-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 932 n. 4 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that \"[a] state law claim which is not addressed in a brief is waived\").   Pages' Law No. 80 claim, however, has not been waived</p>\n        <p>Similarly, appellants have not included any argument regarding Puerto Rico Law No. 100 beyond a passing reference under Pages' Puerto Rico Law No. 80 claim.   As a result, appellants have also waived any issues regarding the district court's grant of summary judgment on their Law No. 100 claims.  Id.</p>\n        <p>While appellants' counsel asserted at oral argument that we should not find these arguments waived because the facts necessary to them were argued in the context of their appellate brief's ADEA argument, we must disagree.   In the absence of any discussion beyond citations to these Puerto Rico statutes, and in the absence of any submitted argument, we conclude that these arguments are waived.   See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Judges are not expected to be mindreaders.

However, an inference of age animus would be plainly unreasonable where the retained person was older.   And Izquierdo has not cited authority, and we have not found any, for the proposition that more senior, but younger, employees fall within the ADEA's protected class</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Lopez has also argued that, while she was appointed to the position of \"Coordinator B\" of the Sales Department on May 25, 1990, her title was fictitious, as she was actually an \"Executive Secretary.\"   This contention has several problems.   Although argued to the court, it was never supported by a sworn statement.   Additionally, Lopez herself contradicted this proposition;  in her deposition, she stated that \"regardless of what they wanted to call me, my work was [as a] Sales Coordinator.\"   Finally, Lopez' appointment to \"Coordinator B\" took place three years prior to her discharge.   It seems unlikely that Iberia promoted her to this fictitious position three years in advance with the intent of later using that title to discriminate against her.   As a result, we conclude that the district court correctly found that this contention could not reasonably be inferred from the evidence presented</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
