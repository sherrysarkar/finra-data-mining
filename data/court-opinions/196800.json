Roland  E. Huston, Jr.,  appeals from\r                                \r\n\nthe  district court's  dismissal of  his  suit against  a New\r\n\nHampshire  child support  enforcement  official and  his  ex-\r\n\nwife's  private attorney under 42  U.S.C.   1983.   We affirm\r\n\nsubstantially for the reasons given in the magistrate judge's\r\n\nreport  dated May  26, 1992,  and order  dated July  6, 1992,\r\n\nwhich  the  district  court   approved  in  its  order  dated\r\n\nSeptember 27, 1995.  We add only the following comments.\r\n\n          1.  From the  facts as alleged by appellant,  which\r\n\nwe  take as true, see  Coyne v. City  of Somerville, 972 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n440,  443 (1st Cir. 1992), no action adverse to his interests\r\n\nwas taken  as a result  of the letters haling  him into state\r\n\ncourt.  Nor was  the conduct of the state  agent \"conscience-\r\n\nshocking\" to the degree necessary to constitute a substantive\r\n\ndue process violation.  See Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748,754\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1990).   The  district court's  determination that\r\n\nappellant's  allegations  do  not  make  out  a  due  process\r\n\nviolation was correct.  \r\n\n          2.   Because  a    1983  conspiracy claim  requires\r\n\nproof of a constitutional  deprivation, Brennan v. Hendrigan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n888  F.2d 189,  195 (1st  Cir. 1989),  appellant's conspiracy\r\n\nclaim,  premised on  the alleged  due process  violation, was\r\n\nalso properly dismissed.\r\n\n          3.   Appellant's  abstention  argument is  rendered\r\n\nmoot by the magistrate's July 6, 1992, order and the district\r\n\ncourt's decision on the merits of the complaint.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
