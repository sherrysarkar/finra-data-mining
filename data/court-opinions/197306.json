Lawrence Schneider was convicted\r                                      \r\n\non  multiple counts of mail  and wire fraud  and now appeals,\r\n\npresenting two  difficult issues.  One  concerns the district\r\n\ncourt's refusal to allow Schneider's expert medical testimony\r\n\nproffered  as  pertinent to  his  state  of mind;  the  other\r\n\nrelates  to the denial of Schneider's  new trial motion based\r\n\non jury-questionnaire  information about  one of  the jurors.\r\n\nOn  both issues, we  agree with the  district court's outcome\r\n\nand affirm.\r\n\n     What  Schneider did  was  largely undisputed  at  trial,\r\n\nalthough  his  state  of  mind  was  very  much  in  dispute.\r\n\nSchneider ran two businesses from  his home in Warwick, Rhode\r\n\nIsland,  engaged  in  buying  and  selling  real  estate  and\r\n\nrestoration of old houses.   In mid-1990, Schneider was under\r\n\nfinancial  pressure and unable to pay his bills.  Starting in\r\n\nMay  1990 and continuing through  October 1990, he ordered on\r\n\ncredit a  variety of goods, including  computer equipment and\r\n\njewelry, the total value of which exceeded $200,000.\r\n\n     Beginning  shortly thereafter, Schneider began to resell\r\n\nthe same goods and pocket  the money.  Between June 1990  and\r\n\nOctober 1990,  Schneider placed 25  classified advertisements\r\n\nin  the Providence  daily newspaper,  offering to  resell the\r\n\ngoods  in question  at deep  discounts.   He gave  purchasers\r\n\nfalse  stories  about  the origin  of  the  goods  or how  he\r\n\nacquired them.  Schneider paid nothing to his suppliers.  The\r\r\n\ngovernment  describes  this as  a classic  \"bust-out\" scheme.\r\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. DeVincent, 632 F.2d 147, 149 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 986 (1980).\r                               \r\n\n     In December  1994, Schneider  was  indicted and  charged\r\n\nwith six counts  of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud\r\n\nbased on his  use of such  facilities in  the conduct of  his\r\n\nscheme.  18 U.S.C.    1343, 1341.  The government's theory of\r\n\nfraud  was that Schneider never intended to pay for the goods\r\n\nbut ordered them with  the aim of reselling them  immediately\r\n\nand bilking the  sellers.  In  addition, the government  also\r\n\nrelied upon  an affirmative misstatement, made  on several of\r\n\nSchneider's credit  applications, that  he had 35  employees,\r\n\nwhich was untrue.\r\n\n     Schneider did  not dispute the core  events described by\r\n\nthe government, but argued that he did not have the requisite\r\n\nspecific  intent  to defraud.   He  pointed  out that  he had\r\n\nbusinesses,  a home and a good credit rating, so his behavior\r\n\nmade no sense  as a  rational criminal act;  it followed,  he\r\n\nargues on  appeal, \"that his behavior  is inexplicable absent\r\n\nan  understanding  of the  defendant's  mental  status.\"   At\r\n\ntrial, he sought to introduce medical evidence to explain his\r\n\nbehavior.\r\n\n     The  proffered evidence was  testimony from two doctors.\r\n\nOne was Dr. Wartenberg,  who specialized in internal medicine\r\n\nand   addiction  medicine;   he  proposed  to   testify  that\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nSchneider's capacity and judgment were significantly impaired\r\n\nby  misprescription  and  overprescription  of  medical drugs\r\n\nduring the  relevant period.   A psychiatrist, Dr.  Roth, was\r\n\nalso  prepared  to testify  to  impaired  judgment, based  on\r\n\nchemical dependency and major depression with probable mania.\r\n\nThis testimony, of which  more will be said later,  was taken\r\n\nas an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury.\r\n\n     In  due  course,  the  district  judge  ruled  that  the\r\n\ntestimony would  not be admitted.  The court's explanation is\r\n\nsummed up in the final sentences of a longer oral ruling:\r\n\n     It seems to  me that the evidence does  not suggest\r\n     that the Defendant  did not act purposefully,  that\r\n     to accept this  evidence as a defense  [of lack of]\r\n     mens  rea manipulates the  concept of intent beyond\r\n     the  intent   required  and  that  under   all  the\r\n     circumstances,   having   considered  all   of  the\r\n     evidence,  the Court will  sustain the government's\r\n     objection  to any  offer of  that proof  before the\r\n     jury and Defendant may have an exception.\r\n\nAs a preface to this conclusion, the district court described\r\n\nin  some length the opinion  in United States  v. Pohlot, 827\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  889 (3d Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1011 (1988),\r                                                  \r\n\ndiscussing  the pertinence  of  psychiatric  testimony  in  a\r\n\nmurder-for-hire case.  \r\n\n     After this evidentiary ruling, the case was tried in May\r\n\n1995.  The jury  deadlocked on eight counts and  acquitted on\r\n\none count.   In October  1995, Schneider was  retried on  the\r\n\nremaining  eight counts.    The district  court stood  by its\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nearlier ruling that the medical testimony was not admissible.\r\n\nThis time the jury convicted on all eight counts.\r\n\n     Following  trial,  two  jurors  contacted  the  district\r\n\njudge, expressing  concerns about another member  of the jury\r\n\npanel.  On inquiry, the  district judge discovered that after\r\n\nthe verdict, the juror  in question had said that  she wanted\r\n\nto  get out  of jury  service  because she  was \"mental.\"   A\r\n\nreview of that juror's  questionnaire revealed that the juror\r\n\nhad affirmatively  answered the question:   \"Do you  have any\r\n\nphysical or mental disability that would interfere or prevent\r\n\nyou  from serving as  a juror?\"   On the reverse  side of the\r\n\nquestionnaire, the juror had written the following:\r\n\n          I  have  an upsetting  emotional handicap\r\n          since my children have been with the DCYF\r\n          [a  Rhode Island  state agency],  and the\r\n          strain  is sometimes too great for me and\r\n          the walking to the bus stop especially in\r\n          inclement  weather would be  kind of hard\r\n          at this time.  I am presently looking for\r\n          housing for my family.  \r\n\n     After  an  investigation of  the  juror  and a  personal\r\n\ninterview  by the district court, the court ruled that it was\r\n\n\"completely  satisfied  that  the  juror  was  competent  and\r\n\nmentally capable at the time of the trial . . . .\"  Schneider\r\n\nnevertheless sought a new  trial on the ground that  he would\r\n\nhave  used his  peremptory challenges  differently if  he had\r\n\nknown  about  the  information  in the  questionnaire.    The\r\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     In due course, Schneider  was sentenced to 33  months in\r\n\nprison  (he had a  prior conviction for  a \"bust-out\" offense\r\n\nsome years  before), and was  ordered to make  restitution of\r\n\nabout  $220,000.   On  this appeal,  he  claims as  error the\r\n\nrefusal  to admit the medical testimony; and he argues that a\r\n\nnew trial should have been granted because he could have used\r\n\na peremptory challenge to  dismiss the juror if he  had known\r\n\nof the information in the questionnaire.\r\n\n          We  begin with the harder of the two issues and ask\r\n\nwhether the district  court erred  in refusing  to admit  the\r\n\nmedical evidence.   The standard of review depends  upon what\r\n\nhas been decided:  rulings of law are reviewed  de novo while\r                                                                   \r\n\nreview   is   typically  deferential   on   so-called  \"mixed\r\n\nquestions.\"   Bergersen v. Commissioner of  Internal Revenue,\r                                                                        \r\n\n   F.3d   ,  1997 WL 120530, at *5 (1st  Cir. Mar. 21, 1997).\r\n\nHere, a legal issue--the meaning of a federal statute--stands\r\n\nat the threshold.\r\n\n     In  1984, Congress  enacted the Insanity  Defense Reform\r\n\nAct,  98  Stat. 2057,  redefining insanity  and making  it an\r\n\naffirmative  defense to  be  proved by  clear and  convincing\r\n\nevidence.   See  18 U.S.C.    17.   The statute  also states:\r                           \r\n\n\"Mental  disease or  defect does  not otherwise  constitute a\r\n\ndefense.\"  Id.   17(a).  Elsewhere, the government has argued\r                          \r\n\nthat  this quoted language is  meant to rule  out any mental-\r\n\ncondition  defense  or  testimony  that does  not  reach  the\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nheights  of  a  properly  pleaded insanity  defense.    E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nPohlot, 827 F.2d at 890.\r                  \r\n\n     In  this  case,  Schneider  did not  offer  an  insanity\r\n\ndefense, but he argues that his medical evidence is pertinent\r\n\nin helping a jury  decide whether he had the  requisite state\r\n\nof  mind necessary for the offense  charged.  The government,\r\n\nin  turn,  says   that  a  number  of  courts  have  admitted\r\n\npsychological  evidence  to negate  specific  intent  but the\r\n\nFirst  Circuit  has  suggested  otherwise;1  that  the  First\r\n\nCircuit's view is consistent  with the final sentence  of the\r\n\nstatute just quoted; and  that it is nevertheless unnecessary\r\n\nto resolve the issue  in this case because the  evidence here\r\n\nwas not relevant in any event.\r\n\n     Aside  from  the final  sentence  of  section 17(a),  in\r\n\nprinciple there should be  no bar to medical evidence  that a\r\n\ndefendant, although not insane, lacked the requisite state of\r\n\nmind.  As LaFave and Scott say:\r\n\n     The  reception  of   evidence  of  the  defendant's\r\n     abnormal  mental condition, totally  apart from the\r\n     defense  of  insanity,  is   certainly  appropriate\r\n     whenever that evidence is  relevant to the issue of\r\n     whether  he  had  the   mental  state  which  is  a\r\n     necessary element of the crime charged.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Compare United States v.

See United States v. Marenghi, 893  F. Supp. 85,\r                                                      \r\n\n89 (D. Me. 1995) (collecting cases).  After all, if  state of\r\n\nmind is  a potential  issue--as it  is in  most  but not  all\r\n\ncriminal  cases--why   should  expert  medical   evidence  be\r\n\nexcluded out of hand?\r\n\n     We  doubt that the  final sentence of  section 17(a) was\r\n\nintended  to  exclude   mental-condition  evidence  short  of\r\n\ninsanity.   Pohlot  canvassed  the arguments  and legislative\r                              \r\n\nhistory  at length, and  concluded (1) that  the statute does\r\n\nnot preclude a  defendant from offering evidence  to negate a\r\n\nrequisite state of mind, 827 F.2d at 903, but (2) that--apart\r\n\nfrom  such a  negation--it does  preclude any  other new  and\r\n\ndifferent defense of  diminished responsibility to excuse  or\r\n\nmitigate the  offense.   Id. at  905-06.2  Pohlot's  analysis\r                                                             \r\n\nseems to us persuasive on both issues.\r\n\n     Similarly, our  own decisions in White  and Kepreos were\r                                                                    \r\n\nnot  intended  to  establish  a  general  rule  that  mental-\r\n\ncondition evidence is always  inadmissible except in relation\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Although phrases like \"diminished responsibility\" are\r\nsometimes used to refer to evidence that negates intent, see\r                                                                        \r\ngenerally 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra,   4.7, a different but\r                                             \r\nsimilarly named concept was developing in a few courts--prior\r\nto the new federal statute--to excuse or lessen\r\nresponsibility, even where the impairment would not make out\r\nan insanity defense or negate required intent.

Dr.  Wartenberg  had  examined  Schneider  for\r\n\napproximately an  hour and  a half  and reviewed  his medical\r\n\nrecords, including medicines prescribed for him over a three-\r\n\nor four-year period.  In his offer of proof, the doctor  said\r\n\nthat the prescriptions were medically  inappropriate and that\r\n\nthe  drugs as prescribed  \"would impair intellectual function\r\n\nin  a variety  of  ways,\" produce  blackouts, roller  coaster\r\n\nhighs and lows,  and permit misperception and delusion.   Dr.\r\n\nWartenberg summarized his view as follows:\r\n\n             My  opinion is  that  to  a degree  of\r\n          reasonable  medical  certainty  that  Mr.\r\n          Schneider's     intellectual    capacity,\r\n          cognitive   function,  ability   to  make\r\n          executive  judgments and  decisions would\r\n          have been  impaired by that level of drug\r\n          prescribing.\r\n\n     On  cross-examination,  government  counsel  secured  an\r\n\nadmission that  Schneider during this period  could engage in\r\n\n\"activity that is  planned to  carry out a  purpose.\"   Quite\r\n\nproperly, neither  side asked  Dr. Wartenberg  the \"ultimate\"\r\n\nquestion  whether Schneider  had  intended  to defraud,  such\r\n\nultimate  questions  to experts  now  being  forbidden as  to\r\n\nmental state in a  criminal case under Fed. R.  Evid. 704(b),\r\n\nwhich is a  companion amendment  to section 17.   See  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Meader, 914 F. Supp. 656, 658 (D. Me. 1996).\r                            \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     The   expert  psychiatrist,   Dr.  Roth,   also  offered\r\n\ntestimony after interviewing Schneider and examining records.\r\n\nHe said that Schneider  suffered from chemical dependency and\r\n\n\"major depression with  probable mania.\"   He said also  that\r\n\nthese conditions \"impair[ed] . . . judgment.\"  He declined to\r\n\nexpress  a view  on  Schneider's ability  to form  a purpose,\r\n\nsaying that he (Dr. Roth) was not there at the time, and that\r\n\nterms like \"purposeful\" posed a metaphysical question.\r\n\n     As we  read the district  judge's ruling, he  deemed the\r\n\nmedical testimony  both irrelevant  and misleading.   Our own\r\n\nview is that the evidence may  have been relevant but only to\r\n\na limited degree, and  that it had a substantial  capacity to\r\n\nmislead  the  jury.   And we  think  that the  district court\r\n\nclearly would  exclude the evidence  under Fed. R.  Evid. 403\r\n\neven  if told  to view it  as having  limited relevance.   To\r\n\nremand,  in  order  to  make  the  district  judge  say  this\r\n\nexplicitly, is  a waste of time.  Let us take these points in\r\n\nturn.\r\n\n     Relevance,    the    ordinary    starting   point    for\r\n\nadmissibility,  Fed. R. Evid. 401,  is a close  issue.  Here,\r\n\nthe government  urged that  Schneider had ordered  the goods,\r\n\nexpecting never to pay for them but to resell them and pocket\r\n\nthe money  and thereby  \"intended to deceive.\"3   Schneider's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3This, more precisely, is the \"specific intent\" element\r\nthat Schneider's evidence purported to negate.  The fraud\r\ncharge in this case has several different elements (e.g., use\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nanswer was that he lacked this state of mind  and the medical\r\n\nevidence  helped  him support  this  view,  that  is (in  the\r\n\nlanguage of  the rule), that  the medical testimony  made his\r\n\nintent to defraud \"less probable than it would be without the\r\n\nevidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 401.\r\n\n     The  sum of the doctors' evidence  is that Schneider was\r\n\ndepressed,  that  he  had   impaired  judgment  (due  to  his\r\n\ndepressed state and overmedication),  and that he was subject\r\n\nto blackouts.  This might not  appear at first to go very far\r\n\nin   negating  his   capacity   to  deceive,   especially  as\r\n\nSchneider's scheme  continued  over  several  months.    This\r\n\nexplains the district court's  view that the medical evidence\r\n\ndid not negate an intent to deceive but instead amounted to a\r\n\nforbidden claim in mitigation.\r\n\n     Still,  evidence  may  be  \"relevant\" under  Rule  401's\r\n\ndefinition, even if it fails to prove or disprove the fact at\r\n\nissue--whether taken  alone or in combination  with all other\r\n\nhelpful  evidence on that issue.  In the latter instance, the\r\n\njudge could direct a verdict if the issue were essential, but\r\n\nnot  against the defendant  in a criminal  case.  Schneider's\r               \r\n\nbest argument is, therefore, that his medical evidence did go\r\n\nsome  distance  to  negate  intent  to  deceive  and  so  was\r\n\nrelevant.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nof the mails) for which there may also be state of mind\r\nrequirements but they are not important here.  See generally\r                                                                        \r\n2 Sand et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions 44-5 (1996).\r                                                           \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n     Where evidence goes  \"some distance\" but manifestly  not\r\n\nfar  enough,  it  may  be tempting  to  say  that  it is  not\r\n\nrelevant.   Frankly, Pohlot appears to us to take this course\r                                       \r\n\nby ruling  that the psychological evidence  of impairment was\r\n\nirrelevant  because   \"by  his  own  admission,\"  Pohlot  had\r                                                                    \r\n\n\"finalized an  agreement to have  his wife murdered  and this\r\n\n`purpose'  to  hire someone  to  kill  his  wife  was  enough\r\n\nregardless of  whether he  `psychologically . .  . understood\r\n\nthe full consequences of this activity.'\"  827 F.2d at 889.\r\n\n     But we have  some doubt  that this  usage comports  with\r\n\nRule  401's  definition quoted  above.   Nor  do we  think it\r\n\nhelpful in  a case like  ours to ask, as  Pohlot did, whether\r                                                            \r\n\nthe conduct was \"purposeful.\"  Pohlot said that the  ordinary\r                                                 \r\n\nmens  rea  requirement  is   satisfied  \"by  any  showing  of\r                     \r\n\npurposeful   activity,   regardless   of  its   psychological\r\n\norigins.\"    827 F.2d  at  904.   But  it  is quite  possible\r\n\npurposefully  to order goods on credit, and later not pay for\r\n\nthem, without having an intent to deceive.\r\n\n     Pohlot's other theme is the capacity of evidence of this\r                       \r\n\nkind  to mislead.  Congress raised the hurdle for an insanity\r\n\ndefense  and barred  a new  diminished capacity  defense that\r\n\ncourts were  beginning to invent.  Yet  the evidence offered,\r\n\nboth  here and  in Pohlot,  suggests that  the defendant  was\r                                     \r\n\ntemporarily out  of his mind  (even though  not insane  under\r\n\nsection 17(a))  and  that  his crime  was  mitigated  by  his\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\npsychological condition.  Such evidence  tends to reintroduce\r\n\nthe very concepts that Congress wanted to exclude and thereby\r\n\nto mislead the jury.\r\n\n     In weighing relevance against ruck under Rule 403.   The\r\n\ngovernment does not now  challenge the evidence as unreliable\r\n\nunder Daubert--only its pertinence  to this case.  Nor  do we\r                         \r\n\npropose to decide here the issue explicitly reserved in Shay,\r                                                                        \r\n\nnamely,  whether and  when  the judge  may exclude  otherwise\r\n\nrelevant  expert evidence  on  the ground  that  it will  not\r\n\n\"assist\"  the jury.   See  Shay, 57  F.3d at  132-33.   It is\r                                           \r\n\nenough  that exclusion of the evidence here under Rule 403 is\r\n\neminently justifiable.\r\n\n     The evidence, as we have said, is of limited  relevance:\r\n\nshowing \"impaired\"  judgment might help  piece out a  lack of\r\n\ndeceit  claim but falls well  short of sufficient  proof.  At\r\n\nthe same time, the expert testimony offered here could easily\r\n\nmislead the jury into thinking that such  a medical condition\r\n\namounts to  temporary insanity  or  ameliorates the  offense.\r\n\nThe  instructions  required here  to guard  the jury  on this\r\n\nscore  would likely have gone  very far to  eliminate any use\r\n\nthe evidence might otherwise have to the defendant.\r\n\n     Thus, we conclude  that the district  court was free  to\r\n\nexclude  this evidence  on the  ground that  its capacity  to\r\n\nmislead  the   jury  substantially  outweighed   its  limited\r\n\nrelevance.   Since exclusion was permitted  but not required,\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nwe  could  remand for  an  explicit finding  under  Rule 403.\r\n\nShay, 57 F.3d at 134.  But given the district court's evident\r                \r\n\nview  of  the  matter,  our  limited  disagreement  with  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's reasoning  would hardly alter  the district\r\n\ncourt's desire to exclude the evidence.  A remand would serve\r\n\nno purpose.   See  United  States v. Dolloph, 75  F.3d 35, 38\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 1866 (1996).\r                                    \r\n\n     Although   our   concerns   about   such   evidence  are\r\n\nconsiderable,  we shrink  from  any generic  rule that  would\r\n\nforbid the district courts from resolving admissibility  case\r\n\nby  case.   Offenses  differ  from  each  other; the  medical\r\n\nevidence, taken alone and in combination with other evidence,\r\n\nis  going to  vary  widely;  and this  is  an area  in  which\r\n\neveryone is still  learning.   In the spirit  of Daubert,  we\r                                                                    \r\n\nrely heavily on the wise superintendence of the  trial court.\r\n\n509 U.S. at 592-93.  In this case we have no quarrel with how\r\n\nit was exercised.\r\n\n     This  brings us  to Schneider's  second claim  of error,\r\n\nnamely,  that the district court erred in refusing to grant a\r\n\nnew trial.  The basis  of the new trial motion was (so far as\r\n\npertinent  here)  that  the  juror  questionnaire  would,  if\r\n\ndisclosed,  have  revealed   mental  or  emotional   problems\r\n\npertaining to  the juror  in question, perhaps  prompting the\r\n\nuse of a peremptory challenge to remove the juror.  Again, in\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nconsidering  the  district court's  action,  our  standard of\r\n\nreview depends upon what the district judge decided.  \r\n\n     The district  court ruled that Schneider  had waived his\r\n\nobjection  because he  failed to move  for disclosure  of the\r\n\nquestionnaire answers prior  to empanelment.  We  took such a\r\n\nview in United States  v. Uribe, 890 F.2d 554, 561  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1989), but stopped  just short of  a definitive finding  that\r\n\nthe Rhode Island federal  juror selection plan permitted such\r\n\naccess to  jury questionnaires.

Aponte-Suarez, 905 F.2d 483, 492 (1st Cir.),\r                                          \r\n\ncert. denied, 498 U.S. 990 (1990).\r                        \r\n\n     On the other hand, Schneider has abandoned on appeal any\r\n\neffort  to  show  actual  prejudice  (e.g.,  by  pointing  to\r                                                      \r\n\ncharacteristics of  the juror  that would likely  have caused\r\n\nher to take an adverse view of Schneider or to fall under the\r\n\nsway of other  jurors).   Such contentions were  made in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court but were  rejected and  are not  now pursued.\r\n\nSchneider's   position  instead  is  that  prejudice  is  not\r\n\nrequired, and he relies on our own statement in United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Vargas, 606 F.2d 341, 346 (1st Cir. 1979):\r                     \r\n\n     [T]here  is  little  doubt  that if  the  court  or\r\n     prosecution  deprives a  defendant of his  right to\r\n     the effective exercise of peremptory challenges, it\r\n     would, without more, be grounds for a new trial.\r\n\n     In  a  number  of   cases  involving  interference  with\r\n\nperemptory challenges, the reviewing  court has treated proof\r\n\nof prejudice as unnecessary.   See United States v. Annigoni,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n96  F.3d  1132, 1141  (9th Cir.  1996) (en  banc) (collecting\r\n\ncases). But  such cases normally involve  a deliberate denial\r\n\nor interference.   Without automatic  reversal, such  conduct\r\n\ncould   rarely  be  corrected;  by  definition,  lawyers  use\r\n\nperemptories where a challenge for cause will not work.\r\n\n     By contrast, a failure of the district court's screening\r\n\napparatus  to  uncover  some   piece  of  potentially  useful\r\n\ninformation in a raft of  jury questionnaires is, if  \"error\"\r\n\nat all, a mistake of quite  a different kind.  At worst, such\r\n\na  mistake might  resemble the  failure of  the judge  to ask\r\n\nadequate voir  dire questions,  where we have  insisted on  a\r\n\nshowing  of prejudice.  United States v.

One concerns the district court's refusal to allow Schneider's expert medical testimony proffered as pertinent to his state of mind;  the other relates to the denial of Schneider's new trial motion based on jury-questionnaire information about one of the jurors.  On both issues, we agree with the district court's outcome and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What Schneider did was largely undisputed at trial, although his state of mind was very much in dispute.  Schneider ran two businesses from his home in Warwick, Rhode Island, engaged in buying and selling real estate and restoration of old houses.  In mid-1990, Schneider was under financial pressure and unable to pay his bills.  Starting in May 1990 and continuing through October 1990, he ordered on credit a variety of goods, including computer equipment and jewelry, the total value of which exceeded $200,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning shortly thereafter, Schneider began to resell the same goods and pocket the money.  Between June 1990 and October 1990, Schneider placed 25 classified advertisements in the Providence daily newspaper, offering to resell the goods in question at deep discounts.  He gave purchasers false stories about the origin of the goods or how he acquired them.  Schneider paid nothing to his suppliers.  The government describes this as a classic \"bust-out\" scheme.  See, e.g., United States v. DeVincent, 632 F.2d 147, 149 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 986, 101 S.Ct. 405, 66 L.Ed.2d 249 (1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1994, Schneider was indicted and charged with six counts of wire fraud and three counts of mail fraud based on his use of such facilities in the conduct of his scheme.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343, 1341.  The government's theory of fraud was that Schneider never intended to pay for the goods but ordered them with the aim of reselling them immediately and bilking the sellers.  In addition, the government also relied upon an affirmative misstatement, made on several of Schneider's credit applications, that he had 35 employees, which was untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Schneider did not dispute the core events described by the government, but argued that he did not have the requisite specific intent to defraud.  He pointed out that he had businesses, a home and a good credit rating, so his behavior made no sense as a rational criminal act;  it followed, he argues on appeal, \"that his behavior is inexplicable absent an understanding of the defendant's mental status.\"   At trial, he sought to introduce medical evidence to explain his behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proffered evidence was testimony from two doctors.  One was Dr. Wartenberg, who specialized in internal medicine and addiction medicine;  he proposed to testify that Schneider's capacity and judgment were significantly impaired by misprescription and overprescription of medical drugs during the relevant period.  A psychiatrist, Dr. Roth, was also prepared to testify to impaired judgment, based on chemical dependency and major depression with probable mania.  This testimony, of which more will be said later, was taken as an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district judge ruled that the testimony would not be admitted.  The court's explanation is summed up in the final sentences of a longer oral ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>It seems to me that the evidence does not suggest that the Defendant did not act purposefully, that to accept this evidence as a defense [of lack of] mens rea manipulates the concept of intent beyond the intent required and that under all the circumstances, having considered all of the evidence, the Court will sustain the government's objection to any offer of that proof before the jury and Defendant may have an exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preface to this conclusion, the district court described in some length the opinion in United States v. Pohlot, 827 F.2d 889 (3d Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1011, 108 S.Ct. 710, 98 L.Ed.2d 660 (1988), discussing the pertinence of psychiatric testimony in a murder-for-hire case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this evidentiary ruling, the case was tried in May 1995.  The jury deadlocked on eight counts and acquitted on one count.  In October 1995, Schneider was retried on the remaining eight counts.  The district court stood by its earlier ruling that the medical testimony was not admissible.  This time the jury convicted on all eight counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following trial, two jurors contacted the district judge, expressing concerns about another member of the jury panel.  On inquiry, the district judge discovered that after the verdict, the juror in question had said that she wanted to get out of jury service because she was \"mental.\"   A review of that juror's questionnaire revealed that the juror had affirmatively answered the question:  \"Do you have any physical or mental disability that would interfere or prevent you from serving as a juror?\"   On the reverse side of the questionnaire, the juror had written the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>I have an upsetting emotional handicap since my children have been with the DCYF [a Rhode Island state agency], and the strain is sometimes too great for me and the walking to the bus stop especially in inclement weather would be kind of hard at this time.  I am presently looking for housing for my family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an investigation of the juror and a personal interview by the district court, the court ruled that it was \"completely satisfied that the juror was competent and mentally capable at the time of the trial....\"  Schneider nevertheless sought a new trial on the ground that he would have used his peremptory challenges differently if he had known about the information in the questionnaire.  The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Schneider was sentenced to 33 months in prison (he had a prior conviction for a \"bust-out\" offense some years before), and was ordered to make restitution of about $220,000.  On this appeal, he claims as error the refusal to admit the medical testimony;  and he argues that a new trial should have been granted because he could have used a peremptory challenge to dismiss the juror if he had known of the information in the questionnaire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the harder of the two issues and ask whether the district court erred in refusing to admit the medical evidence.  The standard of review depends upon what has been decided:  rulings of law are reviewed de novo while review is typically deferential on so-called \"mixed questions.\"  Bergersen v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 109 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir.1997).  Here, a legal issue--the meaning of a federal statute--stands at the threshold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Congress enacted the Insanity Defense Reform Act, 98 Stat. 2057, redefining insanity and making it an affirmative defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 17.  The statute also states:  \"Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.\"  Id. &#167; 17(a).  Elsewhere, the government has argued that this quoted language is meant to rule out any mental-condition defense or testimony that does not reach the heights of a properly pleaded insanity defense.  E.g., Pohlot, 827 F.2d at 890.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Schneider did not offer an insanity defense, but he argues that his medical evidence is pertinent in helping a jury decide whether he had the requisite state of mind necessary for the offense charged.  The government, in turn, says that a number of courts have admitted psychological evidence to negate specific intent but the First Circuit has suggested otherwise;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  that the First Circuit's view is consistent with the final sentence of the statute just quoted;  and that it is nevertheless unnecessary to resolve the issue in this case because the evidence here was not relevant in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the final sentence of section 17(a), in principle there should be no bar to medical evidence that a defendant, although not insane, lacked the requisite state of mind.  As LaFave and Scott say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>The reception of evidence of the defendant's abnormal mental condition, totally apart from the defense of insanity, is certainly appropriate whenever that evidence is relevant to the issue of whether he had the mental state which is a necessary element of the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 4.7, at 530.  The circuits that have considered the question have taken this view.  See United States v. Marenghi, 893 F.Supp. 85, 89 (D.Me.1995) (collecting cases).  After all, if state of mind is a potential issue--as it is in most but not all criminal cases--why should expert medical evidence be excluded out of hand?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We doubt that the final sentence of section 17(a) was intended to exclude mental-condition evidence short of insanity.  Pohlot canvassed the arguments and legislative history at length, and concluded (1) that the statute does not preclude a defendant from offering evidence to negate a requisite state of mind, 827 F.2d at 903, but (2) that--apart from such a negation--it does preclude any other new and different defense of diminished responsibility to excuse or mitigate the offense.  Id. at 905-06.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Pohlot 's analysis seems to us persuasive on both issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, our own decisions in White and Kepreos were not intended to establish a general rule that mental-condition evidence is always inadmissible except in relation to insanity.  In Kepreos, the court held that the specific psychiatric testimony involved was misleading and of doubtful utility, 759 F.2d at 964;  in White, where no coercion defense was offered, the court rejected psychiatric evidence that a defendant engaged in a drug crime because \"she was unable to resist her mother's request for assistance....\"  766 F.2d at 24.   These cases largely turn upon their facts.  See Marenghi, 893 F.Supp. at 88-91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past the threshold of section 17(a), the situation becomes more difficult for the defendant.  The specific medical evidence offered may still be irrelevant to the requisite intent, White, 766 F.2d at 24, or probative value may be substantially outweighed by confusion or delay.  Fed.R.Evid. 403;  Kepreos, 759 F.2d at 964.   Finally, if the evidence is expert testimony, it must meet the further requisites of scientific reliability and helpfulness to the jury.  Fed.R.Evid. 702;  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589-91, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2794-96, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding such issues--relevance, confusion, reliability, helpfulness--the district court has a comparative advantage over an appeals panel.  The issues typically involve unique fact patterns and judgments of degree, and the district judge is closer to the case.  Thus, so long as there is no misstatement of the legal standard and the result reached is not clearly unreasonable, the district judge's ruling is usually respected.  United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we return to the testimony in this case.  Dr. Wartenberg had examined Schneider for approximately an hour and a half and reviewed his medical records, including medicines prescribed for him over a three- or four-year period.  In his offer of proof, the doctor said that the prescriptions were medically inappropriate and that the drugs as prescribed \"would impair intellectual function in a variety of ways,\" produce blackouts, roller coaster highs and lows, and permit misperception and delusion.  Dr. Wartenberg summarized his view as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My opinion is that to a degree of reasonable medical certainty that Mr. Schneider's intellectual capacity, cognitive function, ability to make executive judgments and decisions would have been impaired by that level of drug prescribing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, government counsel secured an admission that Schneider during this period could engage in \"activity that is planned to carry out a purpose.\"   Quite properly, neither side asked Dr. Wartenberg the \"ultimate\" question whether Schneider had intended to defraud, such ultimate questions to experts now being forbidden as to mental state in a criminal case under Fed.R.Evid. 704(b), which is a companion amendment to section 17.  See United States v. Meader, 914 F.Supp. 656, 658 (D.Me.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expert psychiatrist, Dr. Roth, also offered testimony after interviewing Schneider and examining records.  He said that Schneider suffered from chemical dependency and \"major depression with probable mania.\"   He said also that these conditions \"impair[ed] ... judgment.\"   He declined to express a view on Schneider's ability to form a purpose, saying that he (Dr. Roth) was not there at the time, and that terms like \"purposeful\" posed a metaphysical question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we read the district judge's ruling, he deemed the medical testimony both irrelevant and misleading.  Our own view is that the evidence may have been relevant but only to a limited degree, and that it had a substantial capacity to mislead the jury.  And we think that the district court clearly would exclude the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403 even if told to view it as having limited relevance.  To remand, in order to make the district judge say this explicitly, is a waste of time.  Let us take these points in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relevance, the ordinary starting point for admissibility, Fed.R.Evid. 401, is a close issue.  Here, the government urged that Schneider had ordered the goods, expecting never to pay for them but to resell them and pocket the money and thereby \"intended to deceive.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Schneider's answer was that he lacked this state of mind and the medical evidence helped him support this view, that is (in the language of the rule), that the medical testimony made his intent to defraud \"less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 401.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sum of the doctors' evidence is that Schneider was depressed, that he had impaired judgment (due to his depressed state and overmedication), and that he was subject to blackouts.  This might not appear at first to go very far in negating his capacity to deceive, especially as Schneider's scheme continued over several months.  This explains the district court's view that the medical evidence did not negate an intent to deceive but instead amounted to a forbidden claim in mitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, evidence may be \"relevant\" under Rule 401's definition, even if it fails to prove or disprove the fact at issue--whether taken alone or in combination with all other helpful evidence on that issue.  In the latter instance, the judge could direct a verdict if the issue were essential, but not against the defendant in a criminal case.  Schneider's best argument is, therefore, that his medical evidence did go some distance to negate intent to deceive and so was relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where evidence goes \"some distance\" but manifestly not far enough, it may be tempting to say that it is not relevant.  Frankly, Pohlot appears to us to take this course by ruling that the psychological evidence of impairment was irrelevant because \"by his own admission,\" Pohlot had \"finalized an agreement to have his wife murdered and this 'purpose' to hire someone to kill his wife was enough regardless of whether he 'psychologically ... understood the full consequences of this activity.' \"  827 F.2d at 889.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we have some doubt that this usage comports with Rule 401's definition quoted above.  Nor do we think it helpful in a case like ours to ask, as Pohlot did, whether the conduct was \"purposeful.\"  Pohlot said that the ordinary mens rea requirement is satisfied \"by any showing of purposeful activity, regardless of its psychological origins.\"  827 F.2d at 904.   But it is quite possible purposefully to order goods on credit, and later not pay for them, without having an intent to deceive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pohlot 's other theme is the capacity of evidence of this kind to mislead.  Congress raised the hurdle for an insanity defense and barred a new diminished capacity defense that courts were beginning to invent.  Yet the evidence offered, both here and in Pohlot, suggests that the defendant was temporarily out of his mind (even though not insane under section 17(a)) and that his crime was mitigated by his psychological condition.  Such evidence tends to reintroduce the very concepts that Congress wanted to exclude and thereby to mislead the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In weighing relevance against confusion, we will assume for the present purposes that this balance is to be struck under Rule 403.  The government does not now challenge the evidence as unreliable under Daubert--only its pertinence to this case.  Nor do we propose to decide here the issue explicitly reserved in Shay, namely, whether and when the judge may exclude otherwise relevant expert evidence on the ground that it will not \"assist\" the jury.  See Shay, 57 F.3d at 132-33.   It is enough that exclusion of the evidence here under Rule 403 is eminently justifiable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, as we have said, is of limited relevance:  showing \"impaired\" judgment might help piece out a lack of deceit claim but falls well short of sufficient proof.  At the same time, the expert testimony offered here could easily mislead the jury into thinking that such a medical condition amounts to temporary insanity or ameliorates the offense.  The instructions required here to guard the jury on this score would likely have gone very far to eliminate any use the evidence might otherwise have to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that the district court was free to exclude this evidence on the ground that its capacity to mislead the jury substantially outweighed its limited relevance.  Since exclusion was permitted but not required, we could remand for an explicit finding under Rule 403.  Shay, 57 F.3d at 134.   But given the district court's evident view of the matter, our limited disagreement with the district court's reasoning would hardly alter the district court's desire to exclude the evidence.  A remand would serve no purpose.  See United States v. Dolloph, 75 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1866, 134 L.Ed.2d 963 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our concerns about such evidence are considerable, we shrink from any generic rule that would forbid the district courts from resolving admissibility case by case.  Offenses differ from each other;  the medical evidence, taken alone and in combination with other evidence, is going to vary widely;  and this is an area in which everyone is still learning.  In the spirit of Daubert, we rely heavily on the wise superintendence of the trial court.  509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796-97.   In this case we have no quarrel with how it was exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Schneider's second claim of error, namely, that the district court erred in refusing to grant a new trial.  The basis of the new trial motion was (so far as pertinent here) that the juror questionnaire would, if disclosed, have revealed mental or emotional problems pertaining to the juror in question, perhaps prompting the use of a peremptory challenge to remove the juror.  Again, in considering the district court's action, our standard of review depends upon what the district judge decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Schneider had waived his objection because he failed to move for disclosure of the questionnaire answers prior to empanelment.  We took such a view in United States v. Uribe, 890 F.2d 554, 561 (1st Cir.1989), but stopped just short of a definitive finding that the Rhode Island federal juror selection plan permitted such access to jury questionnaires.  Id. In affirming, Uribe relied heavily on the alternative ground that the defendant had suffered no prejudice from the nondisclosure.  Id. at 562.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the parties seek to litigate at length whether Schneider did have effective access to the jury questionnaires, which the governing statute treats somewhat differently than juror lists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Neither the statute nor the Rhode Island plan are crystal clear about access to questionnaires.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1867(f);  Davenport, 824 F.2d at 1515.   We have previously interpreted the statute not to allow inspection of questionnaires \"solely to aid in the voir dire process.\"  Jewell v. Arctic Enterprises, 801 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to rest our decision on waiver or forfeiture.  Assuming arguendo that Schneider might have sought access to the questionnaire based on a showing of need, before trial he had no basis for such a motion.  This is not a case where, prior to empanelment, the defendant knew or should have known of a potential problem with a juror and failed to ask for the questionnaire.  E.g., United States v. Aponte-Suarez, 905 F.2d 483, 492 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 990, 111 S.Ct. 531, 112 L.Ed.2d 541 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, Schneider has abandoned on appeal any effort to show actual prejudice (e.g., by pointing to characteristics of the juror that would likely have caused her to take an adverse view of Schneider or to fall under the sway of other jurors).  Such contentions were made in the district court but were rejected and are not now pursued.  Schneider's position instead is that prejudice is not required, and he relies on our own statement in United States v. Vargas, 606 F.2d 341, 346 (1st Cir.1979):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>[T]here is little doubt that if the court or prosecution deprives a defendant of his right to the effective exercise of peremptory challenges, it would, without more, be grounds for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a number of cases involving interference with peremptory challenges, the reviewing court has treated proof of prejudice as unnecessary.  See United States v. Annigoni, 96 F.3d 1132, 1141 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc) (collecting cases).  But such cases normally involve a deliberate denial or interference.  Without automatic reversal, such conduct could rarely be corrected;  by definition, lawyers use peremptories where a challenge for cause will not work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, a failure of the district court's screening apparatus to uncover some piece of potentially useful information in a raft of jury questionnaires is, if \"error\" at all, a mistake of quite a different kind.  At worst, such a mistake might resemble the failure of the judge to ask adequate voir dire questions, where we have insisted on a showing of prejudice.  United States v. Anagnos, 853 F.2d 1, 3-5 (1st Cir.1988).  See also 9A Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2482 at 115 &amp; n. 8 (2d ed.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not try to draw a definitive line between cases where a showing of prejudice is required and cases where it is not, as this one so clearly falls on the former side of the line.  There was no direct interference with a peremptory challenge, cf.  United States v. Cambara, 902 F.2d 144, 147-48 (1st Cir.1990), and no indication that useful information was deliberately withheld.  Here, as in Vargas (where a juror withheld information), \"[a] new trial [without a showing of prejudice] would be a windfall for the defendant\" without much countervailing benefit.  606 F.2d at 346.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Compare United States v.

One concerns the district court's refusal to allow Schneider's expert medical testimony proffered as pertinent to his state of mind;  the other relates to the denial of Schneider's new trial motion based on jury-questionnaire information about one of the jurors.  On both issues, we agree with the district court's outcome and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What Schneider did was largely undisputed at trial, although his state of mind was very much in dispute.  Schneider ran two businesses from his home in Warwick, Rhode Island, engaged in buying and selling real estate and restoration of old houses.  In mid-1990, Schneider was under financial pressure and unable to pay his bills.  Starting in May 1990 and continuing through October 1990, he ordered on credit a variety of goods, including computer equipment and jewelry, the total value of which exceeded $200,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning shortly thereafter, Schneider began to resell the same goods and pocket the money.  Between June 1990 and October 1990, Schneider placed 25 classified advertisements in the Providence daily newspaper, offering to resell the goods in question at deep discounts.  He gave purchasers false stories about the origin of the goods or how he acquired them.  Schneider paid nothing to his suppliers.  The government describes this as a classic \"bust-out\" scheme.  See, e.g., United States v. DeVincent, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382752\"><a href=\"/opinion/382752/united-states-v-richard-devincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 149 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government's theory of fraud was that Schneider never intended to pay for the goods but ordered them with the aim of reselling them immediately and bilking the sellers.  In addition, the government also relied upon an affirmative misstatement, made on several of Schneider's credit applications, that he had 35 employees, which was untrue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Schneider did not dispute the core events described by the government, but argued that he did not have the requisite specific intent to defraud.  He pointed out that he had businesses, a home and a good credit rating, so his behavior made no sense as a rational criminal act;  it followed, he argues on appeal, \"that his behavior is inexplicable absent an understanding of the defendant's mental status.\"   At trial, he sought to introduce medical evidence to explain his behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proffered evidence was testimony from two doctors.  One was Dr. Wartenberg, who specialized in internal medicine and addiction medicine;  he proposed to testify that Schneider's capacity and judgment were significantly impaired by misprescription and overprescription of medical drugs during the relevant period.  A psychiatrist, Dr. Roth, was also prepared to testify to impaired judgment, based on chemical dependency and major depression with probable mania.  This testimony, of which more will be said later, was taken as an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district judge ruled that the testimony would not be admitted.  The court's explanation is summed up in the final sentences of a longer oral ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>It seems to me that the evidence does not suggest that the Defendant did not act purposefully, that to accept this evidence as a defense [of lack of] mens rea manipulates the concept of intent beyond the intent required and that under all the circumstances, having considered all of the evidence, the Court will sustain the government's objection to any offer of that proof before the jury and Defendant may have an exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preface to this conclusion, the district court described in some length the opinion in United States v. Pohlot, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493615\"><a href=\"/opinion/493615/united-states-v-pohlot-stephen/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1987), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1011</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The jury deadlocked on eight counts and acquitted on one count.  In October 1995, Schneider was retried on the remaining eight counts.  The district court stood by its earlier ruling that the medical testimony was not admissible.  This time the jury convicted on all eight counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following trial, two jurors contacted the district judge, expressing concerns about another member of the jury panel.  On inquiry, the district judge discovered that after the verdict, the juror in question had said that she wanted to get out of jury service because she was \"mental.\"   A review of that juror's questionnaire revealed that the juror had affirmatively answered the question:  \"Do you have any physical or mental disability that would interfere or prevent you from serving as a juror?\"   On the reverse side of the questionnaire, the juror had written the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>I have an upsetting emotional handicap since my children have been with the DCYF [a Rhode Island state agency], and the strain is sometimes too great for me and the walking to the bus stop especially in inclement weather would be kind of hard at this time.  I am presently looking for housing for my family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an investigation of the juror and a personal interview by the district court, the court ruled that it was \"completely satisfied that the juror was competent and mentally capable at the time of the trial....\"  Schneider nevertheless sought a new trial on the ground that he would have used his peremptory challenges differently if he had known about the information in the questionnaire.  The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Schneider was sentenced to 33 months in prison (he had a prior conviction for a \"bust-out\" offense some years before), and was ordered to make restitution of about $220,000.  On this appeal, he claims as error the refusal to admit the medical testimony;  and he argues that a new trial should have been granted because he could have used a peremptory challenge to dismiss the juror if he had known of the information in the questionnaire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the harder of the two issues and ask whether the district court erred in refusing to admit the medical evidence.  The standard of review depends upon what has been decided:  rulings of law are reviewed de novo while review is typically deferential on so-called \"mixed questions.\"  Bergersen v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197258\"><a href=\"/opinion/197258/bergersen-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60-61 (1st Cir.1997).  Here, a legal issue--the meaning of a federal statute--stands at the threshold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Congress enacted the Insanity Defense Reform Act, 98 Stat. 2057, redefining insanity and making it an affirmative defense to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 17.  The statute also states:  \"Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.\"  Id. &#167; 17(a).  Elsewhere, the government has argued that this quoted language is meant to rule out any mental-condition defense or testimony that does not reach the heights of a properly pleaded insanity defense.  E.g., Pohlot, 827 F.2d at 890.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Schneider did not offer an insanity defense, but he argues that his medical evidence is pertinent in helping a jury decide whether he had the requisite state of mind necessary for the offense charged.  The government, in turn, says that a number of courts have admitted psychological evidence to negate specific intent but the First Circuit has suggested otherwise;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  that the First Circuit's view is consistent with the final sentence of the statute just quoted;  and that it is nevertheless unnecessary to resolve the issue in this case because the evidence here was not relevant in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from the final sentence of section 17(a), in principle there should be no bar to medical evidence that a defendant, although not insane, lacked the requisite state of mind.  As LaFave and Scott say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>The reception of evidence of the defendant's abnormal mental condition, totally apart from the defense of insanity, is certainly appropriate whenever that evidence is relevant to the issue of whether he had the mental state which is a necessary element of the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 4.7, at 530.  The circuits that have considered the question have taken this view.  See United States v. Marenghi, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 89 (D.Me.1995) (collecting cases).  After all, if state of mind is a potential issue--as it is in most but not all criminal cases--why should expert medical evidence be excluded out of hand?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We doubt that the final sentence of section 17(a) was intended to exclude mental-condition evidence short of insanity.  Pohlot canvassed the arguments and legislative history at length, and concluded (1) that the statute does not preclude a defendant from offering evidence to negate a requisite state of mind, 827 F.2d at 903, but (2) that--apart from such a negation--it does preclude any other new and different defense of diminished responsibility to excuse or mitigate the offense.  Id. at 905-06.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Pohlot 's analysis seems to us persuasive on both issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, our own decisions in White and Kepreos were not intended to establish a general rule that mental-condition evidence is always inadmissible except in relation to insanity.  In Kepreos, the court held that the specific psychiatric testimony involved was misleading and of doubtful utility, 759 F.2d at 964;  in White, where no coercion defense was offered, the court rejected psychiatric evidence that a defendant engaged in a drug crime because \"she was unable to resist her mother's request for assistance....\"  766 F.2d at 24.   These cases largely turn upon their facts.  See Marenghi, 893 F.Supp. at 88-91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past the threshold of section 17(a), the situation becomes more difficult for the defendant.  The specific medical evidence offered may still be irrelevant to the requisite intent, White, 766 F.2d at 24, or probative value may be substantially outweighed by confusion or delay.  Fed.R.Evid. 403;  Kepreos, 759 F.2d at 964.   Finally, if the evidence is expert testimony, it must meet the further requisites of scientific reliability and helpfulness to the jury.

The issues typically involve unique fact patterns and judgments of degree, and the district judge is closer to the case.  Thus, so long as there is no misstatement of the legal standard and the result reached is not clearly unreasonable, the district judge's ruling is usually respected.  United States v. Shay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196160\"><a href=\"/opinion/196160/united-states-v-shay/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we return to the testimony in this case.  Dr. Wartenberg had examined Schneider for approximately an hour and a half and reviewed his medical records, including medicines prescribed for him over a three- or four-year period.  In his offer of proof, the doctor said that the prescriptions were medically inappropriate and that the drugs as prescribed \"would impair intellectual function in a variety of ways,\" produce blackouts, roller coaster highs and lows, and permit misperception and delusion.  Dr. Wartenberg summarized his view as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My opinion is that to a degree of reasonable medical certainty that Mr. Schneider's intellectual capacity, cognitive function, ability to make executive judgments and decisions would have been impaired by that level of drug prescribing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, government counsel secured an admission that Schneider during this period could engage in \"activity that is planned to carry out a purpose.\"   Quite properly, neither side asked Dr. Wartenberg the \"ultimate\" question whether Schneider had intended to defraud, such ultimate questions to experts now being forbidden as to mental state in a criminal case under Fed.R.Evid. 704(b), which is a companion amendment to section 17.  See United States v. Meader, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></span>, 658 (D.Me.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expert psychiatrist, Dr. Roth, also offered testimony after interviewing Schneider and examining records.  He said that Schneider suffered from chemical dependency and \"major depression with probable mania.\"   He said also that these conditions \"impair[ed] ... judgment.\"   He declined to express a view on Schneider's ability to form a purpose, saying that he (Dr. Roth) was not there at the time, and that terms like \"purposeful\" posed a metaphysical question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we read the district judge's ruling, he deemed the medical testimony both irrelevant and misleading.  Our own view is that the evidence may have been relevant but only to a limited degree, and that it had a substantial capacity to mislead the jury.  And we think that the district court clearly would exclude the evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403 even if told to view it as having limited relevance.  To remand, in order to make the district judge say this explicitly, is a waste of time.  Let us take these points in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relevance, the ordinary starting point for admissibility, Fed.R.Evid. 401, is a close issue.  Here, the government urged that Schneider had ordered the goods, expecting never to pay for them but to resell them and pocket the money and thereby \"intended to deceive.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Schneider's answer was that he lacked this state of mind and the medical evidence helped him support this view, that is (in the language of the rule), that the medical testimony made his intent to defraud \"less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 401.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sum of the doctors' evidence is that Schneider was depressed, that he had impaired judgment (due to his depressed state and overmedication), and that he was subject to blackouts.  This might not appear at first to go very far in negating his capacity to deceive, especially as Schneider's scheme continued over several months.  This explains the district court's view that the medical evidence did not negate an intent to deceive but instead amounted to a forbidden claim in mitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, evidence may be \"relevant\" under Rule 401's definition, even if it fails to prove or disprove the fact at issue--whether taken alone or in combination with all other helpful evidence on that issue.  In the latter instance, the judge could direct a verdict if the issue were essential, but not against the defendant in a criminal case.  Schneider's best argument is, therefore, that his medical evidence did go some distance to negate intent to deceive and so was relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where evidence goes \"some distance\" but manifestly not far enough, it may be tempting to say that it is not relevant.  Frankly, Pohlot appears to us to take this course by ruling that the psychological evidence of impairment was irrelevant because \"by his own admission,\" Pohlot had \"finalized an agreement to have his wife murdered and this 'purpose' to hire someone to kill his wife was enough regardless of whether he 'psychologically ... understood the full consequences of this activity.' \"  827 F.2d at 889.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we have some doubt that this usage comports with Rule 401's definition quoted above.  Nor do we think it helpful in a case like ours to ask, as Pohlot did, whether the conduct was \"purposeful.\"  Pohlot said that the ordinary mens rea requirement is satisfied \"by any showing of purposeful activity, regardless of its psychological origins.\"  827 F.2d at 904.   But it is quite possible purposefully to order goods on credit, and later not pay for them, without having an intent to deceive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pohlot 's other theme is the capacity of evidence of this kind to mislead.  Congress raised the hurdle for an insanity defense and barred a new diminished capacity defense that courts were beginning to invent.  Yet the evidence offered, both here and in Pohlot, suggests that the defendant was temporarily out of his mind (even though not insane under section 17(a)) and that his crime was mitigated by his psychological condition.  Such evidence tends to reintroduce the very concepts that Congress wanted to exclude and thereby to mislead the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In weighing relevance against confusion, we will assume for the present purposes that this balance is to be struck under Rule 403.  The government does not now challenge the evidence as unreliable under Daubert--only its pertinence to this case.  Nor do we propose to decide here the issue explicitly reserved in Shay, namely, whether and when the judge may exclude otherwise relevant expert evidence on the ground that it will not \"assist\" the jury.  See Shay, 57 F.3d at 132-33.   It is enough that exclusion of the evidence here under Rule 403 is eminently justifiable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence, as we have said, is of limited relevance:  showing \"impaired\" judgment might help piece out a lack of deceit claim but falls well short of sufficient proof.  At the same time, the expert testimony offered here could easily mislead the jury into thinking that such a medical condition amounts to temporary insanity or ameliorates the offense.  The instructions required here to guard the jury on this score would likely have gone very far to eliminate any use the evidence might otherwise have to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that the district court was free to exclude this evidence on the ground that its capacity to mislead the jury substantially outweighed its limited relevance.  Since exclusion was permitted but not required, we could remand for an explicit finding under Rule 403.  Shay, 57 F.3d at 134.   But given the district court's evident view of the matter, our limited disagreement with the district court's reasoning would hardly alter the district court's desire to exclude the evidence.  A remand would serve no purpose.  See United States v. Dolloph, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196547\"><a href=\"/opinion/196547/united-states-v-dolloph/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Offenses differ from each other;  the medical evidence, taken alone and in combination with other evidence, is going to vary widely;  and this is an area in which everyone is still learning.  In the spirit of Daubert, we rely heavily on the wise superintendence of the trial court.  509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796-97.   In this case we have no quarrel with how it was exercised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Schneider's second claim of error, namely, that the district court erred in refusing to grant a new trial.  The basis of the new trial motion was (so far as pertinent here) that the juror questionnaire would, if disclosed, have revealed mental or emotional problems pertaining to the juror in question, perhaps prompting the use of a peremptory challenge to remove the juror.  Again, in considering the district court's action, our standard of review depends upon what the district judge decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Schneider had waived his objection because he failed to move for disclosure of the questionnaire answers prior to empanelment.  We took such a view in United States v. Uribe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532755\"><a href=\"/opinion/532755/united-states-v-nestor-uribe-united-states-of-america-v-leon-alberior/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 561 (1st Cir.1989), but stopped just short of a definitive finding that the Rhode Island federal juror selection plan permitted such access to jury questionnaires.  Id. In affirming, Uribe relied heavily on the alternative ground that the defendant had suffered no prejudice from the nondisclosure.  Id. at 562.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, the parties seek to litigate at length whether Schneider did have effective access to the jury questionnaires, which the governing statute treats somewhat differently than juror lists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Neither the statute nor the Rhode Island plan are crystal clear about access to questionnaires.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1867(f);  Davenport, 824 F.2d at 1515.   We have previously interpreted the statute not to allow inspection of questionnaires \"solely to aid in the voir dire process.\"  Jewell v. Arctic Enterprises, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476326\"><a href=\"/opinion/476326/russell-jewell-jr-v-arctic-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to rest our decision on waiver or forfeiture.  Assuming arguendo that Schneider might have sought access to the questionnaire based on a showing of need, before trial he had no basis for such a motion.  This is not a case where, prior to empanelment, the defendant knew or should have known of a potential problem with a juror and failed to ask for the questionnaire.  E.g., United States v. Aponte-Suarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543061\"><a href=\"/opinion/543061/united-states-v-emigdio-aponte-suarez-united-states-of-america-v-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 492 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such contentions were made in the district court but were rejected and are not now pursued.  Schneider's position instead is that prejudice is not required, and he relies on our own statement in United States v. Vargas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370275\"><a href=\"/opinion/370275/united-states-v-antonio-gaudino-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 346 (1st Cir.1979):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>[T]here is little doubt that if the court or prosecution deprives a defendant of his right to the effective exercise of peremptory challenges, it would, without more, be grounds for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a number of cases involving interference with peremptory challenges, the reviewing court has treated proof of prejudice as unnecessary.  See United States v. Annigoni, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726746\"><a href=\"/opinion/726746/united-states-v-richard-annigoni/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>, 1141 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc) (collecting cases).  But such cases normally involve a deliberate denial or interference.  Without automatic reversal, such conduct could rarely be corrected;  by definition, lawyers use peremptories where a challenge for cause will not work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, a failure of the district court's screening apparatus to uncover some piece of potentially useful information in a raft of jury questionnaires is, if \"error\" at all, a mistake of quite a different kind.  At worst, such a mistake might resemble the failure of the judge to ask adequate voir dire questions, where we have insisted on a showing of prejudice.  United States v. Anagnos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509518\"><a href=\"/opinion/509518/united-states-v-arthur-anagnos/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-5 (1st Cir.1988).  See also 9A Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2482 at 115 &amp; n. 8 (2d ed.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not try to draw a definitive line between cases where a showing of prejudice is required and cases where it is not, as this one so clearly falls on the former side of the line.  There was no direct interference with a peremptory challenge, cf.  United States v. Cambara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540782\"><a href=\"/opinion/540782/united-states-v-joaquin-cambara-united-states-of-america-v-jose-cambara/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 147-48 (1st Cir.1990), and no indication that useful information was deliberately withheld.  Here, as in Vargas (where a juror withheld information), \"[a] new trial [without a showing of prejudice] would be a windfall for the defendant\" without much countervailing benefit.  606 F.2d at 346.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Compare United States v.
