We\r\n\nreverse. \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Bajgar and his wife jointly owned a vacant parcel\r\n\nof land in Port St. Lucie, Florida (\"the Florida property\"). \r\n\nOn November 10, 1993, Bajgar conveyed his interest in the\r\n\nland to his wife, purportedly as a belated engagement gift,\r\n\ndelayed twenty-three years.  In return, Bajgar received \"love\r\n\nand affection.\"  The conveyance was recorded on December 2,\r\n\n1993.  At the time of the conveyance, Bajgar faced a\r\n\ncollection action and several foreclosures.  He conceded at\r\n\ntrial that the transfer was fraudulent within the meaning of\r\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code, admitting that the transfer was\r\n\ncompleted with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his\r\n\ncreditors.\r\n\n          On May 16, 1994, less than one year after the\r\n\nconveyance of the Florida property, Bajgar filed a petition\r\n\nfor relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In his\r\n\npetition, Bajgar disclosed the fraudulent transfer by\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nattaching a copy of the deed to the statement of affairs\r\n\nfiled pursuant to 11 U.S.C.   521(1).  At a June 20, 1994,\r\n\nmandatory creditors meeting, Bajgar and his wife volunteered\r\n\nto reconvey the Florida property.  \r\n\n          On August 19, 1994, Martin, one of Bajgar's\r\n\ncreditors, filed a Complaint to Object to Discharge, which\r\n\nshe amended on September 21, 1994.  Martin's amended\r\n\ncomplaint alleged a violation of 11 U.S.C.   727(a)(2)(A),\r\n\nwhich precludes discharge for a debtor who transfers property\r\n\nwithin one year of the filing of a bankruptcy petition if he\r\n\nacts with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. \r\n\nOn September 30, 1994, at Bajgar's request and on the advice\r\n\nof counsel, Bajgar's wife reconveyed the Florida property to\r\n\nherself and Bajgar jointly by quitclaim deed.  Bajgar's wife\r\n\ncompleted the retransfer more than four months after Bajgar\r\n\nfiled his voluntary bankruptcy petition, more than three\r\n\nmonths after the meeting with creditors, and more than one\r\n\nmonth after Martin first objected to discharge.\r\n\n          The bankruptcy court (Hillman, J.) held that the\r\n\nconveyance of the Florida property did not constitute grounds\r\n\nto deny Bajgar's discharge under Section 727(a)(2)(A). \r\n\nMartin appealed this decision to the United States District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.  The district court\r\n\n(Lasker, J.) affirmed, determining that the re-transfer of\r\n\nthe Florida property to Bajgar cured Bajgar's admittedly\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nfraudulent initial transfer.

We hold that re-\r\n\ntransfer subsequent to filing a voluntary bankruptcy petition\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ndoes not cure the fraudulent transfer, and, thus, does not\r\n\navail the debtor discharge under Section 727.\r\n\n          Title 11, Section 727(a)(2)(A) states in pertinent\r\n\npart:\r\n\n          (a) The court shall grant the debtor a discharge, \r\n          unless--\r\n\n               (2) The debtor, with intent to hinder,\r\n               delay, or defraud a creditor . . . has\r\n               transferred . . . \r\n\n                    (A) property of the debtor within\r\n                    one year before the date of the\r\n                    filing of the petition.\r\n\n11 U.S.C.   727(a)(2)(A).  Bajgar urges us to interpret the\r\n\nterm \"transferred\" to mean \"transferred and remained\r\n\ntransferred\" in the context of a debtor who reconveys\r\n\nproperty subsequent to filing a voluntary bankruptcy\r\n\npetition.\r\n\n          As we have stated previously, \"the task of\r\n\ninterpretation begins with the text of the statute itself,\r\n\nand statutory language must be accorded its ordinary\r\n\nmeaning.\"  Telematics Int'l, Inc. v.

The statute specifically authorizes\r\n\ndenial of discharge if the debtor \"transferred\" property\r\n\nwithin one year prior to the date of filing the bankruptcy\r\n\npetition; it does not qualify this provision with a clause to\r\n\nthe effect that transferred property must remain transferred. \r\n\nSee 11 U.S.C.   727(a)(2)(A).\r               \r\n\n          The Bankruptcy Code, moreover, defines the term\r\n\n\"transfer\" broadly as \"every mode, direct or indirect,\r\n\nabsolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of\r\n\ndisposing of or parting with property or with an interest in\r\n\nproperty.\"  11 U.S.C.   101(54).  Although the legislative\r\n\nhistory offers no guidance in interpreting \"transfer\" in the\r\n\ncontext of Section 727(a)(2)(A), the legislative history of\r\n\nSection 101(54), which defines \"transfer,\" explains that\r\n\n\"[t]he definition of transfer is as broad as possible.\"  S.\r\n\nRep.

See Davis v.\r                                                                  \r\n\nDavis (In re Davis), 911 F.2d 560 (11th Cir. 1990) (per\r                              \r\n\ncuriam).  In Davis, the Eleventh Circuit considered the case\r                              \r\n\nof a debtor (\"Davis\") who transferred a one-half interest in\r\n\nhis home to his wife.  See id. at 561.  Upon the advice of a\r                                          \r\n\nbankruptcy lawyer, Davis re-transferred the property.  The\r\n\nday following recordation of the deed formalizing this\r\n\nretransfer, and less than one year after the initial\r\n\ntransfer, Davis filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter\r\n\n7.  Despite the fact that Davis disclosed the existence of\r\n\nthe fraudulent transfers, a creditor filed an adversary\r\n\nproceeding to deny discharge under Section 727(a)(2)(A).  \r\n\n          Like Bajgar, Davis argued that \"the word\r\n\n'transferred' should be read to mean 'transferred and\r\n\nremained transferred' at the time a debtor files his\r\n\nbankruptcy petition.\"  Id. at 562.  Refusing to discharge\r                                      \r\n\nDavis, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned:\r\n\n          Normally, a court should interpret a\r\n          statute in a manner consistent with the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nclaim that  Bajgar should be denied  discharge because Bajgar\r\nfraudulently transferred  property within one year before the\r\nfiling of  the bankruptcy petition falls  squarely within the\r\nexception  that  Section  727(a)(2)(A) enumerates.    See  11\r                                                                     \r\nU.S.C.     727(a)(2)(A).    The  Tully  court's  instruction,\r                                                  \r\ntherefore, does not control this case.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          plain meaning of the language used in the\r\n          statute.  The statutory language of\r\n          section 727(a)(2)(A) is plain and\r\n          unambiguous.  Congress certainly was\r\n          capable of drafting a statute which would\r\n          deny a discharge only when assets were\r\n          fraudulently transferred and remained\r\n          transferred at the time of filing of\r\n          bankruptcy proceedings, but it did not. \r\n          We are a court and not a legislative\r\n          body; therefore, we are not free to\r\n          create by interpretation an exception in\r\n          a statute which is plain on its face.\r\n\nId. (citations omitted).  According to the Eleventh Circuit,\r               \r\n\ntherefore, if a debtor fraudulently transfers property within\r\n\none year before the filing of a bankruptcy petition, he will\r\n\nnot receive a discharge.  See Najjar v. Kablaoui (In re\r                                                                   \r\n\nKablaoui), 196 B.R. 705, 709 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (\"[T]he Eleventh\r                    \r\n\nCircuit wholly rejects the debtor's subsequent reconveyance\r\n\nof the fraudulently transferred property as a defense to a\r\n\nsection 727(a)(2)(A) action.\").\r\n\n          While the plain language of Section 727(a)(2)(A)\r\n\nand the applicable legislative history point to the\r\n\nconclusion that, upon proper objection, any debtor who\r\n\nfraudulently transfers property within one year before the\r\n\nfiling of a bankruptcy petition is not entitled to receive a\r\n\ndischarge pursuant to Section 727, irrespective of the timing\r\n\nof a reconveyance, this case presents us with a debtor who\r\n\nreconveyed property several months subsequent to filing a\r\n\nvoluntary bankruptcy petition.

Adeeb (In re\r                                                                  \r\n\nAdeeb), 787 F.2d 1339, 1344 (9th Cir. 1986), which\r                 \r\n\ninterpreted the term \"transferred\" to mean \"transferred and\r\n\nremained transferred\" in the context of Section 727(a)(2)(A). \r\n\nBoth the bankruptcy court, see Bajgar, 186 B.R. at 8, and the\r                                                 \r\n\ndistrict court, see Martin v.

We do not.\r                 \r\n\n          In Adeeb, the court considered whether or not to\r                              \r\n\ndischarge an individual (\"Adeeb\") who transferred property\r\n\n\"with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor\" within\r\n\none year of the filing of a petition.  See 787 F.2d at 1342,\r                                                      \r\n\n1344.  Faced with demands from his creditors, Adeeb consulted\r\n\nwith an attorney who had little bankruptcy experience. \r\n\nActing upon his attorney's advice, Adeeb transferred several\r\n\nproperties to third parties.  Adeeb then retained an\r\n\nexperienced bankruptcy attorney, who advised him to re-\r\n\ntransfer the properties and to disclose the initial transfers\r\n\nto his creditors.  Adeeb followed this advice and immediately\r\n\nbegan to reverse the transfers while notifying his creditors\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nof his actions.  Before Adeeb could complete the re-transfers\r\n\nand within one year of the initial fraudulent transfers,\r\n\nseveral of his creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy\r\n\npetition against him.  Determining not to contest this\r\n\npetition, several days later Adeeb filed a voluntary\r\n\npetition, \"seeking a discharge of his indebtedness.\"  Id. at\r                                                                     \r\n\n1342.\r\n\n          The Adeeb court determined that \"reading\r                               \r\n\n`transferred' . . . to mean 'transferred and remained\r\n\ntransferred' is most consistent with the legislative purpose\r\n\nof [Section 727(a)(2)(A)].\"  Id. at 1344.  The Adeeb court\r                                                                \r\n\nreasoned:\r\n\n          First, this reading encourages honest\r\n          debtors to recover property they have\r\n          transferred during the year preceding\r\n          bankruptcy.  Encouraging debtors to\r\n          recover improperly transferred property\r\n          facilitates the equitable distribution of\r\n          assets among creditors by ensuring that\r\n          the trustee has possession of all of the\r\n          debtor's assets.  Second, this reading\r\n          permits the honest debtor to undo his \r\n          mistakes and receive his discharge.\r\n\nId. at 1345.  Treating Adeeb as the subject of an involuntary\r               \r\n\npetition because \"[t]he involuntary petition in this case\r\n\nbegan the bankruptcy process,\" id. at 1346 n.4, the court\r                                              \r\n\ndischarged Adeeb.  The court held that \"a debtor who has\r\n\ndisclosed his previous transfers to his creditors and is\r\n\nmaking a good faith effort to recover the property\r\n\ntransferred at the time an involuntary bankruptcy petition is\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nfiled is entitled to a discharge of his debts if he is\r\n\notherwise qualified.\"  Id. at 1346 (emphasis added).\r                                      \r\n\n          The Adeeb court, however, enunciated a different\r                               \r\n\nrule with respect to a debtor who files a voluntary\r                                                               \r\n\nbankruptcy petition:  \"[A] debtor who transfers property\r\n\nwithin one year of bankruptcy with the intent penalized by\r\n\nsection 727(a)(2)(A) may not be denied discharge of his debts\r\n\nif he reveals the transfers to his creditors, recovers\r                                                                  \r\n\nsubstantially all of the property before he files his\r                                                                 \r\n\nbankruptcy petition, and is otherwise qualified for a\r                               \r\n\ndischarge.\"  Id. at 1345 (emphasis added).  As the Adeeb\r                                                                    \r\n\ncourt explained, this rule demanding recovery prior to the\r\n\nfiling of a petition \"assumes the filing of a voluntary\r\n\npetition by the debtor.  In that situation, the debtor\r\n\ncontrols the time of filing the petition.  He is therefore\r\n\nable to time the filing to allow recovery of substantially\r\n\nall of his property.\"  Id. at 1346.  Adeeb thus makes clear\r                                                      \r\n\nthat the test applicable to a debtor subject to an\r\n\ninvoluntary bankruptcy petition differs substantially from\r\n\nthe test the court would apply to a debtor filing a voluntary\r\n\nbankruptcy petition.\r\n\n          Even were we to adopt Adeeb, its application to the\r                                                 \r\n\ninstant case would result in denial of discharge.  Bajgar did\r\n\nnot recover any of the transferred property until well after\r\n\nhe filed his voluntary bankruptcy petition.  Although the\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nbankruptcy court noted the fact that Bajgar did not complete\r\n\nreconveyance of the property \"until several months after the\r\n\nfiling of the petition,\" Bajgar, 186 B.R. at 9, it determined\r                                           \r\n\nthat because Bajgar revealed the transfer at the time of his\r\n\nfiling, \"those facts satisfy the Adeeb test that the recovery\r                                                  \r\n\nbe 'prior to the time the bankruptcy petition was filed or\r\n\nwithin a reasonable time after it was filed.'\"  Id.

Contrary to the bankruptcy court's\r                 \r\n\nassertion, disclosure constitutes only one component of the\r\n\nactivity necessary to secure discharge under Adeeb.

Furthermore, the language that\r                 \r\n\nthe bankruptcy court relies on from Adeeb applies to an\r                                                     \r\n\ninvoluntary petition, rather than a voluntary petition:  \"We\r\n\nemphasize that the debtor [subject] . . . to the filing of\r\n\nthe involuntary petition . . . must actually recover the\r\n\nproperty within a reasonable time after the filing of the\r                                                                     \r\n\ninvoluntary petition.\"  Adeeb, 787 F.2d at 1346 (emphasis\r                                         \r\n\nadded).

In return, Bajgar received \"love\r\n\nand affection.\"  The conveyance was recorded on December 2,\r\n\n1993.  At the time of the conveyance, Bajgar faced a\r\n\ncollection action and several foreclosures.  He conceded at\r\n\ntrial that the transfer was fraudulent within the meaning of\r\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code, admitting that the transfer was\r\n\ncompleted with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his\r\n\ncreditors.\r\n\n          On May 16, 1994, less than one year after the\r\n\nconveyance of the Florida property, Bajgar filed a petition\r\n\nfor relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In his\r\n\npetition, Bajgar disclosed the fraudulent transfer by\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nattaching a copy of the deed to the statement of affairs\r\n\nfiled pursuant to 11 U.S.C.   521(1).  At a June 20, 1994,\r\n\nmandatory creditors meeting, Bajgar and his wife volunteered\r\n\nto reconvey the Florida property.  \r\n\n          On August 19, 1994, Martin, one of Bajgar's\r\n\ncreditors, filed a Complaint to Object to Discharge, which\r\n\nshe amended on September 21, 1994.  Martin's amended\r\n\ncomplaint alleged a violation of 11 U.S.C.   727(a)(2)(A),\r\n\nwhich precludes discharge for a debtor who transfers property\r\n\nwithin one year of the filing of a bankruptcy petition if he\r\n\nacts with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. \r\n\nOn September 30, 1994, at Bajgar's request and on the advice\r\n\nof counsel, Bajgar's wife reconveyed the Florida property to\r\n\nherself and Bajgar jointly by quitclaim deed.  Bajgar's wife\r\n\ncompleted the retransfer more than four months after Bajgar\r\n\nfiled his voluntary bankruptcy petition, more than three\r\n\nmonths after the meeting with creditors, and more than one\r\n\nmonth after Martin first objected to discharge.\r\n\n          The bankruptcy court (Hillman, J.) held that the\r\n\nconveyance of the Florida property did not constitute grounds\r\n\nto deny Bajgar's discharge under Section 727(a)(2)(A). \r\n\nMartin appealed this decision to the United States District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.  The district court\r\n\n(Lasker, J.) affirmed, determining that the re-transfer of\r\n\nthe Florida property to Bajgar cured Bajgar's admittedly\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nfraudulent initial transfer.

In Davis, the Eleventh Circuit considered the case\r                              \r\n\nof a debtor (\"Davis\") who transferred a one-half interest in\r\n\nhis home to his wife.  See id. at 561.  Upon the advice of a\r                                          \r\n\nbankruptcy lawyer, Davis re-transferred the property.  The\r\n\nday following recordation of the deed formalizing this\r\n\nretransfer, and less than one year after the initial\r\n\ntransfer, Davis filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter\r\n\n7.  Despite the fact that Davis disclosed the existence of\r\n\nthe fraudulent transfers, a creditor filed an adversary\r\n\nproceeding to deny discharge under Section 727(a)(2)(A).  \r\n\n          Like Bajgar, Davis argued that \"the word\r\n\n'transferred' should be read to mean 'transferred and\r\n\nremained transferred' at the time a debtor files his\r\n\nbankruptcy petition.\"  Id. at 562.  Refusing to discharge\r                                      \r\n\nDavis, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned:\r\n\n          Normally, a court should interpret a\r\n          statute in a manner consistent with the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nclaim that  Bajgar should be denied  discharge because Bajgar\r\nfraudulently transferred  property within one year before the\r\nfiling of  the bankruptcy petition falls  squarely within the\r\nexception  that  Section  727(a)(2)(A) enumerates.    See  11\r                                                                     \r\nU.S.C.     727(a)(2)(A).    The  Tully  court's  instruction,\r                                                  \r\ntherefore, does not control this case.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          plain meaning of the language used in the\r\n          statute.  The statutory language of\r\n          section 727(a)(2)(A) is plain and\r\n          unambiguous.  Congress certainly was\r\n          capable of drafting a statute which would\r\n          deny a discharge only when assets were\r\n          fraudulently transferred and remained\r\n          transferred at the time of filing of\r\n          bankruptcy proceedings, but it did not. \r\n          We are a court and not a legislative\r\n          body; therefore, we are not free to\r\n          create by interpretation an exception in\r\n          a statute which is plain on its face.\r\n\nId.

According to the Eleventh Circuit,\r               \r\n\ntherefore, if a debtor fraudulently transfers property within\r\n\none year before the filing of a bankruptcy petition, he will\r\n\nnot receive a discharge.

Bajgar (In re Bajgar), C.A. No.\r                                                              \r\n\n95-12562-MEL, slip op. at 2 (D. Mass. March 19, 1996), found\r\n\nAdeeb persuasive in this case.  We do not.\r                 \r\n\n          In Adeeb, the court considered whether or not to\r                              \r\n\ndischarge an individual (\"Adeeb\") who transferred property\r\n\n\"with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor\" within\r\n\none year of the filing of a petition.  See 787 F.2d at 1342,\r                                                      \r\n\n1344.  Faced with demands from his creditors, Adeeb consulted\r\n\nwith an attorney who had little bankruptcy experience. \r\n\nActing upon his attorney's advice, Adeeb transferred several\r\n\nproperties to third parties.  Adeeb then retained an\r\n\nexperienced bankruptcy attorney, who advised him to re-\r\n\ntransfer the properties and to disclose the initial transfers\r\n\nto his creditors.  Adeeb followed this advice and immediately\r\n\nbegan to reverse the transfers while notifying his creditors\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nof his actions.  Before Adeeb could complete the re-transfers\r\n\nand within one year of the initial fraudulent transfers,\r\n\nseveral of his creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy\r\n\npetition against him.  Determining not to contest this\r\n\npetition, several days later Adeeb filed a voluntary\r\n\npetition, \"seeking a discharge of his indebtedness.\"  Id. at\r                                                                     \r\n\n1342.\r\n\n          The Adeeb court determined that \"reading\r                               \r\n\n`transferred' . . . to mean 'transferred and remained\r\n\ntransferred' is most consistent with the legislative purpose\r\n\nof [Section 727(a)(2)(A)].\"  Id. at 1344.  The Adeeb court\r                                                                \r\n\nreasoned:\r\n\n          First, this reading encourages honest\r\n          debtors to recover property they have\r\n          transferred during the year preceding\r\n          bankruptcy.  Encouraging debtors to\r\n          recover improperly transferred property\r\n          facilitates the equitable distribution of\r\n          assets among creditors by ensuring that\r\n          the trustee has possession of all of the\r\n          debtor's assets.  Second, this reading\r\n          permits the honest debtor to undo his \r\n          mistakes and receive his discharge.\r\n\nId. at 1345.  Treating Adeeb as the subject of an involuntary\r               \r\n\npetition because \"[t]he involuntary petition in this case\r\n\nbegan the bankruptcy process,\" id. at 1346 n.4, the court\r                                              \r\n\ndischarged Adeeb.  The court held that \"a debtor who has\r\n\ndisclosed his previous transfers to his creditors and is\r\n\nmaking a good faith effort to recover the property\r\n\ntransferred at the time an involuntary bankruptcy petition is\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nfiled is entitled to a discharge of his debts if he is\r\n\notherwise qualified.\"  Id. at 1346 (emphasis added).\r                                      \r\n\n          The Adeeb court, however, enunciated a different\r                               \r\n\nrule with respect to a debtor who files a voluntary\r                                                               \r\n\nbankruptcy petition:  \"[A] debtor who transfers property\r\n\nwithin one year of bankruptcy with the intent penalized by\r\n\nsection 727(a)(2)(A) may not be denied discharge of his debts\r\n\nif he reveals the transfers to his creditors, recovers\r                                                                  \r\n\nsubstantially all of the property before he files his\r                                                                 \r\n\nbankruptcy petition, and is otherwise qualified for a\r                               \r\n\ndischarge.\"  Id. at 1345 (emphasis added).  As the Adeeb\r                                                                    \r\n\ncourt explained, this rule demanding recovery prior to the\r\n\nfiling of a petition \"assumes the filing of a voluntary\r\n\npetition by the debtor.  In that situation, the debtor\r\n\ncontrols the time of filing the petition.  He is therefore\r\n\nable to time the filing to allow recovery of substantially\r\n\nall of his property.\"  Id. at 1346.  Adeeb thus makes clear\r                                                      \r\n\nthat the test applicable to a debtor subject to an\r\n\ninvoluntary bankruptcy petition differs substantially from\r\n\nthe test the court would apply to a debtor filing a voluntary\r\n\nbankruptcy petition.\r\n\n          Even were we to adopt Adeeb, its application to the\r                                                 \r\n\ninstant case would result in denial of discharge.  Bajgar did\r\n\nnot recover any of the transferred property until well after\r\n\nhe filed his voluntary bankruptcy petition.  Although the\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nbankruptcy court noted the fact that Bajgar did not complete\r\n\nreconveyance of the property \"until several months after the\r\n\nfiling of the petition,\" Bajgar, 186 B.R. at 9, it determined\r                                           \r\n\nthat because Bajgar revealed the transfer at the time of his\r\n\nfiling, \"those facts satisfy the Adeeb test that the recovery\r                                                  \r\n\nbe 'prior to the time the bankruptcy petition was filed or\r\n\nwithin a reasonable time after it was filed.'\"  Id. (quoting\r                                                               \r\n\nAdeeb, 787 F.2d at 1346).  Contrary to the bankruptcy court's\r                 \r\n\nassertion, disclosure constitutes only one component of the\r\n\nactivity necessary to secure discharge under Adeeb.  See\r                                                                    \r\n\nAdeeb, 787 F.2d at 1345-46.  Furthermore, the language that\r                 \r\n\nthe bankruptcy court relies on from Adeeb applies to an\r                                                     \r\n\ninvoluntary petition, rather than a voluntary petition:  \"We\r\n\nemphasize that the debtor [subject] . . . to the filing of\r\n\nthe involuntary petition . . . must actually recover the\r\n\nproperty within a reasonable time after the filing of the\r                                                                     \r\n\ninvoluntary petition.\"  Adeeb, 787 F.2d at 1346 (emphasis\r                                         \r\n\nadded).
