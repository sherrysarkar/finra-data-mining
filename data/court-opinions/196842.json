Wayne  F.  Cross,  currently\r                                        \r\n\nserving a New Hampshire state sentence for two bank robberies\r\n\nin that state, appeals from  an order of the federal district\r\n\ncourt in New Hampshire dismissing  his petition for a writ of\r\n\nhabeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.   2254.  In the petition, Cross\r\n\nsought to attack the New Hampshire state court convictions on\r\n\nthe  ground   that  New  Hampshire  officials   violated  the\r\n\nInterstate Agreement  on Detainers,  N.H. Rev.  Stat. Ann.   \r\n\n606-A et seq.  (\"IAD\"), and  the Fourteenth  Amendment.   The\r                         \r\n\nfacts are as follows.  \r\n\n     While Cross was  in prison in Massachusetts  in November\r\n\n1983, New  Hampshire authorities  obtained jurisdiction  over\r\n\nCross  pursuant  to the  IAD to  try  him for  two  1982 bank\r\n\nrobberies.  Cross  had himself requested a  rapid disposition\r\n\nof  the charges  and waived  objections  to the  extradition.\r\n\nThereafter, Cross was  convicted on the bank  robbery charges\r\n\nin  New Hampshire  state  court, and  in  February 1985,  was\r\n\nsentenced to  two consecutive terms of 7-1/2 to 15 years.  He\r\n\nthen appealed from the convictions.  \r\n\n     At the same time, Cross asked New Hampshire officials to\r\n\nreturn him to Massachusetts pending resolution of his appeal,\r\n\nciting  an IAD  provision that  says the  prisoner should  be\r\n\nreturned  to the sending state \"[a]t the earliest practicable\r\n\ntime consonant with  the purposes of  this agreement.\"   N.H.\r\n\nRev.  Stat. Ann.    606-A:1, art. V(e).   Cross  said that he\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nwanted to go back to  the Massachusetts prison to complete an\r\n\nelectrician training program  that he had been  participating\r\n\nin before his rendition to New Hampshire.    \r\n\n     But New Hampshire officials were concerned that if Cross\r\n\nwas  returned to Massachusetts  and his New  Hampshire appeal\r\n\nresulted in a  new trial, the anti-shuttling provision of the\r\n\nIAD might prevent his reprosecution.   N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.  \r\n\n606-A:1, art. III(d).   Also, the officials were not  certain\r\n\nthat Cross'  earlier waiver  of extradition  would cover  his\r\n\nreturn to New  Hampshire if a new trial became necessary.  As\r\n\na  precaution,  they kept  him  in  New Hampshire  until  his\r\n\nconvictions were affirmed on appeal in December 1986, some 22\r\n\nmonths after he was  sentenced.  State v. Cross, 519 A.2d 272\r                                                           \r\n\n(N.H.   1986).     He   was   then   promptly   returned   to\r\n\nMassachusetts.1     After   completing   his    Massachusetts\r\n\nsentence in 1992, Cross was returned to  New Hampshire, where\r\n\nhe is currently  serving out the bank robbery  sentences.  It\r\n\nwas at this  point that Cross filed the  instant petition for\r\n\nhabeas corpus in the federal district court in New Hampshire.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Following  his  conviction,  Cross filed  a  \"motion to\r\nreturn\" in  New Hampshire state court which  was dismissed as\r\nmoot after  he was returned  to Massachusetts.  Prior  to the\r\npresent action,  Cross also  brought proceedings  in the  New\r\nHampshire state court collaterally attacking his bank robbery\r\nconvictions  and also filed a habeas  petition in the federal\r\ndistrict   court   in   Massachusetts;  both   efforts   were\r\nunsuccessful.  Only  the state appeal is reported.   Cross v.\r                                                                      \r\nWarden, 644 A.2d 542 (N.H. 1994).\r                  \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nCross'  petition  alleged  that his  convictions  on  the New\r\n\nHampshire bank  robbery charges must  be invalidated--without\r\n\npossibility of retrial--because the state violated the IAD by\r\n\nholding him in New Hampshire pending resolution of his appeal\r\n\nthere.\r\n\n     In  addition to  the IAD  claim, the  petition  made two\r\n\nconstitutional claims.  First, Cross argued that the delay in\r\n\nhis return  to Massachusetts unconstitutionally  burdened his\r\n\nright to appeal,  in violation of the Due  Process Clause, by\r\n\nforcing him temporarily to forego rehabilitation if he wished\r\n\nto challenge  his convictions.   Second,  Cross claimed  that\r\n\nexacting this \"extra  price\" for pursuing an  appeal violated\r\n\nthe  Equal Protection  Clause by  irrationally  treating some\r\n\nconvicted defendants differently than others.\r\n\n     The district court dismissed  the petition, relying upon\r\n\na  report and recommendation  by the  magistrate judge.   The\r\n\nmagistrate   judge  had  ruled   that,  under  First  Circuit\r\n\nprecedent, an IAD-violation claim was not ordinarily a ground\r\n\nfor habeas  relief.  Fasano v.  Hall, 615 F.2d 555,  557 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1980).   As  for the  constitutional claims,  the report\r\n\nsaid that  these claims  were foreclosed as  an abuse  of the\r\n\nwrit, under Sawyer  v. Whitley, 505 U.S.  333 (1992), because\r                                          \r\n\nthey had not been raised  by Cross in his prior Massachusetts\r\n\nfederal habeas petition.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     1.  Even  assuming arguendo that New  Hampshire violated\r                                            \r\n\nthe  IAD--a  point  we need  not  decide--the  district court\r\n\ncorrectly ruled that  this statutory claim is  not cognizable\r\n\nunder section 2254.   Although the IAD  is considered federal\r\n\nlaw for purposes of habeas corpus, Reed v. Farley, 114 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n2291,  2296 (1994), nonconstitutional claims can be raised on\r\n\nhabeas only  if  the alleged  error  results in  \"a  complete\r\n\nmiscarriage  of justice.\"   Id. at 2300  (citations omitted).\r                                           \r\n\nCross cannot meet this substantial burden.  The IAD provision\r\n\nat issue here has nothing to  do with securing a fair  trial,\r\n\nand  Cross makes  no  claim that  the  alleged IAD  violation\r\n\nactually impaired  his ability  to  prepare a  defense or  to\r\n\nprosecute his appeal.  See Fasano, 615 F.2d at 557-58.\r                                             \r\n\n     Moreover,  we do not  agree with Cross'  suggestion that\r\n\nReed  v. Farley undermines Fasano  v. Hall.   It is true that\r                                                      \r\n\nReed v. Farley leaves open  the possibility that, in  unusual\r                          \r\n\ncircumstances,   an    IAD    violation    or    any    other\r\n\nnonconstitutional violation of federal law might give rise to\r\n\na claim  considered in a  habeas proceeding.   114 S.  Ct. at\r\n\n2296-99.  But Reed v.  Farley declined to consider such claim\r                                         \r\n\nin  circumstances that  were  arguably  more compelling  than\r\n\nthose presented here, and whatever  gap the Supreme Court has\r\n\nleft open is too narrow for Cross.\r\n\n     Contrary  to  Cross'  suggestion,  denying review  under\r\n\nsection 2254 does not insulate the prompt return provision of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nthe IAD  from federal  enforcement or extend  to prisoners  a\r\n\nfederal  right  without  a  remedy.   The  IAD,  approved  by\r\n\nCongress  as an interstate compact, comprises federal law for\r\n\npurposes of  42 U.S.C.    1983.  E.g.,  Cuyler v. Adams,  449\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 433  (1981).  Cross  was free to seek  injunctive relief\r\n\nunder  section  1983,  requiring New  Hampshire  officials to\r\n\ncomply  with their  IAD obligations.   Id.  See  also Stow v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHoran, 36 F.3d 1089 (1st Cir. 1994). \r                 \r\n\n     2.  The  district court dismissed Cross'  constitutional\r\n\nclaims as an abuse of the writ, believing that neither of the\r\n\nconstitutional  claims had  been  presented in  Cross'  prior\r\n\nfederal  habeas proceeding  in Massachusetts.   See generally\r                                                                         \r\n\nSawyer,  505 U.S.  at 338;  Rule 9(b)  following 28  U.S.C.  \r                  \r\n\n2254.   On  this  appeal,  both sides  concede  that the  due\r\n\nprocess   claim  was  raised  in  the  prior  federal  habeas\r\n\nproceeding and  so is not  foreclosed as  a \"new\" claim.   It\r\n\nappears that the equal protection claim was not raised in the\r\n\nMassachusetts habeas proceeding.\r\n\n     Cross  now offers several  arguments (e.g., that  he was\r                                                           \r\n\npreviously proceeding pro se,  that the Massachusetts  habeas\r                                        \r\n\ncourt held  no evidentiary  hearing) as to  why he  should be\r\n\nallowed to renew the due  process claim in this second habeas\r\n\nproceeding  and to make the equal  protection claim here even\r\n\nthough not previously made in  the earlier petition.  We need\r\n\nnot  decide these issues  because we  are satisfied  that the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\ndelayed return, whatever its propriety under the IAD, did not\r\n\nviolate the Constitution.2\r\n\n     There is no indication that the delayed return comprised\r\n\nan attempt to punish Cross for appealing or to interfere with\r\n\nCross'  appeal from  his  New  Hampshire  convictions.    Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nBlackledge v.  Perry, 417 U.S.  21 (1974).  On  the contrary,\r                                \r\n\nthe aim was  to secure Cross' availability for  a retrial, if\r\n\nhis appeal  caused one to be  necessary.  Whether or  not the\r\n\nNew Hampshire authorities were overly cautious, their purpose\r\n\nwas certainly a legitimate one.\r\n\n     The  delay may well have interfered with Cross' training\r\n\nprogram and  that is regrettable.  But  the Constitution does\r\n\nnot  protect  against  every incidental  burden  that  may by\r\n\nhappenstance result from  the decision to appeal.   Beauchamp\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Murphy, 37 F.3d 700 (1st Cir. 1994).  The likelihood that\r                      \r\n\na delayed return from one prison to  another would discourage\r\n\nmeritorious  appeals  is  very slight  in  the  generality of\r\n\ncases;  more serious burdens were sustained in North Carolina\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Pearce,  395 U.S. 711 (1969),  and in Beauchamp.   And, in\r                                                              \r\n\nthis case, Cross did pursue his appeal.\r                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2It is far from clear that  an unconstitutional delay in\r\nreturning  Cross to Massachusetts would permit a habeas court\r\nto  invalidate  an otherwise  valid conviction  that occurred\r\nprior to the delay.  Ordinarily, in habeas there must be some\r\ncausal  connection between the legal error and the challenged\r                              \r\ndetention.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n       The equal protection claim made in Cross' brief is the\r\n\nsame undue burden  claim just discussed--recast by   pointing\r\n\nto other  defendants who do  not suffer the same  burden when\r\n\nthey  choose   to  appeal  (e.g.,   convicted  New  Hampshire\r                                            \r\n\ndefendants who  were not  extradited) and  claiming that  the\r\n\ndiscrepant  burden on Cross was irrational.  Certainly, Cross\r\n\nwas   treated   differently,   but  that   is   because   his\r\n\ncircumstances were different:   the rationale for a delay  in\r\n\nreturning him to  Massachusetts does not  apply to those  who\r\n\nhad not been extradited or had been but did not appeal. \r\n\n     Cross' real argument, mislabeled as an equal  protection\r\n\nclaim, is simply  that Cross himself did not  need to be kept\r\n\nin  New  Hampshire  because  that  state  could  easily  have\r\n\nreclaimed  him for a  new trial had that  been required.  New\r\n\nHampshire authorities may  have been mistaken in  reading the\r\n\nanti-shuttling clause too broadly or  too narrowly construing\r\n\nCross'  earlier waiver.    But such  a fumble  is at  worst a\r\n\ngarden variety  administrative error in  application and  not\r\n\ninvidious classification  under the Equal  Protection Clause.\r\n\nSee J. Nowak &amp; R.

The facts are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Cross was in prison in Massachusetts in November 1983, New Hampshire authorities obtained jurisdiction over Cross pursuant to the IAD to try him for two 1982 bank robberies.  Cross had himself requested a rapid disposition of the charges and waived objections to the extradition.  Thereafter, Cross was convicted on the bank robbery charges in New Hampshire state court, and in February 1985, was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 7-1/2 to 15 years.  He then appealed from the convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, Cross asked New Hampshire officials to return him to Massachusetts pending resolution of his appeal, citing an IAD provision that says the prisoner should be returned to the sending state \"[a]t the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement.\"   N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 606-A:1, art.  V(e).  Cross said that he wanted to go back to the Massachusetts prison to complete an electrician training program that he had been participating in before his rendition to New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But New Hampshire officials were concerned that if Cross was returned to Massachusetts and his New Hampshire appeal resulted in a new trial, the anti-shuttling provision of the IAD might prevent his reprosecution.  N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 606-A:1, art.  III(d).  Also, the officials were not certain that Cross' earlier waiver of extradition would cover his return to New Hampshire if a new trial became necessary.  As a precaution, they kept him in New Hampshire until his convictions were affirmed on appeal in December 1986, some 22 months after he was sentenced.  State v. Cross, 128 N.H. 732, 519 A.2d 272 (1986).  He was then promptly returned to Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After completing his Massachusetts sentence in 1992, Cross was returned to New Hampshire, where he is currently serving out the bank robbery sentences.  It was at this point that Cross filed the instant petition for habeas corpus in the federal district court in New Hampshire.  Cross' petition alleged that his convictions on the New Hampshire bank robbery charges must be invalidated--without possibility of retrial--because the state violated the IAD by holding him in New Hampshire pending resolution of his appeal there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the IAD claim, the petition made two constitutional claims.  First, Cross argued that the delay in his return to Massachusetts unconstitutionally burdened his right to appeal, in violation of the Due Process Clause, by forcing him temporarily to forego rehabilitation if he wished to challenge his convictions.  Second, Cross claimed that exacting this \"extra price\" for pursuing an appeal violated the Equal Protection Clause by irrationally treating some convicted defendants differently than others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the petition, relying upon a report and recommendation by the magistrate judge.  The magistrate judge had ruled that, under First Circuit precedent, an IAD-violation claim was not ordinarily a ground for habeas relief.  Fasano v. Hall, 615 F.2d 555, 557 (1st Cir.1980).  As for the constitutional claims, the report said that these claims were foreclosed as an abuse of the writ, under Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992), because they had not been raised by Cross in his prior Massachusetts federal habeas petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Even assuming arguendo that New Hampshire violated the IAD--a point we need not decide--the district court correctly ruled that this statutory claim is not cognizable under section 2254.  Although the IAD is considered federal law for purposes of habeas corpus, Reed v. Farley, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2291, 2296, 129 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994), nonconstitutional claims can be raised on habeas only if the alleged error results in \"a complete miscarriage of justice.\"  Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2300 (citations omitted).  Cross cannot meet this substantial burden.  The IAD provision at issue here has nothing to do with securing a fair trial, and Cross makes no claim that the alleged IAD violation actually impaired his ability to prepare a defense or to prosecute his appeal.  See Fasano, 615 F.2d at 557-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we do not agree with Cross' suggestion that Reed v. Farley undermines Fasano v. Hall.  It is true that Reed v. Farley leaves open the possibility that, in unusual circumstances, an IAD violation or any other nonconstitutional violation of federal law might give rise to a claim considered in a habeas proceeding.  --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2296-99.   But Reed v. Farley declined to consider such claim in circumstances that were arguably more compelling than those presented here, and whatever gap the Supreme Court has left open is too narrow for Cross.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Cross' suggestion, denying review under section 2254 does not insulate the prompt return provision of the IAD from federal enforcement or extend to prisoners a federal right without a remedy.  The IAD, approved by Congress as an interstate compact, comprises federal law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  E.g., Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.S. 433, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981).  Cross was free to seek injunctive relief under section 1983, requiring New Hampshire officials to comply with their IAD obligations.  Id. See also Stow v. Horan, 36 F.3d 1089 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court dismissed Cross' constitutional claims as an abuse of the writ, believing that neither of the constitutional claims had been presented in Cross' prior federal habeas proceeding in Massachusetts.  See generally Sawyer, 505 U.S. at 338, 112 S.Ct. at 2518;  Rule 9(b) following 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  On this appeal, both sides concede that the due process claim was raised in the prior federal habeas proceeding and so is not foreclosed as a \"new\" claim.  It appears that the equal protection claim was not raised in the Massachusetts habeas proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cross now offers several arguments (e.g., that he was previously proceeding pro se, that the Massachusetts habeas court held no evidentiary hearing) as to why he should be allowed to renew the due process claim in this second habeas proceeding and to make the equal protection claim here even though not previously made in the earlier petition.  We need not decide these issues because we are satisfied that the delayed return, whatever its propriety under the IAD, did not violate the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no indication that the delayed return comprised an attempt to punish Cross for appealing or to interfere with Cross' appeal from his New Hampshire convictions.  Cf. Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974).  On the contrary, the aim was to secure Cross' availability for a retrial, if his appeal caused one to be necessary.  Whether or not the New Hampshire authorities were overly cautious, their purpose was certainly a legitimate one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The delay may well have interfered with Cross' training program and that is regrettable.  But the Constitution does not protect against every incidental burden that may by happenstance result from the decision to appeal.  Beauchamp v. Murphy, 37 F.3d 700 (1st Cir.1994).  The likelihood that a delayed return from one prison to another would discourage meritorious appeals is very slight in the generality of cases;  more serious burdens were sustained in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), and in Beauchamp.   And, in this case, Cross did pursue his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equal protection claim made in Cross' brief is the same undue burden claim just discussed--recast by pointing to other defendants who do not suffer the same burden when they choose to appeal (e.g., convicted New Hampshire defendants who were not extradited) and claiming that the discrepant burden on Cross was irrational.  Certainly, Cross was treated differently, but that is because his circumstances were different:  the rationale for a delay in returning him to Massachusetts does not apply to those who had not been extradited or had been but did not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cross' real argument, mislabeled as an equal protection claim, is simply that Cross himself did not need to be kept in New Hampshire because that state could easily have reclaimed him for a new trial had that been required.  New Hampshire authorities may have been mistaken in reading the anti-shuttling clause too broadly or too narrowly construing Cross' earlier waiver.  But such a fumble is at worst a garden variety administrative error in application and not invidious classification under the Equal Protection Clause.  See J. Nowak &amp; R. Rotunda, Constitutional Law &#167; 14.2, at 570 (4th ed.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Following his conviction, Cross filed a \"motion to return\" in New Hampshire state court which was dismissed as moot after he was returned to Massachusetts.  Prior to the present action, Cross also brought proceedings in the New Hampshire state court collaterally attacking his bank robbery convictions and also filed a habeas petition in the federal district court in Massachusetts;  both efforts were unsuccessful.  Only the state appeal is reported.  Cross v.

Cross, currently serving a New Hampshire state sentence for two bank robberies in that state, appeals from an order of the federal district court in New Hampshire dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  In the petition, Cross sought to attack the New Hampshire state court convictions on the ground that New Hampshire officials violated the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, N.H.Rev.Stat.

Certainly, Cross was treated differently, but that is because his circumstances were different:  the rationale for a delay in returning him to Massachusetts does not apply to those who had not been extradited or had been but did not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cross' real argument, mislabeled as an equal protection claim, is simply that Cross himself did not need to be kept in New Hampshire because that state could easily have reclaimed him for a new trial had that been required.  New Hampshire authorities may have been mistaken in reading the anti-shuttling clause too broadly or too narrowly construing Cross' earlier waiver.  But such a fumble is at worst a garden variety administrative error in application and not invidious classification under the Equal Protection Clause.  See J. Nowak &amp; R. Rotunda, Constitutional Law &#167; 14.2, at 570 (4th ed.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Following his conviction, Cross filed a \"motion to return\" in New Hampshire state court which was dismissed as moot after he was returned to Massachusetts.  Prior to the present action, Cross also brought proceedings in the New Hampshire state court collaterally attacking his bank robbery convictions and also filed a habeas petition in the federal district court in Massachusetts;  both efforts were unsuccessful.  Only the state appeal is reported.  Cross v.

Ordinarily, in habeas there must be some causal connection between the legal error and the challenged detention</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
