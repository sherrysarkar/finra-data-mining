Paul Allen  appeals the enhancement to his\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\nsentence following his conviction for being a felon in possession\r\n\nof a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  The district\r\n\ncourt  entered a judgment  against appellant  pursuant to  a plea\r\n\nagreement in  which appellant  pled guilty  to violating  section\r\n\n922(g)(1)  and \"acknowledge[d] that  the provisions of  the Armed\r\n\nCareer Criminal Act,  18 U.S.C.   924(e) ('ACCA'),  apply to this\r\n\ncase.\"   Accordingly, the  district court sentenced  appellant to\r\n\n212  months, which amount  includes a sentence  enhancement under\r\n\nthe ACCA.  We find this sentence enhancement proper.\r\n\n            The ACCA applies  when a person who  violates section\r\n\n922(g) has three  previous convictions for a violent  felony or a\r\n\nserious  drug offense.   While the presentence  report, which the\r\n\ndistrict court  adopted, improperly characterized  the qualifying\r\n\ncrimes  under  the  ACCA  as  \"crimes of  violence\"  rather  than\r\n\n\"violent felon[ies],\"  appellant's earlier admission that  he was\r\n\nsubject  to  an enhancement  under  the  provisions of  the  ACCA\r\n\nconstitutes an admission  that his previous convictions  meet the\r\n\nAct's  definitions of \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug offense.\"\r\n\nBecause appellant  has made this  admission, he cannot  now claim\r\n\nthat  the provisions of  the ACCA do  not apply to him.   We also\r\n\nnote  in passing that  all five of  appellant's previous criminal\r\n\nconvictions,  considered   qualifying  prior   felonies  in   the\r\n\npresentencereport, meetthe statutorydefinitionof \"violentfelony.\"\r\n\n            Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n",
