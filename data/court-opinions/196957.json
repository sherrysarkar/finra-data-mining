In the  district court,  Michael Veilleux\r                            \r\n\nbrought  a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.   1983 against\r\n\nJeffrey  Perschau,   a  detective  in   the  Manchester,  New\r\n\nHampshire  Police  Department.   The  district court  granted\r\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Perschau on grounds of qualified\r\n\nimmunity.   Veilleux  appealed,  and on  August  30, 1996,  a\r\n\ndivided  panel of  this court  reversed the  district court's\r\n\ndecision, which we now  withdraw.  We ordered a  rehearing en\r                                                                         \r\n\nbanc pursuant  to our  discretionary authority under  Fed.

City  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nLaconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt.  2548 (1996),  the following  is what  occurred.   On the\r\n\nevening of January 19, 1993,  a patrolling police officer  in\r\n\nManchester heard the sound of a gunshot coming from Veilleux'\r\n\ndirection.  The officer pursued Veilleux  and thought that he\r\n\nsaw  Veilleux fumbling  as if  to take  something out  of his\r\n\npocket.   But when Veilleux  was caught, there  was no gun on\r\n\nVeilleux' person nor was one found nearby.\r\n\n     Veilleux apparently had been drinking and  scuffled with\r\n\nthe  officer.  He was  then arrested for  assaulting a police\r\n\nofficer  and  resisting  arrest.   The  next  morning,  while\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nVeilleux  was  at   the  Manchester   state  court   awaiting\r\n\narraignment,  he  was  overheard  by  another police  officer\r\n\nmaking statements that indicated that Veilleux had had a gun,\r\n\nspecifically, a .32  automatic with hollow-point  ammunition.\r\n\nThis information was relayed  to Detective Perschau who drove\r\n\nto  the courthouse  and  had Veilleux  brought  to a  private\r\n\noffice for interview.\r\n\n     Veilleux did not have  an attorney present and requested\r\n\ncounsel.   Perschau told Veilleux that  he \"wasn't interested\r\n\nin  arresting  him, [but  only] in  getting  the gun  off the\r\n\nstreet\" so that no child could find it and cause itself harm.\r\n\nPerschau also  told Veilleux that Veilleux  was familiar with\r\n\nthe  system and should understand  that any help  he gave the\r\n\npolice in recovering the  gun could not be used  against him,\r\n\nbecause Perschau had not read him his Miranda rights.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Veilleux, 846  F.  Supp. 149,  152  (D.N.H. 1994)\r                                \r\n\n(McAuliffe, J.). \r\n\n     Veilleux then  admitted that he  had had the  pistol and\r\n\nhad thrown it  on or  beneath a porch  during the chase,  but\r\n\ncould  not  recall the  precise  location.    Police in  turn\r\n\nconducted a  very extensive search  and later that  day found\r\n\nthe  weapon underneath a porch  near the site  of the arrest.\r\n\nThe state did not prosecute Veilleux for possessing a weapon,\r\n\nbut the federal government subsequently indicted Veilleux  as\r\n\na felon-in-possession under  18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1).  There is\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nno evidence that Perschau played any  part in the acquisition\r\n\nof incriminating information by federal authorities.\r\n\n     In  the federal  district  court, Veilleux  moved before\r\n\ntrial to suppress the  handgun and the statements he  made to\r\n\npolice.    Without  deciding   that  a  Miranda  warning  was\r                                                           \r\n\nrequired, the  district court suppressed the  handgun and the\r\n\nstatements   because   \"[u]nder   the   totality   of   these\r\n\ncircumstances,  defendant's statements  were involuntary--his\r\n\nwill not to incriminate himself, exercised  repeatedly during\r\n\nthe  interrogation, was  overborne by  the promises  made and\r\n\ndistorted legal  advice given.\"   Veilleux, 846  F. Supp.  at\r                                                      \r\n\n155.1     Following  the   suppression  order,  the   federal\r\n\nprosecutor abandoned the case against Veilleux.\r\n\n     Veilleux then  brought the  present section  1983 action\r\n\nagainst  Perschau  in the  same  federal  district court  but\r\n\nbefore   a  different   district  judge   (Judge  Barbadoro).\r\n\nVeilleux   claimed  that  Perschau   had  violated  Veilleux'\r\n\nconstitutional  rights  against  self-incrimination   and  to\r\n\nsubstantive  due  process.    Without  deciding  definitively\r\n\nwhether there  had been  a violation--but  expressing evident\r\n\ndoubts--the district court granted  summary judgment in favor\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The  reason  for  the  court's hesitation  to  rely  on\r\nMiranda  apparently  stemmed  from  a  recognition  that  the\r                   \r\nSupreme Court has carved out  an exception to the requirement\r\nof  Miranda warnings  in situations  where the  questions are\r                       \r\n\"necessary to secure [the police officers'] own safety or the\r\nsafety  of the public.\"   New York v.  Quarles, 467 U.S. 649,\r                                                          \r\n658-59 (1984).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nof  Perschau on grounds of qualified immunity.  We agree with\r\n\nthe district judge's conclusion.\r\n\n     Qualified  immunity  protects   public  officials   from\r\n\nsection  1983   civil  liability  so  long   as  they  \"acted\r\n\nreasonably under  settled law in the  circumstances.\"  Hunter\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

See United  States v. Jackson, 918 F.2d  236, 242\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1990).   In  this  case,  some  might think  that\r\n\nPerschau  had applied  relatively  little pressure,  that his\r\n\ngoal was admirable, and that the legal advice that he gave to\r\n\nVeilleux  was  sound  and  amply confirmed  by  the  district\r\n\ncourt's grant of the  later motion to suppress.   The absence\r\n\nof a lawyer  does not itself automatically render a statement\r\n\ninvoluntary.  See Quarles, 467 U.S. at 652, 658-59.\r                                     \r\n\n     On the other hand,  courts have in various circumstances\r\n\nfound  to   be  \"involuntary\"  certain   statements  made  by\r\n\ndefendants  in police  custody in  response to  fairly modest\r\n\npolice  pressure or  following  advice or  promises that  the\r\n\ncourt  believed to  be unfair  or misleading.2   Here,  it is\r\n\nlikely  that the  district court  in granting  the motion  to\r\n\nsuppress  was  affected by  the  federal  prosecutor's action\r\n\nwhich undercut Perschau's  earlier representation.   Further,\r\n\ndistrict courts have enjoyed considerable latitude in  making\r\n\ntheir  own  fact-specific   judgment  whether,  under  unique\r\n\ncircumstances, a statement is \"involuntary.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2See, e.g., United States v.

It makes no difference that a court might later\r\n\nconclude that the officer  was mistaken; one of  the cardinal\r\n\npurposes  of immunity is to  offer the police  \"a fairly wide\r\n\nzone  of protection in close  cases.\"  Roy  v.
