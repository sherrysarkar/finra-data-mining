Maldonado,  Federal  Defender  Office,  on  brief   for\r                                \r\nappellant.\r\nDonald K.  Stern, United  States Attorney, and  Gary S.  Katzmann,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        April 10, 1997\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.    Appellant appeals from his  conviction as\r                           \r\n\na felon in possession of a firearm.  He now contends that the\r\n\njury instructions  defining constructive possession  may have\r\n\nallowed the jury to convict him even if he did  not know that\r\n\na  gun was  present within  an area  over which  he exercised\r\n\ndominion and control.   The instructions in this case  do not\r\n\nwarrant  reversal, but  we write  for the  benefit  of future\r\n\ncases  to  pinpoint  a  correctable ambiguity  in  previously\r\n\napproved language.\r\n\n     Appellant,  a convicted  felon,  was  apprehended  while\r\n\ndriving alone in a stolen  car.  A knapsack was on  the front\r\n\npassenger  seat,  and it  contained,  among  other things,  a\r\n\nloaded gun and a  camera.  Appellant denied ownership  of the\r\n\nknapsack  and its  contents,  but the  film  from the  camera\r\n\nsubsequently  revealed  photos of  appellant.   Appellant was\r\n\nindicted on counts including felon in possession of a firearm\r\n\nunder 18 U.S.C.    922(g), and,  after a  jury trial, he  was\r\n\nconvicted on that count.\r\n\n     The   district  court   instructed  the   jury   on  the\r\n\nrequirement of  \"knowing\" possession as follows.   First, the\r\n\njury  was told twice that \"the government must prove beyond a\r\n\nreasonable doubt . . . that the defendant knowingly possessed\r\n\na firearm . . . .\"  Next, \"knowingly\" was defined as:\r\n\n          An act  is done  knowingly if it  is done\r\n          voluntarily  and  intentionally  and  not\r\n          because of mistake or accident.  I'll say\r\n          that again.  An  act is done knowingly if\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          it is done voluntarily  and intentionally\r\n          and not  because of mistake  or accident.\r\n          In  order for  the government  to satisfy\r\n          this  element, it  must  prove  beyond  a\r\n          reasonable doubt that the  defendant knew\r\n          he was possessing a firearm . . . .\r\n\nAnd then \"possession\" was defined as:\r\n\n          The   law   recognizes   two   kinds   of\r\n          possession,    actual   possession    and\r\n          constructive possession. . . .  Even when\r\n          a  person  does not  actually  possess an\r\n          object,   he   may  be   in  constructive\r\n          possession    of   it.       Constructive\r\n          possession exists when a person knowingly\r\n          has the  power  and the  intention  at  a\r\n          given  time  of  exercising dominion  and\r\n          control over  an object or  over the area\r                                                               \r\n          in which the object  is located.  The law\r                                                     \r\n          recognizes no  distinction between actual\r\n          and constructive  possession, either form\r\n          of possession is sufficient.   Possession\r\n          of an object may be established by either\r\n          direct  evidence   or  by  circumstantial\r\n          evidence.   It is not  necessary to prove\r\n          ownership  of  the  object,  but   it  is\r\n          necessary  for  the  government to  prove\r\n          beyond a reasonable  doubt [the]  knowing\r\n          possession of [the] object. \r\n\n(emphasis added)  Finally, the  jury also was instructed that\r\n\n\"the  government must prove beyond  a reasonable doubt  . . .\r\n\nthat  the defendant's knowing possession of the firearm . . .\r\n\nwas in or affecting commerce.\" \r\n\n     Thus, in  instructing the jury, the  district court said\r\n\nthat  constructive possession exists when a person \"knowingly\r\n\nhas the power and the intention at a given time of exercising\r\n\ndominion and control over an object or over the area in which\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe object is located.\"   Appellant complains belatedly about\r                                 \r\n\nthe italicized portion  of the quoted language  on the ground\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthat  it might  allow the  jury to  convict if  the defendant\r\n\ncontrolled  the area  but did  not know  that the  weapon was\r\n\nthere.\r\n\n     Although  the  language  in  question is  more  or  less\r\n\nconsistent with United  States v. Wight, 968  F.2d 1393, 1398\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st   Cir.  1992),   it   is  probably   susceptible  to   a\r\n\nmisinterpretation.  The underlying  thought, which is correct\r\n\nbut could be more precisely  conveyed, is that knowledge  can\r\n\nbe inferred in some  circumstances from control of the  area.\r\n\nSee  United States  v. Lochan,  674 F.2d  960, 966  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1982).  Wight, despite its literal language, should no longer\r                         \r\n\nbe  read as  an  endorsement of  the above-quoted  italicized\r\n\nlanguage  as  an   independent  definition  of   constructive\r\n\npossession.    There is  nothing  wrong  with explaining  the\r\n\nLochan  inference where  appropriate, and  we do  not suggest\r                  \r\n\nthat the Wight language where it has been used in the past is\r                          \r\n\nnecessarily reversible error, taking the charge as a whole. \r\n\n     In  this case the jury was told several times that proof\r\n\nof \"knowing\"  possession was  required; the evidence  linking\r\n\nappellant  to the gun was substantial; and, given the absence\r\n\nof a contemporaneous objection, the italicized phrase did not\r\n\nconstitute  plain  error,  creating  a  risk  of  fundamental\r\n\nunfairness or miscarriage  of justice.  See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHallock, 941 F.2d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                   \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir.
