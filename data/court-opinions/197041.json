We  hold that they do not  and that the rule  of\r\n\nPrice Waterhouse applies to retaliation claims.\r                          \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The following facts are drawn from the district court's\r\n\nMemorandum and Order.   Tanca is a white male  who was a longterm\r\n\nDET  employee.   After several  minority employees  were promoted\r\n\ninto positions for  which Tanca had applied, Tanca  complained to\r\n\nhigh  level DET  managers.    He  believed  that  he  was  better\r\n\nqualified than  the promoted  employees and that  their promotion\r\n\nwas due to reverse discrimination.  At some point, a  position as\r\n\nan  Unemployment  Insurance  Manager (\"UI\")  became  available in\r\n\nDET's Hyannis, Massachusetts, office,  where Tanca worked, and he\r\n\napplied.    Instead  of  offering him  the  Hyannis  UI position,\r\n\nhowever,  DET offered  him  a similar  position  in New  Bedford,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1 A  count alleging  violations of  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 151B  was\r\nvoluntarily dismissed.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nMassachusetts.  Tanca brought  suit, alleging that DET retaliated\r\n\nagainst  him for making his complaints -- a protected activity --\r\n\nby refusing him  the Hyannis  position and offering  him the  New\r\n\nBedford one.  Because  of the distance between Hyannis,  where he\r\n\nlived, and New Bedford, Tanca  described the offered position  as\r\n\nsignificantly less desirable.   DET denied that the decision  was\r\n\nmotivated by retaliation, and maintained that it was based solely\r\n\non legitimate concerns regarding Tanca's management abilities and\r\n\nDET's ability to supervise Tanca in New Bedford.\r\n\n          The case  was tried  before  a jury,  which found  that\r\n\nTanca had  engaged in good  faith activity protected  under Title\r\n\nVII,  that the activity was a motivating factor in DET's decision\r\n\n(and thus that DET had retaliated), but that Tanca would not have\r\n\nreceived  the Hyannis  UI position  even absent  the illegitimate\r\n\nconsideration.    The  district court  then  granted  defendants'\r\n\nMotion  for Judgment  as  a Matter  of  Law, finding  that  Price\r                                                                           \r\n\nWaterhouse  governed the  parties' dispute  and that,  under that\r                    \r\n\ncase, because the jury found that DET would have reached the same\r\n\ndecision absent  any retaliatory motives, DET could  not be found\r\n\nliable.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n              A.  Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act\r                        A.  Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act\r                                                             \r\n\n          We  first outline the  pertinent law, and  then turn to\r\n\nthe interpretation of the statutes in question.\r\n\n                    1.  The Legal Framework  \r                              1.  The Legal Framework  \r                                                     \r\n\n          At the  center of  this case sits  the Supreme  Court's\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ndecision  in Price Waterhouse.  In that gender bias decision, the\r                                       \r\n\nCourt confronted a case in  which the adverse employment decision\r\n\nresulted from  a mixture of legitimate  and illegitimate motives.\r\n\nSettling  a dispute among the circuits over how to deal with such\r\n\n\"mixed  motive\" cases, see Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 238 n.2,\r                                                     \r\n\nthe Court determined that \"an employer shall not be  liable if it\r\n\ncan prove that, even if it had not taken gender  into account, it\r\n\nwould have  come  to the  same  decision regarding  a  particular\r\n\nperson.\"   Id. at 242.   As the trial  court in this  case noted,\r                        \r\n\n\"[p]ut another way,  the Court  held that it  was an  affirmative\r\n\ndefense  to a  charge of  unlawful intentional  discrimination to\r\n\nshow that the employer would have made the same decision even  in\r\n\nthe absence of an unlawful motive.\"  Memorandum and Order, at 3.\r\n\n          Although Price  Waterhouse was  a gender case  under 42\r                                              \r\n\nU.S.C.    2000e-2, the  Supreme Court  stated  that its  analysis\r\n\nextended  to the  other unlawful  employment practices  listed in\r\n\nsection  2000e-2(a),  namely,  \"discrimination  based   on  race,\r\n\nreligion, or national origin.\"  Id. at 244 n.9.  Subsequent cases\r                                             \r\n\nhave  extended the Price Waterhouse analysis to a series of other\r                                             \r\n\ndiscrimination  contexts,  including  retaliation  claims.

We  are accordingly  faced  with an  issue of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Section 107(b) states, in relevant part, that\r\n\n          [o]n a claim in  which an individual proves a\r\n          violation  under  section 2000e-2(m)  of this\r\n          title and a  respondent demonstrates that the\r\n          respondent  would have taken  the same action\r\n          in   the   absence   of   the   impermissible\r\n          motivating factor, the court --\r\n\n               (i)  may grant  declaratory relief,\r\n               injunctive   relief    (except   as\r\n               provided   in  clause   (ii)),  and\r\n               attorney's    fees    and     costs\r\n               demonstrated    to   be    directly\r\n               attributable only to the pursuit of\r\n               a claim under section 2000e-2(m) of\r\n               this title; and\r\n\n               (ii)  shall  not  award damages  or\r\n               issue   an   order  requiring   any\r\n               admission,  reinstatement,  hiring,\r\n               promotion, or payment, described in\r\n               subparagraph (A).\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(g)(2)(B).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nstatutory  interpretation:   do  the mixed  motive provisions  of\r\n\nsection  107(b) extend  to Title  VII retaliation  claims brought\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.   2000e-3?\r\n\n          As  always,  we  begin  our  analysis  with  the  plain\r\n\nlanguage  of the statute.   See, e.g., United  States v. Ram rez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFerrer, 82  F.3d 1131,  1136 (1st  Cir. 1996).   By doing  so, we\r                \r\n\nimmediately  encounter  Tanca's  fundamental   problem:    as   a\r\n\nretaliation  claim,  his suit was brought under section 2000e-3,4\r\n\nand  although  section   107(b)  specifically  addresses  section\r\n\n107(a),  it makes no mention of section 2000e-3.  Indeed, section\r\n\n107(b) plainly states  that it applies  to \"a  claim in which  an\r\n\nindividual  proves  a  violation  under     2000e-2(m) [107(a)].\"\r\n\nSection 107(a),  in turn, specifies that  \"an unlawful employment\r\n\npractice is established when  the complaining party  demonstrates\r\n\nthat  race, color,  religion,  sex,  or  national  origin  was  a\r\n\nmotivating factor.\"5  There is no reference to section 2000e-3 or\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   That section,  which codifies section  704 of the  1964 Civil\r\nRights  Act, makes  it  an unlawful  employment  practice for  an\r\nemployer to discriminate against an employee\r\n\n            because he has  opposed any practice made\r\n            an unlawful employment  practice by  this\r\n            subchapter,  or because  he  has  made  a\r\n            charge,    testified,     assisted,    or\r\n            participated   in   any   manner  in   an\r\n            investigation,  proceeding,  or   hearing\r\n            under this subchapter.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-3(a).\r\n\n5   The  parties do  not make  an argument  on the  basis  of the\r\n\"[e]xcept as  otherwise provided in this  subchapter\" language of\r\nsection 107(a), quoted in footnote 2,  supra.  We note that we do\r                                                      \r\nnot read the quoted  language as expanding the scope  of   2000e-\r\n2(m) to  include retaliation  claims.   Indeed, such an  argument\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nretaliation claims in  either provision.   As the district  court\r\n\nfound,  \"nothing in the 1991 Act would  appear to change any rule\r\n\nwith respect  to retaliation claims  which existed  prior to  its\r\n\nenactment.\"   Memorandum and Order, at 8; cf. Sunshine Dev., Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

On its  face,\r\n\nthen,  the statute  seems to  express an  intent not  to preclude\r\n\napplication of  Price Waterhouse  in the context  of mixed-motive\r                                          \r\n\nretaliation cases.   See Reiss v. Dalton,  845 F. Supp.  742, 744\r                                                  \r\n\n(S.D.  Cal. 1993)  (rejecting  application of  section 107(b)  to\r\n\nTitle VII mixed motive retaliation claim as contrary to the plain\r\n\nmeaning of the statute).\r\n\n          Tanca argues otherwise.   He maintains that reliance on\r\n\nthe plain  meaning of the statute would be inappropriate, because\r\n\nthe   \"clear\"  legislative  history  demonstrates  that  Congress\r\n\nintended that  other employment statutes modeled  after Title VII\r\n\nadopt its new mixed motive analysis.6  See Greenwood Trust Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n\"would require  us to assume  that Congress chose  a surprisingly\r\nindirect  route  to  convey  an important  and  easily  expressed\r\nmessage.\"  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 262.\r                             \r\n\n6   Tanca also seeks support  from section 3(4) of  the 1991 Act.\r\nThat  section states  that  one of  the  Act's purposes  was  \"to\r\nrespond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the\r\nscope of  relevant  civil rights  statutes  in order  to  provide\r\nadequate protection to victims of discrimination.\"  Although this\r\nlanguage lends  credence to the  premise that Congress  sought to\r\noverturn  Price  Waterhouse  at  least   in  part,  it  does  not\r                                     \r\nnecessarily  follow that Congress  felt victims of discrimination\r\ncould only  be  \"adequate[ly]  protect[ed]\"  if a  new  rule  was\r\nestablished  in relation  to retaliation  claims  as well  as the\r\nenumerated discrimination claims.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nMassachusetts, 971 F.2d 818, 825 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[A] court must\r                       \r\n\nalways hesitate to construe words in a statute according to their\r\n\napparent  meaning if to do so  would defeat Congress's discovered\r\n\nintendment.\"), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1052 (1993).   \r                                     \r\n\n          First, he  argues that,  because we \"must  presume that\r\n\nCongress  knows   of   prior   judicial   or   executive   branch\r\n\ninterpretations  of a  statute when it  . . .  amends a statute,\"\r\n\nRam rez-Ferrer,  82 F.3d at  1137, we must  presume that Congress\r                        \r\n\nknew  of  the  judicial  practice  of  borrowing  the  order  and\r\n\nallocations  of burdens  of proof developed  under Title  VII and\r\n\napplying   them  to  retaliation   cases  and   other  employment\r\n\ndiscrimination cases.   See, e.g.,  Griffiths, 988  F.2d at  468.\r                                                       \r\n\nTherefore,  the argument  goes,  Congress' failure  to amend  all\r\n\nother employment discrimination statutes at the same time that it\r\n\namended section  2000e-2 can mean that Congress presumed that the\r\n\ncourts would continue  to borrow  and apply  Title VII  concepts,\r\n\nincluding  the  newly  minted  mixed  motive  damages  provision.\r\n\nIndeed, there is some arguable support in the legislative history\r\n\nfor  his position.  The House Report from the Judiciary Committee\r\n\nstates that \r\n\n            [t]he Committee  intends that . . . other\r\n            laws   modeled   after   Title   VII   be\r\n            interpreted  consistently   in  a  manner\r\n            consistent with  Title VII as  amended by\r\n            this Act.  For example,  disparate impact\r\n            claims under the ADA should be treated in\r\n            the same manner as under Title VII.  \r\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 40(II),  102d Cong., 1st Sess. 4  (1991), reprinted\r                                                                           \r\n\nin 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 694, 697.\r            \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          Assuming arguendo that Congress  did intend the section\r\n\n107  model to  apply  beyond Title  VII,  Tanca's argument  still\r\n\nfails.  Simply  put, Tanca is not arguing that  we borrow a Title\r\n\nVII  concept and use it to interpret another statute, such as the\r\n\nADA.   Rather, he wants us  to read one Title  VII provision into\r\n\nanother.   He  contends  that  Congress  wanted  us  to  do  such\r\n\nborrowing, but it seems just as likely that because Congress knew\r\n\nof  the judicial borrowing, in  order to avoid  such borrowing it\r\n\nspecified which particular aspects of Title VII would be affected\r\n\nby  referencing  107(a)  in  section  107(b).    Tanca  cites  no\r\n\nlegislative history that suggests otherwise.  \r\n\n          This interpretation  gains additional support  from the\r\n\nfact that \"'[w]here Congress  includes particular language in one\r\n\nsection of  a statute but omits it in another section of the same\r\n\nAct, it  is generally  presumed that Congress  acts intentionally\r\n\nand  purposely   in  the  disparate  inclusion   or  exclusion.'\"\r\n\nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Wong Kim  Bo,  472 F.2d  720,  722 (5th  Cir.  1972)).\r                                 \r\n\nSection  102 of  the 1991  Act, codified  at 42  U.S.C.    1981a,\r\n\nprovides for compensatory and punitive damages and specifies that\r\n\nits provisions  will apply to  complaining parties  who bring  an\r\n\naction under section  2000e-3 -- the retaliation section at issue\r\n\nhere --  as well as  2000e-2.   42 U.S.C.    1981a(a)(1).   Thus,\r\n\nbecause Congress addressed  the retaliation section elsewhere  in\r\n\nthe 1991 Act, but chose not to do so in section 107(a) or (b), it\r\n\nwould seem  that \"where Congress intended  to address retaliation\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nviolations, it knew how to do so and did so  expressly.\"7  Reiss,\r                                                                          \r\n\n845 F. Supp. at 745. Second,  Tanca cites a  series of additional\r\n\npassages from  the legislative  history in arguing  that Congress\r\n\nintended  that no part of the prior Price Waterhouse mixed motive\r                                                              \r\n\nanalysis  should remain in  effect.  As  Tanca argues, statements\r\n\nsuch  as the following could be  read to support the premise that\r\n\nthe 1991 Act  should be  read liberally as  regards mixed  motive\r\n\ncases:\r\n\n            If Title  VII's ban on  discrimination in\r\n            employment is to  be meaningful,  victims\r\n            of  proven discrimination must be able to\r\n            obtain   relief,   and  perpetrators   of\r\n            discrimination  must  be held  liable for\r\n            their   actions.       Price   Waterhouse\r                                                               \r\n            jeopardizes that fundamental principle.\r\n\nH.R.  Rep. 40(I), 102d Cong.,  1st Sess. 47  (1991), reprinted in\r                                                                           \r\n\n1991  U.S.C.C.A.N.   549,  585  (Education  and  Labor  Committee\r\n\nReport).  \r\n\n          We need not enter into his argument in detail, however,\r\n\nas  our review of this and  the other passages of the legislative\r\n\nhistory on which Tanca seeks  to rely leads us to  the conclusion\r\n\nthat Congress'  intent remains unclear  regarding the application\r\n\nof the 1991  Act to  Title VII mixed  motive retaliation  claims.\r\n\nIndeed, such  claims are never  directly addressed  in the  cited\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  Indeed, although section 107(b) does not reference retaliation\r\nclaims,  the already existing subsection immediately preceding it\r\nin  Title VII  does.   See 42  U.S.C.    2000-e(5)(g)(2)(A).   As\r                                    \r\nappellees  note,  the  inclusion  of retaliation  claims  in  one\r\nsubsection, juxtaposed with their omission in  the next, tends to\r\nsupport the premise that  Congress' omission of the claim  in the\r\nlatter provision was  intentional.   See Reiss, 845  F. Supp.  at\r                                                        \r\n745.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nlegislative history.   \"'Absent  a clearly  expressed legislative\r\n\nintention  to the  contrary [the]  language [of  a statute]  must\r\n\nordinarily be regarded as conclusive.'\"  Kaiser Aluminum  &amp; Chem.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp. v.

Therefore, as  the plain  meaning  of the  statute is\r\n\nclear, and this  is not a statute whose  \"meanings . . .  take on\r\n\ndifferent  colorations   when  read  in  their   legislative  and\r\n\nhistorical  context,\"  Greenwood Trust  Co., 971 F.2d  at 826, we\r                                                     \r\n\nconclude that the mixed  motive provisions of section 107  of the\r\n\n1991 Act do  not apply  to Title VII  retaliation claims  brought\r\n\nunder section 2000e-3.  \r\n\n          We are conscious  that our decision  in this case  goes\r\n\nagainst those of  some federal  courts that have  looked at  this\r\n\nissue.   However, examination of the cases Tanca cites as support\r\n\nfor his argument reveals  that, although all of them  would apply\r\n\nsection  107(b) to Title VII mixed motive retaliation claims, and\r\n\nsome of  them examined  the legislative  history in  drawing that\r\n\nconclusion,  none of  them  weighed  the  plain language  of  the\r\n\nstatute  prior to borrowing the provision.

The  district  court   found  that\r                                   \r\nsupplemental   questions   put   to   the   jury   remedied   any\r\ninconsistencies in  the verdict,  but noted in  passing that  the\r\n1991 Act  had overruled Price Waterhouse.   Id. at 318  n.2.  The\r                                                         \r\ndistrict court cited Robinson  v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth.,\r                                                                          \r\n982 F.2d 892  (3d Cir.  1993), as support  for that  proposition.\r\nExamination of Robinson shows that the court there cited the 1991\r                                 \r\nAct  only for the proposition that \"Title VII contemplates that a\r\ncorporation may  be liable  for dismissing  an employee  when its\r\nmotives  contain   a  mixture  of  legitimate   and  illegitimate\r\nreasons.\"   Id.  at 899  &amp;  n.8.   As the  underlying dispute  in\r                         \r\nRobinson was tried prior  to the 1991 Act's enactment,  the court\r                  \r\ndid not apply it to the dispute.\r\n\n    A panel of this  court affirmed in part  and vacated in  part\r\nthe  district  court's decision.    See  Kerr-Selgas v.  American\r                                                                           \r\nAirlines,  Inc., 69 F.3d  1205 (1st Cir. 1995).   The panel found\r                         \r\nthat American had no alternative just cause to fire Selgas.  Thus\r\nneither Price Waterhouse nor the 1991 Act was implicated.  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n1210-11.   In  outlining  American's failed  argument, the  panel\r\ncited Griffiths v.  CIGNA Corp. for the proposition  that section\r                                         \r\n107(b)'s  affirmative  defense  would apply  to  the  retaliation\r\nclaim.   Id. at 1210; see  Griffiths, 988 F.2d at  472.  However,\r                                              \r\nthe court  in  Griffiths neither  applied section  107(b) to  the\r                                  \r\nplaintiff's  retaliation  claim  nor  engaged  in  any  statutory\r\ninterpretation  of its  applicability, as  that case  was brought\r\nprior  to the application of  the 1991 Act.   In the end, we find\r\nthat, although there is  some suggestion in Kerr-Selgas  that the\r                                                                 \r\n1991  Act should  apply to  Tanca's claim,  neither of  the cases\r\nrelied on for that  proposition, nor Kerr-Selgas itself, supplies\r                                                          \r\nus with any reason to doubt the result reached here today.  \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nmotive retaliation  claims.  Accordingly, we  weigh the remainder\r\n\nof Tanca's arguments under Price Waterhouse.\r                                                     \r\n\n                    B.  The Jury Instructions\r                              B.  The Jury Instructions\r                                                       \r\n\n          Tanca's next argument centers on the jury instructions.\r\n\nQuestion  four  on  the jury  verdict  form  asked:   \"Would  the\r\n\nemployer  have offered Mr. Tanca  a promotion in  Hyannis were it\r\n\nnot  for plaintiff's protected opposition?\"  The jury sent a note\r\n\nto the judge regarding question four as follows:\r\n\n            Does the word \"a\"  refer to any promotion\r\n            in  the Hyannis office or the specific UI\r\n            position for which Mr. Tanca had applied?\r\n\nThe court replied that \r\n\n            [t]he words  \"a promotion\" in  Question 4\r\n            refers [sic] to the specific  UI position\r\n            for which Mr. Tanca had applied.\r\n\nThe jury then returned  a verdict answering question four  in the\r\n\nnegative,  finding that DET would  not have offered  Tanca the UI\r\n\nposition in Hyannis, even without the illegitimate motivations.\r\n\n          Tanca  argues now that the UI position was not the only\r\n\nHyannis  position that the jury should have considered.  In fact,\r\n\nhe points out, after naming the new Hyannis UI, DET created a new\r\n\nmanager position below the  UI in Hyannis, which would  also have\r\n\nbeen a  promotion for  Tanca.  This  position was not  offered to\r\n\nTanca.    Based on  this, Tanca  claims DET  did not  satisfy its\r\n\nburden of proof  under Price Waterhouse in that  it did not prove\r                                                 \r\n\nthat it would  have come to the same decision even  if it had not\r\n\ntaken the unlawful  motive into account.   See Price  Waterhouse,\r                                                                          \r\n\n490 U.S. at 244.   The pertinent decision here,  he contends, was\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nDET's choice to offer him a position in New Bedford,  and not one\r\n\nin Hyannis.  While the jury found that DET would not have offered\r\n\nhim the Hyannis  UI position, it did not find  that DET would not\r\n\nhave  offered him the new  manager position either, he maintains,\r\n\nbecause it was  not asked.   Therefore, he  continues, the  court\r\n\nshould  have responded to the jury's inquiry by telling them that\r\n\nquestion four referred  to any promotion  in the Hyannis  office.\r                                        \r\n\nSince it  did not, he concludes, DET has not met its burden under\r\n\nPrice Waterhouse.  Tanca  acknowledges that he did not  object to\r                          \r\n\nthe district court's response,  but contends that it was  not his\r\n\nduty to do so:  as DET had to  prove each element of its defense,\r\n\nhe argues, it should have objected.\r\n\n          Our  review of  the record  below, however,  reveals no\r\n\nmention  of  the  new  manager  position  in  Tanca's  Complaint,\r\n\nOpposition to Defendants' Motion  for Summary Judgment, Pre-trial\r\n\nMemorandum, Trial Brief, Motion for a New Trial, or Opposition to\r\n\nDefendants'  Motion for Judgment.  Nor did Tanca object to either\r\n\nthe  jury  instructions  or  the judge's  answer  to  the  jury's\r\n\nquestion  on these grounds.  Accordingly, we find that by failing\r\n\nto squarely raise any question regarding the new manager position\r\n\nbefore  the district court, Tanca has  waived the opportunity for\r\n\nargument  on that  point here.   See  Timberland Design  v. First\r                                                                           \r\n\nServ.

Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989)), also apply to claims of retaliation.  We hold that they do not and that the rule of Price Waterhouse applies to retaliation claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are drawn from the district court's Memorandum and Order.  Tanca is a white male who was a longterm DET employee.  After several minority employees were promoted into positions for which Tanca had applied, Tanca complained to high level DET managers.  He believed that he was better qualified than the promoted employees and that their promotion was due to reverse discrimination.  At some point, a position as an Unemployment Insurance Manager (\"UI\") became available in DET's Hyannis, Massachusetts, office, where Tanca worked, and he applied.  Instead of offering him the Hyannis UI position, however, DET offered him a similar position in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  Tanca brought suit, alleging that DET retaliated against him for making his complaints--a protected activity--by refusing him the Hyannis position and offering him the New Bedford one.  Because of the distance between Hyannis, where he lived, and New Bedford, Tanca described the offered position as significantly less desirable.  DET denied that the decision was motivated by retaliation, and maintained that it was based solely on legitimate concerns regarding Tanca's management abilities and DET's ability to supervise Tanca in New Bedford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried before a jury, which found that Tanca had engaged in good faith activity protected under Title VII, that the activity was a motivating factor in DET's decision (and thus that DET had retaliated), but that Tanca would not have received the Hyannis UI position even absent the illegitimate consideration.  The district court then granted defendants' Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, finding that Price Waterhouse governed the parties' dispute and that, under that case, because the jury found that DET would have reached the same decision absent any retaliatory motives, DET could not be found liable.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first outline the pertinent law, and then turn to the interpretation of the statutes in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the center of this case sits the Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse.   In that gender bias decision, the Court confronted a case in which the adverse employment decision resulted from a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.  Settling a dispute among the circuits over how to deal with such \"mixed motive\" cases, see Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 238 n. 2, 109 S.Ct. at 1784 n. 2, the Court determined that \"an employer shall not be liable if it can prove that, even if it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding a particular person.\"  Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 1786.   As the trial court in this case noted, \"[p]ut another way, the Court held that it was an affirmative defense to a charge of unlawful intentional discrimination to show that the employer would have made the same decision even in the absence of an unlawful motive.\"  Memorandum and Order, at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Price Waterhouse was a gender case under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2, the Supreme Court stated that its analysis extended to the other unlawful employment practices listed in section 2000e-2(a), namely, \"discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin.\"  Id. at 244 n. 9, 109 S.Ct. at 1787 n. 9. Subsequent cases have extended the Price Waterhouse analysis to a series of other discrimination contexts, including retaliation claims.  See Cosgrove v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 9 F.3d 1033, 1039-41 (2d Cir.1993) (analyzing Title VII retaliation claim under Price Waterhouse );  Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp., 988 F.2d 457, 468 (3d Cir.)  (noting that Price Waterhouse applies to mixed motive retaliation claims), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 865, 114 S.Ct. 186, 126 L.Ed.2d 145 (1993), overruled on other grounds, Miller v. CIGNA Corp., 47 F.3d 586, 596 n. 8 (3d Cir.1995);  Kenworthy v. Conoco, Inc., 979 F.2d 1462, 1470-71 (10th Cir.1992) (applying Price Waterhouse to Title VII retaliation claim).  Indeed, at least one court has analyzed retaliation claims in terms of Price Waterhouse even subsequent to the passage of the 1991 Act.  See Veprinsky v. Fluor Daniel, Inc., 87 F.3d 881, 893 (7th Cir.1996).  However, neither the Supreme Court nor this Circuit has held that Price Waterhouse applies to retaliation cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Congress partially overruled Price Waterhouse in the 1991 Act by allowing a finding of liability and limited relief to plaintiffs in mixed motive cases.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, ----, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1489, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).  First, section 107(a) of that Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(m), determines that an employment practice is unlawful even if there are legitimate, as well as illegitimate, motivations for it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Next, section 107(b) of the Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), establishes that if the plaintiff proves a violation of section 107(a), but the defendant demonstrates that it \"would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,\" id., the court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney's fees, although it cannot grant other damages, such as monetary relief or reinstatement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, where Price Waterhouse would have held there was no liability and so would not have allowed any damages, the 1991 Act enables an employee in at least some mixed motive cases to receive certain limited relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca argues that the new mixed motive damages provision applies to all forms of employment discrimination cases, including his own retaliation claim, and we should allow him the liability finding and remedies under section 107(b) the statute permits.  We are accordingly faced with an issue of statutory interpretation:  do the mixed motive provisions of section 107(b) extend to Title VII retaliation claims brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As always, we begin our analysis with the plain language of the statute.  See, e.g., United States v. Ramrez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d 1131, 1136 (1st Cir.1996).  By doing so, we immediately encounter Tanca's fundamental problem:  as a retaliation claim, his suit was brought under section 2000e-3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and although section 107(b) specifically addresses section 107(a), it makes no mention of section 2000e-3.  Indeed, section 107(b) plainly states that it applies to \"a claim in which an individual proves a violation under &#167; 2000e-2(m) [107(a) ].\"  Section 107(a), in turn, specifies that \"an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  There is no reference to section 2000e-3 or retaliation claims in either provision.  As the district court found, \"nothing in the 1991 Act would appear to change any rule with respect to retaliation claims which existed prior to its enactment.\"  Memorandum and Order, at 8;  cf. Sunshine Dev., Inc. v. FDIC, 33 F.3d 106, 116 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[A] legislature's affirmative description of certain powers or exemptions implies denial of nondescribed powers or exemptions.\").  On its face, then, the statute seems to express an intent not to preclude application of Price Waterhouse in the context of mixed-motive retaliation cases.  See Riess v. Dalton, 845 F.Supp. 742, 744 (S.D.Cal.1993) (rejecting application of section 107(b) to Title VII mixed motive retaliation claim as contrary to the plain meaning of the statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca argues otherwise.  He maintains that reliance on the plain meaning of the statute would be inappropriate, because the \"clear\" legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended that other employment statutes modeled after Title VII adopt its new mixed motive analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Greenwood Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 971 F.2d 818, 825 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[A] court must always hesitate to construe words in a statute according to their apparent meaning if to do so would defeat Congress's discovered intendment.\"), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1052, 113 S.Ct. 974, 122 L.Ed.2d 129 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, he argues that, because we \"must presume that Congress knows of prior judicial or executive branch interpretations of a statute when it ... amends a statute,\" Ramrez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d at 1137, we must presume that Congress knew of the judicial practice of borrowing the order and allocations of burdens of proof developed under Title VII and applying them to retaliation cases and other employment discrimination cases.  See, e.g., Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 468.   Therefore, the argument goes, Congress' failure to amend all other employment discrimination statutes at the same time that it amended section 2000e-2 can mean that Congress presumed that the courts would continue to borrow and apply Title VII concepts, including the newly minted mixed motive damages provision.  Indeed, there is some arguable support in the legislative history for his position.  The House Report from the Judiciary Committee states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[t]he Committee intends that ... other laws modeled after Title VII be interpreted consistently in a manner consistent with Title VII as amended by this Act.  For example, disparate impact claims under the ADA should be treated in the same manner as under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep. No. 40(II), 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 694, 697.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that Congress did intend the section 107 model to apply beyond Title VII, Tanca's argument still fails.  Simply put, Tanca is not arguing that we borrow a Title VII concept and use it to interpret another statute, such as the ADA.  Rather, he wants us to read one Title VII provision into another.  He contends that Congress wanted us to do such borrowing, but it seems just as likely that because Congress knew of the judicial borrowing, in order to avoid such borrowing it specified which particular aspects of Title VII would be affected by referencing 107(a) in section 107(b).  Tanca cites no legislative history that suggests otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation gains additional support from the fact that \" '[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' \"  Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir.1972)).  Section 102 of the 1991 Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a, provides for compensatory and punitive damages and specifies that its provisions will apply to complaining parties who bring an action under section 2000e-3--the retaliation section at issue here--as well as 2000e-2.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1).  Thus, because Congress addressed the retaliation section elsewhere in the 1991 Act, but chose not to do so in section 107(a) or (b), it would seem that \"where Congress intended to address retaliation violations, it knew how to do so and did so expressly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Riess, 845 F.Supp. at 745.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Tanca cites a series of additional passages from the legislative history in arguing that Congress intended that no part of the prior Price Waterhouse mixed motive analysis should remain in effect.  As Tanca argues, statements such as the following could be read to support the premise that the 1991 Act should be read liberally as regards mixed motive cases:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>If Title VII's ban on discrimination in employment is to be meaningful, victims of proven discrimination must be able to obtain relief, and perpetrators of discrimination must be held liable for their actions.  Price Waterhouse jeopardizes that fundamental principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R. Rep. 40(I), 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 585 (Education and Labor Committee Report).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not enter into his argument in detail, however, as our review of this and the other passages of the legislative history on which Tanca seeks to rely leads us to the conclusion that Congress' intent remains unclear regarding the application of the 1991 Act to Title VII mixed motive retaliation claims.  Indeed, such claims are never directly addressed in the cited legislative history.  \" 'Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary [the] language [of a statute] must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.' \"  Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem.  Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 835, 110 S.Ct. 1570, 1575, 108 L.Ed.2d 842 (1990) (quoting Consumer Prod.  Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)).  Therefore, as the plain meaning of the statute is clear, and this is not a statute whose \"meanings ... take on different colorations when read in their legislative and historical context,\" Greenwood Trust Co., 971 F.2d at 826, we conclude that the mixed motive provisions of section 107 of the 1991 Act do not apply to Title VII retaliation claims brought under section 2000e-3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are conscious that our decision in this case goes against those of some federal courts that have looked at this issue.  However, examination of the cases Tanca cites as support for his argument reveals that, although all of them would apply section 107(b) to Title VII mixed motive retaliation claims, and some of them examined the legislative history in drawing that conclusion, none of them weighed the plain language of the statute prior to borrowing the provision.  See Beinlich v. Curry Dev., Inc., 54 F.3d 772 (table), No. 94-1465, 1995 WL 311577 (4th Cir.  May 22, 1995) (unpublished disposition) (citing sections 107(b) and 2000e-3(a), without applying them, in retaliation claim);  Woodson, 898 F.Supp. at 304-06 (pretext case);  Hall v. City of Brawley, 887 F.Supp. 1333, 1345 (S.D.Cal.1995);  Jones-Bell v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Sec., No. 95 C 948, 1995 WL 692321, at * 6-* 7 (N.D.Ill. Nov.20, 1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Indeed, the only case we found that examined the statute under traditional statutory interpretation methods supports our conclusions here.  See Riess, 845 F.Supp. at 744-45.   Nothing in the cited cases or others we have examined leads us to question our conclusion.  We also believe that the Price Waterhouse rule does apply to mixed motive retaliation claims.  Accordingly, we weigh the remainder of Tanca's arguments under Price Waterhouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca's next argument centers on the jury instructions.  Question four on the jury verdict form asked:  \"Would the employer have offered Mr. Tanca a promotion in Hyannis were it not for plaintiff's protected opposition?\"   The jury sent a note to the judge regarding question four as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Does the word \"a\" refer to any promotion in the Hyannis office or the specific UI position for which Mr. Tanca had applied?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court replied that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[t]he words \"a promotion\" in Question 4 refers [sic] to the specific UI position for which Mr. Tanca had applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury then returned a verdict answering question four in the negative, finding that DET would not have offered Tanca the UI position in Hyannis, even without the illegitimate motivations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca argues now that the UI position was not the only Hyannis position that the jury should have considered.  In fact, he points out, after naming the new Hyannis UI, DET created a new manager position below the UI in Hyannis, which would also have been a promotion for Tanca.  This position was not offered to Tanca.  Based on this, Tanca claims DET did not satisfy its burden of proof under Price Waterhouse in that it did not prove that it would have come to the same decision even if it had not taken the unlawful motive into account.  See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 244, 109 S.Ct. at 1787.   The pertinent decision here, he contends, was DET's choice to offer him a position in New Bedford, and not one in Hyannis.  While the jury found that DET would not have offered him the Hyannis UI position, it did not find that DET would not have offered him the new manager position either, he maintains, because it was not asked.  Therefore, he continues, the court should have responded to the jury's inquiry by telling them that question four referred to any promotion in the Hyannis office.  Since it did not, he concludes, DET has not met its burden under Price Waterhouse.   Tanca acknowledges that he did not object to the district court's response, but contends that it was not his duty to do so:  as DET had to prove each element of its defense, he argues, it should have objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record below, however, reveals no mention of the new manager position in Tanca's Complaint, Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Pre-trial Memorandum, Trial Brief, Motion for a New Trial, or Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Judgment.  Nor did Tanca object to either the jury instructions or the judge's answer to the jury's question on these grounds.  Accordingly, we find that by failing to squarely raise any question regarding the new manager position before the district court, Tanca has waived the opportunity for argument on that point here.  See Timberland Design v. First Serv.  Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 51 (1st Cir.1991) (\"It is clearly established that arguments not raised at the district court level will not be considered on appeal.\");   see also Kavanaugh v. Greenlee Tool Co., 944 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1991);  Nimrod v. Sylvester, 369 F.2d 870, 872 (1st Cir.1966).  Even were we not to find waiver, Tanca's position would fail.  Simply put, we cannot see how the trial court could have felt that anything besides the UI position was at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The district court, therefore, did not err in its answer to the jury's question, as the pertinent issue was not whether any Hyannis position would have been offered Tanca, but whether the UI position would have been offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the above the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A count alleging violations of Mass.

That section states that one of the Act's purposes was \"to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.\"   Although this language lends credence to the premise that Congress sought to overturn Price Waterhouse at least in part, it does not necessarily follow that Congress felt victims of discrimination could only be \"adequate[ly] protect[ed]\" if a new rule was established in relation to retaliation claims as well as the enumerated discrimination claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Indeed, although section 107(b) does not reference retaliation claims, the already existing subsection immediately preceding it in Title VII does.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000-e(5)(g)(2)(A).  As appellees note, the inclusion of retaliation claims in one subsection, juxtaposed with their omission in the next, tends to support the premise that Congress' omission of the claim in the latter provision was intentional.  See Riess, 845 F.Supp. at 745</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The parties cite one case from this circuit.  In Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 858 F.Supp. 316 (D.P.R.1994), the district court was faced with a claim that the jury's answers to special interrogatories regarding Title VII retaliation and sex discrimination claims were contradictory.  The employer, American Airlines, argued that the jury found that American would have made the same employment decisions even if Selgas' gender were not taken into account, and so American had an absolute defense under Price Waterhouse.   The district court found that supplemental questions put to the jury remedied any inconsistencies in the verdict, but noted in passing that the 1991 Act had overruled Price Waterhouse.  Id. at 318 n. 2. The district court cited  Robinson v. Southeastern Pa.  Transp. Auth., 982 F.2d 892 (3d Cir.1993), as support for that proposition.  Examination of Robinson shows that the court there cited the 1991 Act only for the proposition that \"Title VII contemplates that a corporation may be liable for dismissing an employee when its motives contain a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate reasons.\"  Id. at 899 &amp; n. 8. As the underlying dispute in Robinson was tried prior to the 1991 Act's enactment, the court did not apply it to the dispute</p>\n        <p>A panel of this court affirmed in part and vacated in part the district court's decision.  See Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205 (1st Cir.1995).  The panel found that American had no alternative just cause to fire Selgas.  Thus neither Price Waterhouse nor the 1991 Act was implicated.  Id. at 1210-11.   In outlining American's failed argument, the panel cited Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp. for the proposition that section 107(b)'s affirmative defense would apply to the retaliation claim.  Id. at 1210;  see Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 472.   However, the court in Griffiths neither applied section 107(b) to the plaintiff's retaliation claim nor engaged in any statutory interpretation of its applicability, as that case was brought prior to the application of the 1991 Act.  In the end, we find that, although there is some suggestion in Kerr-Selgas that the 1991 Act should apply to Tanca's claim, neither of the cases relied on for that proposition, nor Kerr-Selgas itself, supplies us with any reason to doubt the result reached here today.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> For example, in his Pre-Trial Memorandum, Tanca listed only two contested issues of fact:</p>\n        <p>A.

Tanca is a white male who was a longterm DET employee.  After several minority employees were promoted into positions for which Tanca had applied, Tanca complained to high level DET managers.  He believed that he was better qualified than the promoted employees and that their promotion was due to reverse discrimination.  At some point, a position as an Unemployment Insurance Manager (\"UI\") became available in DET's Hyannis, Massachusetts, office, where Tanca worked, and he applied.  Instead of offering him the Hyannis UI position, however, DET offered him a similar position in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  Tanca brought suit, alleging that DET retaliated against him for making his complaints--a protected activity--by refusing him the Hyannis position and offering him the New Bedford one.  Because of the distance between Hyannis, where he lived, and New Bedford, Tanca described the offered position as significantly less desirable.  DET denied that the decision was motivated by retaliation, and maintained that it was based solely on legitimate concerns regarding Tanca's management abilities and DET's ability to supervise Tanca in New Bedford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried before a jury, which found that Tanca had engaged in good faith activity protected under Title VII, that the activity was a motivating factor in DET's decision (and thus that DET had retaliated), but that Tanca would not have received the Hyannis UI position even absent the illegitimate consideration.  The district court then granted defendants' Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, finding that Price Waterhouse governed the parties' dispute and that, under that case, because the jury found that DET would have reached the same decision absent any retaliatory motives, DET could not be found liable.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first outline the pertinent law, and then turn to the interpretation of the statutes in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the center of this case sits the Supreme Court's decision in Price Waterhouse.   In that gender bias decision, the Court confronted a case in which the adverse employment decision resulted from a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives.  Settling a dispute among the circuits over how to deal with such \"mixed motive\" cases, see Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 238 n. 2, 109 S.Ct. at 1784 n. 2, the Court determined that \"an employer shall not be liable if it can prove that, even if it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding a particular person.\"  Id. at 242, 109 S.Ct. at 1786.   As the trial court in this case noted, \"[p]ut another way, the Court held that it was an affirmative defense to a charge of unlawful intentional discrimination to show that the employer would have made the same decision even in the absence of an unlawful motive.\"  Memorandum and Order, at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Price Waterhouse was a gender case under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2, the Supreme Court stated that its analysis extended to the other unlawful employment practices listed in section 2000e-2(a), namely, \"discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin.\"  Id. at 244 n. 9, 109 S.Ct. at 1787 n. 9.

See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, section 107(a) of that Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(m), determines that an employment practice is unlawful even if there are legitimate, as well as illegitimate, motivations for it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Next, section 107(b) of the Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), establishes that if the plaintiff proves a violation of section 107(a), but the defendant demonstrates that it \"would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,\" id., the court may grant declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney's fees, although it cannot grant other damages, such as monetary relief or reinstatement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, where Price Waterhouse would have held there was no liability and so would not have allowed any damages, the 1991 Act enables an employee in at least some mixed motive cases to receive certain limited relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca argues that the new mixed motive damages provision applies to all forms of employment discrimination cases, including his own retaliation claim, and we should allow him the liability finding and remedies under section 107(b) the statute permits.  We are accordingly faced with an issue of statutory interpretation:  do the mixed motive provisions of section 107(b) extend to Title VII retaliation claims brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As always, we begin our analysis with the plain language of the statute.  See, e.g., United States v. Ramrez-Ferrer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717544\"><a href=\"/opinion/717544/united-states-v-felipe-ramirez-ferrer-united-states-v-jorge-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span>, 1136 (1st Cir.1996).  By doing so, we immediately encounter Tanca's fundamental problem:  as a retaliation claim, his suit was brought under section 2000e-3,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and although section 107(b) specifically addresses section 107(a), it makes no mention of section 2000e-3.  Indeed, section 107(b) plainly states that it applies to \"a claim in which an individual proves a violation under &#167; 2000e-2(m) [107(a) ].\"  Section 107(a), in turn, specifies that \"an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  There is no reference to section 2000e-3 or retaliation claims in either provision.  As the district court found, \"nothing in the 1991 Act would appear to change any rule with respect to retaliation claims which existed prior to its enactment.\"  Memorandum and Order, at 8;  cf. Sunshine Dev., Inc. v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676988\"><a href=\"/opinion/676988/sunshine-development-inc-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 116 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[A] legislature's affirmative description of certain powers or exemptions implies denial of nondescribed powers or exemptions.\").  On its face, then, the statute seems to express an intent not to preclude application of Price Waterhouse in the context of mixed-motive retaliation cases.  See Riess v. Dalton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></span>, 744 (S.D.Cal.1993) (rejecting application of section 107(b) to Title VII mixed motive retaliation claim as contrary to the plain meaning of the statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca argues otherwise.  He maintains that reliance on the plain meaning of the statute would be inappropriate, because the \"clear\" legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended that other employment statutes modeled after Title VII adopt its new mixed motive analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Greenwood Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588109\"><a href=\"/opinion/588109/greenwood-trust-company-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>, 825 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[A] court must always hesitate to construe words in a statute according to their apparent meaning if to do so would defeat Congress's discovered intendment.\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See, e.g., Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 468.   Therefore, the argument goes, Congress' failure to amend all other employment discrimination statutes at the same time that it amended section 2000e-2 can mean that Congress presumed that the courts would continue to borrow and apply Title VII concepts, including the newly minted mixed motive damages provision.  Indeed, there is some arguable support in the legislative history for his position.  The House Report from the Judiciary Committee states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>[t]he Committee intends that ... other laws modeled after Title VII be interpreted consistently in a manner consistent with Title VII as amended by this Act.  For example, disparate impact claims under the ADA should be treated in the same manner as under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep.

Simply put, Tanca is not arguing that we borrow a Title VII concept and use it to interpret another statute, such as the ADA.  Rather, he wants us to read one Title VII provision into another.  He contends that Congress wanted us to do such borrowing, but it seems just as likely that because Congress knew of the judicial borrowing, in order to avoid such borrowing it specified which particular aspects of Title VII would be affected by referencing 107(a) in section 107(b).  Tanca cites no legislative history that suggests otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation gains additional support from the fact that \" '[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' \"  Russello v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section 102 of the 1991 Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a, provides for compensatory and punitive damages and specifies that its provisions will apply to complaining parties who bring an action under section 2000e-3--the retaliation section at issue here--as well as 2000e-2.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(a)(1).  Thus, because Congress addressed the retaliation section elsewhere in the 1991 Act, but chose not to do so in section 107(a) or (b), it would seem that \"where Congress intended to address retaliation violations, it knew how to do so and did so expressly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Riess, 845 F.Supp. at 745.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Tanca cites a series of additional passages from the legislative history in arguing that Congress intended that no part of the prior Price Waterhouse mixed motive analysis should remain in effect.  As Tanca argues, statements such as the following could be read to support the premise that the 1991 Act should be read liberally as regards mixed motive cases:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>If Title VII's ban on discrimination in employment is to be meaningful, victims of proven discrimination must be able to obtain relief, and perpetrators of discrimination must be held liable for their actions.  Price Waterhouse jeopardizes that fundamental principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.

Indeed, such claims are never directly addressed in the cited legislative history.  \" 'Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary [the] language [of a statute] must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.' \"  Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem.

Therefore, as the plain meaning of the statute is clear, and this is not a statute whose \"meanings ... take on different colorations when read in their legislative and historical context,\" Greenwood Trust Co., 971 F.2d at 826, we conclude that the mixed motive provisions of section 107 of the 1991 Act do not apply to Title VII retaliation claims brought under section 2000e-3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are conscious that our decision in this case goes against those of some federal courts that have looked at this issue.  However, examination of the cases Tanca cites as support for his argument reveals that, although all of them would apply section 107(b) to Title VII mixed motive retaliation claims, and some of them examined the legislative history in drawing that conclusion, none of them weighed the plain language of the statute prior to borrowing the provision.

See Riess, 845 F.Supp. at 744-45.   Nothing in the cited cases or others we have examined leads us to question our conclusion.  We also believe that the Price Waterhouse rule does apply to mixed motive retaliation claims.  Accordingly, we weigh the remainder of Tanca's arguments under Price Waterhouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca's next argument centers on the jury instructions.  Question four on the jury verdict form asked:  \"Would the employer have offered Mr. Tanca a promotion in Hyannis were it not for plaintiff's protected opposition?\"   The jury sent a note to the judge regarding question four as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Does the word \"a\" refer to any promotion in the Hyannis office or the specific UI position for which Mr. Tanca had applied?</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court replied that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[t]he words \"a promotion\" in Question 4 refers [sic] to the specific UI position for which Mr. Tanca had applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury then returned a verdict answering question four in the negative, finding that DET would not have offered Tanca the UI position in Hyannis, even without the illegitimate motivations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tanca argues now that the UI position was not the only Hyannis position that the jury should have considered.  In fact, he points out, after naming the new Hyannis UI, DET created a new manager position below the UI in Hyannis, which would also have been a promotion for Tanca.  This position was not offered to Tanca.  Based on this, Tanca claims DET did not satisfy its burden of proof under Price Waterhouse in that it did not prove that it would have come to the same decision even if it had not taken the unlawful motive into account.  See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 244, 109 S.Ct. at 1787.   The pertinent decision here, he contends, was DET's choice to offer him a position in New Bedford, and not one in Hyannis.  While the jury found that DET would not have offered him the Hyannis UI position, it did not find that DET would not have offered him the new manager position either, he maintains, because it was not asked.  Therefore, he continues, the court should have responded to the jury's inquiry by telling them that question four referred to any promotion in the Hyannis office.  Since it did not, he concludes, DET has not met its burden under Price Waterhouse.   Tanca acknowledges that he did not object to the district court's response, but contends that it was not his duty to do so:  as DET had to prove each element of its defense, he argues, it should have objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record below, however, reveals no mention of the new manager position in Tanca's Complaint, Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Pre-trial Memorandum, Trial Brief, Motion for a New Trial, or Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Judgment.  Nor did Tanca object to either the jury instructions or the judge's answer to the jury's question on these grounds.  Accordingly, we find that by failing to squarely raise any question regarding the new manager position before the district court, Tanca has waived the opportunity for argument on that point here.

Bank for Sav., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560455\"><a href=\"/opinion/560455/timberland-design-inc-and-william-c-barnsley-v-first-service-bank-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991) (\"It is clearly established that arguments not raised at the district court level will not be considered on appeal.\");   see also Kavanaugh v.

Even were we not to find waiver, Tanca's position would fail.  Simply put, we cannot see how the trial court could have felt that anything besides the UI position was at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The district court, therefore, did not err in its answer to the jury's question, as the pertinent issue was not whether any Hyannis position would have been offered Tanca, but whether the UI position would have been offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the above the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A count alleging violations of Mass.

We note that we do not read the quoted language as expanding the scope of &#167; 2000e-2(m) to include retaliation claims.  Indeed, such an argument \"would require us to assume that Congress chose a surprisingly indirect route to convey an important and easily expressed message.\"  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 262, 114 S.Ct. at 1486</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Tanca also seeks support from section 3(4) of the 1991 Act.  That section states that one of the Act's purposes was \"to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.\"   Although this language lends credence to the premise that Congress sought to overturn Price Waterhouse at least in part, it does not necessarily follow that Congress felt victims of discrimination could only be \"adequate[ly] protect[ed]\" if a new rule was established in relation to retaliation claims as well as the enumerated discrimination claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Indeed, although section 107(b) does not reference retaliation claims, the already existing subsection immediately preceding it in Title VII does.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000-e(5)(g)(2)(A).  As appellees note, the inclusion of retaliation claims in one subsection, juxtaposed with their omission in the next, tends to support the premise that Congress' omission of the claim in the latter provision was intentional.  See Riess, 845 F.Supp. at 745</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The parties cite one case from this circuit.  In Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span> (D.P.R.1994), the district court was faced with a claim that the jury's answers to special interrogatories regarding Title VII retaliation and sex discrimination claims were contradictory.  The employer, American Airlines, argued that the jury found that American would have made the same employment decisions even if Selgas' gender were not taken into account, and so American had an absolute defense under Price Waterhouse.   The district court found that supplemental questions put to the jury remedied any inconsistencies in the verdict, but noted in passing that the 1991 Act had overruled Price Waterhouse.  Id. at 318 n. 2. The district court cited  Robinson v. Southeastern Pa.  Transp. Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597435\"><a href=\"/opinion/597435/64-fair-emplpraccas-bna-250-60-empl-prac-dec-p-41983-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1993), as support for that proposition.  Examination of Robinson shows that the court there cited the 1991 Act only for the proposition that \"Title VII contemplates that a corporation may be liable for dismissing an employee when its motives contain a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate reasons.\"  Id. at 899 &amp; n. 8. As the underlying dispute in Robinson was tried prior to the 1991 Act's enactment, the court did not apply it to the dispute</p>\n        <p>A panel of this court affirmed in part and vacated in part the district court's decision.  See Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707599\"><a href=\"/opinion/707599/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-944-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43780-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995).  The panel found that American had no alternative just cause to fire Selgas.  Thus neither Price Waterhouse nor the 1991 Act was implicated.  Id. at 1210-11.   In outlining American's failed argument, the panel cited Griffiths v. CIGNA Corp. for the proposition that section 107(b)'s affirmative defense would apply to the retaliation claim.  Id. at 1210;  see Griffiths, 988 F.2d at 472.   However, the court in Griffiths neither applied section 107(b) to the plaintiff's retaliation claim nor engaged in any statutory interpretation of its applicability, as that case was brought prior to the application of the 1991 Act.  In the end, we find that, although there is some suggestion in Kerr-Selgas that the 1991 Act should apply to Tanca's claim, neither of the cases relied on for that proposition, nor Kerr-Selgas itself, supplies us with any reason to doubt the result reached here today.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> For example, in his Pre-Trial Memorandum, Tanca listed only two contested issues of fact:</p>\n        <p>A.
