  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n                             No. 98-1815\r\n\n  IN RE: ASOCIACION DE COMERCIANTES DEL VIEJO SAN JUAN,\r\n\n                        Appellant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n    [Hon. Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\nLynch, Circuit Judge,\r\nBownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Jesus Santiago Malavet and Santiago, Malavet &amp; Santiago on brief for appellant.\r\n Carlos M. Sanchez La Costa on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 19, 1999\r\n\n                                                Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record and\r\nthe briefs, we conclude that the bankruptcy court acted within\r\nits discretion in dismissing appellant's petition for failure\r\nto make timely filings.  See 11 U.S.C.  521(1) &amp; 1112(e).  \r\n          Even assuming, arguendo, that appellant did not\r\nreceive the order dated August 5, and even though appellant had\r\nrequested an extension, the dismissal still was not an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  Particularly in light of the Notice to Debtor of\r\nFiling a Petition in Bankruptcy dated July 30, 1997, appellant\r\ncould not claim ignorance of the statutory filing requirements\r\nand the potential consequences of default.  Appellant proceeded\r\nat its peril by disregarding those requirements,\r\nnotwithstanding the pending motion, which motion was not\r\nsupported by such good cause that appellant's lack of diligence\r\nnecessarily was excused by it or that the bankruptcy court\r\nnecessarily was bound to grant it. \r\n Appellant's \"motion to submit case on the pleadings\"\r\nis granted.\r\n Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
