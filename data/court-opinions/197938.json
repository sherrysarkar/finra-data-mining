Curran, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, and Richard W.\r\nRose, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nMay 8, 1998\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  This appeal features a dispute\r\nabout the extent to which scientific evidence must be adduced at\r\nsentencing before the court can impose the onerous penalties\r\nattached to trafficking in crack cocaine.  We pause first to set\r\nthe stage and address another, more mundane issue.  We then proceed\r\nto the sentencing question.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 6, 1997, Providence police officers obtained\r\na warrant authorizing them to search residential premises located\r\nat 151 Reynolds Avenue for cocaine, money, and other articles\r\nrelated to the sale or use of narcotics.  In securing the warrant,\r\nthe gendarmes relied on input from a confidential informant (CI-1),\r\nthought by them to be reliable, who not only provided information\r\nbut also made a controlled purchase of cocaine from the subject\r\npremises a few days before the warrant issued.  According to CI-1,\r\nthe person primarily responsible for the drug-distribution activity\r\nwas \"Louie,\" a dark-haired Hispanic male approximately five feet\r\neight inches tall and of medium build.\r\nUpon entering the premises, officers discovered cocaine\r\nin a pair of pants that were lying on the bed in which defendant-\r\nappellant Phillip F. Robinson was sleeping.  Drugs also were found\r\non the kitchen table and in an unoccupied bedroom.  The police\r\narrested the appellant and his mother, Carolyn Robinson, and a\r\nfederal grand jury later indicted both individuals for possessing\r\ncocaine base, intending to distribute it, and conspiring to commit\r\nthat offense.  See 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1),  846 (1994).\r\nAfter the initial arrest, the police sought another\r\nsearch warrant for 151 Reynolds Avenue.  They based the application\r\nfor this warrant on information from a second confidential\r\ninformant (CI-2), who vouchsafed that drug trafficking had\r\ncontinued at the premises notwithstanding the appellant's\r\ndetention.  The warrant issued, but the neoteric search proved a\r\nwaste of time.\r\nDuring pretrial proceedings, the appellant moved for\r\ndisclosure of the identities of both confidential informants.  The\r\ndistrict court denied the motion.  In the ensuing trial, the jury\r\nconvicted the appellant on both charges.\r\nAt the disposition hearing, the key issue centered around\r\nwhether the appellant's offenses involved crack cocaine as opposed\r\nto powdered cocaine.  The district court, relying principally upon\r\ntwo pieces of evidence   a pharmacologist's laboratory report\r\nattesting that the seized drugs had the chemical composition of\r\ncocaine base and the testimony of Detective Daniel Gannon, an\r\nexperienced narcotics investigator, that the contraband was indeed\r\ncrack   resolved this dispute in the government's favor and\r\nsentenced Robinson accordingly.  This appeal followed.  In it, the\r\nappellant challenges both the trial court's denial of his motion\r\nfor disclosure and its sentencing determinations.\r\nII.  THE DISCLOSURE MOTION\r\nWe review a district court's decision not to force the\r\nprosecution to divulge the identity of a confidential informant for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325,\r\n1335 (1st Cir. 1994).  In this context, the abuse of discretion\r\nstandard is quite deferential:  the district court's resolution of\r\na disclosure request should be upheld as long as it comports with\r\nsome reasonable rendition of the record.  See United States v.\r\nBender, 5 F.3d 267, 269 (7th Cir. 1993).\r\nThe Supreme Court first recognized a tattler's privilege\r\nthat is, a privilege to withhold the identity of an informant  \r\nin Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957).  The privilege is\r\ndesigned to protect the government's sources and to shield citizens\r\nwho contribute their knowledge to facilitate the prosecution of\r\ncriminal acts.  Still, the tattler's privilege is not absolute.  In\r\ndetermining whether justification for an exception exists, the nisi\r\nprius court must balance the interests undergirding the privilege\r\nagainst the accused's fundamental right to a fair trial, and, in\r\ndoing so, must take into account the full panoply of relevant\r\ncircumstances (including the nature of the crime charged, the\r\ncontours of the defenses asserted, the available means of proving\r\nthe charges and defenses, and the significance of the informant's\r\nrole).  See id. at 62; United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914,\r\n920-21 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 130\r\n(1st Cir. 1987).\r\nTo further the policies behind the Roviaro rationale, the\r\ntrial court's analysis begins with a presumption favoring\r\nconfidentiality.  Thus, the defendant must carry the devoir of\r\npersuasion to show that disclosure is necessary to mounting an\r\nadequate defense.  See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335; Giry, 818 F.2d at\r\n130.  This burden is heavy, but not intractable.  If, for example,\r\nthe informant is the sole participant, other than the accused, in\r\nthe transaction charged, or if the informant is the only person who\r\nis in a position to amplify or contradict crucial testimony of\r\ngovernment witnesses, then the court may order disclosure.  SeeRoviaro, 353 U.S. at 64; Martinez, 922 F.2d at 920-21; United\r\nStates v. Bibbey, 735 F.2d 619, 621 (1st Cir. 1984).  If, however,\r\nthe informant is merely a source   one who does little more than\r\nput a flea in an officer's ear   the court almost always will deny\r\ndisclosure.  See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335; United States v. Batista-\r\nPolanco, 927 F.2d 14, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nHere, the appellant alleges that the confidential\r\ninformants' identities would have been helpful in his defense.  He\r\nnotes that CI-1 identified a suspect named Louie as the person who\r\nwas selling large quantities of cocaine at 151 Reynolds Avenue;\r\nthat he obviously is not Louie (after all, the appellant is a six\r\nfoot tall Caucasian who weighs 300 pounds   a far cry from a five\r\nfoot eight inch Hispanic of medium build); that his most promising\r\ndefense involved pointing a finger at Louie; and that, through CI-\r\n1, he might have discovered Louie's identity, or, at least, focused\r\nthe jury's attention on a suspect other than himself.  The\r\nappellant adds that he also needed to know CI-2's identity because\r\nCI-2 could testify that another cocaine transaction took place at\r\n151 Reynolds Avenue after he (Robinson) was detained.  The\r\nappellant claims that this information would lend credence to the\r\nidea that Louie was the real culprit.\r\nThe appellant says that the facts of this case mandate\r\ndisclosure under our decision in Zaroogian v. United States, 367\r\nF.2d 959 (1st Cir. 1966).  We demur.  Assuming, without deciding,\r\nthat Zaroogian remains good law, the rule elucidated there applies\r\nonly when a defendant shows that an informant would make a valuable\r\nmaterial witness for the defense.  Id. at 962.  The appellant has\r\nnot made such a showing.\r\nHere, the informers' evidence, though desired by the\r\nappellant, was peripheral to the crimes charges.  In the last\r\nanalysis, the jury convicted Robinson based not on what CI-1 or CI-\r\n2 said or did, but on his culpable presence at a locus where\r\nsubstantial amounts of contraband were found.  Neither CI-1 nor\r\nCI-2 could be expected to shed much light on these circumstances. \r\nFurthermore, even if the elusive Louie existed and could be run to\r\nground, a showing that Louie was guilty would not exonerate the\r\nappellant.  Hence, learning Louie's identity would be only\r\nmarginally relevant, if relevant at all, to the charges confronting\r\nRobinson.\r\nWhere, as here, the government's informants neither\r\nparticipated in nor witnessed the events that inculpated the\r\ndefendant and led to his arrest, the informants ordinarily are\r\ndeemed mere tipsters.  See, e.g., Martinez, 922 F.2d at 921; Giry,\r\n818 F.2d at 130; United States v. Alonzo, 571 F.2d 1384, 1387 (5th\r\nCir. 1978).  There is nothing in the record that removes this case\r\nfrom the sweep of that generalization.  Moreover, we have held with\r\na regularity bordering on the echolalic that tipsters, as opposed\r\nto informants who are active participants in the crimes charged,\r\ngenerally deserve anonymity.  See, e.g., Martinez, 922 F.2d at 921;\r\nGiry, 818 F.2d at 130; United States v. Hemmer, 729 F.2d 10, 15\r\n(1st Cir. 1984).  Consequently, the lower court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in refusing to force the government to divulge the\r\ninformants' identities.\r\nIII.  SENTENCING\r\nThe appellant's sentencing challenge links various\r\nasseverations, all of which implicate the district court's\r\ndetermination that the offenses of conviction involved crack\r\ncocaine as opposed to powdered cocaine.  We treat these\r\nasseverations as a single forensic unit.\r\nThe federal sentencing guidelines penalize trafficking in\r\ncrack cocaine much more harshly than trafficking in cocaine\r\nhydrochloride (cocaine powder).  See United States v. Armstrong,\r\n116 S. Ct. 1480, 1492 (1996).  After an evidentiary hearing, the\r\ndistrict court computed the appellant's offense level on the basis\r\nthat all the contraband   35.33 grams (including an amount\r\nattributable to the conversion of the cash seized, see USSG \r\n2D1.1, comment. (n.12))   was crack cocaine.  This determination\r\nyielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 108 to 135 months,\r\nand the judge imposed a 121-month incarcerative sentence.\r\nIn this court, as below, the appellant challenges the\r\npremise on which his sentence rests.  He maintains that the\r\ngovernment proved nothing beyond the fact that the substance was\r\ncocaine base and that, therefore, his offense level should have\r\nbeen set on the basis of cocaine hydrochloride (which would have\r\nproduced a GSR of 18 to 24 months and led to a much gentler\r\nsentence).  This argument takes dead aim at the district court's\r\nadmission of detective Gannon's testimony to the effect that the\r\nhard, rock-like substance found on the premises was crack.  In the\r\nappellant's view, Gannon, who has no formal scientific training,\r\nwas unqualified to render such an opinion.\r\nWe start with the Sentencing Commission's handiwork. \r\nSince 1993, the Commission has acknowledged that, in common\r\nparlance, \"cocaine base\" means \"crack,\" and that this equivalency\r\nis cognizable for purposes of computing a defendant's GSR.  USSG\r\n2D1.1(c)(n.(D)).  The Commission further defines crack as \"the\r\nstreet name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by\r\nprocessing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and\r\nusually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.\"  Id.  Forms of\r\ncocaine base other than crack are treated as cocaine hydrochloride\r\nfor purposes of calculating the GSR.  See USSG App. C, Amend. 487;\r\nsee also United States v. Abdul, 122 F.3d 477, 479 (7th Cir.),\r\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 643 (1997).\r\nTo implement these directions, it is important to grasp\r\ncertain rudimentary facts.  Cocaine base (C17H21NO4) is a natural\r\nalkaloid found in the coca leaf.  It is a \"base\" because it reacts\r\nwith acids to produce a salt.  The naturally occurring compound is\r\nusually processed by dissolving a paste made from the coca leaf in\r\nhydrochloric acid (HCl) and water (H2O) to create a salt:  cocaine\r\nhydrochloride (C17H22ClNO4), also known as cocaine (in its powdered\r\nform).  The salt is water-soluble and may be snorted or dissolved\r\nin a liquid and injected, but it cannot be smoked.\r\nThere are several ways to convert this salt into a base. \r\nThe most common method is to dissolve the salt in baking soda\r\n(NaHCO3) and water (H2O) and boil the mixture until it solidifies\r\nand dries.  The resulting substance is chemically identical to a\r\nnaturally occurring cocaine base.  In appearance, however, the\r\nsubstance is hard and rock-like.  This artificially manufactured\r\nbase is known in the vernacular as \"crack\" or \"crack cocaine.\"  SeeAbdul, 122 F.3d at 478; United States v. Sloan, 97 F.3d 1378, 1382\r\n(11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 2459 (1997).  Although\r\ncrack is not water-soluble, it can be smoked.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the district court's admission of\r\ndetective Gannon's testimony is fully supportable.  The Federal\r\nRules of Evidence do not pertain during the sentencing phase of a\r\ncriminal trial.   See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d\r\n19, 25 (1st Cir. 1994).  Rather, the sentencing court may consider\r\nevidence that would be inadmissible at trial as long as that\r\nevidence possesses \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support\r\nits probable accuracy.\"  USSG 6A1.3(a).  Under this generous\r\nformulation, the court has wide latitude to decide what type of\r\nproof is, or is not, sufficiently trustworthy to enter into the\r\nsentencing calculus.  See United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22,\r\n27 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).\r\nIn this case, the district judge acted within her\r\ndiscretion in allowing Gannon's testimony.  Even in a trial\r\nsetting, we often have permitted law enforcement officers, not\r\nformally trained as \"experts,\" to furnish opinions based on their\r\nreal-world experience.  See, e.g., United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d\r\n210, 215 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that courts regularly allow\r\ntestimony from experienced narcotics agents anent matters such as\r\n\"dosages, prices, and other particulars endemic to the ingestion\r\nand distribution of crack cocaine\"); United States v. Rivera, 68\r\nF.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 970 (1996);\r\nUnited States v. Tejada, 886 F.2d 483, 486 (1st Cir. 1989).  This\r\nis merely a reflection that \"[e]xpertise is not necessarily\r\nsynonymous with a string of academic degrees or multiple\r\nmemberships in learned societies.\"   United States v. Hoffman, 832\r\nF.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir. 1987).  By like token, \"proof based upon\r\nscientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove\r\nthe illicit nature of a substance.\"  United States v. Valencia-\r\nLucena, 925 F.2d 506, 512 (1st Cir. 1991); accord United States v.\r\nWalters, 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Paiva,\r\n892 F.2d 148, 157 (1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d\r\n954, 960 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\nThese precedents are persuasive here.  The government\r\nlaid a proper foundation for Gannon's testimony by introducing a\r\nchemical analysis in the form of a pharmacologist's report proving\r\nthat, chemically, the contraband was cocaine base.  Chemical\r\nanalysis cannot distinguish crack from any other form of cocaine\r\nbase because crack and all other forms of cocaine base are\r\nidentical at the molecular level.  Thus, no further scientific\r\ntestimony would have been of any conceivable assistance, and we\r\nwill not require the government to indulge in an empty exercise.\r\nThis brings us to Gannon's testimony.  The sentencing\r\njudge did not specify whether she admitted this testimony as a lay\r\nopinion or as an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed\r\npractical as opposed to academic credentials, probably because the\r\ndistinction is immaterial for purposes of this case.  Either way,\r\nit is clear that the sentencing court has discretion to admit the\r\nopinion evidence of a reliable witness who possesses specialized\r\nknowledge (here, experience in dealing with crack and familiarity\r\nwith its appearance and texture).  See Paiva, 892 F.2d at 160;\r\nLadd, 885 F.2d at 959-60.\r\nSuch testimony is particularly helpful in a case like\r\nthis one.  Crack can be differentiated from other cocaine bases\r\nonly by appearance and texture, and the applicable guideline, which\r\nrefers to crack as \"the street name\" for a particular form of\r\ncocaine base, USSG 2D1.1(c)(n.(D)), strongly suggests that\r\nknowledge of what dealers and users consider to be crack may be a\r\nsatisfactory experiential base for opinion evidence.  Gannon, a\r\nveteran narcotics investigator who worked undercover for several\r\nyears as both a \"seller\" and a \"buyer\" in sting operations, had an\r\nintimate familiarity with the crack trade.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court did not err in permitting him to identify a\r\nparticular substance as crack cocaine.  See Hoffman, 832 F.2d at\r\n1310 (upholding admission of opinion testimony offered by \"veteran\r\nDEA agent\" and noting that \"[i]n a rough-and-ready field such as\r\n[hard-core drug trafficking], experience is likely the best\r\nteacher\").\r\nDespite this conclusion, our journey must continue.  The\r\nappellant also contends that the district court erred in finding\r\nthat the contraband was crack.  This contention need not occupy us\r\nfor long.\r\nWhether a particular substance is crack or cocaine for\r\npurposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question of fact to be\r\ndetermined by the court.  See Edwards v. United States ,     S. Ct.\r\n,     (1998) [1998 WL 201395, at *2].  When the nature of an\r\nillicit substance is material at sentencing, the government has the\r\nburden to prove the substance's identity, but its proof need only\r\nbe by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v.\r\nLegarda, 17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st Cir. 1994); Tardiff, 969 F.2d at\r\n1289.  The sentencing court's factfinding must be accepted unless\r\nit is clearly erroneous.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d\r\n698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 739\r\n(1st Cir. 1991).\r\nHere, Judge Lisi's factfinding is amply supported.  The\r\ngovernment introduced the pharmacologist's laboratory report to\r\nestablish the chemical composition of the substances seized from\r\nthe searched premises.  The report identified the substances as\r\ncocaine base.  Detective Gannon, drawing on his experience and\r\nremarking the appearance and hard, rock-like texture of the cocaine\r\nbase seized from 151 Reynolds Avenue, identified it as crack. \r\nFinally,  the appellant testified at the disposition hearing and,\r\nalthough he denied that he sold drugs from his abode, he admitted\r\nthat he intended to sell the packets of drugs seized from his pants\r\npocket, and that he bought and sold \"rock.\"  On the strength of\r\nthis proof, and in the utter absence of any controverting evidence,\r\nJudge Lisi's finding easily survives clear-error review.\r\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  For aught that appears, the\r\nappellant was fairly tried and appropriately sentenced.  We add\r\nonly one small coda:  although the guidelines punish offenders who\r\ntraffic in crack cocaine very severely, especially in relation to\r\nthose who traffic in powdered cocaine, that is a permissible policy\r\nchoice articulated by Congress and the Sentencing Commission. \r\nTherefore, the courts are obliged to give it effect.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Bender, 5 F.3d 267, 269 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court first recognized a tattler's privilege--that is, a privilege to withhold the identity of an informant--in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957).  The privilege is designed to protect the government's sources and to shield citizens who contribute their knowledge to facilitate the prosecution of criminal acts.  Still, the tattler's privilege is not absolute.  In determining whether justification for an exception exists, the nisi prius court must balance the interests undergirding the privilege against the accused's fundamental right to a fair trial, and, in doing so, must take into account the full panoply of relevant circumstances (including the nature of the crime charged, the contours of the defenses asserted, the available means of proving the charges and defenses, and the significance of the informant's role).  See id. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628-29;  United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 920-21 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 130 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To further the policies behind the Roviaro rationale, the trial court's analysis begins with a presumption favoring confidentiality.  Thus, the defendant must carry the devoir of persuasion to show that disclosure is necessary to mounting an adequate defense.  See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335;  Giry, 818 F.2d at 130.   This burden is heavy, but not intractable.  If, for example, the informant is the sole participant, other than the accused, in the transaction charged, or if the informant is the only person who is in a position to amplify or contradict crucial testimony of government witnesses, then the court may order disclosure.  See Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 64, 77 S.Ct. at 629-30;  Martinez, 922 F.2d at 920-21;  United States v. Bibbey, 735 F.2d 619, 621 (1st Cir.1984).  If, however, the informant is merely a source--one who does little more than put a flea in an officer's ear--the court almost always will deny disclosure.  See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335;  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 19-20 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant alleges that the confidential informants' identities would have been helpful in his defense.  He notes that CI-1 identified a suspect named Louie as the person who was selling large quantities of cocaine at 151 Reynolds Avenue;  that he obviously is not Louie (after all, the appellant is a six foot tall Caucasian who weighs 300 pounds--a far cry from a five foot eight inch Hispanic of medium build);  that his most promising defense involved pointing a finger at Louie;  and that, through CI-1, he might have discovered Louie's identity, or, at least, focused the jury's attention on a suspect other than himself.  The appellant adds that he also needed to know CI-2's identity because CI-2 could testify that another cocaine transaction took place at 151 Reynolds Avenue after he (Robinson) was detained.  The appellant claims that this information would lend credence to the idea that Louie was the real culprit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant says that the facts of this case mandate disclosure under our decision in Zaroogian v. United States, 367 F.2d 959 (1st Cir.1966).  We demur.  Assuming, without deciding, that Zaroogian remains good law, the rule elucidated there applies only when a defendant shows that an informant would make a valuable material witness for the defense.  Id. at 962.   The appellant has not made such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the informers' evidence, though desired by the appellant, was peripheral to the crimes charges.  In the last analysis, the jury convicted Robinson based not on what CI-1 or CI-2 said or did, but on his culpable presence at a locus where substantial amounts of contraband were found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Neither CI-1 nor CI-2 could be expected to shed much light on these circumstances.  Furthermore, even if the elusive Louie existed and could be run to ground, a showing that Louie was guilty would not exonerate the appellant.  Hence, learning Louie's identity would be only marginally relevant, if relevant at all, to the charges confronting Robinson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the government's informants neither participated in nor witnessed the events that inculpated the defendant and led to his arrest, the informants ordinarily are deemed mere tipsters.  See, e.g., Martinez, 922 F.2d at 921;  Giry, 818 F.2d at 130;  United States v. Alonzo, 571 F.2d 1384, 1387 (5th Cir.1978).  There is nothing in the record that removes this case from the sweep of that generalization.  Moreover, we have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that tipsters, as opposed to informants who are active participants in the crimes charged, generally deserve anonymity.  See, e.g., Martinez, 922 F.2d at 921;  Giry, 818 F.2d at 130;  United States v. Hemmer, 729 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir.1984).  Consequently, the lower court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to force the government to divulge the informants' identities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's sentencing challenge links various asseverations, all of which implicate the district court's determination that the offenses of conviction involved crack cocaine as opposed to powdered cocaine.  We treat these asseverations as a single forensic unit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal sentencing guidelines penalize trafficking in crack cocaine much more harshly than trafficking in cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine powder).  See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 476-78, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 1492, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996).  After an evidentiary hearing, the district court computed the appellant's offense level on the basis that all the contraband--35.33 grams (including an amount attributable to the conversion of the cash seized, see USSG &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.12))--was crack cocaine.  This determination yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 108 to 135 months, and the judge imposed a 121-month incarcerative sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, as below, the appellant challenges the premise on which his sentence rests.  He maintains that the government proved nothing beyond the fact that the substance was cocaine base and that, therefore, his offense level should have been set on the basis of cocaine hydrochloride (which would have produced a GSR of 18 to 24 months and led to a much gentler sentence).  This argument takes dead aim at the district court's admission of detective Gannon's testimony to the effect that the hard, rock-like substance found on the premises was crack.  In the appellant's view, Gannon, who has no formal scientific training, was unqualified to render such an opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the Sentencing Commission's handiwork.  Since 1993, the Commission has acknowledged that, in common parlance, \"cocaine base\" means \"crack,\" and that this equivalency is cognizable for purposes of computing a defendant's GSR. USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(n.  (D)).  The Commission further defines crack as \"the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.\"  Id. Forms of cocaine base other than crack are treated as cocaine hydrochloride for purposes of calculating the GSR. See USSG App.  C, Amend. 487;  see also United States v. Abdul, 122 F.3d 477, 479 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 643, 139 L.Ed.2d 621 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To implement these directions, it is important to grasp certain rudimentary facts.  Cocaine base (C17H21NO4) is a natural alkaloid found in the coca leaf.  It is a \"base\" because it reacts with acids to produce a salt.  The naturally occurring compound is usually processed by dissolving a paste made from the coca leaf in hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water (H2O) to create a salt:  cocaine hydrochloride (C17H22ClNO4), also known as cocaine (in its powdered form).  The salt is water-soluble and may be snorted or dissolved in a liquid and injected, but it cannot be smoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several ways to convert this salt into a base.  The most common method is to dissolve the salt in baking soda (NaHCO3) and water (H2O) and boil the mixture until it solidifies and dries.  The resulting substance is chemically identical to a naturally occurring cocaine base.  In appearance, however, the substance is hard and rock-like.  This artificially manufactured base is known in the vernacular as \"crack\" or \"crack cocaine.\"   See Abdul, 122 F.3d at 478;  United States v. Sloan, 97 F.3d 1378, 1382 (11th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2459, 138 L.Ed.2d 216 (1997).  Although crack is not water-soluble, it can be smoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the district court's admission of detective Gannon's testimony is fully supportable.  The Federal Rules of Evidence do not pertain during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.1994).  Rather, the sentencing court may consider evidence that would be inadmissible at trial as long as that evidence possesses \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"  USSG &#167; 6A1.3(a).  Under this generous formulation, the court has wide latitude to decide what type of proof is, or is not, sufficiently trustworthy to enter into the sentencing calculus.  See United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district judge acted within her discretion in allowing Gannon's testimony.  Even in a trial setting, we often have permitted law enforcement officers, not formally trained as \"experts,\" to furnish opinions based on their real-world experience.  See, e.g., United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 215 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that courts regularly allow testimony from experienced narcotics agents anent matters such as \"dosages, prices, and other particulars endemic to the ingestion and distribution of crack cocaine\");  United States v. Rivera, 68 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1139, 116 S.Ct. 970, 133 L.Ed.2d 891 (1996);  United States v. Tejada, 886 F.2d 483, 486 (1st Cir.1989).  This is merely a reflection that \"[e]xpertise is not necessarily synonymous with a string of academic degrees or multiple memberships in learned societies.\"  United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir.1987).  By like token, \"proof based upon scientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove the illicit nature of a substance.\"  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 925 F.2d 506, 512 (1st Cir.1991);  accord United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 157 (1st Cir.1989); United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 960 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These precedents are persuasive here.  The government laid a proper foundation for Gannon's testimony by introducing a chemical analysis in the form of a pharmacologist's report proving that, chemically, the contraband was cocaine base.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Chemical analysis cannot distinguish crack from any other form of cocaine base because crack and all other forms of cocaine base are identical at the molecular level.  Thus, no further scientific testimony would have been of any conceivable assistance, and we will not require the government to indulge in an empty exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Gannon's testimony.  The sentencing judge did not specify whether she admitted this testimony as a lay opinion or as an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed practical as opposed to academic credentials, probably because the distinction is immaterial for purposes of this case.  Either way, it is clear that the sentencing court has discretion to admit the opinion evidence of a reliable witness who possesses specialized knowledge (here, experience in dealing with crack and familiarity with its appearance and texture).  See Paiva, 892 F.2d at 160;  Ladd, 885 F.2d at 959-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such testimony is particularly helpful in a case like this one.  Crack can be differentiated from other cocaine bases only by appearance and texture, and the applicable guideline, which refers to crack as \"the street name\" for a particular form of cocaine base, USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(n.  (D)), strongly suggests that knowledge of what dealers and users consider to be crack may be a satisfactory experiential base for opinion evidence.  Gannon, a veteran narcotics investigator who worked undercover for several years as both a \"seller\" and a \"buyer\" in sting operations, had an intimate familiarity with the crack trade.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in permitting him to identify a particular substance as crack cocaine.  See Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1310 (upholding admission of opinion testimony offered by \"veteran DEA agent\" and noting that \"[i]n a rough-and-ready field such as [hard-core drug trafficking], experience is likely the best teacher\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this conclusion, our journey must continue.  The appellant also contends that the district court erred in finding that the contraband was crack.  This contention need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular substance is crack or cocaine for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question of fact to be determined by the court.  See Edwards v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 118 S.Ct. 1475, 1476-77, 140 L.Ed.2d 703 (1998).  When the nature of an illicit substance is material at sentencing, the government has the burden to prove the substance's identity, but its proof need only be by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st Cir.1994);  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1289.   The sentencing court's factfinding must be accepted unless it is clearly erroneous.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 739 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Judge Lisi's factfinding is amply supported.  The government introduced the pharmacologist's laboratory report to establish the chemical composition of the substances seized from the searched premises.  The report identified the substances as cocaine base.  Detective Gannon, drawing on his experience and remarking the appearance and hard, rock-like texture of the cocaine base seized from 151 Reynolds Avenue, identified it as crack.  Finally, the appellant testified at the disposition hearing and, although he denied that he sold drugs from his abode, he admitted that he intended to sell the packets of drugs seized from his pants pocket, and that he bought and sold \"rock.\"   On the strength of this proof, and in the utter absence of any controverting evidence, Judge Lisi's finding easily survives clear-error review.IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried and appropriately sentenced.  We add only one small coda:  although the guidelines punish offenders who traffic in crack cocaine very severely, especially in relation to those who traffic in powdered cocaine, that is a permissible policy choice articulated by Congress and the Sentencing Commission.  Therefore, the courts are obliged to give it effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury similarly convicted Carolyn Robinson, but only Phillip Robinson's appeal is before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Carolyn Robinson owned the Reynolds Avenue house and, in January 1997, resided there with her three sons (Phillip included) and a transient guest.

The jury easily could have inferred that the pants belonged to the appellant:  he, himself, was sleeping in the room, and his wallet, containing a driver's license in his name and a beeper registered to him, were found in the pants.  In yet another bedroom, the police found two small bags of cocaine and a second driver's license in the appellant's name</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In a passing reference in his brief, the appellant also impugns the district court's conversion of $1,800 found in Carolyn Robinson's bedroom into its drug equivalent and the court's inclusion in the drug quantity calculation of amounts of cocaine not found in the appellant's bedroom.  These arguments are wholly undeveloped and we deem them waived.  See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v.

We pause first to set the stage and address another, more mundane issue.  We then proceed to the sentencing question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 1997, Providence police officers obtained a warrant authorizing them to search residential premises located at 151 Reynolds Avenue for cocaine, money, and other articles related to the sale or use of narcotics.  In securing the warrant, the gendarmes relied on input from a confidential informant (CI-1), thought by them to be reliable, who not only provided information but also made a controlled purchase of cocaine from the subject premises a few days before the warrant issued.  According to CI-1, the person primarily responsible for the drug-distribution activity was \"Louie,\" a dark-haired Hispanic male approximately five feet eight inches tall and of medium build.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon entering the premises, officers discovered cocaine in a pair of pants that were lying on the bed in which defendant-appellant Phillip F. Robinson was sleeping.  Drugs also were found on the kitchen table and in an unoccupied bedroom.  The police arrested the appellant and his mother, Carolyn Robinson, and a federal grand jury later indicted both individuals for possessing cocaine base, intending to distribute it, and conspiring to commit that offense.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the initial arrest, the police sought another search warrant for 151 Reynolds Avenue.  They based the application for this warrant on information from a second confidential informant (CI-2), who vouchsafed that drug trafficking had continued at the premises notwithstanding the appellant's detention.  The warrant issued, but the neoteric search proved a waste of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During pretrial proceedings, the appellant moved for disclosure of the identities of both confidential informants.  The district court denied the motion.  In the ensuing trial, the jury convicted the appellant on both charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the key issue centered around whether the appellant's offenses involved crack cocaine as opposed to powdered cocaine.  The district court, relying principally upon two pieces of evidence--a pharmacologist's laboratory report attesting that the seized drugs had the chemical composition of cocaine base and the testimony of Detective Daniel Gannon, an experienced narcotics investigator, that the contraband was indeed crack--resolved this dispute in the government's favor and sentenced Robinson accordingly.  This appeal followed.  In it, the appellant challenges both the trial court's denial of his motion for disclosure and its sentencing determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE DISCLOSURE MOTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's decision not to force the prosecution to divulge the identity of a confidential informant for abuse of discretion.

The privilege is designed to protect the government's sources and to shield citizens who contribute their knowledge to facilitate the prosecution of criminal acts.  Still, the tattler's privilege is not absolute.  In determining whether justification for an exception exists, the nisi prius court must balance the interests undergirding the privilege against the accused's fundamental right to a fair trial, and, in doing so, must take into account the full panoply of relevant circumstances (including the nature of the crime charged, the contours of the defenses asserted, the available means of proving the charges and defenses, and the significance of the informant's role).  See id. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628-29;  United States v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553838\"><a href=\"/opinion/553838/united-states-v-victor-martinez-united-states-of-america-v-hector-vidal/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 920-21 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v.

Thus, the defendant must carry the devoir of persuasion to show that disclosure is necessary to mounting an adequate defense.  See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335;  Giry, 818 F.2d at 130.   This burden is heavy, but not intractable.  If, for example, the informant is the sole participant, other than the accused, in the transaction charged, or if the informant is the only person who is in a position to amplify or contradict crucial testimony of government witnesses, then the court may order disclosure.  See Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 64, 77 S.Ct. at 629-30;  Martinez, 922 F.2d at 920-21;  United States v. Bibbey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"436218\"><a href=\"/opinion/436218/united-states-v-george-w-bibbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 621 (1st Cir.1984).  If, however, the informant is merely a source--one who does little more than put a flea in an officer's ear--the court almost always will deny disclosure.  See Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1335;  United States v. Batista-Polanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellant alleges that the confidential informants' identities would have been helpful in his defense.  He notes that CI-1 identified a suspect named Louie as the person who was selling large quantities of cocaine at 151 Reynolds Avenue;  that he obviously is not Louie (after all, the appellant is a six foot tall Caucasian who weighs 300 pounds--a far cry from a five foot eight inch Hispanic of medium build);  that his most promising defense involved pointing a finger at Louie;  and that, through CI-1, he might have discovered Louie's identity, or, at least, focused the jury's attention on a suspect other than himself.  The appellant adds that he also needed to know CI-2's identity because CI-2 could testify that another cocaine transaction took place at 151 Reynolds Avenue after he (Robinson) was detained.  The appellant claims that this information would lend credence to the idea that Louie was the real culprit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant says that the facts of this case mandate disclosure under our decision in Zaroogian v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273490\"><a href=\"/opinion/273490/harry-zaroogian-alias-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1966).  We demur.  Assuming, without deciding, that Zaroogian remains good law, the rule elucidated there applies only when a defendant shows that an informant would make a valuable material witness for the defense.  Id. at 962.   The appellant has not made such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the informers' evidence, though desired by the appellant, was peripheral to the crimes charges.  In the last analysis, the jury convicted Robinson based not on what CI-1 or CI-2 said or did, but on his culpable presence at a locus where substantial amounts of contraband were found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Neither CI-1 nor CI-2 could be expected to shed much light on these circumstances.  Furthermore, even if the elusive Louie existed and could be run to ground, a showing that Louie was guilty would not exonerate the appellant.  Hence, learning Louie's identity would be only marginally relevant, if relevant at all, to the charges confronting Robinson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the government's informants neither participated in nor witnessed the events that inculpated the defendant and led to his arrest, the informants ordinarily are deemed mere tipsters.  See, e.g., Martinez, 922 F.2d at 921;  Giry, 818 F.2d at 130;  United States v. Alonzo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353896\"><a href=\"/opinion/353896/united-states-v-herman-c-alonzo-aka-roland-alonzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1384</span></a></span>, 1387 (5th Cir.1978).  There is nothing in the record that removes this case from the sweep of that generalization.  Moreover, we have held with a regularity bordering on the echolalic that tipsters, as opposed to informants who are active participants in the crimes charged, generally deserve anonymity.  See, e.g., Martinez, 922 F.2d at 921;  Giry, 818 F.2d at 130;  United States v. Hemmer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"431992\"><a href=\"/opinion/431992/united-states-v-james-hemmer-united-states-of-america-v-john-cusick/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1984).  Consequently, the lower court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to force the government to divulge the informants' identities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's sentencing challenge links various asseverations, all of which implicate the district court's determination that the offenses of conviction involved crack cocaine as opposed to powdered cocaine.  We treat these asseverations as a single forensic unit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal sentencing guidelines penalize trafficking in crack cocaine much more harshly than trafficking in cocaine hydrochloride (cocaine powder).  See United States v. Armstrong, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 476-78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span>, 1492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span> (1996).  After an evidentiary hearing, the district court computed the appellant's offense level on the basis that all the contraband--35.33 grams (including an amount attributable to the conversion of the cash seized, see USSG &#167; 2D1.1, comment.  (n.12))--was crack cocaine.  This determination yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 108 to 135 months, and the judge imposed a 121-month incarcerative sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, as below, the appellant challenges the premise on which his sentence rests.  He maintains that the government proved nothing beyond the fact that the substance was cocaine base and that, therefore, his offense level should have been set on the basis of cocaine hydrochloride (which would have produced a GSR of 18 to 24 months and led to a much gentler sentence).  This argument takes dead aim at the district court's admission of detective Gannon's testimony to the effect that the hard, rock-like substance found on the premises was crack.  In the appellant's view, Gannon, who has no formal scientific training, was unqualified to render such an opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the Sentencing Commission's handiwork.  Since 1993, the Commission has acknowledged that, in common parlance, \"cocaine base\" means \"crack,\" and that this equivalency is cognizable for purposes of computing a defendant's GSR. USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(n.  (D)).  The Commission further defines crack as \"the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.\"  Id. Forms of cocaine base other than crack are treated as cocaine hydrochloride for purposes of calculating the GSR. See USSG App.  C, Amend. 487;  see also United States v. Abdul, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744805\"><a href=\"/opinion/744805/united-states-v-muhammed-abdul/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span>, 479 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Cocaine base (C17H21NO4) is a natural alkaloid found in the coca leaf.  It is a \"base\" because it reacts with acids to produce a salt.  The naturally occurring compound is usually processed by dissolving a paste made from the coca leaf in hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water (H2O) to create a salt:  cocaine hydrochloride (C17H22ClNO4), also known as cocaine (in its powdered form).  The salt is water-soluble and may be snorted or dissolved in a liquid and injected, but it cannot be smoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several ways to convert this salt into a base.  The most common method is to dissolve the salt in baking soda (NaHCO3) and water (H2O) and boil the mixture until it solidifies and dries.  The resulting substance is chemically identical to a naturally occurring cocaine base.  In appearance, however, the substance is hard and rock-like.  This artificially manufactured base is known in the vernacular as \"crack\" or \"crack cocaine.\"   See Abdul, 122 F.3d at 478;  United States v. Sloan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727399\"><a href=\"/opinion/727399/united-states-v-roy-sloan-united-states-of-america-v-hein-van-phung/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></a></span>, 1382 (11th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although crack is not water-soluble, it can be smoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the district court's admission of detective Gannon's testimony is fully supportable.  The Federal Rules of Evidence do not pertain during the sentencing phase of a criminal trial.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195584\"><a href=\"/opinion/195584/united-states-v-gonzalez-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1994).  Rather, the sentencing court may consider evidence that would be inadmissible at trial as long as that evidence possesses \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"  USSG &#167; 6A1.3(a).  Under this generous formulation, the court has wide latitude to decide what type of proof is, or is not, sufficiently trustworthy to enter into the sentencing calculus.  See United States v. Brewster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v.

The government laid a proper foundation for Gannon's testimony by introducing a chemical analysis in the form of a pharmacologist's report proving that, chemically, the contraband was cocaine base.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Chemical analysis cannot distinguish crack from any other form of cocaine base because crack and all other forms of cocaine base are identical at the molecular level.  Thus, no further scientific testimony would have been of any conceivable assistance, and we will not require the government to indulge in an empty exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Gannon's testimony.  The sentencing judge did not specify whether she admitted this testimony as a lay opinion or as an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed practical as opposed to academic credentials, probably because the distinction is immaterial for purposes of this case.  Either way, it is clear that the sentencing court has discretion to admit the opinion evidence of a reliable witness who possesses specialized knowledge (here, experience in dealing with crack and familiarity with its appearance and texture).  See Paiva, 892 F.2d at 160;  Ladd, 885 F.2d at 959-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such testimony is particularly helpful in a case like this one.  Crack can be differentiated from other cocaine bases only by appearance and texture, and the applicable guideline, which refers to crack as \"the street name\" for a particular form of cocaine base, USSG &#167; 2D1.1(c)(n.  (D)), strongly suggests that knowledge of what dealers and users consider to be crack may be a satisfactory experiential base for opinion evidence.  Gannon, a veteran narcotics investigator who worked undercover for several years as both a \"seller\" and a \"buyer\" in sting operations, had an intimate familiarity with the crack trade.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in permitting him to identify a particular substance as crack cocaine.  See Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1310 (upholding admission of opinion testimony offered by \"veteran DEA agent\" and noting that \"[i]n a rough-and-ready field such as [hard-core drug trafficking], experience is likely the best teacher\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this conclusion, our journey must continue.  The appellant also contends that the district court erred in finding that the contraband was crack.  This contention need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular substance is crack or cocaine for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question of fact to be determined by the court.  See Edwards v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118200\"><a href=\"/opinion/118200/edwards-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span> (1998).  When the nature of an illicit substance is material at sentencing, the government has the burden to prove the substance's identity, but its proof need only be by a preponderance of the evidence.  See United States v. Legarda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195229\"><a href=\"/opinion/195229/united-states-v-legarda/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.1994);  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1289.   The sentencing court's factfinding must be accepted unless it is clearly erroneous.  See United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.

The government introduced the pharmacologist's laboratory report to establish the chemical composition of the substances seized from the searched premises.  The report identified the substances as cocaine base.  Detective Gannon, drawing on his experience and remarking the appearance and hard, rock-like texture of the cocaine base seized from 151 Reynolds Avenue, identified it as crack.  Finally, the appellant testified at the disposition hearing and, although he denied that he sold drugs from his abode, he admitted that he intended to sell the packets of drugs seized from his pants pocket, and that he bought and sold \"rock.\"   On the strength of this proof, and in the utter absence of any controverting evidence, Judge Lisi's finding easily survives clear-error review.IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  For aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried and appropriately sentenced.  We add only one small coda:  although the guidelines punish offenders who traffic in crack cocaine very severely, especially in relation to those who traffic in powdered cocaine, that is a permissible policy choice articulated by Congress and the Sentencing Commission.  Therefore, the courts are obliged to give it effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury similarly convicted Carolyn Robinson, but only Phillip Robinson's appeal is before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Carolyn Robinson owned the Reynolds Avenue house and, in January 1997, resided there with her three sons (Phillip included) and a transient guest.  In the course of the January 6 search, the police found 14 \"baggies\" of cocaine on the kitchen table;  a handgun, ammunition, digital measuring scales, and $1,800 in cash in Carolyn Robinson's bedroom;  and 21 \"baggies\" of cocaine in a pair of pants in the appellant's bedroom.  The jury easily could have inferred that the pants belonged to the appellant:  he, himself, was sleeping in the room, and his wallet, containing a driver's license in his name and a beeper registered to him, were found in the pants.  In yet another bedroom, the police found two small bags of cocaine and a second driver's license in the appellant's name</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In a passing reference in his brief, the appellant also impugns the district court's conversion of $1,800 found in Carolyn Robinson's bedroom into its drug equivalent and the court's inclusion in the drug quantity calculation of amounts of cocaine not found in the appellant's bedroom.  These arguments are wholly undeveloped and we deem them waived.  See United States v.
