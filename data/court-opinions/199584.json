BERMAN,\n\n                    Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n                    Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n               Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bruce A. Singal with whom Donoghue, Barrett & Singal, P.C.\nwas on brief for appellant.\n     Kenneth W. Rosenberg, Tax Division, Department of Justice,\nwith whom Claire Fallon, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and David English\nCarmack, Tax Division, Department of Justice, were on brief for\nthe United States.\n\fSeptember 5, 2001\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.          John Berman appeals from the\n\ndistrict    court's   order    dismissing       his   motion   to     quash    an\n\nadministrative summons served by the Internal Revenue Service;\n\nthe dismissal was based on the ground that the motion was not\n\ntimely filed.    The pertinent facts are undisputed.\n\n            From 1991 until 1999, Berman was a partner in the\n\nBoston law firm of Davis, Malm & D'Agostine (\"the Davis firm\").\n\nHe is the subject of an ongoing income tax investigation by the\n\nIRS for the tax years 1993 through 1998.              On May 1, 2000, the\n\nIRS issued a summons to the keeper of records at the Davis firm,\n\nrequiring the production of various documents pertaining to\n\nBerman.      Included    in   the   summons     was   a   request     for     all\n\ncorrespondence    between     Berman      and   the   Davis    firm    or     its\n\nemployees between January 1, 1998, and April 28, 2000.\n\n            The summons was a \"third-party recordkeeper\" summons\n\ngoverned by section 7609 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         26\n\nU.S.C. ยง 7609 (1994 & Supp. 1998).              Third-party recordkeepers\n\nare defined as certain institutions and individuals--including\n\nattorneys and law firms--that customarily maintain financial or\n\nbusiness records.       Id. ยง 7603(b)(2) (Supp. 1998).          By statute,\n\nthe IRS must provide notice of the summons not just to the\n\nrecordkeeper but also to the individual to whom the summons\n\npertains.     Id. ยง 7609(a)(1) (Supp. 1998).              The notice must\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcontain    a   copy   of   the   summons   and    an   explanation    of    the\n\nnoticee's right to initiate a proceeding to quash it.                 Id.\n\n            The IRS mailed a notice of summons to Berman's counsel\n\nby certified mail dated May 2, 2000; Berman had previously\n\ndesignated his counsel as the person to receive such notices.\n\nThe certified mail receipt returned to the IRS indicates that\n\nBerman's    counsel    received    the   notice   the   next   day,   May    3.\n\nSection 7609(a)(2) provides inter alia that the notice \"shall be\n\nsufficient if . . . mailed to\" the person or his designated\n\nrepresentative.       Section 7609(b)(2)(A) further            provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                   Notwithstanding any other law or rule\n            of law, any person who is entitled to notice\n            of a summons under subsection (a) shall have\n            the right to begin a proceeding to quash\n            such summons not later than the 20th day\n            after the day such notice is given in the\n            manner provided in subsection (a)(2).\n\n            Twenty-two days after the summons was mailed by the\n\nIRS--on May 24, 2000--Berman filed a petition to quash the\n\nsummons, alleging that a particular letter responsive to the\n\nsummons was privileged under the attorney-client, work product,\n\nand joint defense privileges.            The district court eventually\n\ndismissed the petition to quash on the ground that it had not\n\nbeen filed within the statutory 20-day period.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             On appeal, Berman claims that his filing was timely\n\nbecause, under a civil procedure rule, he had three extra days\n\nto respond to a mailed notice.          Alternatively, he says that the\n\nIRS is barred by equitable estoppel from invoking the 20-day\n\ndeadline because an IRS agent said that the petition was timely\n\nif   filed   by   May   24.   Lastly,       Berman   says   that   there    are\n\nalternative bases of jurisdiction independent of the statutory\n\npetition to quash.       These arguments turn on issues of law that\n\nwe resolve de novo.\n\n             Perhaps (we need not decide the point) an ordinary\n\nreader of section 7609 might at first be uncertain whether, in\n\nthe case of mailed notices, the 20-day period runs from the date\n\nof mailing or the date of receipt.            Section 7609(b)(2)(A) says\n\nthat the proceeding to quash must be initiated \"not later than\n\nthe 20th day after notice is given in the manner provided in\n\n[section     7609](a)(2),\"    which    in    turn    says   that   notice    is\n\n\"sufficient\" if \"mailed.\"\n\n             However, the statutory provisions, taken together and\n\nread carefully, literally say that the 20 days run from the date\n\nthat notice is \"mailed.\"       Even brief research would reveal that\n\nthe case law requires a motion to quash under section 7609 to be\n\nfiled within 20 days of the mailing of the notice, not of its\n\nreceipt.     Faber v. United States, 921 F.2d 1118, 1119 (10th Cir.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f1990); Stringer v. United States, 776 F.2d 274, 275 (11th Cir.\n\n1985).   A Treasury Department regulation confirms this reading.\n\n26 C.F.R. ยง 301.7609-3(2) (2001) (proceeding to quash must be\n\ncommenced \"not later than the 20th day following the day the\n\nnotice of the summons was . . . mailed\").\n\n          In all events, Berman does not seriously dispute that\n\nsection 7609 requires that the petition to quash be filed within\n\n20 days of the date the notice was mailed.          (Here, as it\n\nhappens, using the date of receipt would not help Berman.)\n\nInstead, Berman argues that he is entitled to the benefits of\n\nRule 6(e), which provides that \"[w]henever a party has the right\n\nor is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a\n\nprescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper\n\nupon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party\n\nby mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.\"    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 6(e).   If Rule 6(e) applied, Berman's   petition would\n\nbe timely.\n\n             By its terms, Rule 6(e) is centrally concerned with\n\nwhat a \"party\" does and a \"party\" operates within the framework\n\nof an existing case.    By contrast, statutes of limitation such\n\nas section 7609 govern the time for commencing an action.      The\n\nprevailing view in the case law is that Rule 6(e) does not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto statutes of limitation,1 and at least two cases have held\n\nexplicitly that Rule 6(e) does not extend the 20-day period\n\nprescribed by section 7609.        Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d\n\n876, 880 (6th Cir. 1999); Brohman v. Mason, 587 F. Supp. 62, 63\n\n(W.D.N.Y. 1984).    But see Turner v. United States, 881 F. Supp.\n\n449, 451 (D. Haw. 1995) (dicta).         We adopt the majority view, so\n\nit   is   unnecessary    to   resolve    several    other,          perhaps   less\n\nimpressive,    arguments      pressed    by   the       IRS    to    defeat   the\n\napplication of Rule 6(e).2\n\n            Berman's second argument is that, even if Rule 6(e)\n\ndoes not apply, the IRS is equitably estopped from asserting the\n\n20-day    statute   of   limitations     because        one    of    its   agents\n\nrepresented    to   Berman's     counsel      in    a    May    24     telephone\n\nconversation that she believed that the deadline for filing the\n\npetition was that day, May 24, when in fact the 20th day was two\n\n\n\n      1\n     E.g., Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d 876, 880 (6th Cir.\n1999); United States v. Easement and Right-of-Way, 386 F.2d 769,\n771 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied sub nom. Skaggs v. United\nStates, 390 U.S. 947 (1968); Whipp v. Weinberger, 505 F.2d 800,\n801 (6th Cir. 1974) .\n      2\n     The IRS relies both on the \"[n]otwithstanding\" proviso that\nintroduces section 7609(b)(2)(A) and on the claim that the 20-\nday limit is \"jurisdictional\" and cannot be extended by a civil\nprocedure rule, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 82. The proviso is less than\ncrystal clear, and if Rule 6(e) did apply to statutes of\nlimitation, it arguably would be possible to treat it as\nincorporated into section 7609 by implication.     Cf. Irwin v.\nDep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fdays earlier, May 22.         Whether equitable estoppel can be invoked\n\nagainst the government in a case such as this is not settled.\n\nThe prexisting general rule-- that equitable estoppel, tolling,\n\nand waiver do not apply against the government in the context of\n\na statutory deadline--was altered in               Irwin v.      Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), so that the presumption is\n\nnow   the    opposite    at   least   so    far   as   equitable   tolling   is\n\nconcerned.\n\n             Yet in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347 (1997),\n\nthe Supreme Court limited Irwin's application in a particular\n\ntax context.       See also Oropallo v. United States, 994 F.2d 25,\n\n28-31 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1050 (1994).                   For\n\npolicy as well as textual reasons the Court concluded that\n\nequitable tolling did not apply to the statute of limitations\n\nfor filing tax refund claims under 26 U.S.C. ยง 6511, Brockamp,\n\n519 U.S. at 354, a ruling in turn modified by Congress in 1998,\n\nbut only in part, 26 U.S.C. ยง 6511(h) (Supp. 1998).                   Just how\n\nfar Brockamp extends is debatable.                Compare Capital Tracing,\n\nInc., v. United States, 63 F.3d 859, 861-63 (9th Cir. 1995),\n\nwith Compagnoni v. United States, 79 A.F.T.R.2d 97-2930, 97-\n\n2932-33 (S.D. Fla. 1997), aff'd, 173 F.3d 1369 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\nBut   we    need   not   decide   whether    Irwin     extends   to   equitable\n\nestoppel or whether Brockamp extends to section 7609 because in\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fany event equitable estoppel could not be made out on these\n\nfacts.\n\n            Among    the    requirements            for    equitable      estoppel   is\n\njustified    reliance      on    the    government's         false    or   misleading\n\nstatement or conduct.            E.g., Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 1998).                               Here, the\n\nagent's statement or behavior, whatever its precise character,\n\noccurred after the 20-day period had already expired.                                The\n\nquestion    of    justification        is     beside       the   point;    obviously,\n\nBerman's    counsel   did       not    rely    on    the    agent's    statement     in\n\nfailing to meet the deadline because the deadline had passed\n\nbefore the statement was made.\n\n            The IRS brief also seeks to refute, on a precautionary\n\nbasis, a possible claim by Berman based on equitable tolling.\n\nThis is a somewhat different doctrine; it is based not just on\n\nmisconduct by the adverse party but also on broader equitable\n\nconcerns that might justify a late filing.                       Irwin, 498 U.S. at\n\n96; Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 861 F.2d 746, 752 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).      However, Berman's brief contains no developed claim\n\nof equitable tolling, so the argument is forfeit.                      United States\n\nv. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).                         Even if it\n\nwere preserved, and Brockamp were put to one side, the facts\n\nsuggest \"at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect\"\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fand not a sufficient basis for equitable tolling.                            Irwin, 498\n\nU.S. at 96; Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n             Berman's final set of arguments is that his petition\n\nto quash may be brought under jurisdictional statutes other than\n\nsection 7609(b)(2)(A)--specifically, 5 U.S.C. ยง 702 (1994); 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1331 (1994); 28 U.S.C. ยง 1340 (1994); 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1346(a)(2) (1994); and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1357 (1994).                         None of these\n\nstatutes assists Berman.             General jurisdictional statutes such\n\nas 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1340 do not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity and therefore cannot be the basis for jurisdiction over\n\na civil action against the federal government.                              Lonsdale v.\n\nUnited      States,   919     F.2d     1440,    1444     (10th      Cir.    1990);    cf.\n\nCoggeshall Dev. Corp. v. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n             Although the APA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 702, and the Little Tucker\n\nAct,   28    U.S.C.     ยง   1346(a)(2),        do    create       limited   waivers    of\n\nsovereign immunity, neither statute is applicable to Berman's\n\nclaim.      The Little Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity for non-\n\ntort claims against the United States \"founded either upon the\n\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an\n\nexecutive department, or upon any express or implied contract\n\nwith   the     United       States.\"      28        U.S.C.    ยง    1346(a)(2).        The\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fjurisdiction of the district courts is limited to claims for\n\nmoney damages \"not exceeding $10,000 in amount.\"                   Id.    The\n\nLittle Tucker Act does not authorize claims that seek primarily\n\nequitable relief.       Richardson v.        Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465\n\n(1973);     Bobula v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 970 F.2d 854, 858-59\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1992).\n\n            Claims for non-monetary relief can be raised under\n\nsection 702 of the APA, but this section too is inapplicable to\n\nBerman's    petition.      Section     702     waives   the   government's\n\nsovereign immunity from claims for non-monetary relief from\n\nadministrative agency action.           But section 702 specifically\n\nlimits the government's waiver of sovereign immunity by denying\n\nthe courts any \"authority to grant relief if any other statute\n\nthat grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the\n\nrelief which is sought.\"       5 U.S.C. ยง 702.     Section 7609(b)(2)(A)\n\nis such an \"other statute,\" and it \"expressly forbids\" any\n\nrelief if the petition is not timely filed.             See Block v. North\n\nDakota, 461 U.S. 273, 286 n.22 (1983).\n\n            The remaining statute invoked by Berman, 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1357, gives the district courts original jurisdiction over any\n\nclaim for money damages brought by an individual to recover for\n\nany injury to his person or property on account of any act done\n\nby   him   while   enforcing   any   federal    statute   either    for   the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcollection or protection of the revenues or to enforce the right\n\nto vote.     This provision is plainly inapplicable to Berman's\n\npetition.\n\n            The order of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f          United States Court of Appeals\n                    For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 01-1266\n\n                       JOHN R.

John Berman appeals from the\n\ndistrict    court's   order    dismissing       his   motion   to     quash    an\n\nadministrative summons served by the Internal Revenue Service;\n\nthe dismissal was based on the ground that the motion was not\n\ntimely filed.    The pertinent facts are undisputed.\n\n            From 1991 until 1999, Berman was a partner in the\n\nBoston law firm of Davis, Malm & D'Agostine (\"the Davis firm\").\n\nHe is the subject of an ongoing income tax investigation by the\n\nIRS for the tax years 1993 through 1998.              On May 1, 2000, the\n\nIRS issued a summons to the keeper of records at the Davis firm,\n\nrequiring the production of various documents pertaining to\n\nBerman.      Included    in   the   summons     was   a   request     for     all\n\ncorrespondence    between     Berman      and   the   Davis    firm    or     its\n\nemployees between January 1, 1998, and April 28, 2000.\n\n            The summons was a \"third-party recordkeeper\" summons\n\ngoverned by section 7609 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         26\n\nU.S.C. ยง 7609 (1994 & Supp. 1998).              Third-party recordkeepers\n\nare defined as certain institutions and individuals--including\n\nattorneys and law firms--that customarily maintain financial or\n\nbusiness records.       Id. ยง 7603(b)(2) (Supp. 1998).          By statute,\n\nthe IRS must provide notice of the summons not just to the\n\nrecordkeeper but also to the individual to whom the summons\n\npertains.     Id. ยง 7609(a)(1) (Supp. 1998).              The notice must\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcontain    a   copy   of   the   summons   and    an   explanation    of    the\n\nnoticee's right to initiate a proceeding to quash it.                 Id.\n\n            The IRS mailed a notice of summons to Berman's counsel\n\nby certified mail dated May 2, 2000; Berman had previously\n\ndesignated his counsel as the person to receive such notices.\n\nThe certified mail receipt returned to the IRS indicates that\n\nBerman's    counsel    received    the   notice   the   next   day,   May    3.\n\nSection 7609(a)(2) provides inter alia that the notice \"shall be\n\nsufficient if . . . mailed to\" the person or his designated\n\nrepresentative.       Section 7609(b)(2)(A) further            provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                   Notwithstanding any other law or rule\n            of law, any person who is entitled to notice\n            of a summons under subsection (a) shall have\n            the right to begin a proceeding to quash\n            such summons not later than the 20th day\n            after the day such notice is given in the\n            manner provided in subsection (a)(2).\n\n            Twenty-two days after the summons was mailed by the\n\nIRS--on May 24, 2000--Berman filed a petition to quash the\n\nsummons, alleging that a particular letter responsive to the\n\nsummons was privileged under the attorney-client, work product,\n\nand joint defense privileges.            The district court eventually\n\ndismissed the petition to quash on the ground that it had not\n\nbeen filed within the statutory 20-day period.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             On appeal, Berman claims that his filing was timely\n\nbecause, under a civil procedure rule, he had three extra days\n\nto respond to a mailed notice.          Alternatively, he says that the\n\nIRS is barred by equitable estoppel from invoking the 20-day\n\ndeadline because an IRS agent said that the petition was timely\n\nif   filed   by   May   24.   Lastly,       Berman   says   that   there    are\n\nalternative bases of jurisdiction independent of the statutory\n\npetition to quash.       These arguments turn on issues of law that\n\nwe resolve de novo.\n\n             Perhaps (we need not decide the point) an ordinary\n\nreader of section 7609 might at first be uncertain whether, in\n\nthe case of mailed notices, the 20-day period runs from the date\n\nof mailing or the date of receipt.            Section 7609(b)(2)(A) says\n\nthat the proceeding to quash must be initiated \"not later than\n\nthe 20th day after notice is given in the manner provided in\n\n[section     7609](a)(2),\"    which    in    turn    says   that   notice    is\n\n\"sufficient\" if \"mailed.\"\n\n             However, the statutory provisions, taken together and\n\nread carefully, literally say that the 20 days run from the date\n\nthat notice is \"mailed.\"       Even brief research would reveal that\n\nthe case law requires a motion to quash under section 7609 to be\n\nfiled within 20 days of the mailing of the notice, not of its\n\nreceipt.     Faber v. United States, 921 F.2d 1118, 1119 (10th Cir.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f1990); Stringer v. United States, 776 F.2d 274, 275 (11th Cir.\n\n1985).   A Treasury Department regulation confirms this reading.\n\n26 C.F.R. ยง 301.7609-3(2) (2001) (proceeding to quash must be\n\ncommenced \"not later than the 20th day following the day the\n\nnotice of the summons was . . . mailed\").\n\n          In all events, Berman does not seriously dispute that\n\nsection 7609 requires that the petition to quash be filed within\n\n20 days of the date the notice was mailed.          (Here, as it\n\nhappens, using the date of receipt would not help Berman.)\n\nInstead, Berman argues that he is entitled to the benefits of\n\nRule 6(e), which provides that \"[w]henever a party has the right\n\nor is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a\n\nprescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper\n\nupon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party\n\nby mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.\"    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 6(e).   If Rule 6(e) applied, Berman's   petition would\n\nbe timely.\n\n             By its terms, Rule 6(e) is centrally concerned with\n\nwhat a \"party\" does and a \"party\" operates within the framework\n\nof an existing case.    By contrast, statutes of limitation such\n\nas section 7609 govern the time for commencing an action.      The\n\nprevailing view in the case law is that Rule 6(e) does not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto statutes of limitation,1 and at least two cases have held\n\nexplicitly that Rule 6(e) does not extend the 20-day period\n\nprescribed by section 7609.        Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d\n\n876, 880 (6th Cir. 1999); Brohman v. Mason, 587 F. Supp. 62, 63\n\n(W.D.N.Y. 1984).    But see Turner v. United States, 881 F. Supp.\n\n449, 451 (D. Haw. 1995) (dicta).         We adopt the majority view, so\n\nit   is   unnecessary    to   resolve    several    other,          perhaps   less\n\nimpressive,    arguments      pressed    by   the       IRS    to    defeat   the\n\napplication of Rule 6(e).2\n\n            Berman's second argument is that, even if Rule 6(e)\n\ndoes not apply, the IRS is equitably estopped from asserting the\n\n20-day    statute   of   limitations     because        one    of    its   agents\n\nrepresented    to   Berman's     counsel      in    a    May    24     telephone\n\nconversation that she believed that the deadline for filing the\n\npetition was that day, May 24, when in fact the 20th day was two\n\n\n\n      1\n     E.g., Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d 876, 880 (6th Cir.\n1999); United States v. Easement and Right-of-Way, 386 F.2d 769,\n771 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied sub nom. Skaggs v. United\nStates, 390 U.S. 947 (1968); Whipp v. Weinberger, 505 F.2d 800,\n801 (6th Cir. 1974) .\n      2\n     The IRS relies both on the \"[n]otwithstanding\" proviso that\nintroduces section 7609(b)(2)(A) and on the claim that the 20-\nday limit is \"jurisdictional\" and cannot be extended by a civil\nprocedure rule, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 82. The proviso is less than\ncrystal clear, and if Rule 6(e) did apply to statutes of\nlimitation, it arguably would be possible to treat it as\nincorporated into section 7609 by implication.     Cf. Irwin v.\nDep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fdays earlier, May 22.         Whether equitable estoppel can be invoked\n\nagainst the government in a case such as this is not settled.\n\nThe prexisting general rule-- that equitable estoppel, tolling,\n\nand waiver do not apply against the government in the context of\n\na statutory deadline--was altered in               Irwin v.      Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), so that the presumption is\n\nnow   the    opposite    at   least   so    far   as   equitable   tolling   is\n\nconcerned.\n\n             Yet in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347 (1997),\n\nthe Supreme Court limited Irwin's application in a particular\n\ntax context.       See also Oropallo v. United States, 994 F.2d 25,\n\n28-31 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1050 (1994).                   For\n\npolicy as well as textual reasons the Court concluded that\n\nequitable tolling did not apply to the statute of limitations\n\nfor filing tax refund claims under 26 U.S.C. ยง 6511, Brockamp,\n\n519 U.S. at 354, a ruling in turn modified by Congress in 1998,\n\nbut only in part, 26 U.S.C. ยง 6511(h) (Supp. 1998).                   Just how\n\nfar Brockamp extends is debatable.                Compare Capital Tracing,\n\nInc., v. United States, 63 F.3d 859, 861-63 (9th Cir. 1995),\n\nwith Compagnoni v. United States, 79 A.F.T.R.2d 97-2930, 97-\n\n2932-33 (S.D. Fla. 1997), aff'd, 173 F.3d 1369 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\nBut   we    need   not   decide   whether    Irwin     extends   to   equitable\n\nestoppel or whether Brockamp extends to section 7609 because in\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fany event equitable estoppel could not be made out on these\n\nfacts.\n\n            Among    the    requirements            for    equitable      estoppel   is\n\njustified    reliance      on    the    government's         false    or   misleading\n\nstatement or conduct.            E.g., Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 1998).                               Here, the\n\nagent's statement or behavior, whatever its precise character,\n\noccurred after the 20-day period had already expired.                                The\n\nquestion    of    justification        is     beside       the   point;    obviously,\n\nBerman's    counsel   did       not    rely    on    the    agent's    statement     in\n\nfailing to meet the deadline because the deadline had passed\n\nbefore the statement was made.\n\n            The IRS brief also seeks to refute, on a precautionary\n\nbasis, a possible claim by Berman based on equitable tolling.\n\nThis is a somewhat different doctrine; it is based not just on\n\nmisconduct by the adverse party but also on broader equitable\n\nconcerns that might justify a late filing.                       Irwin, 498 U.S. at\n\n96; Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 861 F.2d 746, 752 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).      However, Berman's brief contains no developed claim\n\nof equitable tolling, so the argument is forfeit.                      United States\n\nv. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).                         Even if it\n\nwere preserved, and Brockamp were put to one side, the facts\n\nsuggest \"at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect\"\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fand not a sufficient basis for equitable tolling.                            Irwin, 498\n\nU.S. at 96; Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n             Berman's final set of arguments is that his petition\n\nto quash may be brought under jurisdictional statutes other than\n\nsection 7609(b)(2)(A)--specifically, 5 U.S.C. ยง 702 (1994); 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1331 (1994); 28 U.S.C. ยง 1340 (1994); 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1346(a)(2) (1994); and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1357 (1994).                         None of these\n\nstatutes assists Berman.             General jurisdictional statutes such\n\nas 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1340 do not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity and therefore cannot be the basis for jurisdiction over\n\na civil action against the federal government.                              Lonsdale v.\n\nUnited      States,   919     F.2d     1440,    1444     (10th      Cir.    1990);    cf.\n\nCoggeshall Dev. Corp. v. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n             Although the APA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 702, and the Little Tucker\n\nAct,   28    U.S.C.     ยง   1346(a)(2),        do    create       limited   waivers    of\n\nsovereign immunity, neither statute is applicable to Berman's\n\nclaim.      The Little Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity for non-\n\ntort claims against the United States \"founded either upon the\n\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an\n\nexecutive department, or upon any express or implied contract\n\nwith   the     United       States.\"      28        U.S.C.    ยง    1346(a)(2).        The\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fjurisdiction of the district courts is limited to claims for\n\nmoney damages \"not exceeding $10,000 in amount.\"                   Id.    The\n\nLittle Tucker Act does not authorize claims that seek primarily\n\nequitable relief.       Richardson v.        Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465\n\n(1973);     Bobula v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 970 F.2d 854, 858-59\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1992).\n\n            Claims for non-monetary relief can be raised under\n\nsection 702 of the APA, but this section too is inapplicable to\n\nBerman's    petition.      Section     702     waives   the   government's\n\nsovereign immunity from claims for non-monetary relief from\n\nadministrative agency action.           But section 702 specifically\n\nlimits the government's waiver of sovereign immunity by denying\n\nthe courts any \"authority to grant relief if any other statute\n\nthat grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the\n\nrelief which is sought.\"       5 U.S.C. ยง 702.     Section 7609(b)(2)(A)\n\nis such an \"other statute,\" and it \"expressly forbids\" any\n\nrelief if the petition is not timely filed.             See Block v. North\n\nDakota, 461 U.S. 273, 286 n.22 (1983).\n\n            The remaining statute invoked by Berman, 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1357, gives the district courts original jurisdiction over any\n\nclaim for money damages brought by an individual to recover for\n\nany injury to his person or property on account of any act done\n\nby   him   while   enforcing   any   federal    statute   either    for   the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcollection or protection of the revenues or to enforce the right\n\nto vote.     This provision is plainly inapplicable to Berman's\n\npetition.\n\n            The order of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f          United States Court of Appeals\n                    For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 01-1266\n\n                       JOHN R.

John Berman appeals from the\n\ndistrict    court's   order    dismissing       his   motion   to     quash    an\n\nadministrative summons served by the Internal Revenue Service;\n\nthe dismissal was based on the ground that the motion was not\n\ntimely filed.    The pertinent facts are undisputed.\n\n            From 1991 until 1999, Berman was a partner in the\n\nBoston law firm of Davis, Malm & D'Agostine (\"the Davis firm\").\n\nHe is the subject of an ongoing income tax investigation by the\n\nIRS for the tax years 1993 through 1998.              On May 1, 2000, the\n\nIRS issued a summons to the keeper of records at the Davis firm,\n\nrequiring the production of various documents pertaining to\n\nBerman.      Included    in   the   summons     was   a   request     for     all\n\ncorrespondence    between     Berman      and   the   Davis    firm    or     its\n\nemployees between January 1, 1998, and April 28, 2000.\n\n            The summons was a \"third-party recordkeeper\" summons\n\ngoverned by section 7609 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         26\n\nU.S.C. ยง 7609 (1994 & Supp. 1998).              Third-party recordkeepers\n\nare defined as certain institutions and individuals--including\n\nattorneys and law firms--that customarily maintain financial or\n\nbusiness records.       Id. ยง 7603(b)(2) (Supp. 1998).          By statute,\n\nthe IRS must provide notice of the summons not just to the\n\nrecordkeeper but also to the individual to whom the summons\n\npertains.     Id. ยง 7609(a)(1) (Supp. 1998).              The notice must\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcontain    a   copy   of   the   summons   and    an   explanation    of    the\n\nnoticee's right to initiate a proceeding to quash it.                 Id.\n\n            The IRS mailed a notice of summons to Berman's counsel\n\nby certified mail dated May 2, 2000; Berman had previously\n\ndesignated his counsel as the person to receive such notices.\n\nThe certified mail receipt returned to the IRS indicates that\n\nBerman's    counsel    received    the   notice   the   next   day,   May    3.\n\nSection 7609(a)(2) provides inter alia that the notice \"shall be\n\nsufficient if . . . mailed to\" the person or his designated\n\nrepresentative.       Section 7609(b)(2)(A) further            provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                   Notwithstanding any other law or rule\n            of law, any person who is entitled to notice\n            of a summons under subsection (a) shall have\n            the right to begin a proceeding to quash\n            such summons not later than the 20th day\n            after the day such notice is given in the\n            manner provided in subsection (a)(2).\n\n            Twenty-two days after the summons was mailed by the\n\nIRS--on May 24, 2000--Berman filed a petition to quash the\n\nsummons, alleging that a particular letter responsive to the\n\nsummons was privileged under the attorney-client, work product,\n\nand joint defense privileges.            The district court eventually\n\ndismissed the petition to quash on the ground that it had not\n\nbeen filed within the statutory 20-day period.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             On appeal, Berman claims that his filing was timely\n\nbecause, under a civil procedure rule, he had three extra days\n\nto respond to a mailed notice.          Alternatively, he says that the\n\nIRS is barred by equitable estoppel from invoking the 20-day\n\ndeadline because an IRS agent said that the petition was timely\n\nif   filed   by   May   24.   Lastly,       Berman   says   that   there    are\n\nalternative bases of jurisdiction independent of the statutory\n\npetition to quash.       These arguments turn on issues of law that\n\nwe resolve de novo.\n\n             Perhaps (we need not decide the point) an ordinary\n\nreader of section 7609 might at first be uncertain whether, in\n\nthe case of mailed notices, the 20-day period runs from the date\n\nof mailing or the date of receipt.            Section 7609(b)(2)(A) says\n\nthat the proceeding to quash must be initiated \"not later than\n\nthe 20th day after notice is given in the manner provided in\n\n[section     7609](a)(2),\"    which    in    turn    says   that   notice    is\n\n\"sufficient\" if \"mailed.\"\n\n             However, the statutory provisions, taken together and\n\nread carefully, literally say that the 20 days run from the date\n\nthat notice is \"mailed.\"       Even brief research would reveal that\n\nthe case law requires a motion to quash under section 7609 to be\n\nfiled within 20 days of the mailing of the notice, not of its\n\nreceipt.     Faber v. United States, 921 F.2d 1118, 1119 (10th Cir.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f1990); Stringer v. United States, 776 F.2d 274, 275 (11th Cir.\n\n1985).   A Treasury Department regulation confirms this reading.\n\n26 C.F.R. ยง 301.7609-3(2) (2001) (proceeding to quash must be\n\ncommenced \"not later than the 20th day following the day the\n\nnotice of the summons was . . . mailed\").\n\n          In all events, Berman does not seriously dispute that\n\nsection 7609 requires that the petition to quash be filed within\n\n20 days of the date the notice was mailed.          (Here, as it\n\nhappens, using the date of receipt would not help Berman.)\n\nInstead, Berman argues that he is entitled to the benefits of\n\nRule 6(e), which provides that \"[w]henever a party has the right\n\nor is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a\n\nprescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper\n\nupon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party\n\nby mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.\"    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 6(e).   If Rule 6(e) applied, Berman's   petition would\n\nbe timely.\n\n             By its terms, Rule 6(e) is centrally concerned with\n\nwhat a \"party\" does and a \"party\" operates within the framework\n\nof an existing case.    By contrast, statutes of limitation such\n\nas section 7609 govern the time for commencing an action.      The\n\nprevailing view in the case law is that Rule 6(e) does not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto statutes of limitation,1 and at least two cases have held\n\nexplicitly that Rule 6(e) does not extend the 20-day period\n\nprescribed by section 7609.        Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d\n\n876, 880 (6th Cir. 1999); Brohman v. Mason, 587 F. Supp. 62, 63\n\n(W.D.N.Y. 1984).    But see Turner v. United States, 881 F. Supp.\n\n449, 451 (D. Haw. 1995) (dicta).         We adopt the majority view, so\n\nit   is   unnecessary    to   resolve    several    other,          perhaps   less\n\nimpressive,    arguments      pressed    by   the       IRS    to    defeat   the\n\napplication of Rule 6(e).2\n\n            Berman's second argument is that, even if Rule 6(e)\n\ndoes not apply, the IRS is equitably estopped from asserting the\n\n20-day    statute   of   limitations     because        one    of    its   agents\n\nrepresented    to   Berman's     counsel      in    a    May    24     telephone\n\nconversation that she believed that the deadline for filing the\n\npetition was that day, May 24, when in fact the 20th day was two\n\n\n\n      1\n     E.g., Clay v. United States, 199 F.3d 876, 880 (6th Cir.\n1999); United States v. Easement and Right-of-Way, 386 F.2d 769,\n771 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied sub nom. Skaggs v. United\nStates, 390 U.S. 947 (1968); Whipp v. Weinberger, 505 F.2d 800,\n801 (6th Cir. 1974) .\n      2\n     The IRS relies both on the \"[n]otwithstanding\" proviso that\nintroduces section 7609(b)(2)(A) and on the claim that the 20-\nday limit is \"jurisdictional\" and cannot be extended by a civil\nprocedure rule, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 82. The proviso is less than\ncrystal clear, and if Rule 6(e) did apply to statutes of\nlimitation, it arguably would be possible to treat it as\nincorporated into section 7609 by implication.     Cf. Irwin v.\nDep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fdays earlier, May 22.         Whether equitable estoppel can be invoked\n\nagainst the government in a case such as this is not settled.\n\nThe prexisting general rule-- that equitable estoppel, tolling,\n\nand waiver do not apply against the government in the context of\n\na statutory deadline--was altered in               Irwin v.      Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), so that the presumption is\n\nnow   the    opposite    at   least   so    far   as   equitable   tolling   is\n\nconcerned.\n\n             Yet in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347 (1997),\n\nthe Supreme Court limited Irwin's application in a particular\n\ntax context.       See also Oropallo v. United States, 994 F.2d 25,\n\n28-31 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1050 (1994).                   For\n\npolicy as well as textual reasons the Court concluded that\n\nequitable tolling did not apply to the statute of limitations\n\nfor filing tax refund claims under 26 U.S.C. ยง 6511, Brockamp,\n\n519 U.S. at 354, a ruling in turn modified by Congress in 1998,\n\nbut only in part, 26 U.S.C. ยง 6511(h) (Supp. 1998).                   Just how\n\nfar Brockamp extends is debatable.                Compare Capital Tracing,\n\nInc., v. United States, 63 F.3d 859, 861-63 (9th Cir. 1995),\n\nwith Compagnoni v. United States, 79 A.F.T.R.2d 97-2930, 97-\n\n2932-33 (S.D. Fla. 1997), aff'd, 173 F.3d 1369 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\nBut   we    need   not   decide   whether    Irwin     extends   to   equitable\n\nestoppel or whether Brockamp extends to section 7609 because in\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fany event equitable estoppel could not be made out on these\n\nfacts.\n\n            Among    the    requirements            for    equitable      estoppel   is\n\njustified    reliance      on    the    government's         false    or   misleading\n\nstatement or conduct.            E.g., Benitez-Pons v. Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, 136 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 1998).                               Here, the\n\nagent's statement or behavior, whatever its precise character,\n\noccurred after the 20-day period had already expired.                                The\n\nquestion    of    justification        is     beside       the   point;    obviously,\n\nBerman's    counsel   did       not    rely    on    the    agent's    statement     in\n\nfailing to meet the deadline because the deadline had passed\n\nbefore the statement was made.\n\n            The IRS brief also seeks to refute, on a precautionary\n\nbasis, a possible claim by Berman based on equitable tolling.\n\nThis is a somewhat different doctrine; it is based not just on\n\nmisconduct by the adverse party but also on broader equitable\n\nconcerns that might justify a late filing.                       Irwin, 498 U.S. at\n\n96; Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 861 F.2d 746, 752 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).      However, Berman's brief contains no developed claim\n\nof equitable tolling, so the argument is forfeit.                      United States\n\nv. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).                         Even if it\n\nwere preserved, and Brockamp were put to one side, the facts\n\nsuggest \"at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect\"\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fand not a sufficient basis for equitable tolling.                            Irwin, 498\n\nU.S. at 96; Salois v. Dime Sav. Bank, 128 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n             Berman's final set of arguments is that his petition\n\nto quash may be brought under jurisdictional statutes other than\n\nsection 7609(b)(2)(A)--specifically, 5 U.S.C. ยง 702 (1994); 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1331 (1994); 28 U.S.C. ยง 1340 (1994); 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1346(a)(2) (1994); and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1357 (1994).                         None of these\n\nstatutes assists Berman.             General jurisdictional statutes such\n\nas 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1340 do not waive sovereign\n\nimmunity and therefore cannot be the basis for jurisdiction over\n\na civil action against the federal government.                              Lonsdale v.\n\nUnited      States,   919     F.2d     1440,    1444     (10th      Cir.    1990);    cf.\n\nCoggeshall Dev. Corp. v. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).\n\n             Although the APA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 702, and the Little Tucker\n\nAct,   28    U.S.C.     ยง   1346(a)(2),        do    create       limited   waivers    of\n\nsovereign immunity, neither statute is applicable to Berman's\n\nclaim.      The Little Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity for non-\n\ntort claims against the United States \"founded either upon the\n\nConstitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an\n\nexecutive department, or upon any express or implied contract\n\nwith   the     United       States.\"      28        U.S.C.    ยง    1346(a)(2).        The\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fjurisdiction of the district courts is limited to claims for\n\nmoney damages \"not exceeding $10,000 in amount.\"                   Id.    The\n\nLittle Tucker Act does not authorize claims that seek primarily\n\nequitable relief.       Richardson v.        Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465\n\n(1973);     Bobula v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 970 F.2d 854, 858-59\n\n(Fed. Cir. 1992).\n\n            Claims for non-monetary relief can be raised under\n\nsection 702 of the APA, but this section too is inapplicable to\n\nBerman's    petition.      Section     702     waives   the   government's\n\nsovereign immunity from claims for non-monetary relief from\n\nadministrative agency action.           But section 702 specifically\n\nlimits the government's waiver of sovereign immunity by denying\n\nthe courts any \"authority to grant relief if any other statute\n\nthat grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the\n\nrelief which is sought.\"       5 U.S.C. ยง 702.     Section 7609(b)(2)(A)\n\nis such an \"other statute,\" and it \"expressly forbids\" any\n\nrelief if the petition is not timely filed.             See Block v. North\n\nDakota, 461 U.S. 273, 286 n.22 (1983).\n\n            The remaining statute invoked by Berman, 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1357, gives the district courts original jurisdiction over any\n\nclaim for money damages brought by an individual to recover for\n\nany injury to his person or property on account of any act done\n\nby   him   while   enforcing   any   federal    statute   either    for   the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fcollection or protection of the revenues or to enforce the right\n\nto vote.     This provision is plainly inapplicable to Berman's\n\npetition.\n\n            The order of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

John Berman appeals from the\n\ndistrict    court's   order    dismissing       his   motion   to     quash    an\n\nadministrative summons served by the Internal Revenue Service;\n\nthe dismissal was based on the ground that the motion was not\n\ntimely filed.    The pertinent facts are undisputed.\n\n            From 1991 until 1999, Berman was a partner in the\n\nBoston law firm of Davis, Malm & D'Agostine (\"the Davis firm\").\n\nHe is the subject of an ongoing income tax investigation by the\n\nIRS for the tax years 1993 through 1998.              On May 1, 2000, the\n\nIRS issued a summons to the keeper of records at the Davis firm,\n\nrequiring the production of various documents pertaining to\n\nBerman.      Included    in   the   summons     was   a   request     for     all\n\ncorrespondence    between     Berman      and   the   Davis    firm    or     its\n\nemployees between January 1, 1998, and April 28, 2000.\n\n            The summons was a \"third-party recordkeeper\" summons\n\ngoverned by section 7609 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         26\n\nU.S.C. ยง 7609 (1994 & Supp. 1998).              Third-party recordkeepers\n\nare defined as certain institutions and individuals--including\n\nattorneys and law firms--that customarily maintain financial or\n\nbusiness records.       Id. ยง 7603(b)(2) (Supp. 1998).          By statute,\n\nthe IRS must provide notice of the summons not just to the\n\nrecordkeeper but also to the individual to whom the summons\n\npertains.     Id. ยง 7609(a)(1) (Supp. 1998).              The notice must\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcontain    a   copy   of   the   summons   and    an   explanation    of    the\n\nnoticee's right to initiate a proceeding to quash it.                 Id.\n\n            The IRS mailed a notice of summons to Berman's counsel\n\nby certified mail dated May 2, 2000; Berman had previously\n\ndesignated his counsel as the person to receive such notices.\n\nThe certified mail receipt returned to the IRS indicates that\n\nBerman's    counsel    received    the   notice   the   next   day,   May    3.\n\nSection 7609(a)(2) provides inter alia that the notice \"shall be\n\nsufficient if . . . mailed to\" the person or his designated\n\nrepresentative.       Section 7609(b)(2)(A) further            provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                   Notwithstanding any other law or rule\n            of law, any person who is entitled to notice\n            of a summons under subsection (a) shall have\n            the right to begin a proceeding to quash\n            such summons not later than the 20th day\n            after the day such notice is given in the\n            manner provided in subsection (a)(2).\n\n            Twenty-two days after the summons was mailed by the\n\nIRS--on May 24, 2000--Berman filed a petition to quash the\n\nsummons, alleging that a particular letter responsive to the\n\nsummons was privileged under the attorney-client, work product,\n\nand joint defense privileges.            The district court eventually\n\ndismissed the petition to quash on the ground that it had not\n\nbeen filed within the statutory 20-day period.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             On appeal, Berman claims that his filing was timely\n\nbecause, under a civil procedure rule, he had three extra days\n\nto respond to a mailed notice.          Alternatively, he says that the\n\nIRS is barred by equitable estoppel from invoking the 20-day\n\ndeadline because an IRS agent said that the petition was timely\n\nif   filed   by   May   24.   Lastly,       Berman   says   that   there    are\n\nalternative bases of jurisdiction independent of the statutory\n\npetition to quash.       These arguments turn on issues of law that\n\nwe resolve de novo.\n\n             Perhaps (we need not decide the point) an ordinary\n\nreader of section 7609 might at first be uncertain whether, in\n\nthe case of mailed notices, the 20-day period runs from the date\n\nof mailing or the date of receipt.

A Treasury Department regulation confirms this reading.\n\n26 C.F.R. ยง 301.7609-3(2) (2001) (proceeding to quash must be\n\ncommenced \"not later than the 20th day following the day the\n\nnotice of the summons was . . . mailed\").\n\n          In all events, Berman does not seriously dispute that\n\nsection 7609 requires that the petition to quash be filed within\n\n20 days of the date the notice was mailed.          (Here, as it\n\nhappens, using the date of receipt would not help Berman.)\n\nInstead, Berman argues that he is entitled to the benefits of\n\nRule 6(e), which provides that \"[w]henever a party has the right\n\nor is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a\n\nprescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper\n\nupon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party\n\nby mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.\"    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 6(e).   If Rule 6(e) applied, Berman's   petition would\n\nbe timely.\n\n             By its terms, Rule 6(e) is centrally concerned with\n\nwhat a \"party\" does and a \"party\" operates within the framework\n\nof an existing case.    By contrast, statutes of limitation such\n\nas section 7609 govern the time for commencing an action.      The\n\nprevailing view in the case law is that Rule 6(e) does not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto statutes of limitation,1 and at least two cases have held\n\nexplicitly that Rule 6(e) does not extend the 20-day period\n\nprescribed by section 7609.

Id.\n\n            The IRS mailed a notice of summons to Berman's counsel\n\nby certified mail dated May 2, 2000; Berman had previously\n\ndesignated his counsel as the person to receive such notices.\n\nThe certified mail receipt returned to the IRS indicates that\n\nBerman's    counsel    received    the   notice   the   next   day,   May    3.\n\nSection 7609(a)(2) provides inter alia that the notice \"shall be\n\nsufficient if . . . mailed to\" the person or his designated\n\nrepresentative.       Section 7609(b)(2)(A) further            provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                   Notwithstanding any other law or rule\n            of law, any person who is entitled to notice\n            of a summons under subsection (a) shall have\n            the right to begin a proceeding to quash\n            such summons not later than the 20th day\n            after the day such notice is given in the\n            manner provided in subsection (a)(2).\n\n            Twenty-two days after the summons was mailed by the\n\nIRS--on May 24, 2000--Berman filed a petition to quash the\n\nsummons, alleging that a particular letter responsive to the\n\nsummons was privileged under the attorney-client, work product,\n\nand joint defense privileges.            The district court eventually\n\ndismissed the petition to quash on the ground that it had not\n\nbeen filed within the statutory 20-day period.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             On appeal, Berman claims that his filing was timely\n\nbecause, under a civil procedure rule, he had three extra days\n\nto respond to a mailed notice.          Alternatively, he says that the\n\nIRS is barred by equitable estoppel from invoking the 20-day\n\ndeadline because an IRS agent said that the petition was timely\n\nif   filed   by   May   24.   Lastly,       Berman   says   that   there    are\n\nalternative bases of jurisdiction independent of the statutory\n\npetition to quash.       These arguments turn on issues of law that\n\nwe resolve de novo.\n\n             Perhaps (we need not decide the point) an ordinary\n\nreader of section 7609 might at first be uncertain whether, in\n\nthe case of mailed notices, the 20-day period runs from the date\n\nof mailing or the date of receipt.            Section 7609(b)(2)(A) says\n\nthat the proceeding to quash must be initiated \"not later than\n\nthe 20th day after notice is given in the manner provided in\n\n[section     7609](a)(2),\"    which    in    turn    says   that   notice    is\n\n\"sufficient\" if \"mailed.\"\n\n             However, the statutory provisions, taken together and\n\nread carefully, literally say that the 20 days run from the date\n\nthat notice is \"mailed.\"       Even brief research would reveal that\n\nthe case law requires a motion to quash under section 7609 to be\n\nfiled within 20 days of the mailing of the notice, not of its\n\nreceipt.

(Here, as it\n\nhappens, using the date of receipt would not help Berman.)\n\nInstead, Berman argues that he is entitled to the benefits of\n\nRule 6(e), which provides that \"[w]henever a party has the right\n\nor is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a\n\nprescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper\n\nupon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party\n\nby mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.\"    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 6(e).   If Rule 6(e) applied, Berman's   petition would\n\nbe timely.\n\n             By its terms, Rule 6(e) is centrally concerned with\n\nwhat a \"party\" does and a \"party\" operates within the framework\n\nof an existing case.    By contrast, statutes of limitation such\n\nas section 7609 govern the time for commencing an action.      The\n\nprevailing view in the case law is that Rule 6(e) does not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto statutes of limitation,1 and at least two cases have held\n\nexplicitly that Rule 6(e) does not extend the 20-day period\n\nprescribed by section 7609.

John Berman appeals from the\n\ndistrict    court's   order    dismissing       his   motion   to     quash    an\n\nadministrative summons served by the Internal Revenue Service;\n\nthe dismissal was based on the ground that the motion was not\n\ntimely filed.    The pertinent facts are undisputed.\n\n            From 1991 until 1999, Berman was a partner in the\n\nBoston law firm of Davis, Malm & D'Agostine (\"the Davis firm\").\n\nHe is the subject of an ongoing income tax investigation by the\n\nIRS for the tax years 1993 through 1998.              On May 1, 2000, the\n\nIRS issued a summons to the keeper of records at the Davis firm,\n\nrequiring the production of various documents pertaining to\n\nBerman.      Included    in   the   summons     was   a   request     for     all\n\ncorrespondence    between     Berman      and   the   Davis    firm    or     its\n\nemployees between January 1, 1998, and April 28, 2000.\n\n            The summons was a \"third-party recordkeeper\" summons\n\ngoverned by section 7609 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         26\n\nU.S.C. ยง 7609 (1994 & Supp. 1998).              Third-party recordkeepers\n\nare defined as certain institutions and individuals--including\n\nattorneys and law firms--that customarily maintain financial or\n\nbusiness records.       Id. ยง 7603(b)(2) (Supp. 1998).          By statute,\n\nthe IRS must provide notice of the summons not just to the\n\nrecordkeeper but also to the individual to whom the summons\n\npertains.     Id. ยง 7609(a)(1) (Supp. 1998).              The notice must\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fcontain    a   copy   of   the   summons   and    an   explanation    of    the\n\nnoticee's right to initiate a proceeding to quash it.                 Id.\n\n            The IRS mailed a notice of summons to Berman's counsel\n\nby certified mail dated May 2, 2000; Berman had previously\n\ndesignated his counsel as the person to receive such notices.\n\nThe certified mail receipt returned to the IRS indicates that\n\nBerman's    counsel    received    the   notice   the   next   day,   May    3.\n\nSection 7609(a)(2) provides inter alia that the notice \"shall be\n\nsufficient if . . . mailed to\" the person or his designated\n\nrepresentative.       Section 7609(b)(2)(A) further            provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                   Notwithstanding any other law or rule\n            of law, any person who is entitled to notice\n            of a summons under subsection (a) shall have\n            the right to begin a proceeding to quash\n            such summons not later than the 20th day\n            after the day such notice is given in the\n            manner provided in subsection (a)(2).\n\n            Twenty-two days after the summons was mailed by the\n\nIRS--on May 24, 2000--Berman filed a petition to quash the\n\nsummons, alleging that a particular letter responsive to the\n\nsummons was privileged under the attorney-client, work product,\n\nand joint defense privileges.            The district court eventually\n\ndismissed the petition to quash on the ground that it had not\n\nbeen filed within the statutory 20-day period.                 This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             On appeal, Berman claims that his filing was timely\n\nbecause, under a civil procedure rule, he had three extra days\n\nto respond to a mailed notice.          Alternatively, he says that the\n\nIRS is barred by equitable estoppel from invoking the 20-day\n\ndeadline because an IRS agent said that the petition was timely\n\nif   filed   by   May   24.   Lastly,       Berman   says   that   there    are\n\nalternative bases of jurisdiction independent of the statutory\n\npetition to quash.       These arguments turn on issues of law that\n\nwe resolve de novo.\n\n             Perhaps (we need not decide the point) an ordinary\n\nreader of section 7609 might at first be uncertain whether, in\n\nthe case of mailed notices, the 20-day period runs from the date\n\nof mailing or the date of receipt.            Section 7609(b)(2)(A) says\n\nthat the proceeding to quash must be initiated \"not later than\n\nthe 20th day after notice is given in the manner provided in\n\n[section     7609](a)(2),\"    which    in    turn    says   that   notice    is\n\n\"sufficient\" if \"mailed.\"\n\n             However, the statutory provisions, taken together and\n\nread carefully, literally say that the 20 days run from the date\n\nthat notice is \"mailed.\"       Even brief research would reveal that\n\nthe case law requires a motion to quash under section 7609 to be\n\nfiled within 20 days of the mailing of the notice, not of its\n\nreceipt.

A Treasury Department regulation confirms this reading.\n\n26 C.F.R. ยง 301.7609-3(2) (2001) (proceeding to quash must be\n\ncommenced \"not later than the 20th day following the day the\n\nnotice of the summons was . . . mailed\").\n\n          In all events, Berman does not seriously dispute that\n\nsection 7609 requires that the petition to quash be filed within\n\n20 days of the date the notice was mailed.          (Here, as it\n\nhappens, using the date of receipt would not help Berman.)\n\nInstead, Berman argues that he is entitled to the benefits of\n\nRule 6(e), which provides that \"[w]henever a party has the right\n\nor is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a\n\nprescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper\n\nupon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party\n\nby mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.\"    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 6(e).   If Rule 6(e) applied, Berman's   petition would\n\nbe timely.\n\n             By its terms, Rule 6(e) is centrally concerned with\n\nwhat a \"party\" does and a \"party\" operates within the framework\n\nof an existing case.    By contrast, statutes of limitation such\n\nas section 7609 govern the time for commencing an action.      The\n\nprevailing view in the case law is that Rule 6(e) does not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto statutes of limitation,1 and at least two cases have held\n\nexplicitly that Rule 6(e) does not extend the 20-day period\n\nprescribed by section 7609.

Section     702     waives   the   government's\n\nsovereign immunity from claims for non-monetary relief from\n\nadministrative agency action.           But section 702 specifically\n\nlimits the government's waiver of sovereign immunity by denying\n\nthe courts any \"authority to grant relief if any other statute\n\nthat grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the\n\nrelief which is sought.\"       5 U.S.C. ยง 702.     Section 7609(b)(2)(A)\n\nis such an \"other statute,\" and it \"expressly forbids\" any\n\nrelief if the petition is not timely filed.             See Block v.
