Christakos, with whom Joel E. Hoffman, Gail L.\r\nWestover, Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP, Joan M. Griffin and\r\nCasner &amp; Edwards were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\n                                \r\n\n                June 2, 1999\r\n                                         CUDAHY, Senior Circuit Judge.  In 1994, Catex Vitol Gas,\r\nInc.(CVG) fired one of its executives, Stephen Wolfe.  Wolfe now\r\nappeals two orders granting summary judgment to CVG and its\r\npresident, Michael Kutsch, on claims and counter-claims related to\r\nhis termination.  We affirm both orders.\r\n                     I.\r\nIn 1991 Catamount, a Massachusetts natural gas company\r\nowned by Kutsch, hired Wolfe to open and manage a branch office in\r\nHouston.  With the advice of counsel, Wolfe negotiated and signed\r\nan employment contract.  The particulars of this contract are at\r\nissue here, so we recite them with some specificity. \r\nWolfe agreed to serve as a company Vice President from\r\nMarch 1, 1991 until February 28, 1992 (Initial Employment Period).\r\nAccording to  3 of the contract, Wolfe's tenure would \"continue\r\nfrom year to year thereafter and [could] be canceled by [Wolfe]\r\nupon thirty days prior written notice.\"  In consideration of his\r\nservices, the company paid Wolfe a $100,000 yearly base salary. \r\nAny increase in salary or additional compensation, such as a bonus,\r\nwas at the \"sole discretion\" of the company's Board of Directors. \r\nThe contract also outlined termination processes. \r\nSection 7.2 allowed Wolfe to terminate his employment \"upon the\r\nexpiration of the Initial Employment Period in accordance with the\r\nterms of this Agreement.\"  Section 7.1 permitted the company to end\r\nthe relationship\r\n           a) upon the expiration of the Initial\r\nEmployment Period in accordance with the\r\nterms of this Agreement, (b) at any time\r\nwithout notice for \"cause\" as defined\r\nbelow, (c) at any time without notice\r\nwithout cause, subject to section 7.5\r\nbelow, (d) upon the death of the Employee,\r\nor (e) in the event of the Employee's\r\ndisability  . . .\r\nSection 7.5 then defined what compensation would be due Wolfe upon\r\ntermination of his employment.  It provided in full:\r\n           Upon termination of the Employee's\r\nemployment with the Company in accordance\r\nwith clause (a), (b), (d) or (e) of\r\nSection 7.1, all compensation and benefits\r\nunder this Agreement will cease, effective\r\nthe date of termination.  Upon termination\r\nof the Employee's employment with the\r\nCompany in accordance with clause (c) of\r\nSection 7.1 prior to March 1, 1992, (\"the\r\nGuaranteed Payment Date\"), the Employee\r\nwill be paid his Base Salary through such\r\nGuaranteed Payment Date in accordance with\r\nthe Company's ordinary payroll practices. \r\nUpon termination of the Employee's\r\nemployment with the Company in accordance\r\nwith clause (c) of Section 7.1 after the\r\nGuaranteed Payment Date, the Employee will\r\nbe paid his Base Salary for thirty days\r\nafter such termination in accordance with\r\nthe Company's ordinary payroll practices. \r\nOther than as specifically set forth in\r\nthis Section 7.5 or as otherwise required\r\nby law, the Employee will not be entitled\r\nto receive any compensation or benefits\r\nafter termination of his employment with\r\nthe Company.\r\n\nThe contract also contained an integration clause,  11, which\r\nprovided:\r\n           This Agreement constitutes the entire\r\nAgreement between the parties with regard\r\nto the subject matter hereof, superseding\r\nall prior understandings and agreements,\r\nwhether written or oral.  This Agreement\r\nmay not be amended or revised except by a\r\nwriting signed by the parties.\r\n\nWolfe's tenure at Catamount proceeded without incident \r\nthrough the Initial Employment Period.  Wolfe traded natural gas\r\nfor the company out of its Houston office and frequently traveled\r\nto Boston to confer with colleagues.  In 1992, the company, by this\r\ntime re-named Catex Energy Inc., instituted a Bonus and Guaranty\r\nPlan (BGP) to provide \"an incentive to selected key employees of\r\nthe Company similar to that to be derived from holding shares of\r\nthe common stock, no par value per share (\"Common Stock\"), of the\r\nCompany, but without transferring to such employees ownership of\r\nany capital stock of the Company.\"  The BGP is also at issue here,\r\nso we limn its particulars as well.  \r\nThe BGP allowed Kutsch to designate participants for a\r\ngiven fiscal year and required each Participant to execute an\r\nAccession Agreement for that year.  Section 2(a) stated that \"No\r\nownership of any capital stock of the Company will be transferred\r\nor otherwise granted to any employee of the Company as a result of\r\nthe designation or participation of such employee as a\r\nParticipant.\"  In the event of the sale of \"all of the outstanding\r\nCommon Stock of the Company,\"  4(a) entitled BGP Participants to\r\nsome compensation which was to be determined by a precise formula. \r\nSection 11(d) further provided that if the BGP were terminated\r\nprior to the end of a fiscal year and  4(a)'s stock sale\r\ncompensation provision were triggered within a year of that\r\ntermination, Participants would be entitled to compensation as\r\nspecified.  Kutsch designated Wolfe as a BGP Participant for the\r\nfiscal year 1992, and on June 12, 1992, Wolfe executed an Accession\r\nAgreement in accordance with the terms of the BGP.  Wolfe never\r\nsigned an Accession Agreement for the fiscal year 1993.\r\nOn July 31, 1993, Kutsch sold 51 percent of Catex's\r\noutstanding stock, all of which he owned, to Vitol Holding SARL. \r\nPrior to the closing and to facilitate the deal, on July 29, 1993,\r\nWolfe signed a Release and Waiver in which Kutsch agreed to forgive\r\na $25,000 balance on a personal loan, and Wolfe \"irrevocably\r\nrelease[d] and discharge[d] each of the Company, Kutsch and Vitol\r\nfrom any and all liability of whatever description under or in\r\nconnection with the [BGP].\"  In the Release, Wolfe acknowledged\r\nthat he had reviewed acquisition documents which provided for a\r\n$1,000,000 payment to Kutsch, $75,000 of which was intended to be\r\ndivided among the three former BGP Participants.  Paragraph 1(e) of\r\nthe Release provided:\r\n           The Acquisition does not constitute a\r\nStock Sale (as defined in the [BGP]) or\r\nany other event or type of transaction\r\ncontemplated by the [BGP] to require any\r\npayment to Participants.  Moreover,\r\nneither the undersigned nor any other\r\nperson has been designated as a\r\nParticipant under the Plan for the\r\nCompany's fiscal year ending December 31,\r\n1993.  Nevertheless, Kutsch and the\r\nCompany have determined to treat the\r\n[$75,000] as if it were being paid\r\npursuant to the [BGP] and have undertaken\r\nin negotiating the [Acquisition] to ensure\r\ncontinuation after the Acquisition of the\r\nCompany's informal discretionary bonus\r\nprogram for key employees in a manner\r\nconsistent with the company's past\r\npractice.\r\n\nIn addition to signing this Release and Waiver, Wolfe initialed\r\nparagraph 1(e).  He consulted an attorney before executing this\r\nRelease.\r\nAt a CVG Board of Directors Meeting on December 9, 1993,\r\nthe four attendees, one of whom was Kutsch, discussed a\r\nBonus/Incentive Plan (BIP) for 1994.  The proposed program,\r\noutlined in a short memo for the meeting, involved a cash component\r\nlinked to CVG's income, a deferred component vesting over four\r\nyears and a stock component allowing Kutsch to grant CVG employees\r\noptions to purchase his stock in the company.  The minutes of this\r\nmeeting indicate that the Board of Directors believed that these\r\nproposals would create an incentive for \"key senior employees\" to\r\nstay with the company.  The Board apparently \"agreed\" to the bonus\r\nterms as outlined in the proposal memorandum.  Nothing in the\r\nrecord indicates whether CVG actually implemented the BIP or any of\r\nits several components.\r\nWolfe claims that in February or March 1994, Kutsch\r\napproached him about devoting more of his time to developing new\r\nbusiness.  In return, according to Wolfe, Kutsch promised Wolfe a\r\nnew method of compensation.  Wolfe alleges that he and Kutsch\r\nentered into an oral agreement, which changed Wolfe's bonus package\r\nby adding a \"profit center\" component, a \"new bonus\" concept and a\r\nvested ownership interest.  These elements, according to Wolfe's\r\ndescription, roughly correspond to the three component parts of the\r\nBIP.  This agreement also allegedly made parts of Wolfe's annual\r\nbonus mandatory rather than discretionary.  Wolfe claims that, in\r\nreliance on this oral contract, he largely abandoned the client\r\nbase he had spent three years developing in order to concentrate on\r\nbringing in new business for CVG.\r\nOn March 28, 1994, CVG fired Wolfe without cause.  This\r\ntermination was governed by  7(c) of Wolfe's original employment\r\ncontract which mandated that CVG pay Wolfe thirty days' base salary\r\nas severance pay.  CVG paid Wolfe ninety days' severance and\r\noffered to determine at the end of fiscal year 1994 whether Wolfe\r\nshould receive a bonus for the three months of work before his\r\ntermination.  Although his written contract did not so require, CVG\r\neventually granted such a bonus to Wolfe.\r\nApparently anticipating Wolfe's dissatisfaction with this\r\nseverance package, CVG filed a declaratory judgment action in\r\nMassachusetts state court seeking a determination that it did not\r\nowe Wolfe anything more.  Citing diversity of citizenship, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1332, Wolfe removed the case to federal court and counter-\r\nclaimed against CVG and Kutsch.  Wolfe first alleged that CVG had\r\nbreached a contract by failing to pay him the additional\r\ncompensation Kutsch had orally promised.  Wolfe also stated a claim\r\nsounding in fraud related to the Release and Waiver, contending\r\nthat Kutsch had misrepresented the value of the acquisition and\r\nfraudulently induced Wolfe to abandon his stock rights under the\r\nBGP.   CVG moved for summary judgment on both its original action\r\nand Wolfe's counter-claims.  In an order dated June 27, 1997, the\r\ndistrict court granted CVG's motion with respect to Wolfe's breach\r\ncount.  The court held that it could not enforce an oral\r\nmodification of a fully-integrated, written employment contract. \r\nThe court allowed discovery into Wolfe's fraud allegation.  About\r\na year later, in an order dated June 10, 1998, the district court\r\ngranted the remainder of CVG's motion for summary judgment.  It\r\nfound that Wolfe could have suffered no injury from the alleged\r\nfraud because, under the BGP and pursuant to the Release, he owned\r\nno stock rights.  Wolfe appeals both orders.\r\n                    II.\r\nWe review an order of summary judgment de novo, employing\r\nthe same standards as the district court and viewing all facts in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See, e.g.,\r\nHinchey v. Nynex Corp., 144 F.3d 134, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  To\r\nsurvive a summary judgment motion, the non-moving party must\r\nproduce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material\r\nfact.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\r\nA.  Enforcement of the Oral Modification\r\nWolfe first challenges the district court's refusal to\r\nenforce the alleged oral modifications of his employment contract. \r\nHe asserts, in sum, that CVG owes him money pursuant to his\r\nagreement with Kutsch, which involved a profit center, a new bonus\r\nstructure and a vested ownership interest.  The district court\r\nlooked to the four corners of the contract, several provisions of\r\nwhich, it found, precluded enforcement of the alleged promises for\r\nadditional pay.  Section 7.5, for example, provides that if Wolfe\r\nwere terminated without cause (as defined in  7.2(c)) after the\r\nInitial Employment Period, as he was, then CVG owed him only thirty\r\ndays' base salary (it paid him ninety days') and any other \r\ncompensation expressly included in the written contract.  The\r\ndistrict court found no evidence that Wolfe's alleged bonuses had\r\nbeen incorporated in writing in the contract.  Further,  3\r\nprovided that all forms of compensation other than base salary were\r\nat the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.  Similarly,\r\nbecause none of the other alleged modifications was in writing, and\r\n11 of the contract expressly required modifications to be in\r\nwriting, the district court refused to enforce them.  Wolfe now\r\ncalls the district court's strict reliance on the language of the\r\nemployment contract an \"unfounded legal fiction.\"  Appellant's Br.\r\nat 25; see also Appellant's Reply Br. at 2.  \r\nUnder the principles of Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304\r\nU.S. 64, 78 (1938), Texas law supplies the substantive framework\r\nfor determining whether the district court's approach was as\r\nfanciful as Wolfe claims.  As a federal court sitting in\r\ndiversity, it is, of course, our task to interpret and apply as\r\nbest we can the state rules of decision.  See, e.g., Blinzler v. \r\nMarriott Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996).  Relying\r\non pronouncements of the state supreme court and, if these are not\r\nconclusive, on other instructive sources, ultimately \"our task is\r\nto ascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow\r\nunder the circumstances, even if our independent judgment on the\r\nquestion might differ.\"  Id.  So guided, we beat our way through\r\nthe thicket of Texas contract law to determine the validity of\r\nWolfe's charge.\r\nWolfe would plunge us deep into this briar patch by\r\nraising various complicated issues of contract interpretation.  He\r\nwould lead us close to cases limiting the significance of\r\nintegration clauses and canceling the strictures of the Statute of\r\nFrauds.  But we cannot be waylaid by such thorny issues; there is\r\na clearer path, and, although we could pick our way over Wolfe's\r\nobstacle course, we take the safer route.\r\nThus, the alleged oral modifications are unenforceable\r\nbecause they are not sufficiently definite to supply the terms of \r\na valid contract.  The terms of an alleged oral modification to an\r\nemployment contract must be definite enough to allow a court to\r\nknow what it is being asked to enforce.  See, e.g., Montgomery\r\nCounty Hosp. Dist. v. Brown, 965 S.W.2d 501, 502 (Tex. 1998);\r\nHathaway v. General Mills, Inc., 711 S.W.2d 227, 228-29 (Tex.\r\n1986); Botello v. Misener-Collins Co., Ltd., 469 S.W.2d 793, 795\r\n(Tex. 1971).  \"General statements\" and \"[g]eneral comments\" will\r\nnot do; an employee \"cannot construct [a formal agreement] out of\r\nindefinite comments, encouragements, or assurances.\"  Montgomery\r\nCounty, 965 S.W.2d at 502.  \"In order to be legally binding, a\r\ncontract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a court\r\ncan understand what the promisor undertook.\"  T.O. Stanley Boot\r\nCo., Inc. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992).\r\nHere, the district court's characterization of Wolfe's\r\nbreach claim as \"convoluted\" is a masterpiece of understatement.\r\nEven giving all reasonable inferences to Wolfe, as we must do on\r\nsummary judgment, the terms of the alleged oral modification are so \r\nindefinite and uncertain that Wolfe himself was unable to\r\narticulate exactly what he was owed and under what formula the\r\nextent of the deficit could be calculated.  His deposition\r\ntestimony is telling.  CVG questioned Wolfe about the basis for\r\nhis claim that he was owed bonus compensation:\r\n           Q.  Your claim for bonus, is that related to this\r\n  written employment agreement?\r\n           A.  Yes.\r\n           Q.  Is your claim for a bonus related to any other\r\n  agreement?\r\n           A.  The agreement we talked about the profit center\r\n  agreement.\r\n           Q.  Anything other than that?\r\n           A.  Not under claim for bonus, no.\r\n           Q.  And then you say there's a profit center agreement. \r\n  Is that separate from the bonus?\r\n           A.  No.  That's the same type program. . . .when\r\n  Mr. Kutsch asked me to go out and seek a lot of new\r\n  business on behalf of the company, he never\r\n  predicated my payment of bonus based upon the total\r\n  earnings of the corporation.  I was told I would be\r\n  paid based on my contribution to the company. . . .\r\n\nApp. 125-26.  Wolfe's deposition testimony regarding his\r\nunderstanding of the new bonus component was in the same vein:\r\n           A.  That particular program was an additional incentive\r\n  compensation program very similar to the program in\r\n  place at Vitol.  It was fashioned after the Vitol\r\n  plan, which effectively was a vesting program.  For\r\n  example, if my proportionate share of earnings\r\n  amounted to $100,000 over and above my participation\r\n  in the bonus plan, that $100,000 would be put into\r\n  [sic] my name in the vested program, of which I\r\n  would receive 25 percent in four annual\r\n  installments, and that would also be terminated at\r\n  any time if I left the company.  I would be -- there\r\n  would always be three years' payments that I would\r\n  never recover if I ever left.  So in effect over a\r\n  period of time -- let's say if you had four years in\r\n  a row, I mean, there could be sizeable sums of money\r\n  built up in a deferred account that if you ever left\r\n  the company you would walk away from.  The effect of\r\n  the program, to my understanding, was to make sure\r\n  that the employees had significant incentive not to\r\n  leave the company.\r\n           Q.  How would it be determined how much money any one\r\n  person would be entitled to under that?\r\n           A.  I don't recall specifically the allocation\r\n  procedures.  I believe it was 10 percent of the net\r\n  income.  10 to 20 percent of the net income of the\r\n  company was allocated to this type of program.  This\r\n  is in addition to other bonus programs.\r\n           Q.  This is apart from the bonus concept?\r\n           A.  That's correct.\r\n           Q.  Under this program, as you think you understand it,\r\n  when would the first payment have been made if you\r\n  had remained with Catex?\r\n           A.  I believe the first payment would be due at the end\r\n  of 1994.\r\n           Q.  And can you tell me again, as best you can, how that\r\n  payment would be determined?\r\n           A.  I don't recall specifically.  I think I gave you an\r\n  adequate explanation.\r\n\nApp. 129-30.  The questioning continued, and Wolfe was unable to be\r\nany more precise about the specifics of the contract he was seeking\r\nto enforce.\r\nThe documents are similarly devoid of detail.  The\r\nmemorandum -- entitled a \"Proposed ... Plan\" -- simply outlined\r\nscales.  For example, 25 percent of the deferred component (what\r\nWolfe calls the new bonus) would vest each year for four years from\r\nthe grant.  The minutes from the Board of Directors meeting at\r\nwhich the BIP was discussed indicate only that the Board \"agreed\"\r\nto the proposed scale as a means of creating an incentive for\r\ncertain employees.  Nothing in any document specifies what would be\r\npaid to whom and when it would be paid.  More, there is no\r\nevidence to suggest that CVG took any steps to provide for the\r\nimplementation of any of the components of the BIP outlined in the\r\nmemorandum.  The briefs and filings below are also less than\r\nilluminating. \r\nIn order to enforce the oral modifications, Wolfe asks us\r\nto fill in critical details.  We would have to decide, for example,\r\nwhat percentage of CVG's net income between 10 and 20 percent would\r\nbe allocated to the bonus program and, based on his \"contribution\r\nto the company,\" what part of that allotment CVG owed Wolfe.  This\r\nwe cannot do.  In the end, all of the sources which might flesh out\r\nthe terms of his alleged oral contract -- Wolfe's recollection of\r\nthe specifics of his agreement with Kutsch, the BIP memo, minutes\r\nfrom Board of Directors meetings, etc. -- provide nothing more than\r\ngeneral and indefinite comments.  Wolfe cannot forge a contract out\r\nof such hazy materials.  See, e.g., Montgomery County, 965 S.W.2d\r\nat 502; Hathaway, 711 S.W.2d at 228-29.  Accordingly, the oral\r\nmodifications are unenforceable.  We therefore affirm the district\r\ncourt's order of summary judgment in favor of Kutsch and CVG and\r\nagainst Wolfe on Wolfe's breach counter-claim.\r\n\nB.  Fraud in the Sale of Stock Rights\r\nWe also affirm the grant of summary judgment against\r\nWolfe on Wolfe's fraud counter-claim.  Wolfe alleges that Kutsch\r\nfraudulently represented that Kutsch's sale of 51 percent of his\r\nstock in the company would yield only $1 million when it in fact\r\nresulted in Kutsch's receiving more than $10 million.  Wolfe claims\r\nthat, in reliance on these false representations and under pressure\r\nfrom Kutsch, he executed the Release and Waiver. In so doing he\r\nallegedly relinquished his 2.5 percent stock interest in CVG for\r\nsubstantially less than its true value.  The district court\r\nexamined the language of the BGP and Release and concluded that\r\nneither vested any ownership interest in Wolfe.  It therefore held\r\nthat, even if Kutsch had fraudulently misrepresented the value of\r\nthe sale, Wolfe would be unable to show that he was injured -- he\r\nhad no stock rights to relinquish -- and summary judgment was in\r\norder.\r\nWe agree with the district court.  In order to prove\r\nactionable fraud, Wolfe must be able to show that Kutsch's conduct\r\ncaused him some harm.  If Wolfe did not own rights to stock in the\r\nfirst instance, Kutsch's representations about the value of the\r\nmerger, whether fraudulent or not, could not have injured him. \r\nThere is no fraud in being induced to relinquish something you do\r\nnot have.  See, e.g., Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp., 926 F.2d 109,\r\n111 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\nWolfe forfeited nothing.  None of the documents purports\r\nto directly vest in Wolfe an ownership interest in the company. \r\nIndeed, to the contrary, all of the evidence suggests that Wolfe\r\nnever owned any stock in Catamount or its successors.  Wolfe's\r\noriginal employment contract does not provide for an ownership\r\ninterest, and the first section of the BGP expressly states that\r\nits purpose was to create a financial incentive for participants\r\n\"without transferring to [the participants] ownership of any\r\ncapital stock of the Company.\"  (emphasis added).  Section 2(a) is\r\nalso unambiguous:  \"No ownership of any capital stock of the\r\nCompany will be transferred or otherwise granted to any employee of\r\nthe Company as a result of the designation or participation of such\r\nemployee as a Participant.\"\r\nAs before, Wolfe is not discouraged by the clear, written\r\nlanguage of documents he signed; he forges ahead, offering \r\nnumerous reasons why we should ignore this language.  Only one\r\nsuch reason merits our attention.  Wolfe argues that  11(d)of the\r\nBGP created \"tail rights\" which endured into 1993 and resulted in \r\nhis acquiring stock rights.  This argument suffers from many flaws. \r\nSection 11(d) provided that, if the BGP were terminated prior to\r\nthe end of a fiscal year and the stock sale compensation provision\r\nof  4(a) were triggered within a year of that termination, then\r\nformer BGP participants would be entitled to compensation as if the \r\nBGP were still active.  The BGP, however, was not terminated prior\r\nto the end of a fiscal year; rather, it simply expired after only\r\none year on December 31, 1992.  Kutsch never renewed the plan; he\r\nnever designated Participants for fiscal year 1993; and Wolfe (as\r\nwell as all the other former participants) never executed an\r\naccession agreement for 1993.  Moreover,  4(a) requires that \"all\r\nof the outstanding Common Stock of the Company [be sold] in a\r\nsingle transaction.\"  It is undisputed that Kutsch sold only 51\r\npercent of his stock in the company.  Thus, Wolfe's reliance on\r\n11(d) is to no avail.\r\n                    III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment to CVG and Kutsch both on their claims\r\nand on Wolfe's counter-claims.\r\n",

In 1994, Catex Vitol Gas,\r\nInc.(CVG) fired one of its executives, Stephen Wolfe.  Wolfe now\r\nappeals two orders granting summary judgment to CVG and its\r\npresident, Michael Kutsch, on claims and counter-claims related to\r\nhis termination.  We affirm both orders.\r\n                     I.\r\nIn 1991 Catamount, a Massachusetts natural gas company\r\nowned by Kutsch, hired Wolfe to open and manage a branch office in\r\nHouston.  With the advice of counsel, Wolfe negotiated and signed\r\nan employment contract.  The particulars of this contract are at\r\nissue here, so we recite them with some specificity. \r\nWolfe agreed to serve as a company Vice President from\r\nMarch 1, 1991 until February 28, 1992 (Initial Employment Period).\r\nAccording to  3 of the contract, Wolfe's tenure would \"continue\r\nfrom year to year thereafter and [could] be canceled by [Wolfe]\r\nupon thirty days prior written notice.\"  In consideration of his\r\nservices, the company paid Wolfe a $100,000 yearly base salary. \r\nAny increase in salary or additional compensation, such as a bonus,\r\nwas at the \"sole discretion\" of the company's Board of Directors. \r\nThe contract also outlined termination processes. \r\nSection 7.2 allowed Wolfe to terminate his employment \"upon the\r\nexpiration of the Initial Employment Period in accordance with the\r\nterms of this Agreement.\"  Section 7.1 permitted the company to end\r\nthe relationship\r\n           a) upon the expiration of the Initial\r\nEmployment Period in accordance with the\r\nterms of this Agreement, (b) at any time\r\nwithout notice for \"cause\" as defined\r\nbelow, (c) at any time without notice\r\nwithout cause, subject to section 7.5\r\nbelow, (d) upon the death of the Employee,\r\nor (e) in the event of the Employee's\r\ndisability  . . .\r\nSection 7.5 then defined what compensation would be due Wolfe upon\r\ntermination of his employment.  It provided in full:\r\n           Upon termination of the Employee's\r\nemployment with the Company in accordance\r\nwith clause (a), (b), (d) or (e) of\r\nSection 7.1, all compensation and benefits\r\nunder this Agreement will cease, effective\r\nthe date of termination.  Upon termination\r\nof the Employee's employment with the\r\nCompany in accordance with clause (c) of\r\nSection 7.1 prior to March 1, 1992, (\"the\r\nGuaranteed Payment Date\"), the Employee\r\nwill be paid his Base Salary through such\r\nGuaranteed Payment Date in accordance with\r\nthe Company's ordinary payroll practices. \r\nUpon termination of the Employee's\r\nemployment with the Company in accordance\r\nwith clause (c) of Section 7.1 after the\r\nGuaranteed Payment Date, the Employee will\r\nbe paid his Base Salary for thirty days\r\nafter such termination in accordance with\r\nthe Company's ordinary payroll practices. \r\nOther than as specifically set forth in\r\nthis Section 7.5 or as otherwise required\r\nby law, the Employee will not be entitled\r\nto receive any compensation or benefits\r\nafter termination of his employment with\r\nthe Company.\r\n\nThe contract also contained an integration clause,  11, which\r\nprovided:\r\n           This Agreement constitutes the entire\r\nAgreement between the parties with regard\r\nto the subject matter hereof, superseding\r\nall prior understandings and agreements,\r\nwhether written or oral.  This Agreement\r\nmay not be amended or revised except by a\r\nwriting signed by the parties.\r\n\nWolfe's tenure at Catamount proceeded without incident \r\nthrough the Initial Employment Period.  Wolfe traded natural gas\r\nfor the company out of its Houston office and frequently traveled\r\nto Boston to confer with colleagues.  In 1992, the company, by this\r\ntime re-named Catex Energy Inc., instituted a Bonus and Guaranty\r\nPlan (BGP) to provide \"an incentive to selected key employees of\r\nthe Company similar to that to be derived from holding shares of\r\nthe common stock, no par value per share (\"Common Stock\"), of the\r\nCompany, but without transferring to such employees ownership of\r\nany capital stock of the Company.\"  The BGP is also at issue here,\r\nso we limn its particulars as well.  \r\nThe BGP allowed Kutsch to designate participants for a\r\ngiven fiscal year and required each Participant to execute an\r\nAccession Agreement for that year.  Section 2(a) stated that \"No\r\nownership of any capital stock of the Company will be transferred\r\nor otherwise granted to any employee of the Company as a result of\r\nthe designation or participation of such employee as a\r\nParticipant.\"  In the event of the sale of \"all of the outstanding\r\nCommon Stock of the Company,\"  4(a) entitled BGP Participants to\r\nsome compensation which was to be determined by a precise formula. \r\nSection 11(d) further provided that if the BGP were terminated\r\nprior to the end of a fiscal year and  4(a)'s stock sale\r\ncompensation provision were triggered within a year of that\r\ntermination, Participants would be entitled to compensation as\r\nspecified.  Kutsch designated Wolfe as a BGP Participant for the\r\nfiscal year 1992, and on June 12, 1992, Wolfe executed an Accession\r\nAgreement in accordance with the terms of the BGP.  Wolfe never\r\nsigned an Accession Agreement for the fiscal year 1993.\r\nOn July 31, 1993, Kutsch sold 51 percent of Catex's\r\noutstanding stock, all of which he owned, to Vitol Holding SARL. \r\nPrior to the closing and to facilitate the deal, on July 29, 1993,\r\nWolfe signed a Release and Waiver in which Kutsch agreed to forgive\r\na $25,000 balance on a personal loan, and Wolfe \"irrevocably\r\nrelease[d] and discharge[d] each of the Company, Kutsch and Vitol\r\nfrom any and all liability of whatever description under or in\r\nconnection with the [BGP].\"  In the Release, Wolfe acknowledged\r\nthat he had reviewed acquisition documents which provided for a\r\n$1,000,000 payment to Kutsch, $75,000 of which was intended to be\r\ndivided among the three former BGP Participants.  Paragraph 1(e) of\r\nthe Release provided:\r\n           The Acquisition does not constitute a\r\nStock Sale (as defined in the [BGP]) or\r\nany other event or type of transaction\r\ncontemplated by the [BGP] to require any\r\npayment to Participants.  Moreover,\r\nneither the undersigned nor any other\r\nperson has been designated as a\r\nParticipant under the Plan for the\r\nCompany's fiscal year ending December 31,\r\n1993.  Nevertheless, Kutsch and the\r\nCompany have determined to treat the\r\n[$75,000] as if it were being paid\r\npursuant to the [BGP] and have undertaken\r\nin negotiating the [Acquisition] to ensure\r\ncontinuation after the Acquisition of the\r\nCompany's informal discretionary bonus\r\nprogram for key employees in a manner\r\nconsistent with the company's past\r\npractice.\r\n\nIn addition to signing this Release and Waiver, Wolfe initialed\r\nparagraph 1(e).  He consulted an attorney before executing this\r\nRelease.\r\nAt a CVG Board of Directors Meeting on December 9, 1993,\r\nthe four attendees, one of whom was Kutsch, discussed a\r\nBonus/Incentive Plan (BIP) for 1994.  The proposed program,\r\noutlined in a short memo for the meeting, involved a cash component\r\nlinked to CVG's income, a deferred component vesting over four\r\nyears and a stock component allowing Kutsch to grant CVG employees\r\noptions to purchase his stock in the company.  The minutes of this\r\nmeeting indicate that the Board of Directors believed that these\r\nproposals would create an incentive for \"key senior employees\" to\r\nstay with the company.  The Board apparently \"agreed\" to the bonus\r\nterms as outlined in the proposal memorandum.  Nothing in the\r\nrecord indicates whether CVG actually implemented the BIP or any of\r\nits several components.\r\nWolfe claims that in February or March 1994, Kutsch\r\napproached him about devoting more of his time to developing new\r\nbusiness.  In return, according to Wolfe, Kutsch promised Wolfe a\r\nnew method of compensation.  Wolfe alleges that he and Kutsch\r\nentered into an oral agreement, which changed Wolfe's bonus package\r\nby adding a \"profit center\" component, a \"new bonus\" concept and a\r\nvested ownership interest.  These elements, according to Wolfe's\r\ndescription, roughly correspond to the three component parts of the\r\nBIP.  This agreement also allegedly made parts of Wolfe's annual\r\nbonus mandatory rather than discretionary.  Wolfe claims that, in\r\nreliance on this oral contract, he largely abandoned the client\r\nbase he had spent three years developing in order to concentrate on\r\nbringing in new business for CVG.\r\nOn March 28, 1994, CVG fired Wolfe without cause.  This\r\ntermination was governed by  7(c) of Wolfe's original employment\r\ncontract which mandated that CVG pay Wolfe thirty days' base salary\r\nas severance pay.  CVG paid Wolfe ninety days' severance and\r\noffered to determine at the end of fiscal year 1994 whether Wolfe\r\nshould receive a bonus for the three months of work before his\r\ntermination.  Although his written contract did not so require, CVG\r\neventually granted such a bonus to Wolfe.\r\nApparently anticipating Wolfe's dissatisfaction with this\r\nseverance package, CVG filed a declaratory judgment action in\r\nMassachusetts state court seeking a determination that it did not\r\nowe Wolfe anything more.  Citing diversity of citizenship, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1332, Wolfe removed the case to federal court and counter-\r\nclaimed against CVG and Kutsch.  Wolfe first alleged that CVG had\r\nbreached a contract by failing to pay him the additional\r\ncompensation Kutsch had orally promised.  Wolfe also stated a claim\r\nsounding in fraud related to the Release and Waiver, contending\r\nthat Kutsch had misrepresented the value of the acquisition and\r\nfraudulently induced Wolfe to abandon his stock rights under the\r\nBGP.   CVG moved for summary judgment on both its original action\r\nand Wolfe's counter-claims.  In an order dated June 27, 1997, the\r\ndistrict court granted CVG's motion with respect to Wolfe's breach\r\ncount.  The court held that it could not enforce an oral\r\nmodification of a fully-integrated, written employment contract. \r\nThe court allowed discovery into Wolfe's fraud allegation.  About\r\na year later, in an order dated June 10, 1998, the district court\r\ngranted the remainder of CVG's motion for summary judgment.  It\r\nfound that Wolfe could have suffered no injury from the alleged\r\nfraud because, under the BGP and pursuant to the Release, he owned\r\nno stock rights.  Wolfe appeals both orders.\r\n                    II.\r\nWe review an order of summary judgment de novo, employing\r\nthe same standards as the district court and viewing all facts in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See, e.g.,\r\nHinchey v. Nynex Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197961\"><a href=\"/opinion/197961/hinchey-v-nynex/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  To\r\nsurvive a summary judgment motion, the non-moving party must\r\nproduce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material\r\nfact.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\r\nA.  Enforcement of the Oral Modification\r\nWolfe first challenges the district court's refusal to\r\nenforce the alleged oral modifications of his employment contract. \r\nHe asserts, in sum, that CVG owes him money pursuant to his\r\nagreement with Kutsch, which involved a profit center, a new bonus\r\nstructure and a vested ownership interest.  The district court\r\nlooked to the four corners of the contract, several provisions of\r\nwhich, it found, precluded enforcement of the alleged promises for\r\nadditional pay.  Section 7.5, for example, provides that if Wolfe\r\nwere terminated without cause (as defined in  7.2(c)) after the\r\nInitial Employment Period, as he was, then CVG owed him only thirty\r\ndays' base salary (it paid him ninety days') and any other \r\ncompensation expressly included in the written contract.  The\r\ndistrict court found no evidence that Wolfe's alleged bonuses had\r\nbeen incorporated in writing in the contract.  Further,  3\r\nprovided that all forms of compensation other than base salary were\r\nat the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.  Similarly,\r\nbecause none of the other alleged modifications was in writing, and\r\n11 of the contract expressly required modifications to be in\r\nwriting, the district court refused to enforce them.  Wolfe now\r\ncalls the district court's strict reliance on the language of the\r\nemployment contract an \"unfounded legal fiction.\"  Appellant's Br.\r\nat 25; see also Appellant's Reply Br. at 2.  \r\nUnder the principles of Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103012\"><a href=\"/opinion/103012/erie-r-co-v-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (1938), Texas law supplies the substantive framework\r\nfor determining whether the district court's approach was as\r\nfanciful as Wolfe claims.  As a federal court sitting in\r\ndiversity, it is, of course, our task to interpret and apply as\r\nbest we can the state rules of decision.  See, e.g., Blinzler v. \r\nMarriott Int'l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196700\"><a href=\"/opinion/196700/blinzler-v-marriott-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996).  Relying\r\non pronouncements of the state supreme court and, if these are not\r\nconclusive, on other instructive sources, ultimately \"our task is\r\nto ascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow\r\nunder the circumstances, even if our independent judgment on the\r\nquestion might differ.\"  Id.  So guided, we beat our way through\r\nthe thicket of Texas contract law to determine the validity of\r\nWolfe's charge.\r\nWolfe would plunge us deep into this briar patch by\r\nraising various complicated issues of contract interpretation.  He\r\nwould lead us close to cases limiting the significance of\r\nintegration clauses and canceling the strictures of the Statute of\r\nFrauds.  But we cannot be waylaid by such thorny issues; there is\r\na clearer path, and, although we could pick our way over Wolfe's\r\nobstacle course, we take the safer route.\r\nThus, the alleged oral modifications are unenforceable\r\nbecause they are not sufficiently definite to supply the terms of \r\na valid contract.  The terms of an alleged oral modification to an\r\nemployment contract must be definite enough to allow a court to\r\nknow what it is being asked to enforce.  See, e.g., Montgomery\r\nCounty Hosp. Dist. v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1722522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1722522/montgomery-county-hosp-dist-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (Tex. 1998);\r\nHathaway v.

His deposition\r\ntestimony is telling.  CVG questioned Wolfe about the basis for\r\nhis claim that he was owed bonus compensation:\r\n           Q.  Your claim for bonus, is that related to this\r\n  written employment agreement?\r\n           A.  Yes.\r\n           Q.  Is your claim for a bonus related to any other\r\n  agreement?\r\n           A.  The agreement we talked about the profit center\r\n  agreement.\r\n           Q.  Anything other than that?\r\n           A.  Not under claim for bonus, no.\r\n           Q.  And then you say there's a profit center agreement. \r\n  Is that separate from the bonus?\r\n           A.  No.  That's the same type program. . . .when\r\n  Mr. Kutsch asked me to go out and seek a lot of new\r\n  business on behalf of the company, he never\r\n  predicated my payment of bonus based upon the total\r\n  earnings of the corporation.  I was told I would be\r\n  paid based on my contribution to the company. . . .\r\n\nApp. 125-26.  Wolfe's deposition testimony regarding his\r\nunderstanding of the new bonus component was in the same vein:\r\n           A.  That particular program was an additional incentive\r\n  compensation program very similar to the program in\r\n  place at Vitol.  It was fashioned after the Vitol\r\n  plan, which effectively was a vesting program.  For\r\n  example, if my proportionate share of earnings\r\n  amounted to $100,000 over and above my participation\r\n  in the bonus plan, that $100,000 would be put into\r\n  [sic] my name in the vested program, of which I\r\n  would receive 25 percent in four annual\r\n  installments, and that would also be terminated at\r\n  any time if I left the company.  I would be -- there\r\n  would always be three years' payments that I would\r\n  never recover if I ever left.  So in effect over a\r\n  period of time -- let's say if you had four years in\r\n  a row, I mean, there could be sizeable sums of money\r\n  built up in a deferred account that if you ever left\r\n  the company you would walk away from.  The effect of\r\n  the program, to my understanding, was to make sure\r\n  that the employees had significant incentive not to\r\n  leave the company.\r\n           Q.  How would it be determined how much money any one\r\n  person would be entitled to under that?\r\n           A.  I don't recall specifically the allocation\r\n  procedures.  I believe it was 10 percent of the net\r\n  income.  10 to 20 percent of the net income of the\r\n  company was allocated to this type of program.  This\r\n  is in addition to other bonus programs.\r\n           Q.  This is apart from the bonus concept?\r\n           A.  That's correct.\r\n           Q.  Under this program, as you think you understand it,\r\n  when would the first payment have been made if you\r\n  had remained with Catex?\r\n           A.  I believe the first payment would be due at the end\r\n  of 1994.\r\n           Q.  And can you tell me again, as best you can, how that\r\n  payment would be determined?\r\n           A.  I don't recall specifically.  I think I gave you an\r\n  adequate explanation.\r\n\nApp. 129-30.  The questioning continued, and Wolfe was unable to be\r\nany more precise about the specifics of the contract he was seeking\r\nto enforce.\r\nThe documents are similarly devoid of detail.  The\r\nmemorandum -- entitled a \"Proposed ... Plan\" -- simply outlined\r\nscales.  For example, 25 percent of the deferred component (what\r\nWolfe calls the new bonus) would vest each year for four years from\r\nthe grant.  The minutes from the Board of Directors meeting at\r\nwhich the BIP was discussed indicate only that the Board \"agreed\"\r\nto the proposed scale as a means of creating an incentive for\r\ncertain employees.  Nothing in any document specifies what would be\r\npaid to whom and when it would be paid.  More, there is no\r\nevidence to suggest that CVG took any steps to provide for the\r\nimplementation of any of the components of the BIP outlined in the\r\nmemorandum.  The briefs and filings below are also less than\r\nilluminating. \r\nIn order to enforce the oral modifications, Wolfe asks us\r\nto fill in critical details.  We would have to decide, for example,\r\nwhat percentage of CVG's net income between 10 and 20 percent would\r\nbe allocated to the bonus program and, based on his \"contribution\r\nto the company,\" what part of that allotment CVG owed Wolfe.  This\r\nwe cannot do.  In the end, all of the sources which might flesh out\r\nthe terms of his alleged oral contract -- Wolfe's recollection of\r\nthe specifics of his agreement with Kutsch, the BIP memo, minutes\r\nfrom Board of Directors meetings, etc. -- provide nothing more than\r\ngeneral and indefinite comments.  Wolfe cannot forge a contract out\r\nof such hazy materials.  See, e.g., Montgomery County, 965 S.W.2d\r\nat 502; Hathaway, 711 S.W.2d at 228-29.  Accordingly, the oral\r\nmodifications are unenforceable.  We therefore affirm the district\r\ncourt's order of summary judgment in favor of Kutsch and CVG and\r\nagainst Wolfe on Wolfe's breach counter-claim.\r\n\nB.  Fraud in the Sale of Stock Rights\r\nWe also affirm the grant of summary judgment against\r\nWolfe on Wolfe's fraud counter-claim.  Wolfe alleges that Kutsch\r\nfraudulently represented that Kutsch's sale of 51 percent of his\r\nstock in the company would yield only $1 million when it in fact\r\nresulted in Kutsch's receiving more than $10 million.  Wolfe claims\r\nthat, in reliance on these false representations and under pressure\r\nfrom Kutsch, he executed the Release and Waiver. In so doing he\r\nallegedly relinquished his 2.5 percent stock interest in CVG for\r\nsubstantially less than its true value.  The district court\r\nexamined the language of the BGP and Release and concluded that\r\nneither vested any ownership interest in Wolfe.  It therefore held\r\nthat, even if Kutsch had fraudulently misrepresented the value of\r\nthe sale, Wolfe would be unable to show that he was injured -- he\r\nhad no stock rights to relinquish -- and summary judgment was in\r\norder.\r\nWe agree with the district court.  In order to prove\r\nactionable fraud, Wolfe must be able to show that Kutsch's conduct\r\ncaused him some harm.  If Wolfe did not own rights to stock in the\r\nfirst instance, Kutsch's representations about the value of the\r\nmerger, whether fraudulent or not, could not have injured him. \r\nThere is no fraud in being induced to relinquish something you do\r\nnot have.  See, e.g., Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556402\"><a href=\"/opinion/556402/richard-c-powers-v-boston-cooper-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n111 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\nWolfe forfeited nothing.  None of the documents purports\r\nto directly vest in Wolfe an ownership interest in the company. \r\nIndeed, to the contrary, all of the evidence suggests that Wolfe\r\nnever owned any stock in Catamount or its successors.  Wolfe's\r\noriginal employment contract does not provide for an ownership\r\ninterest, and the first section of the BGP expressly states that\r\nits purpose was to create a financial incentive for participants\r\n\"without transferring to [the participants] ownership of any\r\ncapital stock of the Company.\"  (emphasis added).  Section 2(a) is\r\nalso unambiguous:  \"No ownership of any capital stock of the\r\nCompany will be transferred or otherwise granted to any employee of\r\nthe Company as a result of the designation or participation of such\r\nemployee as a Participant.\"\r\nAs before, Wolfe is not discouraged by the clear, written\r\nlanguage of documents he signed; he forges ahead, offering \r\nnumerous reasons why we should ignore this language.  Only one\r\nsuch reason merits our attention.  Wolfe argues that  11(d)of the\r\nBGP created \"tail rights\" which endured into 1993 and resulted in \r\nhis acquiring stock rights.  This argument suffers from many flaws. \r\nSection 11(d) provided that, if the BGP were terminated prior to\r\nthe end of a fiscal year and the stock sale compensation provision\r\nof  4(a) were triggered within a year of that termination, then\r\nformer BGP participants would be entitled to compensation as if the \r\nBGP were still active.  The BGP, however, was not terminated prior\r\nto the end of a fiscal year; rather, it simply expired after only\r\none year on December 31, 1992.  Kutsch never renewed the plan; he\r\nnever designated Participants for fiscal year 1993; and Wolfe (as\r\nwell as all the other former participants) never executed an\r\naccession agreement for 1993.  Moreover,  4(a) requires that \"all\r\nof the outstanding Common Stock of the Company [be sold] in a\r\nsingle transaction.\"  It is undisputed that Kutsch sold only 51\r\npercent of his stock in the company.  Thus, Wolfe's reliance on\r\n11(d) is to no avail.\r\n                    III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment to CVG and Kutsch both on their claims\r\nand on Wolfe's counter-claims.\r\n</pre>",
