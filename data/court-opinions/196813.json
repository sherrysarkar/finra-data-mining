Ruben  Santana Diaz appeals  from the\r                                \r\r\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of his petition  under 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2255.  We affirm for the reasons given briefly below.\r\n\n          1.   Santana did not raise his claim that the trial\r\n\ncourt's failure  to order  identification or production  of a\r\n\nconfidential informant  prejudiced his  ability to assert  an\r\n\nentrapment  defense in his direct appeal.   See United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256, 259 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n506 U.S. 876 (1992).  Failure to raise a constitutional claim\r\n\non  direct  appeal  ordinarily  bars  raising  the  issue  on\r\n\ncollateral attack  unless the  petitioner can show  cause for\r\n\nthe failure and actual prejudice from the alleged trial court\r\n\nerror.   See Knight v.  United States, 37 F.3d  769, 774 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1994).  \r\n\n          As  cause, Santana asserts  his appellate counsel's\r\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.   However, as the district\r\n\ncourt  correctly  concluded  in  resolving  that  issue,  the\r\n\nfailure to  obtain the confidential  informant's testimony at\r\n\ntrial  did  not  prejudice  Santana's ability  to  assert  an\r\n\nentrapment defense.   Even assuming that  the informant would\r\n\nhave  testified as  Santana suggests,  at most  his testimony\r\n\nwould  have established  only one  element of  the entrapment\r\n\ndefense -- that the government induced Santana to participate\r\n\nin  the drug  deal  in question.    To assert  an  entrapment\r\n\ndefense, however, Santana also had to establish at trial that\r\n\nhe  was  not predisposed  to commit  his  crime.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nStates v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256,  259 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 506 U.S. 876 (1992).    As we held on  direct appeal,\r                  \r\n\nhe never did so.  Id. at 259-60.  \r                                 \r\n\n          2.  Santana  bears the burden  of showing that  the\r\n\ncourt vindictively sentenced him  for exercising his right to\r\n\na jury trial, as he claims.   United States v. Mena-Robles, 4\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1026, 1037  (1st Cir.  1993), cert. denied,  114 S.  Ct.\r                                                           \r\n\n1550 (1994).   He  has not  pointed to  any statement by  the\r\n\ndistrict court or any other evidence suggesting that there is\r\n\na \"reasonable likelihood\" that he received a harsher sentence\r\n\nthan he otherwise  would have because he went to  trial so as\r\n\nto trigger a  presumption of  vindictiveness.  See  id.   The\r                                                                   \r\n\nmere  fact  that  co-defendants, who  pled  guilty,  received\r\n\nlesser sentences does  not show that it  is reasonably likely\r\n\nthat Santana  was vindictively sentenced.   Id.   Hence,  the\r                                                           \r\n\nclaim of vindictive sentencing fails.  Id.  \r                                                      \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
