In the district  court Michael\r                                       \r\n\nIndelicato pled  guilty to various charges  of possession and\r\n\ndistribution  of cocaine,  conspiracy to  distribute cocaine,\r\n\nwire  fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    371,  1343; 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1), 846, 853.   He\r\n\nwas tried on four related charges of possessing  firearms and\r\n\nammunition,  having  previously  been convicted  of  a  crime\r\n\npunishable by  more than  one year  in prison.   18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n922(g)(1).  In a  jury-waived trial on stipulated facts,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court found  Indelicato guilty  on those  counts as\r\n\nwell.  United States v. Indelicato, 887 F. Supp. 23 (D. Mass.\r                                              \r\n\n1995).  Indelicato now appeals from these firearms possession\r\n\nconvictions and from his sentence on the drug counts.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The background  facts are  easily summarized.   In 1993,\r\n\nIndelicato  pled  guilty  in  Massachusetts  state  court  to\r\n\nassault  and battery with  a knife  and carrying  a dangerous\r\n\nweapon (the knife).  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265,   13A; ch. 269,\r\n\n  10(b).  The  state court ultimately sentenced him to a one-\r\n\nyear  suspended sentence  and  $7,500  in restitution,  which\r\n\nIndelicato paid.  Both  offenses are misdemeanors under state\r\n\nlaw but punishable by a maximum  of two and one-half years in\r\n\nprison.\r\n\n     On May 7, 1994, federal agents arrested Indelicato.  The\r\n\nagents searched his home and place of business and found four\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nfirearms (including an Uzi semiautomatic weapon) and numerous\r\n\nforms   of  ammunition.     The  ensuing  indictment  charged\r\n\nIndelicato, among  other offenses, with  violating 18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person \"who  has\r\n\nbeen  convicted  in  any  court of,  a  crime  punishable  by\r\n\nimprisonment for a  term exceeding one year . .  . to ship or\r\n\ntransport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or\r\n\naffecting commerce,  any  firearm or  ammunition  . .  .  .\"1\r\n\nIndelicato   stipulated   that   the    interstate   commerce\r\n\nrequirement was satisfied.\r\n\n     However, 18  U.S.C.     921(a)(20)  excludes  from  this\r\n\ncategory \"[a]ny  conviction which  has been expunged,  or set\r\n\naside or  for which  a person  has been pardoned  or has  had\r\n\ncivil rights restored . .  . unless such pardon, expungement,\r\n\nor restoration  of civil  rights expressly provides  that the\r\n\nperson   may  not  ship,   transport,  possess,   or  receive\r\n\nfirearms.\"   At trial, Indelicato argued  that this exclusion\r\n\napplied  to him  because  Massachusetts never  took away  his\r\n\ncivil rights and because  he suffered no restrictions  on his\r\n\nstate firearms privileges.\r\n\n     The district court rejected Indelicato's argument, quite\r\n\nproperly relying upon United States v. Ramos, 961 F.2d  1003,\r                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     118 U.S.C.   921(a)(20)(B)  excludes from this  category\r\npersons convicted of state  misdemeanors punishable by a term\r\nof  imprisonment of  two years  or less.   Because  his state\r\ncrimes carried a larger  maximum sentence, Indelicato did not\r\nfall within this exception.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n1007-10 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506  U.S. 934 (1992), which\r                                            \r\n\nheld  that   rights  never   taken  away  cannot   have  been\r\n\n\"restored.\"     Long  after  the   district  court  sentenced\r\n\nIndelicato,  this court  (in February  1996) sitting  en banc\r                                                                         \r\n\nannounced  its decision in United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1,\r                                                             \r\n\n5-6  (1st  Cir.) (en  banc), cert.  denied,  116 S.  Ct. 2569\r                                                      \r\n\n(1996),  which  overruled  Ramos  on a  different  issue  and\r                                            \r\n\nexplicitly reserved judgment  on whether  civil rights  never\r\n\ntaken away could be \"restored.\"\r\n\n     At Indelicato's  sentencing in July  1995, the  district\r\n\ncourt imposed concurrent terms  of 168 months imprisonment on\r\n\nthe  cocaine counts  (based primarily  on the  weight of  the\r\n\ndrugs), 120 months on the firearms possession counts, and  60\r\n\nmonths on  the fraud counts,  as well as  supervised release,\r\n\nfines, assessments and forfeitures.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     Our  principal  concern  on  this  appeal  is  with  the\r\n\nfirearms  possession counts,  which present  an issue  of law\r\n\nthat we review de  novo.  As originally  enacted in 1968,  18\r                                   \r\n\nU.S.C.    922(g)(1)  made criminal  gun possession  by anyone\r\n\npreviously  convicted  of  a crime  (the  predicate  offense)\r\n\npunishable  by more  than one year  of imprisonment,  but the\r\n\nstatute  allowed   an   exception  for   state   misdemeanors\r\n\npunishable by two years or less of imprisonment.  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n921(a)(20).  In 1983, the Supreme Court held that a predicate\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\noffense under  section 922(g) is defined by  federal law, and\r\n\nthat state expunctions of state convictions did not avoid the\r\n\nban of section 922(g)(1).  Dickerson v. New Banner Institute,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 460 U.S. 103, 111-12, 115 (1983).\r                \r\n\n     Congress  reacted  to  Dickerson  and  like  rulings  by\r                                                 \r\n\nenacting  in 1986  the Firearms  Owners' Protection  Act, 100\r\n\nStat.   449,  which   in  pertinent   part  amended   section\r\n\n921(a)(20)'s  definition   of   predicate  offenses.      The\r\n\namendment, which remains in effect today, provides that state\r\n\nlaw  defines what  constitutes  a predicate  \"conviction\" for\r\n\npurposes  of section  922(g)(1) and  other provisions  of the\r\n\nstatute.    It  also  excludes  convictions  that  have  been\r\n\n\"expunged\" or \"set aside,\"  or for which the person  has been\r\n\n\"pardoned\" or \"has had civil  rights restored.\"  Congress has\r\n\nprovided no definition of \"civil rights\" or \"restored.\" \r\n\n     The  main  issue for  us  is whether  the  \"civil rights\r\n\nrestored\"  provision in section 921(a)(20)  protects one who,\r\n\nlike  Indelicato, never  had his  civil rights taken  away at\r\n\nall.  It is common ground that misdemeanants in Massachusetts\r\n\ndo  not lose the  rights that we and  most courts describe as\r\n\n\"civil rights\" under  the statute:   the rights  to vote,  to\r\n\nserve  on a jury, and to hold  public office.  Caron, 77 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  2.  But the  government argues, based  on plain language,\r\n\nthat a defendant cannot have \"restored\" to him what the state\r\n\nnever took away. \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     The  issue  is difficult  because  it  pits the  literal\r\n\nlanguage  of   the   statute  against   Congress'   perceived\r\n\nrationale.    Clearly  the   ordinary  reading  of  the  word\r\n\n\"restored\" supports the  government.  This  court so held  in\r\n\nRamos, 961 F.2d  at 1007-08, although over  a strong dissent,\r                 \r\n\nand the  Second  Circuit  followed  Ramos on  this  issue  in\r                                                     \r\n\nMcGrath  v. United States, 60 F.3d 1005, 1007 (2d Cir. 1995),\r                                     \r\n\ncert.  denied, 116  S. Ct.  929 (1996).   But  there  are two\r                         \r\n\ndifferent  reasons  why  we are  not  inclined  to  treat the\r\n\nliteral language  as precluding further  inquiry, quite apart\r\n\nfrom the determination of the en banc court in Caron treating\r                                                                \r\n\nthe present issue as an open one in this circuit.  See Caron,\r                                                                        \r\n\n77 F.3d at 5-6.2\r\n\n     First,  a ready  explanation exists  why Congress  might\r\n\nhave used  the term  \"restored\" without intending  to exclude\r\n\npersons like Indelicato.  The incidents that gave rise to the\r\n\namendment  (in  particular,  Dickerson),  and  what  Congress\r                                                  \r\n\nthought to  be the ordinary case, involved the deprivation of\r\n\ncivil  rights and  their  subsequent  restoration  (e.g.,  by\r                                                                    \r\n\npardon).  Indeed,  there is no indication in  the legislative\r\n\nhistory  that Congress gave any attention to the rare case in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Although we  think that  Caron  frees us  to treat  the\r                                                \r\nissue  as open despite Ramos, we have taken the precaution of\r                                        \r\ncirculating this opinion  in advance to all  of the circuit's\r\nactive judges.  This informal circulation does not preclude a\r\npetition   for   rehearing   or   suggestion   of   en   banc\r                                                                         \r\nreconsideration. See Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera\r                                                                         \r\nVazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 9 n.5 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                   \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nwhich someone convicted of a serious crime would not lose one\r\n\nor more of the three civil rights that have been used by most\r\n\ncourts as touchstones under this section.\r\n\n     Second, as  explained later in this opinion,  it is hard\r\n\nto  find any reason why  Congress would have  wished to adopt\r\n\nthe  distinction now  urged  by the  government.   In  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Cassidy, 899 F.2d  543, 549 n.13  (6th Cir. 1990),\r                              \r\n\nthe Sixth  Circuit went so far  as to say that  there was \"no\r\n\nrational basis\"  for  distinguishing between  a criminal  who\r\n\nnever lost his civil  rights and one who had  them taken away\r\n\nand  then  restored by  statute.   As  the Supreme  Court has\r\n\nreminded us, \"[l]ooking beyond the naked text for guidance is\r\n\nperfectly  proper when  the result  it apparently  decrees is\r\n\ndifficult  to  fathom or  where  it  seems inconsistent  with\r\n\nCongress' intention . . . .\"  Public Citizen v. Department of\r                                                                         \r\n\nJustice, 491 U.S. 440, 455 (1989).\r                   \r\n\n     Where  language  is  not  conclusive,  courts  turn   to\r\n\nlegislative history and purpose.   Most broadly, it has  been\r\n\nsuggested   that   Congress'   main   purpose   in   enacting\r\n\nsection 921(a)(20) was to let the states decide who may carry\r\n\nguns.   E.g., United States v. Bost, 87 F.3d 1333, 1334 (D.C.\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1996);  Caron, 77  F.3d at  3; Ramos,  961 F.2d  at 1011\r                                                     \r\n\n(Torruella, J.,  dissenting).   If so,  it might  follow that\r\n\nMassachusetts--having declined to restrict the gun possession\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nrights  of misdemeanants  like  Indelicato--should  have  its\r\n\npreference followed as a matter of course.\r\n\n     This is  too sweeping  a contention.   Congress  in 1986\r\n\ndeliberately gave  the states much latitude  to determine who\r\n\nwould fall under the ban of  the federal statute; but it  did\r\n\nnot give the states carte blanche as  to the manner of making\r                                             \r\n\nthis  determination.   Rather, Congress  created a  structure\r\n\nthat  allows  the  state  to  make  this   decision  only  in\r\n\nmechanically defined ways--such as by expungement  or setting\r\n\naside of a conviction, pardon or restoration of civil rights.\r\n\nFor instance, if  a state  does not restore  a felon's  civil\r\n\nrights  but expressly  allows  him to  possess firearms,  the\r\n\nfelon  may still  be  prosecuted under  the federal  statute.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Thomas,  991 F.2d  206, 214-15  (5th Cir.),\r                                    \r\n\ncert. denied, 510 U.S. 1014 (1993).\r                        \r\n\n     Although Congress did not  specify which civil rights it\r\n\nhad  in  mind,  the   plurality  view  among  the  circuits--\r\n\nexplicitly adopted  by this court in  Caron--is that Congress\r                                                       \r\n\nhad in mind  the core  cluster of \"citizen\"  rights that  are\r\n\ntypically lost by felons and restored by pardons, namely, the\r\n\nright to vote, to serve on  a jury and to hold public office.\r\n\nCaron, 77  F.3d at 2.   Indeed,  when the Senate  debated the\r                 \r\n\namendment,  Senator  Sasser  noted  that  under  the  federal\r\n\nstatute, convicted  felons \"lose most  civil rights--to vote,\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nhold  office, and  so  on .  . .  .\"   131 Cong.  Rec. 18,182\r\n\n(1985).\r\n\n     To key the  federal statute to these  civil rights makes\r\n\nsense only on  one assumption: that  Congress thought of  the\r\n\nattribution of these rights as expressing \"a state's judgment\r\n\nthat  a particular person or  class of persons  is, despite a\r\n\nprior   conviction,   sufficiently  trustworthy   to  possess\r\n\nfirearms.\"  McGrath, 60  F.3d at 1009.  Accord  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Meeks, 987  F.2d 575,  578 (9th Cir.),  cert. denied,  510\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 919  (1993).  This \"trustworthiness\"  rationale is about\r\n\nthe  best that  we  or anyone  else  has managed  to  explain\r\n\nCongress' approach.\r\n\n     The tightest application of this rationale might suggest\r\n\nthat  Congress intended  to  allow  firearms possession  only\r\n\nwhere a state has made an individualized decision  to restore\r                                                    \r\n\ncivil rights as, for  example, by an individual pardon.   But\r\n\nthe    statute   contains   no    explicit   requirement   of\r\n\nindividualized  action.   And this  court in  Caron, together\r                                                               \r\n\nwith  most  other circuits,  see 77  F.3d  at 2  n.1,  4, has\r                                            \r\n\nrejected such a requirement of individualized action.\r\n\n     If individualized action is not  required, it is hard to\r\n\nsee why Congress would wish to distinguish between one  whose\r\n\ncivil rights were never taken away (Indelicato) and one whose\r\n\ncivil rights  were mechanically taken  away and  mechanically\r\n\nrestored.  The  government has supplied  no such reason,  nor\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nhas  any  court done  so.   The  distinction  could certainly\r\n\ncreate an anomalous  result in various situations, such  as a\r\n\njurisdiction  that did  not deprive  a misdemeanant  of civil\r\n\nrights but took away the rights of a felon and  then restored\r\n\nthem  by statute on the felon's completion of his prison term\r\n\nand period of supervision.\r\n\n     The  government's  best  argument, ad  hominem  but  not\r                                                               \r\n\nwithout force, is that Indelicato is a perfect example of the\r\n\nkind of  previously convicted criminal who ought to be barred\r\n\nfrom  possessing  a firearm.    Indelicato  had earlier  been\r\n\nconvicted of an assault with a  knife; he was engaged in drug\r\n\noperations;  and  his  collection of  weapons  and ammunition\r\n\nprovided ample reason to  think that he was a  very dangerous\r\n\nman.    Yet  because   Massachusetts  law  does  not  deprive\r\n\nIndelicato  of his  civil  rights, Indelicato  can do  what a\r\n\nfederally convicted forger could not.\r\n\n     But  the ad  hominem  argument is  somewhat  misleading.\r                                     \r\n\nIndelicato is  already serving  a very long  federal sentence\r\n\nfor the drug offenses; and if civil rights were not deemed to\r\n\nbe  \"restored\" to him, neither would they be restored to some\r\n\nother misdemeanant  in Massachusetts whose crime  might be so\r\n\npacific that  no one would  think that  it made any  sense to\r\n\ndeprive  him of the opportunity  to possess a  firearm.  See,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g., Mass. Gen.

But Ramos' decision on\r                                                            \r\n\nthe point  at issue  drew some of  its force  from its  other\r\n\nholding  that  Congress had  intended  restoration  to be  an\r\n\nindividualized decision--a  defensible position, but  one now\r\n\nrejected by Caron and  most other circuits.  As  for McGrath,\r                                                                        \r\n\nit  must be  set against  the contrary  views of  three other\r\n\ncircuits--the Fifth,  Sixth and Tenth.

Ultimately, there  can be\r\n\nno  perfect answer on a point that Congress did not consider.\r\n\n     The issue before us  is unlikely to matter outside  of a\r\n\nvery few states.   Most states do take  away from every felon\r\n\nat least one of  the three civil rights in question.  Vermont\r\n\n(the  subject of McGrath)  appears to be one  of the very few\r                                    \r\n\nstates  where a  felon does  not lose at  least one  of these\r\n\nrights  upon  conviction; and  even  Vermont  preserves those\r\n\nrights only  for a  felon who  is not  actually incarcerated,\r\n\nMcGrath, 60 F.3d at 1007 &amp;  n.2.  And most circuits have held\r                   \r\n\nthat all three  civil rights  must be restored  to avoid  the\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nfederal  ban.3   Thus,  actual  restoration is  likely  to be\r\n\nrequired in most cases.\r\n\n     Conversely,  misdemeanants  are  normally  free  of  the\r\n\nfederal ban by virtue of a different exception in the federal\r\n\nstatute (see  note 1,  above) save  where the  misdemeanor is\r                        \r\n\npunishable by more  than two years  in prison.   This too  is\r\n\nunusual,  the  traditional  distinction  between  felony  and\r\n\nmisdemeanor being the potential for  a sentence of more  than\r\n\none year.  W. LaFave &amp; A.

This does not  preclude the possibility\r\n\nthat  when  Congress  understands  the  implications  of  its\r\n\nstatute  for  a problem  it did  not  foresee, it  may prefer\r\n\nanother result.\r\n\n     We conclude, therefore, that Indelicato's  civil rights,\r\n\nto  the extent  that they  were never  taken away,  should be\r\n\ntreated as  \"restored\" for  purposes of the  federal statute.\r\n\nHere,  the   government   concedes  that   misdemeanants   in\r\n\nMassachusetts do  not lose their civil rights.

It  is patent that  Congress as a\r\n\nwhole did not appreciate the great variety  and complexity of\r\n\nstate  provisions that would have  to be meshed  with the new\r\n\nfederal statute or the odd results that would follow.  One of\r\n\nthe senators  made  this  very  point,  but  only  after  the\r\n\namendment  had   passed.    132  Cong.   Rec.  28,488  (1986)\r\n\n(statement of Sen. Durenberger).\r\n\n     Yet, the  proliferated case law, the  conflicts, and the\r\n\nutter  waste of time incurred by courts and litigants are all\r\n\nsecondary reasons for revision.  The main reason for Congress\r\n\nto revisit  the statute is that  it does not do  the job that\r\n\nCongress  expected it to do in reliably sorting out those who\r\n\npresent  a  special   danger--and  warrant  special   federal\r\n\nrestrictions  on possession  of firearms--from  those who  do\r\n\nnot.   Wherever  one  chooses  to  draw  the  line  (and  the\r\n\nconflicting  policies  are  for  Congress  to  balance),  the\r\n\npresent line is too ragged and erratic to protect the public.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n     At sentencing in July  1995, Indelicato conceded that he\r\n\nreceived about  35 kilograms of cocaine  from Amilcar Antonio\r\n\nImbert, as  supported by  evidence from  beeper records.   He\r\n\ndisputed Imbert's testimony that Imbert had delivered cocaine\r\n\nto Indelicato  on many different occasions,  including a ten-\r\n\nkilogram  transaction, and  argued that  the total  amount of\r\n\ncocaine  that he purchased was  less than 50  kilograms.  The\r\n\ndistrict court concluded that the amount of drugs exceeded 50\r\n\nkilograms,   and   sentenced   Indelicato   to   168   months\r\n\nimprisonment  on   the  drug  counts,  the   minimum  of  the\r\n\napplicable range for this quantity.\r\n\n     On appeal,  Indelicato continues to dispute the quantity\r\n\nof  cocaine attributed  to him.   But a review  of the record\r\n\nindicates that  the government  presented enough  evidence to\r\n\nsupport the district court's finding (which need be only by a\r\n\npreponderance)  that  Indelicato   purchased  more  than   50\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine  from Imbert.   Indelicato  conceded 35\r\n\nkilograms, although  the more accurate estimate  by the judge\r\n\nof the sales recorded by beeper  records was 36.25 kilograms.\r\n\nImbert  also   testified  that  he  sold   ten  kilograms  to\r\n\nIndelicato on  one occasion that  would not have  appeared in\r\n\nthe beeper records.  \r\n\n     The question, then, is whether  the district court had a\r\n\nsufficient basis for finding an additional four kilograms not\r\n\nrepresented  in the  beeper  records.   The court  concluded,\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nbased  on Imbert's  testimony,  that Imbert  sold cocaine  to\r\n\nIndelicato several  times each month for  at least one-and-a-\r\n\nhalf months  prior to the  beeper records and  independent of\r\n\nthe  ten-kilogram  sale.   Imbert  also said  that  each sale\r\n\ninvolved  whole kilograms  (or  more) or  large fractions  of\r\n\nkilograms.   We think that these  multiple deliveries of such\r\n\nquantities over the course of six weeks provides a sufficient\r\n\nbasis  for the conclusion  that at least  four more kilograms\r\n\nshould be attributed to Indelicato.\r\n\n     Credibility   judgments  at  sentencing  are  the  trial\r\n\njudge's province, United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1995),  and the  fact that  the district  judge rejected\r\n\nsome of Imbert's testimony as not credible does not mean that\r\n\nshe could not credit other aspects of his testimony.  Because\r\n\nthe district court's findings for sentencing were not clearly\r\n\nerroneous, e.g., United  States v. Wihbey,  75 F.3d 761,  776\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996), we affirm the drug quantity determination.\r\n\n     The defendant's  convictions and sentence  for violating\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) are  vacated; his sentence on  the drug\r                                              \r\n\ncounts is affirmed; and the  case is remanded for entry of  a\r                                                         \r\n\nmodified judgment consistent with this opinion.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n",

The ensuing indictment charged Indelicato, among other offenses, with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person \"who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Indelicato stipulated that the interstate commerce requirement was satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20) excludes from this category \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"   At trial, Indelicato argued that this exclusion applied to him because Massachusetts never took away his civil rights and because he suffered no restrictions on his state firearms privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Indelicato's argument, quite properly relying upon United States v. Ramos, 961 F.2d 1003, 1007-10 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 934, 113 S.Ct. 364, 121 L.Ed.2d 277 (1992), which held that rights never taken away cannot have been \"restored.\"   Long after the district court sentenced Indelicato, this court (in February 1996) sitting en banc announced its decision in United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.)  (en banc ), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2569, 135 L.Ed.2d 1085 (1996), which overruled Ramos on a different issue and explicitly reserved judgment on whether civil rights never taken away could be \"restored.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Indelicato's sentencing in July 1995, the district court imposed concurrent terms of 168 months imprisonment on the cocaine counts (based primarily on the weight of the drugs), 120 months on the firearms possession counts, and 60 months on the fraud counts, as well as supervised release, fines, assessments and forfeitures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our principal concern on this appeal is with the firearms possession counts, which present an issue of law that we review de novo.   As originally enacted in 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) made criminal gun possession by anyone previously convicted of a crime (the predicate offense) punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, but the statute allowed an exception for state misdemeanors punishable by two years or less of imprisonment.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  In 1983, the Supreme Court held that a predicate offense under section 922(g) is defined by federal law, and that state expunctions of state convictions did not avoid the ban of section 922(g)(1).  Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 111-12, 115, 103 S.Ct. 986, 991-92, 993, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress reacted to Dickerson and like rulings by enacting in 1986 the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, 100 Stat. 449, which in pertinent part amended section 921(a)(20)'s definition of predicate offenses.  The amendment, which remains in effect today, provides that state law defines what constitutes a predicate \"conviction\" for purposes of section 922(g)(1) and other provisions of the statute.  It also excludes convictions that have been \"expunged\" or \"set aside,\" or for which the person has been \"pardoned\" or \"has had civil rights restored.\"   Congress has provided no definition of \"civil rights\" or \"restored.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main issue for us is whether the \"civil rights restored\" provision in section 921(a)(20) protects one who, like Indelicato, never had his civil rights taken away at all.  It is common ground that misdemeanants in Massachusetts do not lose the rights that we and most courts describe as \"civil rights\" under the statute:  the rights to vote, to serve on a jury, and to hold public office.  Caron, 77 F.3d at 2.   But the government argues, based on plain language, that a defendant cannot have \"restored\" to him what the state never took away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is difficult because it pits the literal language of the statute against Congress' perceived rationale.  Clearly the ordinary reading of the word \"restored\" supports the government.  This court so held in Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1007-08, although over a strong dissent, and the Second Circuit followed Ramos on this issue in McGrath v. United States, 60 F.3d 1005, 1007 (2d Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 929, 133 L.Ed.2d 857 (1996).  But there are two different reasons why we are not inclined to treat the literal language as precluding further inquiry, quite apart from the determination of the en banc court in Caron treating the present issue as an open one in this circuit.  See Caron, 77 F.3d at 5-6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a ready explanation exists why Congress might have used the term \"restored\" without intending to exclude persons like Indelicato.  The incidents that gave rise to the amendment (in particular, Dickerson ), and what Congress thought to be the ordinary case, involved the deprivation of civil rights and their subsequent restoration (e.g., by pardon).  Indeed, there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress gave any attention to the rare case in which someone convicted of a serious crime would not lose one or more of the three civil rights that have been used by most courts as touchstones under this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as explained later in this opinion, it is hard to find any reason why Congress would have wished to adopt the distinction now urged by the government.  In United States v. Cassidy, 899 F.2d 543, 549 n. 13 (6th Cir.1990), the Sixth Circuit went so far as to say that there was \"no rational basis\" for distinguishing between a criminal who never lost his civil rights and one who had them taken away and then restored by statute.  As the Supreme Court has reminded us, \"[l]ooking beyond the naked text for guidance is perfectly proper when the result it apparently decrees is difficult to fathom or where it seems inconsistent with Congress' intention....\"  Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 2567, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where language is not conclusive, courts turn to legislative history and purpose.  Most broadly, it has been suggested that Congress' main purpose in enacting section 921(a)(20) was to let the states decide who may carry guns.  E.g., United States v. Bost, 87 F.3d 1333, 1334 (D.C.Cir.1996);  Caron, 77 F.3d at 3;  Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1011 (Torruella, J., dissenting).  If so, it might follow that Massachusetts--having declined to restrict the gun possession rights of misdemeanants like Indelicato--should have its preference followed as a matter of course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is too sweeping a contention.  Congress in 1986 deliberately gave the states much latitude to determine who would fall under the ban of the federal statute;  but it did not give the states carte blanche as to the manner of making this determination.  Rather, Congress created a structure that allows the state to make this decision only in mechanically defined ways--such as by expungement or setting aside of a conviction, pardon or restoration of civil rights.  For instance, if a state does not restore a felon's civil rights but expressly allows him to possess firearms, the felon may still be prosecuted under the federal statute.  United States v. Thomas, 991 F.2d 206, 214-15 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1014, 114 S.Ct. 607, 126 L.Ed.2d 572 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Congress did not specify which civil rights it had in mind, the plurality view among the circuits--explicitly adopted by this court in Caron--is that Congress had in mind the core cluster of \"citizen\" rights that are typically lost by felons and restored by pardons, namely, the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to hold public office.  Caron, 77 F.3d at 2.   Indeed, when the Senate debated the amendment, Senator Sasser noted that under the federal statute, convicted felons \"lose most civil rights--to vote, hold office, and so on....\"  131 Cong.  Rec. 18,182 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To key the federal statute to these civil rights makes sense only on one assumption:  that Congress thought of the attribution of these rights as expressing \"a state's judgment that a particular person or class of persons is, despite a prior conviction, sufficiently trustworthy to possess firearms.\"  McGrath, 60 F.3d at 1009.   Accord United States v. Meeks, 987 F.2d 575, 578 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 919, 114 S.Ct. 314, 126 L.Ed.2d 261 (1993).  This \"trustworthiness\" rationale is about the best that we or anyone else has managed to explain Congress' approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tightest application of this rationale might suggest that Congress intended to allow firearms possession only where a state has made an individualized decision to restore civil rights as, for example, by an individual pardon.  But the statute contains no explicit requirement of individualized action.  And this court in Caron, together with most other circuits, see 77 F.3d at 2 n. 1, 4, has rejected such a requirement of individualized action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If individualized action is not required, it is hard to see why Congress would wish to distinguish between one whose civil rights were never taken away (Indelicato) and one whose civil rights were mechanically taken away and mechanically restored.  The government has supplied no such reason, nor has any court done so.  The distinction could certainly create an anomalous result in various situations, such as a jurisdiction that did not deprive a misdemeanant of civil rights but took away the rights of a felon and then restored them by statute on the felon's completion of his prison term and period of supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's best argument, ad hominem but not without force, is that Indelicato is a perfect example of the kind of previously convicted criminal who ought to be barred from possessing a firearm.  Indelicato had earlier been convicted of an assault with a knife;  he was engaged in drug operations;  and his collection of weapons and ammunition provided ample reason to think that he was a very dangerous man.  Yet because Massachusetts law does not deprive Indelicato of his civil rights, Indelicato can do what a federally convicted forger could not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the ad hominem argument is somewhat misleading.  Indelicato is already serving a very long federal sentence for the drug offenses;  and if civil rights were not deemed to be \"restored\" to him, neither would they be restored to some other misdemeanant in Massachusetts whose crime might be so pacific that no one would think that it made any sense to deprive him of the opportunity to possess a firearm.  See, e.g., Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 56, &#167; 50 (alteration of ballots).  Congress can fix the flaws in the present statute;  we cannot do so without creating other flaws and the possibility of some new injustice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that our conclusion is contrary to two very able opinions--our own circuit's earlier two-to-one decision on this issue in Ramos and the Second Circuit's decision in McGrath, relying directly upon Ramos.   But Ramos ' decision on the point at issue drew some of its force from its other holding that Congress had intended restoration to be an individualized decision--a defensible position, but one now rejected by Caron and most other circuits.  As for McGrath, it must be set against the contrary views of three other circuits--the Fifth, Sixth and Tenth.  Thomas, 991 F.2d at 212;  Cassidy, 899 F.2d at 549 n. 13;  United States v. Hall, 20 F.3d 1066, 1069 (10th Cir.1994). Ultimately, there can be no perfect answer on a point that Congress did not consider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue before us is unlikely to matter outside of a very few states.  Most states do take away from every felon at least one of the three civil rights in question.  Vermont (the subject of McGrath ) appears to be one of the very few states where a felon does not lose at least one of these rights upon conviction;  and even Vermont preserves those rights only for a felon who is not actually incarcerated, McGrath, 60 F.3d at 1007 &amp; n. 2.   And most circuits have held that all three civil rights must be restored to avoid the federal ban.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, actual restoration is likely to be required in most cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, misdemeanants are normally free of the federal ban by virtue of a different exception in the federal statute (see note 1, above) save where the misdemeanor is punishable by more than two years in prison.  This too is unusual, the traditional distinction between felony and misdemeanor being the potential for a sentence of more than one year.  W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, 1 Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 1.6, at 41 (1986).  This does not preclude the possibility that when Congress understands the implications of its statute for a problem it did not foresee, it may prefer another result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that Indelicato's civil rights, to the extent that they were never taken away, should be treated as \"restored\" for purposes of the federal statute.  Here, the government concedes that misdemeanants in Massachusetts do not lose their civil rights.  Accord Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1008.   Nor are we concerned with the exception to the exception--the \"expressly provides\" proviso at the end of section 921(a)(20)--for the government also concedes that Massachusetts does not restrict a misdemeanant's rights to \"ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this case illustrates all too well, the federal statute, as now drafted, gives rise to a host of difficult and obscure issues that Congress ought to resolve by reexamining this statute.  It is patent that Congress as a whole did not appreciate the great variety and complexity of state provisions that would have to be meshed with the new federal statute or the odd results that would follow.  One of the senators made this very point, but only after the amendment had passed.  132 Cong.  Rec. 28,488 (1986) (statement of Sen.  Durenberger).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, the proliferated case law, the conflicts, and the utter waste of time incurred by courts and litigants are all secondary reasons for revision.  The main reason for Congress to revisit the statute is that it does not do the job that Congress expected it to do in reliably sorting out those who present a special danger--and warrant special federal restrictions on possession of firearms--from those who do not.  Wherever one chooses to draw the line (and the conflicting policies are for Congress to balance), the present line is too ragged and erratic to protect the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing in July 1995, Indelicato conceded that he received about 35 kilograms of cocaine from Amilcar Antonio Imbert, as supported by evidence from beeper records.  He disputed Imbert's testimony that Imbert had delivered cocaine to Indelicato on many different occasions, including a ten-kilogram transaction, and argued that the total amount of cocaine that he purchased was less than 50 kilograms.  The district court concluded that the amount of drugs exceeded 50 kilograms, and sentenced Indelicato to 168 months imprisonment on the drug counts, the minimum of the applicable range for this quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Indelicato continues to dispute the quantity of cocaine attributed to him.  But a review of the record indicates that the government presented enough evidence to support the district court's finding (which need be only by a preponderance) that Indelicato purchased more than 50 kilograms of cocaine from Imbert.  Indelicato conceded 35 kilograms, although the more accurate estimate by the judge of the sales recorded by beeper records was 36.25 kilograms.  Imbert also testified that he sold ten kilograms to Indelicato on one occasion that would not have appeared in the beeper records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the district court had a sufficient basis for finding an additional four kilograms not represented in the beeper records.  The court concluded, based on Imbert's testimony, that Imbert sold cocaine to Indelicato several times each month for at least one-and-a-half months prior to the beeper records and independent of the ten-kilogram sale.  Imbert also said that each sale involved whole kilograms (or more) or large fractions of kilograms.  We think that these multiple deliveries of such quantities over the course of six weeks provides a sufficient basis for the conclusion that at least four more kilograms should be attributed to Indelicato.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Credibility judgments at sentencing are the trial judge's province, United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995), and the fact that the district judge rejected some of Imbert's testimony as not credible does not mean that she could not credit other aspects of his testimony.  Because the district court's findings for sentencing were not clearly erroneous, e.g., United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 776 (1st Cir.1996), we affirm the drug quantity determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's convictions and sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) are vacated;  his sentence on the drug counts is affirmed;  and the case is remanded for entry of a modified judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20)(B) excludes from this category persons convicted of state misdemeanors punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.

He was tried on four related charges of possessing firearms and ammunition, having previously been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).  In a jury-waived trial on stipulated facts, the district court found Indelicato guilty on those counts as well.  United States v.

The ensuing indictment charged Indelicato, among other offenses, with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful for any person \"who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Indelicato stipulated that the interstate commerce requirement was satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20) excludes from this category \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored ... unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"   At trial, Indelicato argued that this exclusion applied to him because Massachusetts never took away his civil rights and because he suffered no restrictions on his state firearms privileges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Indelicato's argument, quite properly relying upon United States v.

As originally enacted in 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) made criminal gun possession by anyone previously convicted of a crime (the predicate offense) punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, but the statute allowed an exception for state misdemeanors punishable by two years or less of imprisonment.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  In 1983, the Supreme Court held that a predicate offense under section 922(g) is defined by federal law, and that state expunctions of state convictions did not avoid the ban of section 922(g)(1).  Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110876\"><a href=\"/opinion/110876/dickerson-v-new-banner-institute-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 111-12, 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110876\"><a href=\"/opinion/110876/dickerson-v-new-banner-institute-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The amendment, which remains in effect today, provides that state law defines what constitutes a predicate \"conviction\" for purposes of section 922(g)(1) and other provisions of the statute.  It also excludes convictions that have been \"expunged\" or \"set aside,\" or for which the person has been \"pardoned\" or \"has had civil rights restored.\"   Congress has provided no definition of \"civil rights\" or \"restored.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main issue for us is whether the \"civil rights restored\" provision in section 921(a)(20) protects one who, like Indelicato, never had his civil rights taken away at all.  It is common ground that misdemeanants in Massachusetts do not lose the rights that we and most courts describe as \"civil rights\" under the statute:  the rights to vote, to serve on a jury, and to hold public office.  Caron, 77 F.3d at 2.   But the government argues, based on plain language, that a defendant cannot have \"restored\" to him what the state never took away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is difficult because it pits the literal language of the statute against Congress' perceived rationale.  Clearly the ordinary reading of the word \"restored\" supports the government.  This court so held in Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1007-08, although over a strong dissent, and the Second Circuit followed Ramos on this issue in McGrath v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700445\"><a href=\"/opinion/700445/james-mcgrath-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1007 (2d Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></span> (1996).  But there are two different reasons why we are not inclined to treat the literal language as precluding further inquiry, quite apart from the determination of the en banc court in Caron treating the present issue as an open one in this circuit.  See Caron, 77 F.3d at 5-6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a ready explanation exists why Congress might have used the term \"restored\" without intending to exclude persons like Indelicato.  The incidents that gave rise to the amendment (in particular, Dickerson ), and what Congress thought to be the ordinary case, involved the deprivation of civil rights and their subsequent restoration (e.g., by pardon).  Indeed, there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress gave any attention to the rare case in which someone convicted of a serious crime would not lose one or more of the three civil rights that have been used by most courts as touchstones under this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as explained later in this opinion, it is hard to find any reason why Congress would have wished to adopt the distinction now urged by the government.  In United States v. Cassidy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538852\"><a href=\"/opinion/538852/united-states-v-calvin-cassidy/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 549 n. 13 (6th Cir.1990), the Sixth Circuit went so far as to say that there was \"no rational basis\" for distinguishing between a criminal who never lost his civil rights and one who had them taken away and then restored by statute.  As the Supreme Court has reminded us, \"[l]ooking beyond the naked text for guidance is perfectly proper when the result it apparently decrees is difficult to fathom or where it seems inconsistent with Congress' intention....\"  Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112305\"><a href=\"/opinion/112305/public-citizen-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 455, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112305\"><a href=\"/opinion/112305/public-citizen-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span> (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where language is not conclusive, courts turn to legislative history and purpose.  Most broadly, it has been suggested that Congress' main purpose in enacting section 921(a)(20) was to let the states decide who may carry guns.  E.g., United States v. Bost, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721287\"><a href=\"/opinion/721287/united-states-v-michael-t-bost/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></a></span>, 1334 (D.C.Cir.1996);  Caron, 77 F.3d at 3;  Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1011 (Torruella, J., dissenting).  If so, it might follow that Massachusetts--having declined to restrict the gun possession rights of misdemeanants like Indelicato--should have its preference followed as a matter of course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is too sweeping a contention.  Congress in 1986 deliberately gave the states much latitude to determine who would fall under the ban of the federal statute;  but it did not give the states carte blanche as to the manner of making this determination.  Rather, Congress created a structure that allows the state to make this decision only in mechanically defined ways--such as by expungement or setting aside of a conviction, pardon or restoration of civil rights.  For instance, if a state does not restore a felon's civil rights but expressly allows him to possess firearms, the felon may still be prosecuted under the federal statute.  United States v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604852\"><a href=\"/opinion/604852/united-states-v-henry-david-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 214-15 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1014</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Caron, 77 F.3d at 2.   Indeed, when the Senate debated the amendment, Senator Sasser noted that under the federal statute, convicted felons \"lose most civil rights--to vote, hold office, and so on....\"  131 Cong.  Rec. 18,182 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To key the federal statute to these civil rights makes sense only on one assumption:  that Congress thought of the attribution of these rights as expressing \"a state's judgment that a particular person or class of persons is, despite a prior conviction, sufficiently trustworthy to possess firearms.\"  McGrath, 60 F.3d at 1009.   Accord United States v. Meeks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601564\"><a href=\"/opinion/601564/united-states-v-john-morgan-meeks/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 578 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></span> (1993).  This \"trustworthiness\" rationale is about the best that we or anyone else has managed to explain Congress' approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tightest application of this rationale might suggest that Congress intended to allow firearms possession only where a state has made an individualized decision to restore civil rights as, for example, by an individual pardon.  But the statute contains no explicit requirement of individualized action.  And this court in Caron, together with most other circuits, see 77 F.3d at 2 n. 1, 4, has rejected such a requirement of individualized action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If individualized action is not required, it is hard to see why Congress would wish to distinguish between one whose civil rights were never taken away (Indelicato) and one whose civil rights were mechanically taken away and mechanically restored.  The government has supplied no such reason, nor has any court done so.  The distinction could certainly create an anomalous result in various situations, such as a jurisdiction that did not deprive a misdemeanant of civil rights but took away the rights of a felon and then restored them by statute on the felon's completion of his prison term and period of supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's best argument, ad hominem but not without force, is that Indelicato is a perfect example of the kind of previously convicted criminal who ought to be barred from possessing a firearm.  Indelicato had earlier been convicted of an assault with a knife;  he was engaged in drug operations;  and his collection of weapons and ammunition provided ample reason to think that he was a very dangerous man.  Yet because Massachusetts law does not deprive Indelicato of his civil rights, Indelicato can do what a federally convicted forger could not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the ad hominem argument is somewhat misleading.  Indelicato is already serving a very long federal sentence for the drug offenses;  and if civil rights were not deemed to be \"restored\" to him, neither would they be restored to some other misdemeanant in Massachusetts whose crime might be so pacific that no one would think that it made any sense to deprive him of the opportunity to possess a firearm.  See, e.g., Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 56, &#167; 50 (alteration of ballots).  Congress can fix the flaws in the present statute;  we cannot do so without creating other flaws and the possibility of some new injustice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that our conclusion is contrary to two very able opinions--our own circuit's earlier two-to-one decision on this issue in Ramos and the Second Circuit's decision in McGrath, relying directly upon Ramos.   But Ramos ' decision on the point at issue drew some of its force from its other holding that Congress had intended restoration to be an individualized decision--a defensible position, but one now rejected by Caron and most other circuits.  As for McGrath, it must be set against the contrary views of three other circuits--the Fifth, Sixth and Tenth.  Thomas, 991 F.2d at 212;  Cassidy, 899 F.2d at 549 n. 13;  United States v. Hall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666944\"><a href=\"/opinion/666944/united-states-v-walter-clinton-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span>, 1069 (10th Cir.1994). Ultimately, there can be no perfect answer on a point that Congress did not consider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue before us is unlikely to matter outside of a very few states.  Most states do take away from every felon at least one of the three civil rights in question.  Vermont (the subject of McGrath ) appears to be one of the very few states where a felon does not lose at least one of these rights upon conviction;  and even Vermont preserves those rights only for a felon who is not actually incarcerated, McGrath, 60 F.3d at 1007 &amp; n. 2.   And most circuits have held that all three civil rights must be restored to avoid the federal ban.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, actual restoration is likely to be required in most cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, misdemeanants are normally free of the federal ban by virtue of a different exception in the federal statute (see note 1, above) save where the misdemeanor is punishable by more than two years in prison.  This too is unusual, the traditional distinction between felony and misdemeanor being the potential for a sentence of more than one year.  W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, 1 Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 1.6, at 41 (1986).  This does not preclude the possibility that when Congress understands the implications of its statute for a problem it did not foresee, it may prefer another result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that Indelicato's civil rights, to the extent that they were never taken away, should be treated as \"restored\" for purposes of the federal statute.  Here, the government concedes that misdemeanants in Massachusetts do not lose their civil rights.  Accord Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1008.   Nor are we concerned with the exception to the exception--the \"expressly provides\" proviso at the end of section 921(a)(20)--for the government also concedes that Massachusetts does not restrict a misdemeanant's rights to \"ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this case illustrates all too well, the federal statute, as now drafted, gives rise to a host of difficult and obscure issues that Congress ought to resolve by reexamining this statute.  It is patent that Congress as a whole did not appreciate the great variety and complexity of state provisions that would have to be meshed with the new federal statute or the odd results that would follow.  One of the senators made this very point, but only after the amendment had passed.  132 Cong.  Rec. 28,488 (1986) (statement of Sen.  Durenberger).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, the proliferated case law, the conflicts, and the utter waste of time incurred by courts and litigants are all secondary reasons for revision.  The main reason for Congress to revisit the statute is that it does not do the job that Congress expected it to do in reliably sorting out those who present a special danger--and warrant special federal restrictions on possession of firearms--from those who do not.  Wherever one chooses to draw the line (and the conflicting policies are for Congress to balance), the present line is too ragged and erratic to protect the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing in July 1995, Indelicato conceded that he received about 35 kilograms of cocaine from Amilcar Antonio Imbert, as supported by evidence from beeper records.  He disputed Imbert's testimony that Imbert had delivered cocaine to Indelicato on many different occasions, including a ten-kilogram transaction, and argued that the total amount of cocaine that he purchased was less than 50 kilograms.  The district court concluded that the amount of drugs exceeded 50 kilograms, and sentenced Indelicato to 168 months imprisonment on the drug counts, the minimum of the applicable range for this quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Indelicato continues to dispute the quantity of cocaine attributed to him.  But a review of the record indicates that the government presented enough evidence to support the district court's finding (which need be only by a preponderance) that Indelicato purchased more than 50 kilograms of cocaine from Imbert.  Indelicato conceded 35 kilograms, although the more accurate estimate by the judge of the sales recorded by beeper records was 36.25 kilograms.  Imbert also testified that he sold ten kilograms to Indelicato on one occasion that would not have appeared in the beeper records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the district court had a sufficient basis for finding an additional four kilograms not represented in the beeper records.  The court concluded, based on Imbert's testimony, that Imbert sold cocaine to Indelicato several times each month for at least one-and-a-half months prior to the beeper records and independent of the ten-kilogram sale.  Imbert also said that each sale involved whole kilograms (or more) or large fractions of kilograms.  We think that these multiple deliveries of such quantities over the course of six weeks provides a sufficient basis for the conclusion that at least four more kilograms should be attributed to Indelicato.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Credibility judgments at sentencing are the trial judge's province, United States v.
