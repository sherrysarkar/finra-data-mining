We will not\r\nsecond-guess the district court's negative assessment of\r\ndefendant's credibility, and there was adequate support for the\r\nconclusion that defendant had not truthfully provided all his\r\ninformation.  Accordingly, the district court had sufficient\r\ngrounds to refuse the safety valve.  See United States v. Montanez,\r\n82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc.
