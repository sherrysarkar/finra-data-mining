Key Bank, 906 F.  Supp.\r\n\n13, \r               16-17 \r                     (D. \r                        Me. \r                            1995), \r                                   the complexity of this case compels us\r\n\nto sketch the necessary background information.\r\n\n          In 1983, Consumers  Water Company (\"CWC\")  acquired\r\n\nSchiavi Homes Corporation (\"SHC\"), a profitable Maine  mobile\r\n\nhome sales  business, from John  Schiavi (\"Schiavi\").   Under\r\n\nCWC's ownership, SHC continued  to operate successfully.   In\r\n\n1985, John Palmer (\"Palmer\") became SHC's new president.   In\r\n\nAugust 1985,  Palmer and his  wife, Mary  Anna, also  founded\r\n\nPalmer Development Corporation (\"Palmer Development\").   Like\r\n\nSHC, Palmer Development engaged in the sale of mobile homes \r\n\nthroughout Maine.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          In 1985, the Penobscot Indian Nation (\"PIN\")  hired\r\n\nTribal  Assets Management  (\"TAM\") to  locate, evaluate,  and\r\n\nrecommend potential investment opportunities.  Late in  1986,\r\n\nTAM \r               identified SHC as a potential PIN investment and conducted\r\n\na \r             detailed \r                      analysis \r                              of \r                                 SHC's viability as a successful business\r\n\nventure.    TAM  alerted PIN  that  SHC  constituted  a  good\r\n\ninvestment possibility, but cautioned PIN that the success of\r\n\nthe \r               venture \r                       would \r                            depend \r                                   largely on PIN's willingness to invest\r\n\nin new mobile home sites on which the mobile homes it sold to\r\n\nretail  customers  could  be  located.    PIN  expressed  its\r\n\nwillingness \r                       to use its lands and invest its resources for such\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          On  December 31,  1986, PIN  and Palmer  Management\r\n\nCorporation \r                       (\"Palmer \r                               Management\"), a corporation formed for the\r\n\npurpose of purchasing  SHC, executed a Partnership  Agreement\r\n\ncreating \r                    Schiavi Homes (\"Schiavi Homes\" or \"the Partnership\"),\r\n\na Maine  limited partnership.   Pursuant  to the  Partnership\r\n\nAgreement, PIN  became the  sole limited  partner and  Palmer\r\n\nManagement the sole general partner.1  PIN acquired a  ninety\r\n\npercent \r                   interest in Schiavi Homes.  Palmer Management received\r\n\nonly a  ten percent share but  secured full control over  all\r\n\nmanagement decisions.\r\n\n1.  Prior to the purchase, TAM informed PIN that Palmer had\r\nbeen the president of SHC.  PIN also knew both that Palmer\r\nand his wife owned Palmer Development and that Palmer\r\nDevelopment engaged in business activities similar to those\r\nof SHC.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Also on December 31, 1986, the Partnership executed\r\n\na \r             Purchase \r                      and Sale Agreement with SHC, which provided for the\r\n\nPartnership's  purchase of  SHC's  assets  and  business  for\r\n\napproximately $5  million.  Key  Bank of  Maine (\"Key  Bank\")\r\n\nfinanced \r                    the \r                        purchase on the condition that Palmer retain full\r\n\nmanagement \r                      control over Schiavi Homes.  Key Bank also insisted\r\n\nthat \r                PIN \r                    post a $1 million letter of credit to secure its loan\r\n\nand agree  to restrictions on  the withdrawal  of funds  from\r\n\nSchiavi Homes.\r\n\n          As part  of its  purchase of  SHC, the  Partnership\r\n\nsecured three non-competition agreements.  CWC entered into a\r\n\nnon-competition agreement with Schiavi Homes and assigned  to\r\n\nthe Partnership its  interest in an existing  non-competition\r\n\nagreement  with Schiavi,  which it  obtained at  the time  it\r\n\noriginally acquired  the business.   Palmer signed a  similar\r\n\nagreement with the Partnership.\r\n\n          Schiavi Homes  fared  poorly  from  its  inception.\r\n\nAlthough sales of mobile  homes in Maine reached an all  time\r\n\nhigh \r                during \r                       this \r                           time, \r                                 by the end of 1987 Schiavi Homes' market\r\n\nshare had declined from eighteen to eight percent.  Over  the\r\n\ncourse  of  its  three  year  existence,  PIN  made   several\r\n\ninvestments \r                       in \r                         Schiavi \r                                 Homes in an attempt to buoy its business\r\n\nfortunes.  Most significantly, in October 1987, PIN signed  a\r\n\nLease-Option  Agreement with  Schiavi Homes  leasing for  the\r\n\nnominal fee of $1 per  year a twenty-four acre tract of  real\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nproperty \r                    (the \r                        \"Holden \r                                Lot\") that PIN purchased during this same\r\n\n onth. \r                   \r                   The \r                      Lease-Option \r                                   Agreement afforded the Partnership the\r\n\noption\r            m       to  purchase  the  Holden  Lot  for  $100,000.    PIN\r\n\nsubsequently invested approximately  $135,000 to develop  the\r\n\nHolden Lot  for purposes of the  Schiavi Homes business.   In\r\n\nDecember 1988, with Schiavi Homes unable to make its  regular\r\n\nmonthly \r                   loan \r                        payment \r                               of \r                                  principal and interest to Key Bank, the\r\n\nPartnership pledged the Lease-Option Agreement to Key Bank.\r\n\n          In April 1989, acting on the advice of its counsel,\r\n\nBernstein, \r                      Shur, Sawyer &amp; Nelson (\"Bernstein\"), PIN decided to\r\n\nliquidate \r                     Schiavi Homes.  As part of the liquidation plan, PIN\r\n\nand Palmer then assigned Schiavi Homes' assets to Key Bank.\r\n\nIn \r              May \r                  1989, \r                       Key \r                           Bank \r                                notified PIN that it intended to exercise\r\n\nthe purchase option contained in the Lease-Option Agreement.2\r\n\nAt \r              this \r                   time, \r                        Key \r                            Bank \r                                 also initiated three foreclosure actions\r\n\nwith respect to real property that the Partnership owned  and\r\n\nencumbered \r                      with \r                          mortgage \r                                   deeds given to Key Bank in conjunction\r\n\nwith the initial financing of SHC's purchase.\r\n\n          On  September  29,  1989,  PIN  entered  into   two\r\n\ncomprehensive\r                         Settlement Agreements with Schiavi, SHC, Schiavi\r\n\n2.  \r\nThe Area Director of the Eastern Area Office of the Bureau of\r\nIndian Affairs, George Big Eagle, approved the transfer of\r\nthe Holden Lot to Key Bank pursuant to Title IV of the Indian\r\nFinancing Act of 1974, 25 U.S.C. SS 1451-1543, which forbids,\r\nwithout written consent, any transfer or disposal of a\r\nproject being improved with federal grant funds within three\r\nyears of the use of such funds.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nHomes, \r                  Palmer, \r                         Palmer \r                                Management, Key Bank, Burlington Homes of\r\n\nNew England3  (\"Burlington  Homes\"),  and  CWC  (collectively\r\n\n\"Appellees\").  PIN,  Schiavi Homes,  Schiavi, Palmer,  Palmer\r\n\nManagement,  and  Key  Bank  executed  the  first  Settlement\r\n\nAgreement (\"first Settlement Agreement\"); PIN, Schiavi Homes,\r\n\nSHC, Palmer, Palmer Management, Key Bank, CWC, and Burlington\r\n\nHomes  executed  the  second  Settlement  Agreement  (\"second\r\n\nSettlement \r                      Agreement\"). \r                                   \r                                   The two agreements contained identical\r\n\nlanguage that served broadly to \"release, remise and  forever\r\n\ndischarge\" \r                      all \r                         claims \r                                involving the signatories.  Subsequent to\r\n\nthe \r               signing \r                       of \r                         the \r                             two \r                                 Settlement Agreements, legal proceedings\r\n\nderiving from the operation of Schiavi Homes ceased.\r\n\n          The ensuing period of  calm ended on September  14,\r\n\n1994, \r                 when \r                      PIN \r                         filed \r                               the \r                                   lawsuit underlying this appeal.  PIN's\r\n\nsuit stemmed from an  investigation of Key Bank's  activities\r\n\nrelating \r                    to \r                       Schiavi Homes that Penobscot County Deputy Sheriff\r\n\nCarl Andrews conducted between approximately 1993 and  1994.4\r\n\n3.  Burlington Homes of New England, a subsidiary of CWC,\r\nmanufactured mobile homes.  SHC, Schiavi Homes, and Palmer\r\nDevelopment all sold homes that Burlington manufactured.\r\n\n4.  The record does not reveal the exact duration, scope, or\r\nfindings of the investigation.  Andrews testified that he\r\nprovided the Maine Attorney General's office with a three\r\npage report summarizing his findings, but he did not divulge\r\nthe report's contents to PIN.  No party submitted this report\r\ninto evidence; in fact, it is not apparent from the record\r\nthat the results of the investigation were set out in writing\r\nor were made known to the public.  It is clear, however, that\r\nno criminal proceedings of any kind resulted from Andrews'\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nPIN alleges that Andrews' investigation revealed  substantial\r\n\nimproprieties on the part of PIN's business associates in the\r\n\nSchiavi Homes venture.  Also on September 14, 1994, PIN  held\r\n\ntwo press  conferences,  one in  Bangor,  Maine, and  one  in\r\n\nPortland, Maine,  to announce the  filing of  its lawsuit  in\r\n\nfederal  district  court.    Michael  Marcello,  PIN's  media\r\n\nrelations \r                     consultant, \r                                prepared the statements that PIN Governor\r\n\nReuben Phillips and  PIN Lieutenant Governor Gerald  Pardilla\r\n\nread at the two press conferences.  Marcello also distributed\r\n\nthe text of the statements to members of the media.\r\n\n          PIN's \r                           complaint contained nine counts and named nine\r\n\ndefendants.  Most importantly for our purposes, the complaint\r\n\nalleged that the two Settlement Agreements signed by PIN  and\r\n\nthe  Appellees were  void because  they did  not receive  the\r\n\nSecretary of the Interior's approval pursuant to 25 U.S.C.  S\r\n\n81.5  SHC filed a motion to dismiss PIN's claims.  Key  Bank,\r\n\nSchiavi, Palmer, Palmer Development, Palmer Management,  CWC,\r\n\nand Burlington Homes moved for summary judgment.\r\n\n5.  PIN's complaint also alleged the following:  (1) breach\r\nof duty of good faith and fair dealing (against Key Bank,\r\nCWC, SHC, Burlington, Schiavi, Palmer, and Palmer\r\nManagement); (2) breach of contract (against Schiavi); (3)\r\nmisrepresentation (against CWC, SHC, Burlington, Schiavi, and\r\nPalmer); (4) fraud (against Bernstein); (5) negligence\r\n(against Bernstein); (6) breach of fiduciary duty (against\r\nKey Bank, Palmer, and Palmer Management); and (7) RICO\r\nviolations (against Key Bank, CWC, Burlington, Bernstein,\r\nSchiavi, Palmer, Palmer Management, and Palmer Development).\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Palmer, Palmer Development, Palmer Management  (the\r\n\n\"Palmer \r                   Defendants\"), \r                                Key Bank, and Schiavi filed counterclaims\r\n\nagainst PIN for defamation and punitive damages based on  the\r\n\nalleged defamation stemming from the September 14, 1994 press\r\n\nconferences.   Key  Bank filed  counterclaims for  defamation\r\n\nagainst Marcello, Phillips, and Pardilla.  Also deriving from\r\n\nthese \r                 press \r                       conferences, Palmer asserted counterclaims against\r\n\nPIN  for intentional  and negligent  infliction of  emotional\r\n\ndistress.     Both   Palmer  and   Palmer  Management   filed\r\n\ncounterclaims \r                         against \r                                PIN for breach of contract, alleging that\r\n\nPIN's suit violated the  release contained in the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements. \r                        \r                        Only Marcello responded with a motion for summary\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          The district court  (Brody, J.)  concluded that  25\r\n\nU.S.C. S  81  did not  apply  to the  Settlement  Agreements.\r\n\nDetermining that the Settlement Agreements constituted  valid\r\n\nreleases, the district court granted summary judgment for the\r\n\ndefendants \r                      with respect to all of PIN's claims.  See Penobscot\r\n\nIndian \r                  Nation, \r                         906 \r                             F. \r                                Supp. at 20-21.  Treating SHC's motion to\r\n\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment, the district  court\r\n\nseparately granted  summary  judgment for  SHC based  on  the\r\n\nbinding \r                   nature \r                          of \r                            the \r                                Settlement Agreements.  See id. at 21-22.\r\n\nThe district court also ruled that the statute of limitations\r\n\nbarred PIN's RICO claims.  See id. at 21.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          The \r                         district \r                                  court \r                                       then \r                                            considered the counterclaims.\r\n\nFinding that Key Bank did not allege facts demonstrating even\r\n\n      ence  on Marcello's  part, the  district court  granted\r\n\nMarcello's \r                      motion \r                            for \r                                summary judgment on Key Bank's defamation\r\n\n    terclaim.       \r            neglig\r            coun            See id. at  23.  Despite  the fact that  only\r\n\nMarcello filed  a motion for  summary judgment, the  district\r\n\ncourt proceeded to grant summary judgment sua sponte for  PIN\r\n\nand  the  remaining  cross-Appellees  with  respect  to   the\r\n\ndefamation \r                      claims.6  See id.  Judge Brody also awarded summary\r\n\njudgment sua sponte for PIN and the other cross-Appellees  on\r\n\nthe punitive damage counterclaims.  See id. at 24.   Finally,\r\n\nthe district court granted PIN's motion for summary  judgment\r\n\nwith respect to the emotional distress and breach of contract\r\n\nclaims. \r                    \r                    See\r                        \r                        Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, Civ. No. 94-\r\n\n0212-B (D. Me. Dec. 13, 1995).\r\n\n          In  the spring  of 1996,  PIN's malpractice  claims\r\n\nagainst Bernstein  went to  trial before  a jury.   The  jury\r\n\nreturned a verdict in favor of Bernstein.  The district court\r\n\nthen entered a final judgment resolving all claims on May  7,\r\n\n1996.  These appeals ensued.7  \r\n\n6.  The Palmer Defendants immediately filed a motion for\r\nreconsideration, which the district court subsequently denied \r\nSee Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, Civ. No. 94-0212-B,\r\n1 (D. Me. Dec. 13, 1995).\r\n\n7.  PIN did not appeal the adverse judgment respecting either\r\nits RICO claims or its other claims against Bernstein. \r\nCross-Appellants did not appeal the district court's sua\r\nsponte ruling as to punitive damages.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n          The district court  must grant summary judgment  if\r\n\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on file, together  with the affidavits . . .  show\r\n\nthat \r                there \r                      is \r                        no \r                           genuine \r                                   issue as to any material fact and that\r\n\nthe \r               moving \r                      party \r                           is \r                              entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\n\nFed.

We begin by resolving an issue of first impression  in\r\n\nthis Circuit:  whether  25 U.S.C. S 81 applies to  agreements\r\n\nrelative \r                    to \r                       lands that an Indian tribe purchases in fee simple\r\n\nfor investment  purposes.   We then  determine whether  PIN's\r\n\nfiling \r                  of \r                     this action in 1994 constituted an actionable breach\r\n\nof contract.   Subsequently, we  decide whether the  district\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\ncourt \r                 erred \r                      in \r                         concluding that the statements Marcello prepared\r\n\nand  individual  PIN officials  announced  to  the  press  in\r\n\nSeptember 1994 did not amount to defamation.  Thereafter,  we\r\n\ntouch upon  the issue of whether  PIN's conduct at the  press\r\n\nconferences  constituted  either  intentional  or   negligent\r\n\ninfliction \r                      of \r                        emotional \r                                  distress.  Finally, we evaluate whether\r\n\nthe \r               district \r                        court \r                             has \r                                 jurisdiction to hear the remaining state\r\n\nlaw claims at issue in this case.\r\n\nA.  Section 81\r\n\n          PIN sought a declaratory judgment from the district\r\n\ncourt that  the  agreements it  executed with  the  Appellees\r\n\nnecessitated  approval from  the  Secretary of  the  Interior\r\n\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. S  81.  Section 81 states in  pertinent\r\n\npart:\r\n\n          No agreement shall be made by any  person\r\n          with any tribe  of Indians . . . for  the\r\n          payment or delivery of any money or other\r\n          thing  of   value,  in   present  or   in\r\n          prospective,  or  for  the  granting   or\r\n          procuring any  privilege to  him, or  any\r\n          other person in consideration of services\r\n          for \r                         said \r                              Indians relative to their lands .\r\n          . . unless such agreement be executed and\r\n          approved as follows:\r\n\n                           . . . .\r\n\n          It  shall  bear   the  approval  of   the\r\n          Secretary  of   the  Interior   and   the\r\n          Commissioner \r                                  of Indian Lands indorsed upon\r\n          it.\r\n                           . . . .\r\n\n          All  contracts  or  agreements  made   in\r\n          violation of this  section shall be  null\r\n          and void . . . . \r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\nCongress adopted S 81, originally Revised Statute S 2103,  in\r\n\n1872. \r                  \r                  To \r                     this day, Congress has not repealed S 81 and the few\r\n\namendments \r                      to \r                         its \r                            text \r                                 have been only technical.  See Altheimer\r\n\n&amp; \r             Gray \r                  v. \r                     Sioux \r                          Mfg. \r                               Corp., 983 F.2d 803, 805 (7th Cir. 1993).8\r\n\n          Section 81 dictates  that any agreement within  its\r\n\npurview that is not approved by the Secretary of the Interior\r\n\n(\"the Secretary\") is void ab  initio.  PIN insists that S  81\r\n\napplies \r                   not \r                       only to the two Settlement Agreements, but also to\r\n\nthe agreements  pertaining to the  creation and operation  of\r\n\nSchiavi Homes, specifically the Asset Purchase Agreement, the\r\n\nPartnership Agreement, and  the Lease-Option Agreement.   PIN\r\n\ntherefore \r                     reasons that the Settlement Agreements, the Purchase\r\n\nand Sale  Agreement, and the  Lease-Option Agreement are  not\r\n\nbinding.   PIN also  contends that  the Secretary  improperly\r\n\ndetermined  that  S  81 did  not  apply  to  the  Partnership\r\n\nAgreement.\r\n\n          Significantly, if the Settlement Agreements are not\r\n\nvalid because they  never received  the Secretary's  approval\r\n\npursuant to S 81, PIN may pursue its remaining claims against\r\n\nthe  Appellees.    If, on  the  other  hand,  the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements  do not fall  within the parameters  of S 81,  PIN\r\n\n8.  In addition to technical amendments to S 81, Congress\r\npassed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. SS 2701-\r\n2721, which provides in part:  \"The authority of the\r\nSecretary under section 81 of this title, relating to\r\nmanagement contracts regulated pursuant to this chapter, is\r\nhereby transferred to the [National Indian Gaming]\r\nCommission.\"  25 U.S.C. S 2711(h).\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nconcedes that its remaining  non-S 81 claims fail due to  the\r\n\nbinding nature  of the Settlement  Agreements.  We  therefore\r\n\nbegin our analysis by evaluating the applicability of S 81 to\r\n\nthe Settlement Agreements.\r\n\n          1.  Settlement Agreements  \r\n\n          Without \r                             regard \r                                    to \r                                      S \r                                        81, \r                                            the two Settlement Agreements\r\n\nconstituted  valid  releases.    Both  Settlement  Agreements\r\n\nprovided  that  the  parties  \"release,  remise  and  forever\r\n\ndischarge each other . . . from all suits . . .  at law or in\r\n\nequity \r                  . \r                    . \r                     . \r                       which \r                             directly or indirectly relate[] to . . . any\r\n\n. . . transactions . . . among each other.\"  Whether or not S\r\n\n81 \r              pertains \r                       to \r                         and \r                             thus \r                                  voids the Settlement Agreements depends\r\n\nupon whether either  or both constitute an agreement with  an\r\n\nIndian tribe for services  relative to Indian lands.  See  25\r\n\nU.S.C. S 81.\r\n\n               a.  Agreement with an Indian Tribe\r\n\n          The Appellees contend that the Partnership,  rather\r\n\nthan \r                PIN \r                    in \r                       its individual capacity, represents the applicable\r\n\nentity  in this case.   This argument  is unavailing.   PIN's\r\n\nLieutenant \r                      Governor signed both Settlement Agreements as PIN's\r\n\npersonal representative,  not  as the  Partnership's  Limited\r\n\nPartner.   John  Palmer, the  Partnership's General  Partner,\r\n\nsigned on behalf of Schiavi Homes.  Moreover, even if Schiavi\r\n\nHomes,  not  PIN  in  its  individual  capacity,  signed  the\r\n\nagreements, the district  court's observation that  \"[c]ourts\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\nlook beyond  the  mere formality  of corporate  structure  in\r\n\nconstruing  the identity  of parties  with regard  to S  81,\"\r\n\nPenobscot, 906 F. Supp. at 19, necessitates no elaboration on\r\n\nour \r               part. \r                      \r                      Se\r                        e Altheimer &amp; Gray, 983 F.2d at 809-10; Pueblo of\r\n\nSanta Ana v. Hodel, 663 F. Supp. 1300, 1306 (D.D.C. 1987).\r\n\n               b.  Services\r\n\n          The  district  court  ruled  that  \"the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements \r                      themselves \r                                do \r                                   not constitute contracts for services.\r\n\nThe Settlement  Agreements rather pertain  to the release  of\r\n\nlegal claims  . . . .\"  Penobscot, 906 F. Supp. at 20.   This\r\n\nconclusion aptly  describes the  first Settlement  Agreement,\r\n\nwhich made no reference to any service to be performed by any\r\n\nparty to the Agreement for any other party to the  Agreement.\r\n\nThe first Settlement Agreement, consequently, did not involve\r\n\nservices.\r\n\n          The \r                         second \r                                Settlement Agreement contains a provision\r\n\nobligating \r                      Key \r                          Bank \r                              to \r                                 \"jointly [with PIN] seek a purchaser for\r\n\nthe Holden Lot9 . . . at a price to be mutually agreed upon.\"\r\n\nBecause \r                   the \r                       Supreme Court has instructed that federal statutes\r\n\nconcerning \r                      Indian tribes must be construed \"liberally in favor\r\n\nof the Indians,\"  Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe of Indians,  471\r\n\nU.S. 759, 766 (1985), we assume for purposes of this  opinion\r\n\n9.  At oral argument, PIN informed us that the Holden Lot\r\nconstitutes the sole tract of land at issue in this case,\r\nand, thus, the only piece of Indian land to which S 81 could\r\napply.\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nthat \r                this \r                     provision \r                              in \r                                 the second Settlement Agreement entailed\r\n\na \r             \"service\" \r                       within the meaning of S 81, see Green v.

Relative to Indian lands\r\n\n          The final prong  of the S 81 analysis, whether  the\r\n\nSettlement Agreements  were  \"relative  to  [Indian]  lands,\"\r\n\npresents a  more difficult  question.   The first  Settlement\r\n\nAgreement is not relative to Indian lands because it  neither\r\n\npertained nor referred  to any land  whatsoever.  The  second\r\n\nSettlement Agreement, however, both involved and referred  to\r\n\nland that an  Indian tribe owned.   Specifically, the  second\r\n\nSettlement \r                      Agreement \r                               provided for the disposition of the Holden\r\n\nLot.  At first glance, S 81 may appear to apply to the Holden\r\n\nLot because PIN, an Indian tribe, owned this parcel of  land.\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nWe believe, however, that the meaning of S 81's language, the\r\n\nintentions  of   its  drafters,   the  Interior   Secretary'\r\n\n               of  S 81,  the case  law from  o-determinatio\r\n\n                       e statute does not apply to the Holden\r                                                                        s\r            interpretation                                              n\r            support \r                   a \r                     holding \r                            that \r                                 th\r\n\nLot.  Although we have uncovered no precedent that explicitly\r\n\nconsiders whether or not S 81 applies to land that an  Indian\r\n\ntribe \r                 purchased \r                           in \r                             fee \r                                 simple for investment purposes, in doing\r\n\nso now we  give voice to  an assumption underlying  virtually\r\n\nevery \r                 decision addressing the applicability of S 81 to service\r\n\nagreements with Indian tribes relative to their lands.  \r\n\n          We \r                        base \r                             our \r                                 conclusion primarily on the distinctions\r\n\nbetween \r                   Indian \r                          trust \r                               or \r                                  tribal lands (hereinafter \"Indian trust\r\n\nlands\")10 and  lands that Indian  tribes hold  in fee  simple\r\n\n(hereinafter \"Indian fee lands\").   The phrase \"Indian  trust\r\n\nlands\" derives from the historic trust relationship  existing\r\n\nbetween Indian tribes and the federal government,  originally\r\n\ndescribed as \"resembl[ing]  that of a ward to his  guardian.\"\r\n\nWorcester v. Georgia, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1, 17 (1831); see also\r\n\nOneida  County v.  Oneida Indian  Nation, 470  U.S. 226,  247\r\n\n10.  We use the terms \"Indian trust lands\" and \"Indian tribal\r\nlands\" interchangeably because we have not located any\r\nauthority that draws a distinction between these terms that\r\nis material for our purposes.  See, e.g., Black's Law\r\nDictionary 772 (1990); Felix S. Cohen's Handbook of Federal\r\nIndian Law 35-36, 476 (Rennard Strickland et al. eds., 1982);\r\nReid P. Chambers &amp; Monroe E. Price, Regulating Sovereignty: \r\nSecretarial Discretion and the Leasing of Indian Lands, 26\r\nStan. L. Rev. 1061, 1061 (1974) (referring to Indian lands\r\ndelineated \"restricted\" in 25 U.S.C.

Morton, 528\r\n\nF.2d 370, 379 (1st Cir. 1975).  Indian trust lands constitute\r\n\nreal property the title  to which the United States holds  in\r\n\ntrust for an  Indian tribe.   See 25 U.S.C.  S 465; Felix  S.\r\n\nCohen's \r                   Handbook of Federal Indian Law 476 (Rennard Strickland\r\n\net al. eds., 1982) [hereinafter Cohen's Handbook].  \r\n\n          Fee simple lands, by  contrast, are those lands  in\r\n\nwhich the  owner \"is entitled  to the  entire property,  with\r\n\nunconditional power of disposition.\"  Black's Law  Dictionary\r\n\n615 \r               (6th \r                    ed. \r                        1990).  Federal law recognizes that Indian tribes\r\n\nmay hold certain lands in fee simple and that these lands may\r\n\nnot \r               be \r                  subject to the trust relationship between Indian tribes\r\n\nand the  federal government.   See, e.g.,  25 U.S.C. S  1466.\r\n\nSpecifically,\r                         and pertinent to these appeals, the Maine Indian\r\n\nClaims Settlement Act, 25 U.S.C. SS 1721-1735, indicates that\r\n\nthe Holden  Lot constitutes Indian  fee land  over which  the\r\n\nfederal \r                   government \r                             does \r                                  not have a trust responsibility because\r\n\nthe \r               Lot \r                   does \r                       not \r                           lie \r                               within designated PIN Territory.  In fact,\r\n\nCongress expressly disavowed trust responsibility for  Indian\r\n\nreal \r                property encompassing the area in which the Holden Lot is\r\n\nsituated.\r                    11\r                       \r                        \r                        Accordingly, we find that PIN held the Holden Lot\r\n\n11.  25 U.S.C. S 1724(d)(3) provides:  \"Land or natural\r\nresources acquired outside the boundaries of [Penobscot\r\nIndian Territory] . . . shall be held in fee by the\r\nrespective tribe or nation, and the United States shall have\r\nno further trust responsibility with respect thereto.\"  25\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nin fee simple.  We now  consider the impact this fact has  on\r\n\nwhether S 81 applies to the second Settlement Agreement.  \r\n\n          This \r                          inquiry \r                                  necessitates that we first consider the\r\n\nstatute's text.   See United States  v. Gonzales, 117 S.  Ct.\r\n\n1032, 1034 (1997).   As previously noted,  S 81 states:   \"No\r\n\nagreement \r                     shall \r                           be \r                             made \r                                  by any person with any tribe of Indians\r\n\n. . . for the payment or delivery of any money or other thing\r\n\nof \r              value, \r                     in \r                        present or in prospective, or for the granting or\r\n\nprocuring  any privilege  to  him,  or any  other  person  in\r\n\nconsideration of services for said Indians relative to  their\r\n\nlands \r                 . \r                   . \r                     . \r                      .\" \r                          \r                          The \r                              statute does not distinguish between Indian\r\n\ntrust lands and  Indian fee lands; nor  does it refer to  all\r\n\nIndian lands.  In fact, S 81's scope is not clearly  defined.\r\n\nSee Mark A.  Jarboe, Fundamental  Legal Principles  Affecting\r\n\nBusiness Transactions in Indian Country, 17 Harmline L.  Rev.\r\n\n417, 430 (1994); see also Stowell v.

See        v.\r\n\nUnited States, 508 U.S.  223, 228 (1993).  When Congress  has\r\n\nfailed to  define statutory language,  the Supreme Court  has\r\n\nresorted  to authoritative  texts to  determine the  ordinary\r\n\nmeaning of statutory language.  See id. at 229.  According to\r\n\none  such text,  the term  \"Indian lands\"  refers to  \"[r]eal\r\n\nproperty ceded to the U.S. by Indians, commonly to be held in\r\n\ntrust \r                 for \r                     Indians.\" \r                               \r                               Blac\r                                   k's Law Dictionary 771 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n\nThe definition of  Indian tribal or  trust land is  virtually\r\n\nidentical:  \"real propt 772.12\r\n\n          In the  context of S  81, the  phrase \"relative  to\r\n\n[Indian] lands\" is understood to refer to Indian trust lands.\r\n\nSee Cohen's Handbook at 318 n.293 (explaining that \"25 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 81[] prohibit[s]  contracts with  Indian tribes  concerning\r\n\ntrust property unless approved by the Commissioner of  Indian\r\n\naffairs\") (emphasis  added);  Patrick K.  Duffy and  Lois  A.\r\n\n12.  It is noteworthy that the phrase \"Indian country\" refers\r\nto \"all lands set aside by whatever means for the residence\r\nof tribal Indians under federal protection, together with\r\ntrust and restricted Indian allotments.\"  Cohen's Handbook at\r\n34; see also United States v. John, 437 U.S. 634, 648-50\r\n(1978).  The phrase \"as Indian lands are held\" is read\r\n\"simply to state the United States will hold title in trust\r\nfor the tribe.\"  Cohen's Handbook at 476.  These definitions\r\nwould seem to indicate that \"Indian country\" and \"Indian\r\nlands\" encompass Indian trust lands but not Indian fee lands.\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nLofgren,  Jurassic  Farce:    A  Critical  Analysis  of   the\r\n\nGovernment's Seizure of \"Sue,\" A  Sixty-Five-Million-Year-Old\r\n\nTyrannosaurs \r                        Rex \r                           Fossil, \r                                   39 S.

Thus, although\r\n\nit appears that S 81's \"relative to [Indian] lands\"  language\r\n\nconnotes Indian trust lands rather than Indian fee lands,  we\r\n\nacknowledge that this interpretation is not iron-clad.\r\n\n          Recognizing that we cannot end our inquiry with the\r\n\n\"ordinary\" or  \"natural\" meaning of  the statute's terms,  we\r\n\nconsider \r                    the \r                        relevant legislative history in an effort to give\r\n\neffect  to the  intentions of  the statute's  drafters.

Feb.  22, 1871) (declaring  that\r\n\nstatute was for Indians' \"protection and to prevent them from\r\n\nbeing plundered\") (comments of Senator Davis).  Specifically,\r\n\nCongress adopted S 81 to protect Indian tribes and individual\r\n\nIndians \r                   from \r                       persons, \r                                particularly attorneys and claims agents,\r\n\noffering  dubious services,  typically the  assertion of  the\r\n\nIndians' land claims against the government, in exchange  for\r\n\nenormous fees.  See Cong. Globe, 41st Cong. at 1483-86.   One\r\n\nsenator  indicated that  this section  \"would prevent  . .  .\r\n\ncontracts \r                     being made by [Indian tribes] unless approved by the\r\n\nSecretary \r                     of \r                       the \r                           Interior in any matter relating to the land or\r\n\nannuities  that they  hold under  or derive  from the  United\r\n\nStates.\"   See Cong.

The  two  statements\r\n\naddressing the application  of S 81 may be read  differently:\r\n\nSenator Harlan's description  may indicate  that the  statute\r\n\napplies solely  to lands  over which  the federal  government\r\n\nexercises   a  trust   responsibility;   Senator   Casserly's\r\n\nexplanation may mean that the statute applies to Indian lands\r\n\ngenerally. \r                       \r                       To reconcile this ambiguity, and thus to parse the\r\n\nordinary meaning of S 81 at the time of its ratification,  we\r\n\nconsider the understanding of the status of Indian lands that\r\n\nprevailed at the time Congress passed S 81.13  See  Oliphant,\r\n\n13.  Our determination to further consider the nature of\r\nIndian land ownership during this time in order to properly\r\ninterpret the phrase \"relative to [Indian] lands\" would be\r\nappropriate even if we read Senator Harlan's statement in the\r\ndisjunctive, rather than in the conjunctive as the sentence\r\nwas recorded.  That is, if we read the phrase \"relating to\r\nthe land or annuities that they hold under or derive from the\r\nUnited States\" so that the qualifying statement \"that they\r\nhold under or derive from the United States\" qualifies only\r\nthe word \"annuities\" but not the words \"the land,\" we still\r\nwould have learned little more concerning the definition of\r\n\"Indian lands.\"  Such a reading, though tortured, would\r\nresolve the ambiguity between the drafters' two statements\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\n435 U.S. at 206.\r\n\n          In 1872,  when Congress  passed S  81, federal  law\r\n\nprovided that Indian tribes enjoyed the right to possess  and\r\n\noccupy  lands but  not to  alienate these  lands without  the\r\n\nfederal government's approval.

It was not until the legal relationship between Indian\r\ntribes and the federal government evolved dramatically in the\r\ntwentieth century that legislation regulating Indian tribes'\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\nCongress did not distinguish  between Indian trust lands  and\r\n\nIndian fee lands at  this time presumably because it did  not\r\n\ncontemplate that Indian tribes could hold land in fee simple.\r\n\n          During this time, however, Congress did provide for\r\n\nindividual Indians to hold land in fee simple.  See 25 U.S.C.\r\n\nSS 348-349 (1887).  The allotment process that these statutes\r\n\nauthorized permitted the  Secretary to transfer certain  real\r\n\nproperty to individual Indians.  Typically, the United States\r\n\nwould hold such lands in trust for the designated individuals\r\n\nfor a period of twenty-five years.  See Sam Pelican, 232 U.S.\r\n\nat 447.  The Secretary, at his discretion, could \"cause to be\r\n\nissued \r                  to \r                     such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter\r\n\nall restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said\r\n\nland shall  be removed.\"   25 U.S.C.  S 349.   Despite  these\r\n\nstatutes'  provision  for  individual  Indians'  fee   simple\r\n\nownership of real property, we have unearthed no  legislation\r\n\nreal property routinely distinguished between restricted and\r\nunrestricted tribal lands.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. S 1360(b)\r\n(1953) (referring specifically to the \"alienation,\r\nencumbrance, or taxation of any real or personal property . .\r\n. that is held in trust by the United States or is subject to\r\na restriction against alienation imposed by the United\r\nStates\"); 25 U.S.C. S 415 (1955) (referring specifically to\r\n\"restricted Indian lands\").  Modern statutes routinely\r\ndistinguish between Indian trust lands and Indian fee lands. \r\nSee, e.g., 25 U.S.C. S 1724(d)(3) (1980) (distinguishing\r\nbetween Indian trust lands and Indian fee lands, and\r\nindicating that the United States does not have \"trust\r\nresponsibility\" with respect to the latter); 25 U.S.C. S 1466\r\n(1974) (indicating that Indian tribes can purchase real\r\nproperty \"without any restriction on alienation, control, or\r\nuse\").\r\n\n                            -25-\r                                         25\r\r\n\nenacted \r                   during \r                          this \r                              time \r                                   that afforded similar rights to Indian\r\n\ntribes.  See Cohen's Handbook at 36 &amp; n.78.\r\n\n          Interpreting S 81  and its  legislative history  in\r\n\nlight of  the  understandings and  assumptions of  those  who\r\n\ndrafted it, see Oliphant, 435 U.S. at 206, thus supports  the\r\n\nconclusion \r                      that S 81 does not pertain to the Holden Lot.  When\r\n\nCongress passed S 81  it did not envision that Indian  tribes\r\n\ncould hold land in the  manner that PIN held the Holden  Lot.\r\n\nCf. Cohen's Handbook at  127-43 (concluding that during  this\r\n\ntime \r                \"extensive government supervisory power over the everyday\r\n\nlife of  Indians was essentially  unchecked\").  It  therefore\r\n\nwould  seem  anomalous, in  endeavoring  to  give  effect  to\r\n\nCongress' intent, to apply S 81 to lands PIN purchased in fee\r\n\nsimple for investment purposes.\r\n\n          Admittedly, the broad remedial purposes that S 81's\r\n\ndrafters  attributed  to  the  statute  may  complicate  this\r\n\nanalysis.   Congress desired  to protect  Indian tribes  from\r\n\nunscrupulous \r                        business practices, see Cong. Globe 41st Cong. at\r\n\n1485-86, and enjoyed  the sole right  to encumber all  Indian\r\n\nlands, see Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S.\r\n\n661, \r                667 \r                    (1974) (\"Once the United States was organized and the\r\n\nConstitution \r                        adopted \r                                . \r                                 . \r                                   . tribal rights to Indian lands became\r\n\nthe exclusive  province of the  federal law.

Congress, moreover, occasionally\r\n\ndid \r               authorize individual Indians to hold designated parcels of\r\n\nreal property  in  fee  simple, and,  therefore,  could  have\r\n\nexempted these fee simple lands from S 81's purview if it did\r\n\nnot \r               want \r                    S \r                      81 to apply to Indian fee lands.  To our knowledge,\r\n\nCongress has adopted  no such exemption.   Our analysis  thus\r\n\nillustrates  that  although   S  81's  legislative   history,\r\n\nconsidered \r                      in light of the status of federal Indian law during\r\n\nthe \r               middle \r                      of the nineteenth century, points to the conclusion\r\n\nthat S 81  does not apply  to Indian fee  lands, it does  not\r\n\nprovide a clear answer to the issue we face today.\r\n\n          Having \r                            failed \r                                   to \r                                     arrive \r                                            at a definitive answer to our\r\n\ninquiry  through  reference  to  S  81's  plain  meaning  and\r\n\nlegislative history, we turn to analyze the interpretation of\r\n\nthe agency  responsible for administering  the statute.

See id. at 811 (indicating that\r\n\n                            -32-\r                                         32\r\r\n\nthe \r               four \r                    factors that it set forth \"are not the 'sine qua non'\r\n\nof a contract which relates to Indian lands\").\r\n\n          Despite \r                             its \r                                 distinguishing characteristics, however,\r\n\nAltheimer\r                     \r                     informs our analysis of PIN's appeal.  Specifically,\r\n\nthe \r               Altheimer\r                         court refused to find the agreement \"relative to\r\n\n[Indian] lands\" in part because the Indian tribe in Altheimer\r\n\nremained \r                    involved in the business relationship.  In this case,\r\n\nPIN  participated  in  the  Partnership,  not  through  daily\r\n\nmanagement \r                      duties, \r                             but \r                                 through financing and leasing activities\r\n\npromoting  Schiavi   Homes'   business  activities.      More\r\n\nimportantly, Altheimer emphasized  the fact that the  subject\r\n\nmatter of the  contract derived no  special benefit from  the\r\n\nIndian  tribe's sovereign  status.   See  id.  at 812.    The\r\n\nAltheimer court explained:   \"Unlike bingo, manufacturers  of\r\n\nlatex medical products need not seek refuge from state  civil\r\n\nlaws by locating on a reservation.\"   Id.  In this case,  the\r\n\nparties to the second Settlement Agreement derived no special\r\n\nbenefit from PIN's sovereign status.16\r\n\n          Notwithstanding the fact  that Altheimer, like  the\r\n\nother cases we have considered, supports the conclusion  that\r\n\n16.  We note that when the land at issue constitutes Indian\r\nfee land it is difficult for the subject matter of the\r\ncontract to derive a special benefit from the Indian tribe's\r\nsovereignty because Indian tribes do not have the same powers\r\nand privileges with respect to Indian fee lands that they do\r\nin the context of Indian trust lands.

See\r\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe v. RIBO, Inc., 686 F.

Following execution of  the\r\n\nagreements, the Tribe purchased a total of 28.8 acres of land\r\n\nadjacent to  the Tribe's reservation.   See id.  at 50.   The\r\n\nTribe, however, failed to secure trust status for this  land.\r\n\nSee id.\r\n\n          The \r                         Narragans\r                                  ett defendants specifically argued that\r\n\n\"S 81 pertained only to 'tribal  land' . . . [that is,]  land\r\n\nthat is part of the Tribe's reservation.\"  Id.  The  district\r\n\ncourt rejected this argument, reasoning:\r\n\n          [S]uch a  construction  proves to  be  at\r\n          variance with both the plain language  of\r\n          the statute and  with its broad  remedial\r\n          purpose.  Thus the statute uses the  term\r\n          'their  [the  Indians']  lands'   without\r\n          differentiating between  original  tribal\r\n          lands and  those  subsequently  acquired.\r\n          Reading into  those words the  limitation\r\n          urged by  Defendants would distort  their\r\n          plain meaning.   Moreover, it also  would\r\n          emasculate the statute and frustrate  its\r\n          purpose  of  providing  a  mechanism   to\r\n          regulate Indian land transactions.\r\n\n                            -34-\r                                         34\r\r\n\nId.\r               \r                \r                Although the Narragansett court recognized that S 81 \"has\r\n\nits origin in the longstanding trust relationship between the\r\n\nfederal \r                   government and Indian tribes,\" id. at 50, it held that\r\n\n\"S 81 renders both the agreements and the notes and mortgages\r\n\ngiven by  the Tribe in accordance  with their terms null  and\r\n\nvoid.\"  Id. at 51.\r\n\n          We   find  the   Narragansett   court's   reasoning\r\n\nunpersuasive.    The   construction  that  the   Narragansett\r\n\ndefendants  advanced, we  believe,  comports with  the  plain\r\n\nlanguage of the statute.  If S 81 is predicated on the  trust\r\n\nrelationship between the  federal government  and the  Indian\r\n\ntribes, see  id.; United States ex  rel. Hall v. Tribal  Dev.\r\n\nCorp.\r                , \r                  49 \r                    F.3d \r                         1208, \r                               1214 (7th Cir. 1995), then reading S 81 to\r\n\napply to Indian  lands purchased in  fee simple for  business\r\n\nreasons contradicts the  statute's purpose and its  drafters'\r\n\nintentions.  Even  those courts that have propounded a  broad\r\n\nreading of  S 81's  \"relative to  [Indian] lands\"  component,\r\n\nmoreover, \r                     have not found that this phrase refers to Indian fee\r\n\nlands.  See, e.g., Koberstein, 762 F.2d at 619; United States\r\n\nex rel Shakopee v. Pan American Mgmt. Co., 616 F. Supp. 1200,\r\n\n1217-18  (D.

See United States  v.\r\n\nCarroll, 105 F.3d 740, 744 (1st Cir. 1997) (instructing  that\r\n\ncommon sense construction  that \"avoid[s] absurd or  counter-\r\n\nintuitive results\" is favored); O'Connell v.

Perhaps recognizing the Narragansett decision as an\r\nanomaly, at least one circuit court has interpreted\r\nNarragansett as \"simply hold[ing] that bingo management\r\nagreements involve services within the meaning of [S 81].\" \r\nBacon, 21 F.3d at 212.\r\n\n18.  We recognize that the Supreme Court determined that the\r\nNonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. S 177, applied to land that the\r\nPueblo Indian tribes of New Mexico held in fee simple.  See\r\nUnited States v. Candelaria, 271 U.S. 432, 440-44 (1926); see\r\nalso United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, 45-48 (1913)\r\n(finding that Congress could restrict the alienation of land\r\nthat New Mexico Pueblo Indians held in fee simple).  The\r\nPueblo Indians at issue in Candelaria and Sandoval held their\r\nlands in fee simple under both Spanish and Mexican law before\r\nthe United States gained control over New Mexico.  See\r\nCandelaria, 271 U.S. at 442; Sandoval, 231 U.S. at 44-45. \r\n\n                            -36-\r                                         36\r\r\n\nU.S.C.

We believe that the situation in this case, in\r\nwhich PIN purchased land in fee simple for investment\r\n                                                  Candelaria\r                    See\r            retained the authority to restrict the alienation of these\r                                  , 271 U.S. at 442; \r            purposes, differs substantially from that in both \r\nand Sandoval, in which the tribes held their ancestral tribal\r\nlands in a modified version of fee simple under Spanish and\r\nMexican rule.       We note, however, that several courts,\r\nrelying on Candelaria and Sandoval, have found S 177\r\napplicable to lands that other Indian tribes have purchased\r\nin fee simple.  See Alonzo v. United States, 249 F.2d 189,\r\n196 (10th Cir. 1957); United States v. 7,405.3 Acres of Land,\r\n97 F.2d 417, 422 (4th Cir. 1938).  Given Alonzo's paucity of\r\nanalysis and outdated paternalism (the court adopted the\r\nnotion that Indians are \"'a simple, uninformed people, ill-\r\nprepared to cope with the intelligence and greed of other\r\nraces,'\" see id. (quoting Candelaria, 271 U.S. at 442)), we\r\ndo not find this decision persuasive.  This conclusion\r\napplies equally to 7,405.3 Acres of Land.    \r\n          The situation in this case, moreover, differs\r\nsubstantially from that in Alonzo and 7,405.3 Acres of Land. \r\nAs opposed to the land in question in those cases, Congress\r\ndisavowed trust responsibility over the land encompassing the\r\nHolden Lot.  See 25 U.S.C. S 1724(d)(3).  In Lummi Indian\r\nTribe v. Whatcom County, 5 F.3d 1355, 1359 (9th Cir. 1993),\r\nthe Ninth Circuit took issue with Alonzo and 7,405.3 Acres of\r\nLand and ruled that \"parcels of land approved for alienation\r\nby the federal government and then reacquired by the Tribe\r\ndid not then become inalienable by operation of the\r\nNonintercourse Act.\"  See also Federal Power Comm'n v.\r\nTuscarora Indian Nation, 362 U.S. 99, 110-15 (1960)\r\n(determining that lands that Indian tribe purchased in fee\r\nsimple were not subject to federal oversight pursuant to\r\nFederal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. S 797(e), because United States\r\nneither owned these lands nor owned an interest in these\r\nlands).  The lands at issue in Lummi Indian Nation and\r\nTuscarora Indian Nation were similar to the Holden Lot in\r\nthat the tribes purchased these lands in fee simple.  See\r\nLummi Indian Tribe, 5 F.3d at 1357; Tuscarora Indian Nation,\r\n362 U.S. at 105-06. \r\n\n                            -37-\r                                         37\r\r\n\nencompassing the  Holden Lot,  it expressly  stated that  the\r\n\np\r\n\n    as its  source the Nonintercourse  Act, meaning that  th\r\n\ntrust relationship pertains to land transactions which are or\r\n\n                             Passamaquoddy Tribe\r            N\r            See 25 U.S.C.

SS 1721-1735, implicitly repealed S\r\n81 with respect to PIN generally.  Although S 1724 provides\r\nthat several statutes, including 25 U.S.C. S 177, no longer\r\napply to PIN, it makes no mention of S 81.  If Congress\r\ndesired to repeal completely S 81 with respect to all PIN\r\nreal property it could easily have done so, as it did with S\r\n177.  Cf. Bailey v. United States, 116 S.

In fact, adopting PIN's  interpretation\r\n\nwould frustrate Indian  tribes' efforts  to promote  economic\r\n\ndevelopment and fiscal autonomy.  \r\n\n          This analysis reflects the modern trend in  federal\r\n\nIndian \r                  policy away from outmoded paternalistic21 practices and\r\n\npolicies. \r                      \r                      Se\r                        e Cohen's Handbook at 180-206; Federal Indian Law\r\n\nat \r              151-59. \r                       \r                       Particularly during the last forty years, Congress\r\n\nhas endeavored to afford Indian tribes the latitude to pursue\r\n\ntheir social, political, and economic goals as they determine\r\n\nappropriate.

See\r\n\nBlackfeet  Tribe, 471  U.S.  at 766.    The rule  recited  in\r\n\nBlackfeet Tribe, however, does not require a court to  ignore\r\n\ncompelling authority supporting a conclusion contrary to  the\r\n\n                            -41-\r                                         41\r\r\n\nposition \r                    that a particular Indian tribe advances.  See Lyng v.\r\n\nNorthwest Indian Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439, 456  (1988).\r\n\nWe therefore hold that the Settlement Agreements did not fall\r\n\nwithin \r                  the \r                      parameters \r                                of \r                                   S 81, and thus that the two Settlement\r\n\nAgreements constituted valid, binding releases that  preclude\r\n\nPIN from further pursuing its remaining claims.\r\n\n          2.  Underlying Agreements\r\n\n          Despite the  fact that S 81  does not apply to  the\r\n\nSettlement \r                      Agreements, and thus that the Settlement Agreements\r\n\nfunction to release PIN's  remaining claims, we must  briefly\r\n\nconsider whether S 81 applies to the underlying agreements at\r\n\nissue \r                 in \r                    this case.  We pursue this inquiry to deter potential\r\n\nabuse \r                 stemming from the execution of a settlement agreement in\r\n\nthe context  of S  81.   We are  particularly concerned  that\r\n\nparties to an agreement for services relative to Indian trust\r\n\nlands may seek to avoid securing Secretarial approval of such\r\n\nagreement  pursuant to S  81 by executing  a relet that  this\r\n\nrelease did not constitute an agreement with an Indian  tribe\r\n\nfor services relative  to Indian lands, and that the  release\r\n\nfunctions to prohibit any action that a party to the  release\r\n\ninitiates  subsequently  to  void  the  underlying  agreement\r\n\npursuant \r                    to \r                       S \r                        81.22\r                              \r                               \r                               To \r                                  avoid creating a potential safe harbor,\r\n\n22.  Even if such a release did preclude a party's action to\r\ninvalidate the underlying agreement pursuant to S 81, as in\r\nthe instant case, S 81's qui tam provision would permit\r\nanother party to bring suit in the name of the United States\r\nto invalidate the underlying agreements if these underlying\r\n\n                            -42-\r                                         42\r\r\n\nwe evaluate the three underlying agreements at issue in  this\r\n\ncase  to  determine whether  or  not  they  necessitated  the\r\n\nSecretary's approval pursuant to S 81.\r\n\n               a.  Asset Purchase Agreement\r\n\n          The  Asset  Purchase  Agreement23  constituted  the\r\n\noperative agreement relating to the Partnership's purchase of\r\n\nSHC. \r                 \r                 This \r                     Agreement \r                               was \r                                   a pure sales contract.  Without regard\r\n\nto whether  S  81's \"services\"  component pertains  to  sales\r\n\ncontracts, see Menominee Tribe, 233 U.S. at 570-71 (finding S\r\n\n81 applicable to  contract for sale of logging equipment  and\r\n\nsupplies); but see Hall, 825 F. Supp. at 1431-32 (ruling that\r\n\n\"Congress  did  not  intend  that  section  81  govern  sales\r\n\ncontracts\"),  the  only  real  property  that  the  Agreement\r\n\nmentioned was real property that the seller, SHC,  possessed,\r\n\nnot land that an Indian tribe, specifically PIN, owned.  This\r\n\nAgreement \r                     simply \r                           stipulated that the Partnership secured a $3.5\r\n\nagreements did not bear the Secretary's approval.  See Tribal\r\nDevelopment, 49 F.3d at 1212; United States ex rel. Yankton\r\nSioux Tribe v. Gambler's Supply, Inc. 925 F. Supp. 658, 668-\r\n69 (D.S.D. 1996).\r\n\n23.  PIN refers both to the Asset Purchase Agreement and to\r\n\"associated contracts and documentation\" as being void ab\r\ninitio pursuant to S 81.  The Partnership executed a Non-\r\nCompetition and Consulting Agreement with John Schiavi on\r\nDecember 30, 1996.  Although this Agreement did provide for\r\nservices, in the form of consulting duties, it never\r\nmentioned and did not relate to any Indian lands.  The non-\r\ncompetition agreements that the Partnership executed with CWC\r\nsimilarly did not pertain to any Indian lands.  Section 81,\r\ntherefore, does not apply to these \"associated contracts and\r\ndocumentation.\"\r\n\n                            -43-\r                                         43\r\r\n\nmillion \r                   guaranteed loan from Key Bank; it neither required nor\r\n\nreferred \r                    to \r                       PIN's use of its land as collateral for this loan.\r\n\n               b.  Partnership Agreement\r\n\n          We \r                        find \r                             that \r                                 the \r                                     Partnership Agreement did constitute\r\n\na \r             services \r                     agreement \r                               because it contained a provision dictating\r\n\nthat \r                Palmer \r                       enjoyed \r                              sole \r                                   responsibility for managing SHC to the\r\n\nbenefit of both Palmer and PIN.  See Koberstein, 762 F.2d  at\r\n\n619  (finding  that  S  81  governs  management   contracts).\r\n\nNonetheless,  despite  PIN's   assertion  that  the   parties\r\n\nenvisioned the use  of PIN's lands to advance SHC's  business\r\n\nactivities, the  Partnership Agreement  neither  specifically\r\n\nmentioned \r                     nor \r                        indirectly \r                                   referenced any use of land.  It merely\r\n\nstated \r                  that \r                       PIN would provide a $1 million Letter of Credit to\r\n\nsecure Key Bank's Guaranteed  Loan financing the purchase  of\r\n\nSHC.   The Partnership  Agreement, therefore,  does not  fall\r\n\nwithin \r                  the \r                      parameters \r                                of \r                                   S 81 because it does not constitute an\r\n\nagreement   for   services  relative   to  Indian   lands.24 \r\n\n          Because the service that the Partnership  Agreement\r\n\nprovided for  entailed  the  management of  SHC,  we  briefly\r\n\nevaluate \r                    this Agreement in light of Altheimer, which addressed\r\n\nthe applicability of S 81 to a management agreement.  See 983\r\n\nF.2d \r                at \r                   811. \r                         The relevant Altheimer factors indicate that the\r\n\n24.  As previously noted, the parties to the Partnership\r\nAgreement submitted this Agreement for the Secretary's\r\napproval pursuant to S 81.  The Secretary specifically\r\ndetermined that S 81 did not pertain to the Agreement.\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                         44\r\r\n\nPartnership Agreement  does not fall  within S 81's  purview.\r\n\nSpecifically, the Partnership Agreement did not relate to the\r\n\nmanagement of a facility to be located on Indian lands,  and,\r\n\neven if it did, the operation of such facility would not have\r\n\ndepended in  any way  on  PIN's legal  status as  a  separate\r\n\nsovereign.  See id.\r\n\n               c.  Lease-Option Agreement\r\n\n          The Lease-Option Agreement, unlike the  Partnership\r\n\nAgreement, did not pertain  to \"services\" relative to  Indian\r\n\nlands.25  The Lease-Option simply provided that Schiavi Homes\r\n\nenjoyed the right to use  and improve the Holden Lot for  the\r\n\npurpose of conducting its business.  It also afforded Schiavi\r\n\nHomes an option to purchase the Holden Lot.  The Lease-Option\r\n\nnever  mentioned and  did  not  relate to  the  provision  of\r\n\nservices.  In addition, although it did involve real property\r\n\nthat \r                PIN \r                    owned (the Holden Lot), as previously noted this land\r\n\nwas \r               not \r                   within the parameters of S 81 because it was not trust\r\n\nland.   Even if  the Holden Lot  did constitute Indian  trust\r\n\nlands, S  81 would not  apply to  the Lease-Option  Agreement\r\n\n25.  The Assignment of Lease executed on December 1, 1988,\r\ntransferring Schiavi Homes' entire interest in the Lease, and\r\nparticularly the option to purchase the Holden Lot, to Key\r\nBank as additional collateral for the repayment of its\r\nGuaranteed Loan in the amount of $3,500,000 did not require\r\nSecretarial approval under S 81.  This agreement did not\r\nentail any services and pertained only to the Holden Lot not\r\nto PIN's trust lands.  On July 20, 1989, moreover, PIN\r\nsecured Bureau of Indian Affairs approval for this Assignment\r\npursuant to Title IV of the Indian Financing Act of 1974, 25\r\nU.S.C. SS 1521-1524.\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                         45\r\r\n\nbecause \r                   the \r                       Maine \r                            Indian \r                                   Claims Settlement Act provided that 25\r\n\nU.S.C.  SS  396  &amp; 415  would  govern  leases  involving  PIN\r\n\nterritory.  See 25 U.S.C. S 1724(g)(3)(A)&amp;(B) (providing that\r\n\n25 U.S.C.  SS  396a-396g &amp;  415-415d  govern leasing  of  PIN\r\n\nTerritory); see also Koberstein, 762 F.2d at 619  (indicating\r\n\nthat S 81  governs transactions relative to Indian lands  for\r\n\nwhich Congress has not passed a specific statute).\r\n\nB.  Breach of Contract\r\n\n          Palmer and Palmer Management assert that by  filing\r\n\nthe  instant suit,  PIN breached  the contractual  obligation\r\n\nmemorialized  in the  Settlement Agreements  to \"release  all\r\n\nclaims.\"  In  their counterclaim, these two  cross-Appellants\r\n\nsought damages from this  purported breach deriving from  the\r\n\n\"loss of time that could otherwise be spent in the pursuit of\r\n\nlegitimate business interests.\"  On appeal, Palmer and Palmer\r\n\nManagement request damages \"caused by the lawsuit outside  of\r\n\nattorney \r                    fees.\"\r                         26\r                            \r                             \r                             Because we find the Settlement Agreements to\r\n\nconstitute \r                      valid \r                           releases not within the parameters of S 81, we\r\n\nnow \r               consider \r                        Palmer and Palmer Management's breach of contract\r\n\ncounterclaims.\r\n\n26.  The district court devoted the majority of its analysis\r\nto the issue of whether a party may recover attorney's fees\r\nfor the breach of a settlement agreement's release of claims. \r\nThe district court found that a party could not recover such\r\nattorney's fees in the defense of a suit that itself\r\nconstituted a breach of a settlement agreement.  See\r\nPenobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, Civ. No. 94-0212-B, at 6\r\n(D. Me. Dec. 13, 1995).  Neither Palmer nor Palmer Management\r\nraises this issue on appeal.\r\n\n                            -46-\r                                         46\r\r\n\n                            -47-\r                                         47\r\r\n\n          Both Settlement  Agreements  state:   \"The  parties\r\n\nhereto \r                  have \r                      been \r                           collectively negotiating a final settlement in\r\n\nthe \r               Schiavi \r                       Homes \r                            loan \r                                 transaction, termination of business and\r\n\nliquidation, and are desirous of reaching a final  settlement\r\n\nbetween the parties  to avoid litigation now in existence  or\r\n\nthat could  hereafter  arise.\"   As mentioned  earlier,  both\r\n\nSettlement Agreements  expressly  provided that  the  parties\r\n\n\"release, remise and forever discharge each other . . .  from\r\n\nall suits .  . . at law or in equity . . . which directly  or\r\n\nindirectly \r                      relate[] \r                               to \r                                 . \r                                   . . any . . . transactions . . . among\r\n\neach other.\"  The district court dismissed Palmer and  Palmer\r\n\nManagement's claim for lost  business damages on the  grounds\r\n\nthat PIN's lawsuit in violation of the Settlement  Agreements\r\n\n\"was  seemingly  in good  faith\"  and  \"was  not  frivolous.\"\r\n\nPenobscot Indian Nation v.

Palmer and  Palmer  Management\r\n\ncontend \r                   that \r                        Dodge v. United States Auto. Ass'n, 417 A.2d 969,\r\n\n975 (Me. 1980)  supports their claim  for damages other  than\r\n\nattorney's  fees.   In  Dodge,  the parties  entered  into  a\r\n\nsettlement \r                      agreement concerning a homeowners insurance policy.\r\n\nThe  agreement included  a  provision  releasing  all  claims\r\n\nstemming  from  the insurance  policy.    Subsequent  to  the\r\n\nexecution of the agreement, plaintiff filed suit against  the\r\n\ninsurance company.  The insurance company then responded with\r\n\n                            -49-\r                                         49\r\r\n\n\"a counterclaim for  specific performance  of the  settlement\r\n\nagreement and for damages resulting from [plaintiff's] . .  .\r\n\nbreach thereof,\" id. at 972, which \"consisted principally  of\r\n\nits attorney's fees incurred in defending the suit brought by\r\n\n[the  plaintiff]  .  .  .  in  violation  of  the  settlement\r\n\nagreement,\"  id. at 975.   The Superior  Court did not  order\r\n\nspecific shed by  the court's disposition of the main  claims\r\n\nasserted \r                    by \r                       [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 975.  The Superior Court\r\n\nalso \r                denied \r                       the insurance company's claim for attorney's fees.\r\n\nSee id.  \r\n\n          The insurance company cross-appealed these rulings,\r\n\nrecognizing that  if  the Maine  Supreme Court  affirmed  the\r\n\nSuperior \r                    Court's judgment, there would be no need to reach the\r\n\nissue of specific performance.  The Dodge court held:\r\n\n          Because of the pervasiveness and vigor of\r\n          the American rule making each party  bear\r\n          its own  attorney's  fees, parties  to  a\r\n          settlement--in  absence  of  an   express\r\n          contractual provision  to the  contrary--\r\n          must  be  taken  to  intend  to   exclude\r\n          attorney's  fees from  the  damages  that\r\n          otherwise  would  be  recoverable  as   a\r\n          foreseeable and probable consequence of a\r\n          breach of the agreement.\r\n\nId.\r               \r                \r                The \r                    Maine Supreme Court explained in detail its denial of\r\n\ndamages \r                   which normally attend a breach of contract in the case\r\n\nof the breach of a settlement agreement:    \r\n\n          An after-the fact rationalization for the\r\n          rule denying normal contract damages  for\r\n          breach of settlement agreements can  also\r\n          be \r                        developed \r                                  from the strong public policy\r\n          favoring such settlements.  Were the rule\r\n\n                            -50-\r                                         50\r\r\n\n          otherwise, a  lawyer would  be much  more\r\n          wary of  informal settlement  discussions\r\n          for fear of subjecting his client to  the\r\n          added  expense of  the  opposing  party's\r\n          attorney's   fees  if   it   were   later\r\n          determined that those discussions had  in\r\n          fact  reached  the  point  of  a  binding\r\n          bilateral \r                               agreement.  On balance it may be\r\n          preferable to  encourage free  settlement\r\n          negotiations, undampened  by the risk  of\r\n          the heavy damages that would be  assessed\r\n          in those relatively  few cases where  one\r\n          party fails to perform its agreement.\r\n\nId.  at 976.    The Dodge  court  thus denied  the  insurance\r\n\ncompany's cross-appeal in full.\r\n\n          Although it may be debatable whether Dodge resolved\r\n\nthe issue concerning the possibility of a non-breaching party\r\n\nrecovering  on a  breach  of  contract theory  the  costs  of\r\n\nlitigation, other than  attorney's fees,  resulting from  its\r\n\ndefense  of a  suit filed  in contravention  of a  settlement\r\n\nagreement, we need not take up this debate today.  Palmer and\r\n\nPalmer Management have not directed us to any Maine case that\r\n\ngrants damages of the variety that they seek, and we have not\r\n\nfound \r                 any \r                     such case on our own initiative.  We note that Maine\r\n\ndoes \r                recognize the remedy of specific performance in the event\r\n\nof a breach of a settlement agreement.  See McGuire, 495 A.2d\r\n\nat \r              798 \r                  (indicating that party may seek specific performance as\r\n\nremedy for breach of settlement agreement).  By ruling that S\r\n\n81 does not apply to the Settlement Agreements in this  case,\r\n\nand \r               thus \r                    that \r                        these \r                              Agreements preclude PIN's remaining claims,\r\n\nwe effectively have provided Palmer and Palmer Management the\r\n\n                            -51-\r                                         51\r\r\n\nequitable remedy of  specific performance  of the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements.\r\n\n          We \r                        need \r                             not \r                                 sift alternative sources of authority to\r\n\nresolve  the exact issue  of whether or  not the law  affords\r\n\ndamages in addition to specific performance in the event of a\r\n\nbreach \r                  of \r                     a \r                      settlement \r                                 agreement28 because no material issue of\r\n\nfact \r                exists \r                       as \r                         to \r                            the \r                                damages that Palmer and Palmer Management\r\n\nsustained as  a  result of  PIN's  breach of  the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements in this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson\r\n\n28.  We recognize that certain jurisdictions may permit a\r\nparty to sue for both specific performance and consequential\r\n\nSee, e.g.,           v.     , 428 N.W.2d 647, 658 (Iowa\r            damages in the case of the breach of a settlement agreement. \r                       Berryhill    Hatt\r\n1988); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts S 281(3)\r\n(1981).  Other jurisdictions, however, apparently require a\r\nparty to select between specific performance and monetary\r\ndamages in the event of a breach of a settlement agreement. \r\nSee, e.g., TNT Marketing, Inc. v. Agresti, 796 F.2d 276, 278\r\n(9th Cir. 1986).  Even those jurisdictions that appear to\r\nafford an aggrieved party the right to sue both for specific\r\nperformance and for consequential damages are not consistent\r\nin their approach.  In Village of Kaktovik v. Watt, 689 F.2d\r\n222 (D.C. Cir. 1982), for instance, the District of Columbia\r\nCircuit first stated:  \"Upon breach [of a settlement\r\nagreement] by one party, the other party may obtain damages\r\nor specific performance as appropriate.\"  Id. at 230; see\r\nalso Jackson v. Washington Monthly Co., 569 F.2d 119, 120 n.\r\n1 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  The Watt court then declared:  \"Upon\r\nanticipatory breach of a settlement contract . . . the non-\r\nbreaching party m[ay] choose . . . to enforce the agreement\r\nand perhaps also recover damages resulting from its breach .\r\n. . .\"  Id. at 231.  We therefore believe that further\r\nexposition of this issue, see Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l,\r\nInc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that\r\nwhen a state's highest court has not propounded on an issue\r\nin question, \"we seek guidance in analogous state court\r\ndecisions, persuasive adjudications by courts of sister\r\nstates, learned treatises, and public policy considerations\r\nidentified in state decisional law\"), would be of little\r\nbenefit in this case.\r\n\n                            -52-\r                                         52\r\r\n\nv.

Relying  o\r                    the district court  determined that Marcello was  not\r\n\nnegligent \r                     in \r                        drafting and circulating the press release to the\r\n\nmedia because he reasonably relied \"on the veracity of  PIN's\r\n\ncomplaint.\"   Id.  Finding  that Marcello's  conduct did  not\r\n\namount even to the negligence applicable to private  persons,\r\n\nthe district court did  not consider whether or not Key  Bank\r\n\nconstituted a public figure.  See id.  \r\n\n          Key Bank insists that  a genuine issue of  material\r\n\nfact \r                existed \r                        concerning whether or not Marcello was negligent.\r\n\nKey \r               Bank \r                    also \r                        argues \r                               that the district court improperly granted\r\n\nsummary judgment sua sponte on its defamation claims  against\r\n\nPIN,  Phillips, and  Pardilla.   The  other  cross-Appellants\r\n\n(Schiavi, Palmer, Palmer Development, and Palmer  Management)\r\n\n29.  As it did below, Key Bank argues that the following\r\nstatements, contained in the press release that Marcello\r\ndrafted and disseminated, are defamatory:  (1) the statement\r\nclaiming that \"money . . . had been stolen from\" PIN; (2) the\r\nstatement asserting that Key Bank \"conspired and acted to\r\ndefraud the Penobscot Nation;\" (3) the statement explaining\r\nthat \"the conduct of Key Bank . . . resulted in the Penobscot\r\nNation entering into an improvident and unconscionable\r\npartnership investment\" pursuant to which it \"relinquished\r\nits right, its land, and its money to those who plundered the\r\nPenobscot Nation, lied to the Penobscot Nation and its\r\nmembers, and stole from the Penobscot Nation and its\r\nmembers;\" (4) the statement positing that \"bad acts, fraud,\r\nand bad faith committed by Key Bank . . . against the\r\nPenobscot Nation is a far greater conspiracy than could have\r\nbeen outlined\" in the press conference; and (5) the statement\r\ninsisting that PIN \"suffered grave financial losses and later\r\nlearned that they have been victimized, manipulated, lied to,\r\nand used by Key Bank.\" \r\n\n                            -54-\r                                         54\r\r\n\necho Key Bank's objection to the district court's sua  sponte\r\n\nruling on their defamation claims against PIN.  They maintain\r\n\nthat this ruling constituted reversible error.\r\n\n          1.  Marcello\r\n\n          We \r                        first \r                             consider \r                                      whether the district court properly\r\n\ngranted \r                   summary judgment for Marcello on Key Bank's defamation\r\n\nclaim.  In order to state a claim for defamation in Maine,  a\r\n\nprivate \r                   person must establish the following:  \"(a) a false and\r\n\ndefamatory statement concerning another; (b) an  unprivileged\r\n\npublication to a third party; (c) fault amounting at least to\r\n\nnegligence on  the  part of  the  publisher; and  (d)  either\r\n\nactionability\r                         of the statement irrespective of special harm or\r\n\nthe existence  of special  harm caused  by the  publication.\"\r\n\nPowers, 596 A.2d at  69.  The issue  in this case is  whether\r\n\nMarcello's conduct constituted negligence.\r\n\n          We \r                        find \r                             that \r                                 the \r                                     existence of material issues of fact\r\n\nprecludes \r                     the entry of summary judgment concerning this issue.\r\n\nSee\r               \r               Lipsett\r                       \r                       v. \r                         University\r                                    of P.

Two conditions,  however,  circumscribe the  district\r\n\ncourt's exercise  of this power:   first,  discovery must  be\r\n\n\"sufficiently  advanced  that  the  parties  have  enjoyed  a\r\n\nreasonable opportunity to glean the material facts;\"  second,\r\n\nthe \r               district \r                        court must \"give[] the targeted party appropriate\r\n\nnotice and a chance to present its evidence on the  essential\r\n\nelements of the claim or  defense.\"  Id.; see also Stella  v.\r\n\nTewksbury\r                    , \r                      4 \r                       F.3d \r                            53, \r                                55 \r                                   (1st Cir. 1993); Jardines Bacata, Ltd.\r\n\n                            -62-\r                                         62\r\r\n\nv. Diaz-Marquez, 878 F.2d 1555, 1560 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\n\n          In this case, discovery had proceeded to the  point\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    parties understood the material facts.  PIN filed its\r\n\ncomplaint and conducted  the press  conferences in  September\r\n\n1994.  The district court did not make its sua sponte  ruling\r\n\nuntil October 1995.  By this time, the parties had compiled a\r\n\nvoluminous record  that included  depositions of  all of  the\r\n\nparties involved in the press conference.\r\n\n          As in Berkovitz, however, the district court  never\r\n\n\"gave the [cross-Appellants] a meaningful opportunity to cull\r\n\nthe  best evidence  supporting  [their] position[s],  and  to\r\n\npresent  that   evidence,  together   with  developed   legal\r\n\nargumentation\r                        , in opposition to the entry of summary judgment\"\r\n\nwith respect PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla.  Id. at 31.  On the\r\n\ncontrary, the district court's  sua sponte ruling took  these\r\n\nparties by  surprise;  only Marcello  had moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment and neither Schiavi nor the Palmer Defendants  filed\r\n\ndefamation claims against Marcello.32\r\n\n32.  Although Key Bank did have the opportunity to present\r\nits position with respect to Marcello, it did not in the case\r\nof PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla because none of these parties\r\nmoved for summary judgment.  Key Bank's argumentation may\r\nhave differed little in response to summary judgment motions\r\nfiled by PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla, given the similarity of\r\nthe facts and circumstances relating to its claims against\r\nthese parties.  The nature of PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla's\r\nrelationship to the conduct at issue as well as the defenses\r\nthat these parties now assert in response to Key Bank's\r\ndefamation claims, however, support Key Bank's argument that\r\nit would have responded differently to these parties had the\r\ndistrict court afforded it an opportunity to do so.

Like the appellant in\r\n\nBerkovitz\r                    , \r                     however, \r                              the \r                                  Palmer Defendants timely filed a motion\r\n\nto reconsider.  Although Key Bank and Schiavi did not  follow\r\n\nsuit, \r                 the \r                    considerations \r                                   that govern the filing of a motion for\r\n\nreconsideration are very flexible.  See Berkovitz, 89 F.3d at\r\n\n31; United  States v. Roberts, 978  F.2d 17, 21-22 (1st  Cir.\r\n\n1992).  In any event, neither the cases that Berkovitz  cites\r\n\nnor Rule  56 imposes an  obligation on the  subject of a  sua\r\n\nsponte summary judgment ruling to move for reconsideration in\r\n\norder to preserve its claims on appeal.  We therefore refrain\r\n\nfrom penalizing  Key  Bank and  Schiavi for  their  purported\r\n\noversight.  Because  the district court failed to afford  the\r\n\nStella, 4 F.3d at 56 (noting the special preparation\r\nnecessary to defend a motion for summary judgment). \r\nSignificantly, Key Bank did not present evidence, either in\r\nits written or in its oral defense to Marcello's summary\r\njudgment motion, concerning PIN, Phillips, or Pardilla.  See\r\nBerkovitz, 89 F.3d at 31 n.8 (reasoning that plaintiff at\r\nissue in Berkovitz did not have an opportunity to put forth\r\nevidence relating to summary judgment motion).  We thus\r\ninclude Key Bank in our disposition of the district court's\r\nsua sponte defamation rulings.     \r\n\n                            -64-\r                                         64\r\r\n\ncross-Appellants \r                            any \r                               opportunity to oppose its grant of summary\r\n\njudgment for PIN,  Phillips, and Pardilla, we hold that  this\r\n\nruling cannot stand.\r\n\nD.

Specifically,  Palmer\r\n\nmentions \r                    this issue only in the table of contents and a single\r\n\nheading of his Brief.  Other than these floating  references,\r\n\nPalmer  never  makes any  argument  in  his  principal  brief\r\n\nconcerning either  intentional  or  negligent  infliction  of\r\n\nemotional \r                     distress. \r                                \r                               \"It \r                                   is settled in this circuit that issues\r\n\nadverted \r                    to \r                       on \r                         appeal \r                                in \r                                   a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\r\n\nsome  developed  argumentation,  are  deemed  to  have   been\r\n\nabandoned.\"  Ryan v.

We believe that in so doing we also\r\n\ngive effect to  the intentions of those  who adopted S 81  in\r\n\n1872.\r\n\n          We affirm in part, reverse and vacate in part,  and\r\n\nremand \r                  to \r                     the \r                        district \r                                 court for further proceedings consistent\r\n\nwith this opinion.

Supp.\r\n\n13, \r               16-17 \r                     (D. \r                        Me. \r                            1995), \r                                   the complexity of this case compels us\r\n\nto sketch the necessary background information.\r\n\n          In 1983, Consumers  Water Company (\"CWC\")  acquired\r\n\nSchiavi Homes Corporation (\"SHC\"), a profitable Maine  mobile\r\n\nhome sales  business, from John  Schiavi (\"Schiavi\").   Under\r\n\nCWC's ownership, SHC continued  to operate successfully.   In\r\n\n1985, John Palmer (\"Palmer\") became SHC's new president.   In\r\n\nAugust 1985,  Palmer and his  wife, Mary  Anna, also  founded\r\n\nPalmer Development Corporation (\"Palmer Development\").   Like\r\n\nSHC, Palmer Development engaged in the sale of mobile homes \r\n\nthroughout Maine.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          In 1985, the Penobscot Indian Nation (\"PIN\")  hired\r\n\nTribal  Assets Management  (\"TAM\") to  locate, evaluate,  and\r\n\nrecommend potential investment opportunities.  Late in  1986,\r\n\nTAM \r               identified SHC as a potential PIN investment and conducted\r\n\na \r             detailed \r                      analysis \r                              of \r                                 SHC's viability as a successful business\r\n\nventure.    TAM  alerted PIN  that  SHC  constituted  a  good\r\n\ninvestment possibility, but cautioned PIN that the success of\r\n\nthe \r               venture \r                       would \r                            depend \r                                   largely on PIN's willingness to invest\r\n\nin new mobile home sites on which the mobile homes it sold to\r\n\nretail  customers  could  be  located.    PIN  expressed  its\r\n\nwillingness \r                       to use its lands and invest its resources for such\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          On  December 31,  1986, PIN  and Palmer  Management\r\n\nCorporation \r                       (\"Palmer \r                               Management\"), a corporation formed for the\r\n\npurpose of purchasing  SHC, executed a Partnership  Agreement\r\n\ncreating \r                    Schiavi Homes (\"Schiavi Homes\" or \"the Partnership\"),\r\n\na Maine  limited partnership.   Pursuant  to the  Partnership\r\n\nAgreement, PIN  became the  sole limited  partner and  Palmer\r\n\nManagement the sole general partner.1  PIN acquired a  ninety\r\n\npercent \r                   interest in Schiavi Homes.  Palmer Management received\r\n\nonly a  ten percent share but  secured full control over  all\r\n\nmanagement decisions.\r\n\n1.  Prior to the purchase, TAM informed PIN that Palmer had\r\nbeen the president of SHC.  PIN also knew both that Palmer\r\nand his wife owned Palmer Development and that Palmer\r\nDevelopment engaged in business activities similar to those\r\nof SHC.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Also on December 31, 1986, the Partnership executed\r\n\na \r             Purchase \r                      and Sale Agreement with SHC, which provided for the\r\n\nPartnership's  purchase of  SHC's  assets  and  business  for\r\n\napproximately $5  million.  Key  Bank of  Maine (\"Key  Bank\")\r\n\nfinanced \r                    the \r                        purchase on the condition that Palmer retain full\r\n\nmanagement \r                      control over Schiavi Homes.  Key Bank also insisted\r\n\nthat \r                PIN \r                    post a $1 million letter of credit to secure its loan\r\n\nand agree  to restrictions on  the withdrawal  of funds  from\r\n\nSchiavi Homes.\r\n\n          As part  of its  purchase of  SHC, the  Partnership\r\n\nsecured three non-competition agreements.  CWC entered into a\r\n\nnon-competition agreement with Schiavi Homes and assigned  to\r\n\nthe Partnership its  interest in an existing  non-competition\r\n\nagreement  with Schiavi,  which it  obtained at  the time  it\r\n\noriginally acquired  the business.   Palmer signed a  similar\r\n\nagreement with the Partnership.\r\n\n          Schiavi Homes  fared  poorly  from  its  inception.\r\n\nAlthough sales of mobile  homes in Maine reached an all  time\r\n\nhigh \r                during \r                       this \r                           time, \r                                 by the end of 1987 Schiavi Homes' market\r\n\nshare had declined from eighteen to eight percent.  Over  the\r\n\ncourse  of  its  three  year  existence,  PIN  made   several\r\n\ninvestments \r                       in \r                         Schiavi \r                                 Homes in an attempt to buoy its business\r\n\nfortunes.  Most significantly, in October 1987, PIN signed  a\r\n\nLease-Option  Agreement with  Schiavi Homes  leasing for  the\r\n\nnominal fee of $1 per  year a twenty-four acre tract of  real\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nproperty \r                    (the \r                        \"Holden \r                                Lot\") that PIN purchased during this same\r\n\n onth. \r                   \r                   The \r                      Lease-Option \r                                   Agreement afforded the Partnership the\r\n\noption\r            m       to  purchase  the  Holden  Lot  for  $100,000.    PIN\r\n\nsubsequently invested approximately  $135,000 to develop  the\r\n\nHolden Lot  for purposes of the  Schiavi Homes business.   In\r\n\nDecember 1988, with Schiavi Homes unable to make its  regular\r\n\nmonthly \r                   loan \r                        payment \r                               of \r                                  principal and interest to Key Bank, the\r\n\nPartnership pledged the Lease-Option Agreement to Key Bank.\r\n\n          In April 1989, acting on the advice of its counsel,\r\n\nBernstein, \r                      Shur, Sawyer &amp; Nelson (\"Bernstein\"), PIN decided to\r\n\nliquidate \r                     Schiavi Homes.  As part of the liquidation plan, PIN\r\n\nand Palmer then assigned Schiavi Homes' assets to Key Bank.\r\n\nIn \r              May \r                  1989, \r                       Key \r                           Bank \r                                notified PIN that it intended to exercise\r\n\nthe purchase option contained in the Lease-Option Agreement.2\r\n\nAt \r              this \r                   time, \r                        Key \r                            Bank \r                                 also initiated three foreclosure actions\r\n\nwith respect to real property that the Partnership owned  and\r\n\nencumbered \r                      with \r                          mortgage \r                                   deeds given to Key Bank in conjunction\r\n\nwith the initial financing of SHC's purchase.\r\n\n          On  September  29,  1989,  PIN  entered  into   two\r\n\ncomprehensive\r                         Settlement Agreements with Schiavi, SHC, Schiavi\r\n\n2.  \r\nThe Area Director of the Eastern Area Office of the Bureau of\r\nIndian Affairs, George Big Eagle, approved the transfer of\r\nthe Holden Lot to Key Bank pursuant to Title IV of the Indian\r\nFinancing Act of 1974, 25 U.S.C. SS 1451-1543, which forbids,\r\nwithout written consent, any transfer or disposal of a\r\nproject being improved with federal grant funds within three\r\nyears of the use of such funds.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nHomes, \r                  Palmer, \r                         Palmer \r                                Management, Key Bank, Burlington Homes of\r\n\nNew England3  (\"Burlington  Homes\"),  and  CWC  (collectively\r\n\n\"Appellees\").  PIN,  Schiavi Homes,  Schiavi, Palmer,  Palmer\r\n\nManagement,  and  Key  Bank  executed  the  first  Settlement\r\n\nAgreement (\"first Settlement Agreement\"); PIN, Schiavi Homes,\r\n\nSHC, Palmer, Palmer Management, Key Bank, CWC, and Burlington\r\n\nHomes  executed  the  second  Settlement  Agreement  (\"second\r\n\nSettlement \r                      Agreement\"). \r                                   \r                                   The two agreements contained identical\r\n\nlanguage that served broadly to \"release, remise and  forever\r\n\ndischarge\" \r                      all \r                         claims \r                                involving the signatories.  Subsequent to\r\n\nthe \r               signing \r                       of \r                         the \r                             two \r                                 Settlement Agreements, legal proceedings\r\n\nderiving from the operation of Schiavi Homes ceased.\r\n\n          The ensuing period of  calm ended on September  14,\r\n\n1994, \r                 when \r                      PIN \r                         filed \r                               the \r                                   lawsuit underlying this appeal.  PIN's\r\n\nsuit stemmed from an  investigation of Key Bank's  activities\r\n\nrelating \r                    to \r                       Schiavi Homes that Penobscot County Deputy Sheriff\r\n\nCarl Andrews conducted between approximately 1993 and  1994.4\r\n\n3.  Burlington Homes of New England, a subsidiary of CWC,\r\nmanufactured mobile homes.  SHC, Schiavi Homes, and Palmer\r\nDevelopment all sold homes that Burlington manufactured.\r\n\n4.  The record does not reveal the exact duration, scope, or\r\nfindings of the investigation.  Andrews testified that he\r\nprovided the Maine Attorney General's office with a three\r\npage report summarizing his findings, but he did not divulge\r\nthe report's contents to PIN.  No party submitted this report\r\ninto evidence; in fact, it is not apparent from the record\r\nthat the results of the investigation were set out in writing\r\nor were made known to the public.  It is clear, however, that\r\nno criminal proceedings of any kind resulted from Andrews'\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nPIN alleges that Andrews' investigation revealed  substantial\r\n\nimproprieties on the part of PIN's business associates in the\r\n\nSchiavi Homes venture.  Also on September 14, 1994, PIN  held\r\n\ntwo press  conferences,  one in  Bangor,  Maine, and  one  in\r\n\nPortland, Maine,  to announce the  filing of  its lawsuit  in\r\n\nfederal  district  court.    Michael  Marcello,  PIN's  media\r\n\nrelations \r                     consultant, \r                                prepared the statements that PIN Governor\r\n\nReuben Phillips and  PIN Lieutenant Governor Gerald  Pardilla\r\n\nread at the two press conferences.  Marcello also distributed\r\n\nthe text of the statements to members of the media.\r\n\n          PIN's \r                           complaint contained nine counts and named nine\r\n\ndefendants.  Most importantly for our purposes, the complaint\r\n\nalleged that the two Settlement Agreements signed by PIN  and\r\n\nthe  Appellees were  void because  they did  not receive  the\r\n\nSecretary of the Interior's approval pursuant to 25 U.S.C.  S\r\n\n81.5  SHC filed a motion to dismiss PIN's claims.  Key  Bank,\r\n\nSchiavi, Palmer, Palmer Development, Palmer Management,  CWC,\r\n\nand Burlington Homes moved for summary judgment.\r\n\n5.  PIN's complaint also alleged the following:  (1) breach\r\nof duty of good faith and fair dealing (against Key Bank,\r\nCWC, SHC, Burlington, Schiavi, Palmer, and Palmer\r\nManagement); (2) breach of contract (against Schiavi); (3)\r\nmisrepresentation (against CWC, SHC, Burlington, Schiavi, and\r\nPalmer); (4) fraud (against Bernstein); (5) negligence\r\n(against Bernstein); (6) breach of fiduciary duty (against\r\nKey Bank, Palmer, and Palmer Management); and (7) RICO\r\nviolations (against Key Bank, CWC, Burlington, Bernstein,\r\nSchiavi, Palmer, Palmer Management, and Palmer Development).\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Palmer, Palmer Development, Palmer Management  (the\r\n\n\"Palmer \r                   Defendants\"), \r                                Key Bank, and Schiavi filed counterclaims\r\n\nagainst PIN for defamation and punitive damages based on  the\r\n\nalleged defamation stemming from the September 14, 1994 press\r\n\nconferences.   Key  Bank filed  counterclaims for  defamation\r\n\nagainst Marcello, Phillips, and Pardilla.  Also deriving from\r\n\nthese \r                 press \r                       conferences, Palmer asserted counterclaims against\r\n\nPIN  for intentional  and negligent  infliction of  emotional\r\n\ndistress.     Both   Palmer  and   Palmer  Management   filed\r\n\ncounterclaims \r                         against \r                                PIN for breach of contract, alleging that\r\n\nPIN's suit violated the  release contained in the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements. \r                        \r                        Only Marcello responded with a motion for summary\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          The district court  (Brody, J.)  concluded that  25\r\n\nU.S.C. S  81  did not  apply  to the  Settlement  Agreements.\r\n\nDetermining that the Settlement Agreements constituted  valid\r\n\nreleases, the district court granted summary judgment for the\r\n\ndefendants \r                      with respect to all of PIN's claims.  See Penobscot\r\n\nIndian \r                  Nation, \r                         906 \r                             F. \r                                Supp. at 20-21.  Treating SHC's motion to\r\n\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment, the district  court\r\n\nseparately granted  summary  judgment for  SHC based  on  the\r\n\nbinding \r                   nature \r                          of \r                            the \r                                Settlement Agreements.  See id. at 21-22.\r\n\nThe district court also ruled that the statute of limitations\r\n\nbarred PIN's RICO claims.  See id. at 21.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          The \r                         district \r                                  court \r                                       then \r                                            considered the counterclaims.\r\n\nFinding that Key Bank did not allege facts demonstrating even\r\n\n      ence  on Marcello's  part, the  district court  granted\r\n\nMarcello's \r                      motion \r                            for \r                                summary judgment on Key Bank's defamation\r\n\n    terclaim.       \r            neglig\r            coun            See id. at  23.  Despite  the fact that  only\r\n\nMarcello filed  a motion for  summary judgment, the  district\r\n\ncourt proceeded to grant summary judgment sua sponte for  PIN\r\n\nand  the  remaining  cross-Appellees  with  respect  to   the\r\n\ndefamation \r                      claims.6  See id.  Judge Brody also awarded summary\r\n\njudgment sua sponte for PIN and the other cross-Appellees  on\r\n\nthe punitive damage counterclaims.  See id. at 24.   Finally,\r\n\nthe district court granted PIN's motion for summary  judgment\r\n\nwith respect to the emotional distress and breach of contract\r\n\nclaims. \r                    \r                    See\r                        \r                        Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, Civ. No. 94-\r\n\n0212-B (D. Me. Dec. 13, 1995).\r\n\n          In  the spring  of 1996,  PIN's malpractice  claims\r\n\nagainst Bernstein  went to  trial before  a jury.   The  jury\r\n\nreturned a verdict in favor of Bernstein.  The district court\r\n\nthen entered a final judgment resolving all claims on May  7,\r\n\n1996.  These appeals ensued.7  \r\n\n6.  The Palmer Defendants immediately filed a motion for\r\nreconsideration, which the district court subsequently denied \r\nSee Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, Civ. No. 94-0212-B,\r\n1 (D. Me. Dec. 13, 1995).\r\n\n7.  PIN did not appeal the adverse judgment respecting either\r\nits RICO claims or its other claims against Bernstein. \r\nCross-Appellants did not appeal the district court's sua\r\nsponte ruling as to punitive damages.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n          The district court  must grant summary judgment  if\r\n\n\"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on file, together  with the affidavits . . .  show\r\n\nthat \r                there \r                      is \r                        no \r                           genuine \r                                   issue as to any material fact and that\r\n\nthe \r               moving \r                      party \r                           is \r                              entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\n\nFed.

We begin by resolving an issue of first impression  in\r\n\nthis Circuit:  whether  25 U.S.C. S 81 applies to  agreements\r\n\nrelative \r                    to \r                       lands that an Indian tribe purchases in fee simple\r\n\nfor investment  purposes.   We then  determine whether  PIN's\r\n\nfiling \r                  of \r                     this action in 1994 constituted an actionable breach\r\n\nof contract.   Subsequently, we  decide whether the  district\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\ncourt \r                 erred \r                      in \r                         concluding that the statements Marcello prepared\r\n\nand  individual  PIN officials  announced  to  the  press  in\r\n\nSeptember 1994 did not amount to defamation.  Thereafter,  we\r\n\ntouch upon  the issue of whether  PIN's conduct at the  press\r\n\nconferences  constituted  either  intentional  or   negligent\r\n\ninfliction \r                      of \r                        emotional \r                                  distress.  Finally, we evaluate whether\r\n\nthe \r               district \r                        court \r                             has \r                                 jurisdiction to hear the remaining state\r\n\nlaw claims at issue in this case.\r\n\nA.

PIN insists that S  81\r\n\napplies \r                   not \r                       only to the two Settlement Agreements, but also to\r\n\nthe agreements  pertaining to the  creation and operation  of\r\n\nSchiavi Homes, specifically the Asset Purchase Agreement, the\r\n\nPartnership Agreement, and  the Lease-Option Agreement.   PIN\r\n\ntherefore \r                     reasons that the Settlement Agreements, the Purchase\r\n\nand Sale  Agreement, and the  Lease-Option Agreement are  not\r\n\nbinding.   PIN also  contends that  the Secretary  improperly\r\n\ndetermined  that  S  81 did  not  apply  to  the  Partnership\r\n\nAgreement.\r\n\n          Significantly, if the Settlement Agreements are not\r\n\nvalid because they  never received  the Secretary's  approval\r\n\npursuant to S 81, PIN may pursue its remaining claims against\r\n\nthe  Appellees.    If, on  the  other  hand,  the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements  do not fall  within the parameters  of S 81,  PIN\r\n\n8.  In addition to technical amendments to S 81, Congress\r\npassed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. SS 2701-\r\n2721, which provides in part:  \"The authority of the\r\nSecretary under section 81 of this title, relating to\r\nmanagement contracts regulated pursuant to this chapter, is\r\nhereby transferred to the [National Indian Gaming]\r\nCommission.\"  25 U.S.C. S 2711(h).\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nconcedes that its remaining  non-S 81 claims fail due to  the\r\n\nbinding nature  of the Settlement  Agreements.  We  therefore\r\n\nbegin our analysis by evaluating the applicability of S 81 to\r\n\nthe Settlement Agreements.\r\n\n          1.  Settlement Agreements  \r\n\n          Without \r                             regard \r                                    to \r                                      S \r                                        81, \r                                            the two Settlement Agreements\r\n\nconstituted  valid  releases.    Both  Settlement  Agreements\r\n\nprovided  that  the  parties  \"release,  remise  and  forever\r\n\ndischarge each other . . . from all suits . . .  at law or in\r\n\nequity \r                  . \r                    . \r                     . \r                       which \r                             directly or indirectly relate[] to . . . any\r\n\n. . . transactions . . . among each other.\"  Whether or not S\r\n\n81 \r              pertains \r                       to \r                         and \r                             thus \r                                  voids the Settlement Agreements depends\r\n\nupon whether either  or both constitute an agreement with  an\r\n\nIndian tribe for services  relative to Indian lands.

This argument  is unavailing.   PIN's\r\n\nLieutenant \r                      Governor signed both Settlement Agreements as PIN's\r\n\npersonal representative,  not  as the  Partnership's  Limited\r\n\nPartner.

The first  Settlement\r\n\nAgreement is not relative to Indian lands because it  neither\r\n\npertained nor referred  to any land  whatsoever.  The  second\r\n\nSettlement Agreement, however, both involved and referred  to\r\n\nland that an  Indian tribe owned.

At first glance, S 81 may appear to apply to the Holden\r\n\nLot because PIN, an Indian tribe, owned this parcel of  land.\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nWe believe, however, that the meaning of S 81's language, the\r\n\nintentions  of   its  drafters,   the  Interior   Secretary'\r\n\n               of  S 81,  the case  law from  o-determinatio\r\n\n                       e statute does not apply to the Holden\r                                                                        s\r            interpretation                                              n\r            support \r                   a \r                     holding \r                            that \r                                 th\r\n\nLot.

SS 1721-1735, indicates that\r\n\nthe Holden  Lot constitutes Indian  fee land  over which  the\r\n\nfederal \r                   government \r                             does \r                                  not have a trust responsibility because\r\n\nthe \r               Lot \r                   does \r                       not \r                           lie \r                               within designated PIN Territory.  In fact,\r\n\nCongress expressly disavowed trust responsibility for  Indian\r\n\nreal \r                property encompassing the area in which the Holden Lot is\r\n\nsituated.\r                    11\r                       \r                        \r                        Accordingly, we find that PIN held the Holden Lot\r\n\n11.  25 U.S.C. S 1724(d)(3) provides:  \"Land or natural\r\nresources acquired outside the boundaries of [Penobscot\r\nIndian Territory] . . . shall be held in fee by the\r\nrespective tribe or nation, and the United States shall have\r\nno further trust responsibility with respect thereto.\"  25\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nin fee simple.  We now  consider the impact this fact has  on\r\n\nwhether S 81 applies to the second Settlement Agreement.  \r\n\n          This \r                          inquiry \r                                  necessitates that we first consider the\r\n\nstatute's text.   See United States  v. Gonzales, 117 S.  Ct.\r\n\n1032, 1034 (1997).

See id. at 229.  According to\r\n\none  such text,  the term  \"Indian lands\"  refers to  \"[r]eal\r\n\nproperty ceded to the U.S. by Indians, commonly to be held in\r\n\ntrust \r                 for \r                     Indians.\" \r                               \r                               Blac\r                                   k's Law Dictionary 771 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n\nThe definition of  Indian tribal or  trust land is  virtually\r\n\nidentical:  \"real propt 772.12\r\n\n          In the  context of S  81, the  phrase \"relative  to\r\n\n[Indian] lands\" is understood to refer to Indian trust lands.\r\n\nSee Cohen's Handbook at 318 n.293 (explaining that \"25 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 81[] prohibit[s]  contracts with  Indian tribes  concerning\r\n\ntrust property unless approved by the Commissioner of  Indian\r\n\naffairs\") (emphasis  added);  Patrick K.

The  two  statements\r\n\naddressing the application  of S 81 may be read  differently:\r\n\nSenator Harlan's description  may indicate  that the  statute\r\n\napplies solely  to lands  over which  the federal  government\r\n\nexercises   a  trust   responsibility;   Senator   Casserly's\r\n\nexplanation may mean that the statute applies to Indian lands\r\n\ngenerally. \r                       \r                       To reconcile this ambiguity, and thus to parse the\r\n\nordinary meaning of S 81 at the time of its ratification,  we\r\n\nconsider the understanding of the status of Indian lands that\r\n\nprevailed at the time Congress passed S 81.13  See  Oliphant,\r\n\n13.  Our determination to further consider the nature of\r\nIndian land ownership during this time in order to properly\r\ninterpret the phrase \"relative to [Indian] lands\" would be\r\nappropriate even if we read Senator Harlan's statement in the\r\ndisjunctive, rather than in the conjunctive as the sentence\r\nwas recorded.  That is, if we read the phrase \"relating to\r\nthe land or annuities that they hold under or derive from the\r\nUnited States\" so that the qualifying statement \"that they\r\nhold under or derive from the United States\" qualifies only\r\nthe word \"annuities\" but not the words \"the land,\" we still\r\nwould have learned little more concerning the definition of\r\n\"Indian lands.\"  Such a reading, though tortured, would\r\nresolve the ambiguity between the drafters' two statements\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\n435 U.S. at 206.\r\n\n          In 1872,  when Congress  passed S  81, federal  law\r\n\nprovided that Indian tribes enjoyed the right to possess  and\r\n\noccupy  lands but  not to  alienate these  lands without  the\r\n\nfederal government's approval.

It was not until the legal relationship between Indian\r\ntribes and the federal government evolved dramatically in the\r\ntwentieth century that legislation regulating Indian tribes'\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\nCongress did not distinguish  between Indian trust lands  and\r\n\nIndian fee lands at  this time presumably because it did  not\r\n\ncontemplate that Indian tribes could hold land in fee simple.\r\n\n          During this time, however, Congress did provide for\r\n\nindividual Indians to hold land in fee simple.  See 25 U.S.C.\r\n\nSS 348-349 (1887).  The allotment process that these statutes\r\n\nauthorized permitted the  Secretary to transfer certain  real\r\n\nproperty to individual Indians.  Typically, the United States\r\n\nwould hold such lands in trust for the designated individuals\r\n\nfor a period of twenty-five years.  See Sam Pelican, 232 U.S.\r\n\nat 447.  The Secretary, at his discretion, could \"cause to be\r\n\nissued \r                  to \r                     such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter\r\n\nall restrictions as to sale, incumbrance, or taxation of said\r\n\nland shall  be removed.\"   25 U.S.C.  S 349.   Despite  these\r\n\nstatutes'  provision  for  individual  Indians'  fee   simple\r\n\nownership of real property, we have unearthed no  legislation\r\n\nreal property routinely distinguished between restricted and\r\nunrestricted tribal lands.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. S 1360(b)\r\n(1953) (referring specifically to the \"alienation,\r\nencumbrance, or taxation of any real or personal property . .\r\n. that is held in trust by the United States or is subject to\r\na restriction against alienation imposed by the United\r\nStates\"); 25 U.S.C. S 415 (1955) (referring specifically to\r\n\"restricted Indian lands\").  Modern statutes routinely\r\ndistinguish between Indian trust lands and Indian fee lands. \r\nSee, e.g., 25 U.S.C. S 1724(d)(3) (1980) (distinguishing\r\nbetween Indian trust lands and Indian fee lands, and\r\nindicating that the United States does not have \"trust\r\nresponsibility\" with respect to the latter); 25 U.S.C. S 1466\r\n(1974) (indicating that Indian tribes can purchase real\r\nproperty \"without any restriction on alienation, control, or\r\nuse\").\r\n\n                            -25-\r                                         25\r\r\n\nenacted \r                   during \r                          this \r                              time \r                                   that afforded similar rights to Indian\r\n\ntribes.  See Cohen's Handbook at 36 &amp; n.78.\r\n\n          Interpreting S 81  and its  legislative history  in\r\n\nlight of  the  understandings and  assumptions of  those  who\r\n\ndrafted it, see Oliphant, 435 U.S. at 206, thus supports  the\r\n\nconclusion \r                      that S 81 does not pertain to the Holden Lot.  When\r\n\nCongress passed S 81  it did not envision that Indian  tribes\r\n\ncould hold land in the  manner that PIN held the Holden  Lot.\r\n\nCf. Cohen's Handbook at  127-43 (concluding that during  this\r\n\ntime \r                \"extensive government supervisory power over the everyday\r\n\nlife of  Indians was essentially  unchecked\").  It  therefore\r\n\nwould  seem  anomalous, in  endeavoring  to  give  effect  to\r\n\nCongress' intent, to apply S 81 to lands PIN purchased in fee\r\n\nsimple for investment purposes.\r\n\n          Admittedly, the broad remedial purposes that S 81's\r\n\ndrafters  attributed  to  the  statute  may  complicate  this\r\n\nanalysis.   Congress desired  to protect  Indian tribes  from\r\n\nunscrupulous \r                        business practices, see Cong. Globe 41st Cong. at\r\n\n1485-86, and enjoyed  the sole right  to encumber all  Indian\r\n\nlands, see Oneida Indian Nation v.

To our knowledge,\r\n\nCongress has adopted  no such exemption.

The Seventh Circuit\r\n\nemphasized the fact that the non-Indian contracting party did\r\n\nnot  have exclusive  control of  the facility  and that  \"the\r\n\nbusiness derived  no  special benefit  from its  location  on\r\n\nReservation land.\"  Id. at 812.\r\n\n          Considering the present case in light of  Altheimer\r\n\ncompels \r                   two \r                      initial \r                              observations.  First, the second Settlement\r\n\nAgreement obviously did not constitute a management contract.\r\n\nSecond, importing the precise considerations pertinent to  an\r\n\nevaluation  of a  management contract  to an  analysis of  an\r\n\nagreement  to assist  in locating  a purchaser  for land  may\r\n\npresent \r                   certain difficulties.

Specifically,\r\n\nthe \r               Altheimer\r                         court refused to find the agreement \"relative to\r\n\n[Indian] lands\" in part because the Indian tribe in Altheimer\r\n\nremained \r                    involved in the business relationship.  In this case,\r\n\nPIN  participated  in  the  Partnership,  not  through  daily\r\n\nmanagement \r                      duties, \r                             but \r                                 through financing and leasing activities\r\n\npromoting  Schiavi   Homes'   business  activities.      More\r\n\nimportantly, Altheimer emphasized  the fact that the  subject\r\n\nmatter of the  contract derived no  special benefit from  the\r\n\nIndian  tribe's sovereign  status.   See  id.  at 812.    The\r\n\nAltheimer court explained:   \"Unlike bingo, manufacturers  of\r\n\nlatex medical products need not seek refuge from state  civil\r\n\nlaws by locating on a reservation.\"   Id.  In this case,  the\r\n\nparties to the second Settlement Agreement derived no special\r\n\nbenefit from PIN's sovereign status.16\r\n\n          Notwithstanding the fact  that Altheimer, like  the\r\n\nother cases we have considered, supports the conclusion  that\r\n\n16.  We note that when the land at issue constitutes Indian\r\nfee land it is difficult for the subject matter of the\r\ncontract to derive a special benefit from the Indian tribe's\r\nsovereignty because Indian tribes do not have the same powers\r\nand privileges with respect to Indian fee lands that they do\r\nin the context of Indian trust lands.

We pursue this inquiry to deter potential\r\n\nabuse \r                 stemming from the execution of a settlement agreement in\r\n\nthe context  of S  81.   We are  particularly concerned  that\r\n\nparties to an agreement for services relative to Indian trust\r\n\nlands may seek to avoid securing Secretarial approval of such\r\n\nagreement  pursuant to S  81 by executing  a relet that  this\r\n\nrelease did not constitute an agreement with an Indian  tribe\r\n\nfor services relative  to Indian lands, and that the  release\r\n\nfunctions to prohibit any action that a party to the  release\r\n\ninitiates  subsequently  to  void  the  underlying  agreement\r\n\npursuant \r                    to \r                       S \r                        81.22\r                              \r                               \r                               To \r                                  avoid creating a potential safe harbor,\r\n\n22.  Even if such a release did preclude a party's action to\r\ninvalidate the underlying agreement pursuant to S 81, as in\r\nthe instant case, S 81's qui tam provision would permit\r\nanother party to bring suit in the name of the United States\r\nto invalidate the underlying agreements if these underlying\r\n\n                            -42-\r                                         42\r\r\n\nwe evaluate the three underlying agreements at issue in  this\r\n\ncase  to  determine whether  or  not  they  necessitated  the\r\n\nSecretary's approval pursuant to S 81.\r\n\n               a.  Asset Purchase Agreement\r\n\n          The  Asset  Purchase  Agreement23  constituted  the\r\n\noperative agreement relating to the Partnership's purchase of\r\n\nSHC. \r                 \r                 This \r                     Agreement \r                               was \r                                   a pure sales contract.  Without regard\r\n\nto whether  S  81's \"services\"  component pertains  to  sales\r\n\ncontracts, see Menominee Tribe, 233 U.S. at 570-71 (finding S\r\n\n81 applicable to  contract for sale of logging equipment  and\r\n\nsupplies); but see Hall, 825 F. Supp. at 1431-32 (ruling that\r\n\n\"Congress  did  not  intend  that  section  81  govern  sales\r\n\ncontracts\"),  the  only  real  property  that  the  Agreement\r\n\nmentioned was real property that the seller, SHC,  possessed,\r\n\nnot land that an Indian tribe, specifically PIN, owned.

PIN refers both to the Asset Purchase Agreement and to\r\n\"associated contracts and documentation\" as being void ab\r\ninitio pursuant to S 81.  The Partnership executed a Non-\r\nCompetition and Consulting Agreement with John Schiavi on\r\nDecember 30, 1996.  Although this Agreement did provide for\r\nservices, in the form of consulting duties, it never\r\nmentioned and did not relate to any Indian lands.  The non-\r\ncompetition agreements that the Partnership executed with CWC\r\nsimilarly did not pertain to any Indian lands.  Section 81,\r\ntherefore, does not apply to these \"associated contracts and\r\ndocumentation.\"\r\n\n                            -43-\r                                         43\r\r\n\nmillion \r                   guaranteed loan from Key Bank; it neither required nor\r\n\nreferred \r                    to \r                       PIN's use of its land as collateral for this loan.\r\n\n               b.  Partnership Agreement\r\n\n          We \r                        find \r                             that \r                                 the \r                                     Partnership Agreement did constitute\r\n\na \r             services \r                     agreement \r                               because it contained a provision dictating\r\n\nthat \r                Palmer \r                       enjoyed \r                              sole \r                                   responsibility for managing SHC to the\r\n\nbenefit of both Palmer and PIN.  See Koberstein, 762 F.2d  at\r\n\n619  (finding  that  S  81  governs  management   contracts).\r\n\nNonetheless,  despite  PIN's   assertion  that  the   parties\r\n\nenvisioned the use  of PIN's lands to advance SHC's  business\r\n\nactivities, the  Partnership Agreement  neither  specifically\r\n\nmentioned \r                     nor \r                        indirectly \r                                   referenced any use of land.  It merely\r\n\nstated \r                  that \r                       PIN would provide a $1 million Letter of Credit to\r\n\nsecure Key Bank's Guaranteed  Loan financing the purchase  of\r\n\nSHC.   The Partnership  Agreement, therefore,  does not  fall\r\n\nwithin \r                  the \r                      parameters \r                                of \r                                   S 81 because it does not constitute an\r\n\nagreement   for   services  relative   to  Indian   lands.24 \r\n\n          Because the service that the Partnership  Agreement\r\n\nprovided for  entailed  the  management of  SHC,  we  briefly\r\n\nevaluate \r                    this Agreement in light of Altheimer, which addressed\r\n\nthe applicability of S 81 to a management agreement.  See 983\r\n\nF.2d \r                at \r                   811. \r                         The relevant Altheimer factors indicate that the\r\n\n24.  As previously noted, the parties to the Partnership\r\nAgreement submitted this Agreement for the Secretary's\r\napproval pursuant to S 81.  The Secretary specifically\r\ndetermined that S 81 did not pertain to the Agreement.\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                         44\r\r\n\nPartnership Agreement  does not fall  within S 81's  purview.\r\n\nSpecifically, the Partnership Agreement did not relate to the\r\n\nmanagement of a facility to be located on Indian lands,  and,\r\n\neven if it did, the operation of such facility would not have\r\n\ndepended in  any way  on  PIN's legal  status as  a  separate\r\n\nsovereign.  See id.\r\n\n               c.  Lease-Option Agreement\r\n\n          The Lease-Option Agreement, unlike the  Partnership\r\n\nAgreement, did not pertain  to \"services\" relative to  Indian\r\n\nlands.25  The Lease-Option simply provided that Schiavi Homes\r\n\nenjoyed the right to use  and improve the Holden Lot for  the\r\n\npurpose of conducting its business.  It also afforded Schiavi\r\n\nHomes an option to purchase the Holden Lot.  The Lease-Option\r\n\nnever  mentioned and  did  not  relate to  the  provision  of\r\n\nservices.  In addition, although it did involve real property\r\n\nthat \r                PIN \r                    owned (the Holden Lot), as previously noted this land\r\n\nwas \r               not \r                   within the parameters of S 81 because it was not trust\r\n\nland.   Even if  the Holden Lot  did constitute Indian  trust\r\n\nlands, S  81 would not  apply to  the Lease-Option  Agreement\r\n\n25.  The Assignment of Lease executed on December 1, 1988,\r\ntransferring Schiavi Homes' entire interest in the Lease, and\r\nparticularly the option to purchase the Holden Lot, to Key\r\nBank as additional collateral for the repayment of its\r\nGuaranteed Loan in the amount of $3,500,000 did not require\r\nSecretarial approval under S 81.  This agreement did not\r\nentail any services and pertained only to the Holden Lot not\r\nto PIN's trust lands.  On July 20, 1989, moreover, PIN\r\nsecured Bureau of Indian Affairs approval for this Assignment\r\npursuant to Title IV of the Indian Financing Act of 1974, 25\r\nU.S.C. SS 1521-1524.\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                         45\r\r\n\nbecause \r                   the \r                       Maine \r                            Indian \r                                   Claims Settlement Act provided that 25\r\n\nU.S.C.  SS  396  &amp; 415  would  govern  leases  involving  PIN\r\n\nterritory.  See 25 U.S.C. S 1724(g)(3)(A)&amp;(B) (providing that\r\n\n25 U.S.C.  SS  396a-396g &amp;  415-415d  govern leasing  of  PIN\r\n\nTerritory); see also Koberstein, 762 F.2d at 619  (indicating\r\n\nthat S 81  governs transactions relative to Indian lands  for\r\n\nwhich Congress has not passed a specific statute).\r\n\nB.  Breach of Contract\r\n\n          Palmer and Palmer Management assert that by  filing\r\n\nthe  instant suit,  PIN breached  the contractual  obligation\r\n\nmemorialized  in the  Settlement Agreements  to \"release  all\r\n\nclaims.\"  In  their counterclaim, these two  cross-Appellants\r\n\nsought damages from this  purported breach deriving from  the\r\n\n\"loss of time that could otherwise be spent in the pursuit of\r\n\nlegitimate business interests.\"  On appeal, Palmer and Palmer\r\n\nManagement request damages \"caused by the lawsuit outside  of\r\n\nattorney \r                    fees.\"\r                         26\r                            \r                             \r                             Because we find the Settlement Agreements to\r\n\nconstitute \r                      valid \r                           releases not within the parameters of S 81, we\r\n\nnow \r               consider \r                        Palmer and Palmer Management's breach of contract\r\n\ncounterclaims.\r\n\n26.  The district court devoted the majority of its analysis\r\nto the issue of whether a party may recover attorney's fees\r\nfor the breach of a settlement agreement's release of claims. \r\nThe district court found that a party could not recover such\r\nattorney's fees in the defense of a suit that itself\r\nconstituted a breach of a settlement agreement.  See\r\nPenobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, Civ. No. 94-0212-B, at 6\r\n(D. Me. Dec. 13, 1995).  Neither Palmer nor Palmer Management\r\nraises this issue on appeal.\r\n\n                            -46-\r                                         46\r\r\n\n                            -47-\r                                         47\r\r\n\n          Both Settlement  Agreements  state:   \"The  parties\r\n\nhereto \r                  have \r                      been \r                           collectively negotiating a final settlement in\r\n\nthe \r               Schiavi \r                       Homes \r                            loan \r                                 transaction, termination of business and\r\n\nliquidation, and are desirous of reaching a final  settlement\r\n\nbetween the parties  to avoid litigation now in existence  or\r\n\nthat could  hereafter  arise.\"   As mentioned  earlier,  both\r\n\nSettlement Agreements  expressly  provided that  the  parties\r\n\n\"release, remise and forever discharge each other . . .  from\r\n\nall suits .  . . at law or in equity . . . which directly  or\r\n\nindirectly \r                      relate[] \r                               to \r                                 . \r                                   . . any . . . transactions . . . among\r\n\neach other.\"  The district court dismissed Palmer and  Palmer\r\n\nManagement's claim for lost  business damages on the  grounds\r\n\nthat PIN's lawsuit in violation of the Settlement  Agreements\r\n\n\"was  seemingly  in good  faith\"  and  \"was  not  frivolous.\"\r\n\nPenobscot Indian Nation v.

The insurance company then responded with\r\n\n                            -49-\r                                         49\r\r\n\n\"a counterclaim for  specific performance  of the  settlement\r\n\nagreement and for damages resulting from [plaintiff's] . .  .\r\n\nbreach thereof,\" id. at 972, which \"consisted principally  of\r\n\nits attorney's fees incurred in defending the suit brought by\r\n\n[the  plaintiff]  .  .  .  in  violation  of  the  settlement\r\n\nagreement,\"  id. at 975.   The Superior  Court did not  order\r\n\nspecific shed by  the court's disposition of the main  claims\r\n\nasserted \r                    by \r                       [the plaintiff].\"  Id. at 975.  The Superior Court\r\n\nalso \r                denied \r                       the insurance company's claim for attorney's fees.\r\n\nSee id.  \r\n\n          The insurance company cross-appealed these rulings,\r\n\nrecognizing that  if  the Maine  Supreme Court  affirmed  the\r\n\nSuperior \r                    Court's judgment, there would be no need to reach the\r\n\nissue of specific performance.  The Dodge court held:\r\n\n          Because of the pervasiveness and vigor of\r\n          the American rule making each party  bear\r\n          its own  attorney's  fees, parties  to  a\r\n          settlement--in  absence  of  an   express\r\n          contractual provision  to the  contrary--\r\n          must  be  taken  to  intend  to   exclude\r\n          attorney's  fees from  the  damages  that\r\n          otherwise  would  be  recoverable  as   a\r\n          foreseeable and probable consequence of a\r\n          breach of the agreement.\r\n\nId.\r               \r                \r                The \r                    Maine Supreme Court explained in detail its denial of\r\n\ndamages \r                   which normally attend a breach of contract in the case\r\n\nof the breach of a settlement agreement:    \r\n\n          An after-the fact rationalization for the\r\n          rule denying normal contract damages  for\r\n          breach of settlement agreements can  also\r\n          be \r                        developed \r                                  from the strong public policy\r\n          favoring such settlements.  Were the rule\r\n\n                            -50-\r                                         50\r\r\n\n          otherwise, a  lawyer would  be much  more\r\n          wary of  informal settlement  discussions\r\n          for fear of subjecting his client to  the\r\n          added  expense of  the  opposing  party's\r\n          attorney's   fees  if   it   were   later\r\n          determined that those discussions had  in\r\n          fact  reached  the  point  of  a  binding\r\n          bilateral \r                               agreement.  On balance it may be\r\n          preferable to  encourage free  settlement\r\n          negotiations, undampened  by the risk  of\r\n          the heavy damages that would be  assessed\r\n          in those relatively  few cases where  one\r\n          party fails to perform its agreement.\r\n\nId.  at 976.    The Dodge  court  thus denied  the  insurance\r\n\ncompany's cross-appeal in full.\r\n\n          Although it may be debatable whether Dodge resolved\r\n\nthe issue concerning the possibility of a non-breaching party\r\n\nrecovering  on a  breach  of  contract theory  the  costs  of\r\n\nlitigation, other than  attorney's fees,  resulting from  its\r\n\ndefense  of a  suit filed  in contravention  of a  settlement\r\n\nagreement, we need not take up this debate today.  Palmer and\r\n\nPalmer Management have not directed us to any Maine case that\r\n\ngrants damages of the variety that they seek, and we have not\r\n\nfound \r                 any \r                     such case on our own initiative.  We note that Maine\r\n\ndoes \r                recognize the remedy of specific performance in the event\r\n\nof a breach of a settlement agreement.  See McGuire, 495 A.2d\r\n\nat \r              798 \r                  (indicating that party may seek specific performance as\r\n\nremedy for breach of settlement agreement).  By ruling that S\r\n\n81 does not apply to the Settlement Agreements in this  case,\r\n\nand \r               thus \r                    that \r                        these \r                              Agreements preclude PIN's remaining claims,\r\n\nwe effectively have provided Palmer and Palmer Management the\r\n\n                            -51-\r                                         51\r\r\n\nequitable remedy of  specific performance  of the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements.\r\n\n          We \r                        need \r                             not \r                                 sift alternative sources of authority to\r\n\nresolve  the exact issue  of whether or  not the law  affords\r\n\ndamages in addition to specific performance in the event of a\r\n\nbreach \r                  of \r                     a \r                      settlement \r                                 agreement28 because no material issue of\r\n\nfact \r                exists \r                       as \r                         to \r                            the \r                                damages that Palmer and Palmer Management\r\n\nsustained as  a  result of  PIN's  breach of  the  Settlement\r\n\nAgreements in this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Anderson\r\n\n28.  We recognize that certain jurisdictions may permit a\r\nparty to sue for both specific performance and consequential\r\n\nSee, e.g.,           v.     , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032527\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032527/berryhill-v-hatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 (Iowa\r            damages in the case of the breach of a settlement agreement. \r                       Berryhill    Hatt\r\n1988); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts S 281(3)\r\n(1981).  Other jurisdictions, however, apparently require a\r\nparty to select between specific performance and monetary\r\ndamages in the event of a breach of a settlement agreement. \r\nSee, e.g., TNT Marketing, Inc. v.

As it did below, Key Bank argues that the following\r\nstatements, contained in the press release that Marcello\r\ndrafted and disseminated, are defamatory:  (1) the statement\r\nclaiming that \"money . . . had been stolen from\" PIN; (2) the\r\nstatement asserting that Key Bank \"conspired and acted to\r\ndefraud the Penobscot Nation;\" (3) the statement explaining\r\nthat \"the conduct of Key Bank . . . resulted in the Penobscot\r\nNation entering into an improvident and unconscionable\r\npartnership investment\" pursuant to which it \"relinquished\r\nits right, its land, and its money to those who plundered the\r\nPenobscot Nation, lied to the Penobscot Nation and its\r\nmembers, and stole from the Penobscot Nation and its\r\nmembers;\" (4) the statement positing that \"bad acts, fraud,\r\nand bad faith committed by Key Bank . . . against the\r\nPenobscot Nation is a far greater conspiracy than could have\r\nbeen outlined\" in the press conference; and (5) the statement\r\ninsisting that PIN \"suffered grave financial losses and later\r\nlearned that they have been victimized, manipulated, lied to,\r\nand used by Key Bank.\" \r\n\n                            -54-\r                                         54\r\r\n\necho Key Bank's objection to the district court's sua  sponte\r\n\nruling on their defamation claims against PIN.

In order to state a claim for defamation in Maine,  a\r\n\nprivate \r                   person must establish the following:  \"(a) a false and\r\n\ndefamatory statement concerning another; (b) an  unprivileged\r\n\npublication to a third party; (c) fault amounting at least to\r\n\nnegligence on  the  part of  the  publisher; and  (d)  either\r\n\nactionability\r                         of the statement irrespective of special harm or\r\n\nthe existence  of special  harm caused  by the  publication.\"\r\n\nPowers, 596 A.2d at  69.

PIN filed its\r\n\ncomplaint and conducted  the press  conferences in  September\r\n\n1994.  The district court did not make its sua sponte  ruling\r\n\nuntil October 1995.  By this time, the parties had compiled a\r\n\nvoluminous record  that included  depositions of  all of  the\r\n\nparties involved in the press conference.\r\n\n          As in Berkovitz, however, the district court  never\r\n\n\"gave the [cross-Appellants] a meaningful opportunity to cull\r\n\nthe  best evidence  supporting  [their] position[s],  and  to\r\n\npresent  that   evidence,  together   with  developed   legal\r\n\nargumentation\r                        , in opposition to the entry of summary judgment\"\r\n\nwith respect PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla.  Id. at 31.  On the\r\n\ncontrary, the district court's  sua sponte ruling took  these\r\n\nparties by  surprise;  only Marcello  had moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment and neither Schiavi nor the Palmer Defendants  filed\r\n\ndefamation claims against Marcello.32\r\n\n32.  Although Key Bank did have the opportunity to present\r\nits position with respect to Marcello, it did not in the case\r\nof PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla because none of these parties\r\nmoved for summary judgment.  Key Bank's argumentation may\r\nhave differed little in response to summary judgment motions\r\nfiled by PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla, given the similarity of\r\nthe facts and circumstances relating to its claims against\r\nthese parties.  The nature of PIN, Phillips, and Pardilla's\r\nrelationship to the conduct at issue as well as the defenses\r\nthat these parties now assert in response to Key Bank's\r\ndefamation claims, however, support Key Bank's argument that\r\nit would have responded differently to these parties had the\r\ndistrict court afforded it an opportunity to do so.

Because  the district court failed to afford  the\r\n\nStella, 4 F.3d at 56 (noting the special preparation\r\nnecessary to defend a motion for summary judgment). \r\nSignificantly, Key Bank did not present evidence, either in\r\nits written or in its oral defense to Marcello's summary\r\njudgment motion, concerning PIN, Phillips, or Pardilla.  See\r\nBerkovitz, 89 F.3d at 31 n.8 (reasoning that plaintiff at\r\nissue in Berkovitz did not have an opportunity to put forth\r\nevidence relating to summary judgment motion).  We thus\r\ninclude Key Bank in our disposition of the district court's\r\nsua sponte defamation rulings.     \r\n\n                            -64-\r                                         64\r\r\n\ncross-Appellants \r                            any \r                               opportunity to oppose its grant of summary\r\n\njudgment for PIN,  Phillips, and Pardilla, we hold that  this\r\n\nruling cannot stand.\r\n\nD.
