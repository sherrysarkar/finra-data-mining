Twenty-five  pled guilty either before  trial or\r\n\nshortly after trial started.  Eight defendants were  tried to\r\n\nverdict, five were acquitted.\r\n\n          Luis Alicea-Cardoza,  nicknamed \"Burbuja\",  was one\r\n\nof the three convicted and  now appeals.  His main contention\r\n\nis that  the jury, confronted  with a maze of  defendants and\r\n\ndrug  and violence  evidence, convicted  him  when there  was\r\n\nprecious little evidence,  too little, he says,  to support a\r\n\nconviction.   The little  evidence  there was,  he says,  was\r\n\nbased on beeper  transmissions and this court,  which has not\r\n\npreviously addressed  the question, should find  those beeper\r\n\nrecords erroneously  admitted.   Although Alicea-Cardoza  has\r\n\nably  argued  these  and  ancillary  points,  we  affirm  his\r\n\nconviction under  21 U.S.C.    841  and  the drug  conspiracy\r\n\nstatute,  21 U.S.C.     846,  and his  sentence  of 27  years\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\n                              I\r                                          I\r\n\n          Because the  defendant attacks  the sufficiency  of\r\n\nthe  evidence,  we review  the  evidence  in the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the  verdict, with a view to  whether a rational\r\n\njuror could have found guilt  beyond a reasonable doubt.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 615 (1st Cir. 1992).  \r                                 \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Interception  of telephone  messages in  April 1994\r\n\nconfirmed  that Jorge  Solano-Moreta  was  in  charge  of  an\r\n\norganization selling drugs, principally  cocaine, at numerous\r\n\ndrug  points  in  Bayam n,  including a  drug  point  at  the\r\n\nVirgilio D vila Housing Project.  Alicea-Cardoza had acted as\r\n\na \"runner\" (meaning that he managed the business operation by\r\n\nreceiving, accounting  for, and safeguarding the  proceeds of\r\n\ndrug sales)  for a  Virgilio D vila  drug  point since  1992.\r\n\nApproximately  four kilograms of cocaine were sold monthly at\r\n\nthat  drug  point.   Alicea-Cardoza  was  also  a runner  for\r\n\nanother  drug point in  the Virgilio D vila  Housing Project.\r\n\nThere, approximately  one half of a kilogram  of cocaine base\r\n\nwas sold monthly. \r\n\n          The  evidence  implicating  Alicea-Cardoza  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy consisted  principally of  the testimony  of Amiud\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as and charts of intercepted  beeper messages sent\r\n\nto Solano-Moreta by Alicea-Cardoza.  Alicea-Mat as  testified\r\n\nthat  he was  part  of  a drug  selling  organization at  the\r\n\nVirgilio  D vila Housing Project known as the Virgilio D vila\r\n\ngroup,  which sold cocaine, crack, and heroin.  Alicea-Mat as\r\n\nsaid he ran several drug points and was a trigger man for the\r\n\ngroup.  He  testified that the members of  the group included\r\n\nLuis Rosario-Rodr guez,  Richard Rosario-Rodr guez  and Edwin\r\n\nRosario-Rodr guez (three brothers who ran the  group), Felipe\r\n\nGarc a-Roque, as well  as defendant \"Luis Alicea,  [and] some\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\npeople  who are confined in state institutions.\"  When asked,\r\n\n\" . . .  do you know if  Ruiz [sic] Alicea has a  nickname or\r\n\nnicknames,\" Alicea-Mat as responded,  \"Burbuja\".  When  asked\r\n\nwhether  \"Luis Alicea-Cardoza,  also  known as  Burbuja\"  was\r\n\nseated  in the  courtroom,  Alicea-Mat as identified  Alicea-\r\n\nCardoza.  And  when asked \"How many Burbujas  worked for this\r\n\norganization or  group,\"  Alicea-Mat as responded,  \"Just one\r\n\nBurbuja.\"   \"Burbujas\"  means \"Bubbles\"  and  members of  the\r\n\njury,  applying  their  common  experience  of  Puerto  Rican\r                   \r\n\nsociety, could reasonably have regarded it as an unusual male\r\n\nnickname.  No evidence was  presented to suggest that another\r\n\n\"Burbuja\" may have been involved in this organization.\r\n\n          Alicea-Mat as  testified that  the Virgilio  D vila\r\n\ngroup and  Solano-Moreta \"established  a solid  relationship\"\r\n\nduring 1992 and 1993 to  help each other fight \"wars\" against\r\n\ncompeting  groups  for  control  of  the  local  drug  trade.\r\n\nSolano-Moreta and  the Virgilio  D vila group  would meet  to\r\n\ndiscuss drug points and plan attacks  against enemies of both\r\n\ngroups,  pooling their  resources \"in  order  to be  strong.\"\r\n\nThey also did  business with each other:   Solano-Moreta sold\r\n\nkilos of  drugs to the  Virgilio D vila group, which  in turn\r\n\nsold  the  drugs  throughout   the  Virgilio  D vila  Housing\r\n\nProject.   In addition,  the Virgilio D vila  group collected\r\n\nmoney for Solano-Moreta at drug  points owned by him and took\r\n\nthe money to  him.  They even committed  murders with Solano-\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nMoreta to enforce their control over the drug trade.  The two\r\n\ngroups developed a \"frequent and close friendship\" and \"[met]\r\n\non many occasions.\"  When asked who attended these  meetings,\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as responded:\r\n\n          Richard Rosario-Rodr guez, Edwin Rosario-\r\n          Rodr guez, I, Willy Nariz, [Jorge] Solano\r\n          Moreta, Perla.   When [Jorge] would  come\r\n          down  to  the   Virgilio  D vila  Housing\r\n          Project,   Luis   Rosario-Rodr guez   was\r\n          there.    Luis  Rosario-Rodr guez  [sic],\r                                                               \r\n          alias Burbuja,  and several  other people\r                                   \r\n          who are jailed at the state institution.1\r\n\n(emphasis added).\r\n\n          In addition to  this testimony, Alicea-Cardoza  was\r\n\nimplicated  by  charts  the  government  prepared  of  beeper\r\n\nmessages.  These charts recorded the content of approximately\r\n\nfour  thousand messages received  between April 26,  1995 and\r\n\nJune 5, 1995  by Solano-Moreta on his beepers.   The messages\r\n\nwere  intercepted  by   federal  agents  pursuant   to  court\r\n\nauthorization.   Special Agent Gilberto Vazquez, who directed\r\n\nthe investigation, testified that the charts transcribing the\r\n\nmessages  sent  to  Solano-Moreta  were  produced  by  a  pen\r\n\nregister,  which  intercepted the  messages  sent  to Solano-\r\n\nMoreta's beeper and printed them out.  Vazquez also testified\r\n\nthat  he  tested  the pen  register  system  for  accuracy by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Alicea-Mat as seemed to have mistakenly repeated the name\r\nLuis Rosario-Rodr guez.   The jury could have  concluded this\r\nwas  an  inadvertent  mistake,  rather  than  evidence  of  a\r\ndifferent \"Burbuja\", especially  in light of  Alicea-Mat as's\r\ndirect   identification  of   Alicea-Cardoza   as  the   real\r\n\"Burbuja\".\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nchecking its results against the messages received by a clone\r\n\nbeeper, an  exact replica of  Solano's beeper.   He testified\r\n\nthat the  pen register and clone beeper  received exactly the\r\n\nsame messages received by Solano-Moreta.\r\n\n          Several hundred  of the  messages to  Solano-Moreta\r\n\nrecorded  in the beeper charts  were from \"Burbuja\".  Typical\r\n\nwere messages  asking Solano-Moreta  to call  \"Burbuja\" at  a\r\n\ncertain  phone  number  or messages  leaving  a  phone number\r\n\naccompanied by \"Burbuja, Urgente.\"  Some messages referred to\r\n\nobtaining  \"work\".      Vazquez  testified   that,   in   his\r\n\nconsiderable experience  investigating drug gangs,  these and\r\n\nother  messages received  by Solano-Moreta involved  the drug\r\n\ntrade.\r\n\n          Of  the five members  of the Virgilio  D vila group\r\n\nwho  originally  went  to   trial,  only  Alicea-Cardoza  was\r\n\nconvicted.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Alicea-Cardoza claims  the district  court admitted\r\n\nthe beeper charts without proper authentication under Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 901, that the evidence  was insufficient to support his\r\n\nconviction,  and  that  he  was  subject  to  a  constructive\r\n\namendment to the indictment.\r\n\nA.  Beeper Charts\r                             \r\n\n          Under Fed.  R.  Evid. 901(a),  \"The requirement  of\r\n\nauthentication or identification as a condition precedent  to\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nadmissibility is satisfied by  evidence sufficient to support\r\n\na finding that  the matter in question is  what its proponent\r\n\nclaims.\"   Fed. R. Evid. 901(a).   To establish authenticity,\r\n\nthe   proponent  need   not   rule  out   \"all  possibilities\r\n\ninconsistent with  authenticity, or .  . .  prove beyond  any\r\n\ndoubt  that the evidence is what  it purports to be.  Rather,\r\n\nthe standard for authentication, and hence for admissibility,\r\n\nis  one  of   reasonable  likelihood.\"    United   States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHolmquist, 36 F.3d  154, 168 (1st Cir. 1994).   Generally, if\r                     \r\n\nthe   district  court  is  satisfied  that  the  evidence  is\r\n\nsufficient  to allow  a  reasonable  person  to  believe  the\r\n\nevidence is what it purports  to be, Rule 901(a) is satisfied\r\n\nand  the  jury  may  decide  what weight  it  will  give  the\r\n\nevidence.   See id. at  167.  Because  authentication rulings\r                               \r\n\nare  necessarily fact specific,  we review such  rulings only\r\n\nfor mistake of law or abuse of discretion.  See id.  \r                                                               \r\n\n          The  district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n\nadmitting the beeper charts as  a record of the messages sent\r\n\nto  Solano-Moreta's beeper.  Vazquez adequately explained the\r\n\nmeans by which the pen  register intercepted and recorded the\r\n\nbeeper  messages,  and  how the  clone  beeper  confirmed the\r\n\naccuracy of  that system.   Asked by the prosecution  how the\r\n\nbeeper charts had been produced, Vazquez responded, \"It  is a\r\n\nmachine known as a pen register.  As the message comes in the\r\n\npen register just annotates or writes exactly  what comes out\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\non the beeper.\"   Vazquez explained clone beepers.   \"A clone\r\n\nis an exact replica  of a beeper.   If I was going to  have a\r\n\nclone to my beeper and you had it,  you would receive exactly\r\n\nthe  same message  that I  get.\"   Vazquez testified  that he\r\n\ncarried a  clone of Solano-Moreta's  beeper for about  a week\r\n\nduring the intercept period.  Asked whether Vazquez found any\r\n\ndifference between the  written messages produced by  the pen\r\n\nregister  and those  received by  the  clone beeper,  Vazquez\r\n\nresponded,  \"No  difference.\"     This   testimony  was   not\r\n\ncontradicted or challenged by the defense. \r\n\n          Alicea-Cardoza's  argument is  that  the charts  of\r\n\nthese phone  calls were  not  properly authenticated  because\r\n\nthere was  no evidence  that Alicea-Cardoza  was in  fact the\r\n\nperson who  left  the  messages.   Defendant  relies  on  the\r\n\ngeneral rule that  self-identification by a speaker  alone is\r\n\nnot  sufficient authentication.  See United States v. Puerta-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRestrepo, 814  F.2d 1236, 1239 (7th Cir. 1987); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Pool, 660 F.2d 547, 560 (5th Cir.  Unit B Nov. 1981).  We\r                    \r\n\nagree that, under Puerta-Restrepo and Pool, the beeper charts\r                                                      \r\n\ncould not  be authenticated  under Rule  901 were  they being\r\n\noffered for the sole purpose of identifying Alicea-Cardoza as\r\n\nthe \"Burbuja\" who sent the messages.  \r\n\n          Here,  however,  the   government's  evidence  only\r\n\nshowed the  beeper  messages that  Solano-Moreta himself  had\r\n\nreceived, not who specifically had sent them.   This is not a\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncase of  the jury being asked to take  on faith that a caller\r\n\nwas who the witness  said the caller was.  Rather, the charts\r\n\nwere introduced  for the  different purpose  of proving  that\r\n\nSolano-Moreta  received these messages on his beeper, and the\r\n\nbeeper  charts plainly constitute  an accurate record  of the\r\n\nmessages that  Solano-Moreta received.  As Vazquez testified,\r\n\na beeper decodes  a digital message which it  displays on its\r\n\nscreen,  e.g., \"Call Burbuja.\"   The pen  register intercepts\r\n\nthat message and records  it, over time producing  a complete\r\n\nrecord  of all  messages sent  to  that beeper.   That  these\r\n\nbeeper charts  produced by the  pen register are  an accurate\r\n\nrecord of  the messages  sent to  Solano-Moreta's beeper  was\r\n\nestablished by the  testimony of Vazquez, who  explained that\r\n\nthe beeper  charts were checked  against a  clone beeper  and\r\n\nthat there was no difference between the two.  This testimony\r\n\nwas sufficient to  authenticate the beeper charts  as records\r\n\nof the messages sent to Solano-Moreta's beeper.  \r\n\n          Whether  the \"Burbuja\"  who  sent the  messages was\r\n\nAlicea-Cardoza  is a separate question not within the purview\r\n\nof Rule 901.  The  jury had to decide on its own, taking into\r\n\naccount other evidence, some  direct and some circumstantial,\r\n\nwhether Alicea-Cardoza  was \"Burbuja\".  Given  that evidence,\r\n\nthe jury reasonably  established that \"Burbuja\" was  a member\r\n\nof the  drug ring  and that \"Burbuja\"  was, in  fact, Alicea-\r\n\nCardoza.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          It is true that someone who was not \"Burbuja\" could\r\n\nhave  been leaving  the messages  or that  some other  person\r\n\nnamed  \"Burbuja\" left the  messages.  Alicea-Cardoza  did not\r\n\nmake  such a  contention  at trial,  but  if he  had,  such a\r\n\ncontention  does not  go  to whether  the  beeper charts  are\r\n\nproperly authenticated.   The jury could still  have assessed\r\n\nthe weight  of the evidence  in light of that  contention and\r\n\nmade a judgment accordingly.   In sum, whether the  \"Burbuja\"\r\n\nwho sent the messages  is in fact Alicea-Cardoza,  or perhaps\r\n\nsome other  \"Burbuja\", is a  separate matter for the  jury to\r\n\ndecide.  \r\n\n          As for the  whether the charts  were authenticated,\r\n\nthe standard of  reasonable likelihood was satisfied  in this\r\n\ncase.\r\n\nB.  Sufficiency\r                           \r\n\n          Thus,  we turn to the question whether the evidence\r\n\nin  this  case  is  sufficient  to  support  Alicea-Cardoza's\r\n\nconviction.  In assessing a sufficiency challenge, we \"review\r\n\nthe record to  determine whether the evidence  and reasonable\r\n\ninferences therefrom, taken as a  whole and in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury  to\r\n\ndetermine  beyond a reasonable  doubt that the  defendant was\r\n\nguilty as charged.\"  United  States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486,\r                                                         \r\n\n1490  (1st Cir. 1997)  (citations, internal  quotation marks,\r\n\nand alterations omitted).  \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Taking  the   beeper  charts   and  Alicea-Mat as's\r\n\ntestimony together, we conclude the  evidence was sufficient.\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as's  testimony  identifies  Alicea-Cardoza  as  a\r\n\nmember  of the  Virgilio  D vila group  and  links the  drug-\r\n\nrelated  enterprises of that group to those of Solano-Moreta.\r\n\nThe testimony establishes that  Alicea-Cardoza was \"Burbuja\".\r\n\nThe  beeper charts  demonstrate that  \"Burbuja\" had  frequent\r\n\ncontact with Solano-Moreta.   And the jury could easily  find\r\n\nthat  these  communications involved  matters related  to the\r\n\nmanufacture and sale of drugs.  While it is possible that the\r\n\n\"Burbuja\"  who   sent  those  messages   was  indeed  another\r\n\n\"Burbuja\",  or that Alicea-Cardoza and Solano-Moreta had only\r\n\na non-criminal  relationship, the  jury was  not required  to\r\n\naccept either  of these conclusions.   To  the contrary,  the\r\n\nevidence  clearly  suggests that  Alicea-Cardoza  was closely\r\n\ninvolved with Solano-Moreta in the drug trade, and is plainly\r\n\nsufficient to sustain the conviction.  \r\n\n          That the jury did not also convict other members of\r\n\nthe Virgilio  D vila group  based  solely on  Alicea-Mat as's\r\n\ntestimony does  not undercut this  conclusion.  The  jury may\r\n\nwell have regarded Alicea-Mat as's  testimony as insufficient\r\n\nto  prove  the  guilt  of those  other  defendants  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt, but  this does not mean,  as Alicea-Cardoza\r\n\nargues,  that  we   must  therefore  accord   Alicea-Mat as's\r\n\ntestimony no  weight in considering  this sufficiency  claim.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nThe jury could reasonably have  found, as indeed it did, that\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as's testimony  in  conjunction  with  the  beeper\r\n\ncharts  proved  Alicea-Cardoza's  guilt  beyond a  reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.\r\n\nC.  Constructive Variance\r                                     \r\n\n          Alicea-Cardoza claims  that his  conviction amounts\r\n\nto a constructive variance of  the indictment in that (1) the\r\n\nindictment charges  him with being  a triggerman, but  he was\r\n\ntried for  being a  runner, and (2)  the evidence  showed the\r\n\nexistence of multiple  conspiracies, while Alicea-Cardoza did\r\n\nnot participate in the conspiracy for which he was convicted.\r\n\nVariances  between the indictment and the evidence ultimately\r\n\nproved  against a  single defendant  may be  common when  the\r\n\ngovernment prosecutes large criminal  enterprises in a single\r\n\ntrial.   See United States  v. Glenn, 828  F.2d 855, 858 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1987).  When constructive variance is  alleged on appeal\r\n\nin a conspiracy case, under Glenn the following questions are\r                                             \r\n\nasked: \r\n\n          (1) Is the  evidence sufficient to permit\r\n          a  jury  to find  the (express  or tacit)\r\n          agreement  that  the  indictment charges?\r\n          (2)  If not, is it sufficient to permit a\r\n          jury, under a proper set of instructions,\r\n          to convict  the defendant  of a  related,\r\n          similar conspiracy?  (3)  If so, does the\r\n          variance    affect    the     defendant's\r\n          substantial rights or does the difference\r\n          between  the charged  conspiracy and  the\r\n          conspiracy  proved  amount  to  \"harmless\r\n          error?\r\n\nId.  \r               \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          As to the  first test, the evidence permits  a jury\r\n\nto find that  Alicea-Cardoza did conspire with  Solano-Moreta\r\n\nto distribute drugs and that  he was an active participant in\r\n\nthat enterprise.  Indeed, the beeper charts show that Alicea-\r\n\nCardoza  and Solano-Moreta  were  in frequent  communication.\r\n\nAccordingly,  that Alicea-Cardoza  was indicted  for  being a\r\n\nconspirator/triggerman   but  the   evidence  proved   him  a\r\n\nconspirator/runner   does   not    constitute   impermissible\r\n\nvariance.  \"So  long as the  statutory violation remains  the\r\n\nsame,  the jury  can  convict  even if  the  facts found  are\r\n\nsomewhat  different than  those  charged --  so  long as  the\r\n\ndifference does not cause unfair prejudice.  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTwitty, 72  F.3d 228,  231 (citing Glenn,  828 F.3d  at 858).\r                                                    \r\n\nThere is  no unfair prejudice  in this case.   Alicea-Cardoza\r\n\nhad notice that he was under indictment for being involved in\r\n\nthe Solano-Moreta  drug organization,  and he  knew that  his\r\n\ncentral defense  needed to be  that he was  not part  of that\r\n\norganization  --  as a  triggerman, runner,  or in  any other\r\n\ncapacity.  The error in the indictment was not so grave as to\r\n\ncause  Alicea-Cardoza to defend himself on the wrong grounds,\r\n\nespecially  when the evidence adduced at trial showed Alicea-\r\n\nCardoza   to  be   deeply  involved   in  the   Solano-Moreta\r\n\norganization. \r\n\n                             III\r                                         III\r\n\n          The sentencing appeal  is also without merit.   The\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ncourt assigned Alicea-Cardoza a base offense level of thirty-\r\n\neight under  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1 for  conviction of  an offense\r\n\ninvolving at least 1.5 kilograms  of cocaine base.  The court\r\n\nincreased  the offense  level by  two points  to forty  under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.      2D1(b)(1),  adopting   the   findings  of   the\r\n\npresentence report that weapons  were used by  Alicea-Cardoza\r\n\nin furtherance  of  the conspiracy.   The  court declined  to\r\n\nadopt the recommendation  of the presentence report  to raise\r\n\nAlicea-Cardoza's offense level by an additional three points,\r\n\nrejecting the  report's  finding that  Alicea-Cardoza  had  a\r\n\nmanagerial  role  in the  conspiracy.    The court  found  an\r\n\nimprisonment  range of  324  to  405  months,  and  sentenced\r\n\nAlicea-Cardoza to 324 months in prison, including a statutory\r\n\nminimum of ten years in jail under 21 U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(A).\r\n\n          The  government  has  the burden  of  proving  drug\r\n\nquantity by a fair preponderance of the  evidence, see United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871, and amply  met its burden\r                             \r\n\nhere.  The evidence shows that the Solano-Moreta organization\r\n\nwas  a major  drug distribution  network  buying and  selling\r\n\nhundreds of  kilograms of  cocaine and  cocaine base  through\r\n\nvarious drug points,  including those at the  Virgilio D vila\r\n\nHousing  Project.  The evidence shows that Alicea-Cardoza was\r\n\na runner for those drug points at Virgilio D vila.  According\r\n\nto  the presentence report, Alicea-Cardoza \"ran\" a drug point\r\n\nat  which approximately four  kilograms of cocaine  were sold\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nmonthly, he \"ran\"  another drug point at  which approximately\r\n\none half  kilogram of cocaine  base was sold monthly.   Given\r\n\nthis  evidence, the  district court did  not commit  error in\r\n\nassigning Alicea-Cardoza a base offense level of thirty-eight\r\n\nfor  committing an offense involving 1.5 kilograms of cocaine\r\n\nbase. This  evidence at  trial is  sufficient to sustain  the\r\n\noffense level.    As to  Alicea-Cardoza's attack  on the  two\r\n\npoint increase in his offense level  for use of a weapon, the\r\n\nevidence at trial shows that Alicea-Cardoza was armed when he\r\n\nserved as a  watchman for drug points in  the Virgilio D vila\r\n\nHousing Project.  This is sufficient to sustain the increase.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n",

Twenty-five  pled guilty either before  trial or\r\n\nshortly after trial started.  Eight defendants were  tried to\r\n\nverdict, five were acquitted.\r\n\n          Luis Alicea-Cardoza,  nicknamed \"Burbuja\",  was one\r\n\nof the three convicted and  now appeals.  His main contention\r\n\nis that  the jury, confronted  with a maze of  defendants and\r\n\ndrug  and violence  evidence, convicted  him  when there  was\r\n\nprecious little evidence,  too little, he says,  to support a\r\n\nconviction.   The little  evidence  there was,  he says,  was\r\n\nbased on beeper  transmissions and this court,  which has not\r\n\npreviously addressed  the question, should find  those beeper\r\n\nrecords erroneously  admitted.   Although Alicea-Cardoza  has\r\n\nably  argued  these  and  ancillary  points,  we  affirm  his\r\n\nconviction under  21 U.S.C.    841  and  the drug  conspiracy\r\n\nstatute,  21 U.S.C.     846,  and his  sentence  of 27  years\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\n                              I\r                                          I\r\n\n          Because the  defendant attacks  the sufficiency  of\r\n\nthe  evidence,  we review  the  evidence  in the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the  verdict, with a view to  whether a rational\r\n\njuror could have found guilt  beyond a reasonable doubt.

Alicea-Cardoza had acted as\r\n\na \"runner\" (meaning that he managed the business operation by\r\n\nreceiving, accounting  for, and safeguarding the  proceeds of\r\n\ndrug sales)  for a  Virgilio D vila  drug  point since  1992.\r\n\nApproximately  four kilograms of cocaine were sold monthly at\r\n\nthat  drug  point.   Alicea-Cardoza  was  also  a runner  for\r\n\nanother  drug point in  the Virgilio D vila  Housing Project.\r\n\nThere, approximately  one half of a kilogram  of cocaine base\r\n\nwas sold monthly. \r\n\n          The  evidence  implicating  Alicea-Cardoza  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy consisted  principally of  the testimony  of Amiud\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as and charts of intercepted  beeper messages sent\r\n\nto Solano-Moreta by Alicea-Cardoza.  Alicea-Mat as  testified\r\n\nthat  he was  part  of  a drug  selling  organization at  the\r\n\nVirgilio  D vila Housing Project known as the Virgilio D vila\r\n\ngroup,  which sold cocaine, crack, and heroin.  Alicea-Mat as\r\n\nsaid he ran several drug points and was a trigger man for the\r\n\ngroup.  He  testified that the members of  the group included\r\n\nLuis Rosario-Rodr guez,  Richard Rosario-Rodr guez  and Edwin\r\n\nRosario-Rodr guez (three brothers who ran the  group), Felipe\r\n\nGarc a-Roque, as well  as defendant \"Luis Alicea,  [and] some\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\npeople  who are confined in state institutions.\"  When asked,\r\n\n\" . . .  do you know if  Ruiz [sic] Alicea has a  nickname or\r\n\nnicknames,\" Alicea-Mat as responded,  \"Burbuja\".

And  when asked \"How many Burbujas  worked for this\r\n\norganization or  group,\"  Alicea-Mat as responded,  \"Just one\r\n\nBurbuja.\"   \"Burbujas\"  means \"Bubbles\"  and  members of  the\r\n\njury,  applying  their  common  experience  of  Puerto  Rican\r                   \r\n\nsociety, could reasonably have regarded it as an unusual male\r\n\nnickname.  No evidence was  presented to suggest that another\r\n\n\"Burbuja\" may have been involved in this organization.\r\n\n          Alicea-Mat as  testified that  the Virgilio  D vila\r\n\ngroup and  Solano-Moreta \"established  a solid  relationship\"\r\n\nduring 1992 and 1993 to  help each other fight \"wars\" against\r\n\ncompeting  groups  for  control  of  the  local  drug  trade.\r\n\nSolano-Moreta and  the Virgilio  D vila group  would meet  to\r\n\ndiscuss drug points and plan attacks  against enemies of both\r\n\ngroups,  pooling their  resources \"in  order  to be  strong.\"\r\n\nThey also did  business with each other:   Solano-Moreta sold\r\n\nkilos of  drugs to the  Virgilio D vila group, which  in turn\r\n\nsold  the  drugs  throughout   the  Virgilio  D vila  Housing\r\n\nProject.   In addition,  the Virgilio D vila  group collected\r\n\nmoney for Solano-Moreta at drug  points owned by him and took\r\n\nthe money to  him.

The two\r\n\ngroups developed a \"frequent and close friendship\" and \"[met]\r\n\non many occasions.\"  When asked who attended these  meetings,\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as responded:\r\n\n          Richard Rosario-Rodr guez, Edwin Rosario-\r\n          Rodr guez, I, Willy Nariz, [Jorge] Solano\r\n          Moreta, Perla.   When [Jorge] would  come\r\n          down  to  the   Virgilio  D vila  Housing\r\n          Project,   Luis   Rosario-Rodr guez   was\r\n          there.    Luis  Rosario-Rodr guez  [sic],\r                                                               \r\n          alias Burbuja,  and several  other people\r                                   \r\n          who are jailed at the state institution.1\r\n\n(emphasis added).\r\n\n          In addition to  this testimony, Alicea-Cardoza  was\r\n\nimplicated  by  charts  the  government  prepared  of  beeper\r\n\nmessages.  These charts recorded the content of approximately\r\n\nfour  thousand messages received  between April 26,  1995 and\r\n\nJune 5, 1995  by Solano-Moreta on his beepers.   The messages\r\n\nwere  intercepted  by   federal  agents  pursuant   to  court\r\n\nauthorization.   Special Agent Gilberto Vazquez, who directed\r\n\nthe investigation, testified that the charts transcribing the\r\n\nmessages  sent  to  Solano-Moreta  were  produced  by  a  pen\r\n\nregister,  which  intercepted the  messages  sent  to Solano-\r\n\nMoreta's beeper and printed them out.  Vazquez also testified\r\n\nthat  he  tested  the pen  register  system  for  accuracy by\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Alicea-Mat as seemed to have mistakenly repeated the name\r\nLuis Rosario-Rodr guez.   The jury could have  concluded this\r\nwas  an  inadvertent  mistake,  rather  than  evidence  of  a\r\ndifferent \"Burbuja\", especially  in light of  Alicea-Mat as's\r\ndirect   identification  of   Alicea-Cardoza   as  the   real\r\n\"Burbuja\".\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nchecking its results against the messages received by a clone\r\n\nbeeper, an  exact replica of  Solano's beeper.   He testified\r\n\nthat the  pen register and clone beeper  received exactly the\r\n\nsame messages received by Solano-Moreta.\r\n\n          Several hundred  of the  messages to  Solano-Moreta\r\n\nrecorded  in the beeper charts  were from \"Burbuja\".  Typical\r\n\nwere messages  asking Solano-Moreta  to call  \"Burbuja\" at  a\r\n\ncertain  phone  number  or messages  leaving  a  phone number\r\n\naccompanied by \"Burbuja, Urgente.\"  Some messages referred to\r\n\nobtaining  \"work\".      Vazquez  testified   that,   in   his\r\n\nconsiderable experience  investigating drug gangs,  these and\r\n\nother  messages received  by Solano-Moreta involved  the drug\r\n\ntrade.\r\n\n          Of  the five members  of the Virgilio  D vila group\r\n\nwho  originally  went  to   trial,  only  Alicea-Cardoza  was\r\n\nconvicted.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Alicea-Cardoza claims  the district  court admitted\r\n\nthe beeper charts without proper authentication under Fed.

Asked whether Vazquez found any\r\n\ndifference between the  written messages produced by  the pen\r\n\nregister  and those  received by  the  clone beeper,  Vazquez\r\n\nresponded,  \"No  difference.\"     This   testimony  was   not\r\n\ncontradicted or challenged by the defense. \r\n\n          Alicea-Cardoza's  argument is  that  the charts  of\r\n\nthese phone  calls were  not  properly authenticated  because\r\n\nthere was  no evidence  that Alicea-Cardoza  was in  fact the\r\n\nperson who  left  the  messages.

Unit B Nov. 1981).  We\r                    \r\n\nagree that, under Puerta-Restrepo and Pool, the beeper charts\r                                                      \r\n\ncould not  be authenticated  under Rule  901 were  they being\r\n\noffered for the sole purpose of identifying Alicea-Cardoza as\r\n\nthe \"Burbuja\" who sent the messages.  \r\n\n          Here,  however,  the   government's  evidence  only\r\n\nshowed the  beeper  messages that  Solano-Moreta himself  had\r\n\nreceived, not who specifically had sent them.   This is not a\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncase of  the jury being asked to take  on faith that a caller\r\n\nwas who the witness  said the caller was.  Rather, the charts\r\n\nwere introduced  for the  different purpose  of proving  that\r\n\nSolano-Moreta  received these messages on his beeper, and the\r\n\nbeeper  charts plainly constitute  an accurate record  of the\r\n\nmessages that  Solano-Moreta received.  As Vazquez testified,\r\n\na beeper decodes  a digital message which it  displays on its\r\n\nscreen,  e.g., \"Call Burbuja.\"   The pen  register intercepts\r\n\nthat message and records  it, over time producing  a complete\r\n\nrecord  of all  messages sent  to  that beeper.   That  these\r\n\nbeeper charts  produced by the  pen register are  an accurate\r\n\nrecord of  the messages  sent to  Solano-Moreta's beeper  was\r\n\nestablished by the  testimony of Vazquez, who  explained that\r\n\nthe beeper  charts were checked  against a  clone beeper  and\r\n\nthat there was no difference between the two.  This testimony\r\n\nwas sufficient to  authenticate the beeper charts  as records\r\n\nof the messages sent to Solano-Moreta's beeper.  \r\n\n          Whether  the \"Burbuja\"  who  sent the  messages was\r\n\nAlicea-Cardoza  is a separate question not within the purview\r\n\nof Rule 901.  The  jury had to decide on its own, taking into\r\n\naccount other evidence, some  direct and some circumstantial,\r\n\nwhether Alicea-Cardoza  was \"Burbuja\".  Given  that evidence,\r\n\nthe jury reasonably  established that \"Burbuja\" was  a member\r\n\nof the  drug ring  and that \"Burbuja\"  was, in  fact, Alicea-\r\n\nCardoza.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          It is true that someone who was not \"Burbuja\" could\r\n\nhave  been leaving  the messages  or that  some other  person\r\n\nnamed  \"Burbuja\" left the  messages.  Alicea-Cardoza  did not\r\n\nmake  such a  contention  at trial,  but  if he  had,  such a\r\n\ncontention  does not  go  to whether  the  beeper charts  are\r\n\nproperly authenticated.   The jury could still  have assessed\r\n\nthe weight  of the evidence  in light of that  contention and\r\n\nmade a judgment accordingly.   In sum, whether the  \"Burbuja\"\r\n\nwho sent the messages  is in fact Alicea-Cardoza,  or perhaps\r\n\nsome other  \"Burbuja\", is a  separate matter for the  jury to\r\n\ndecide.  \r\n\n          As for the  whether the charts  were authenticated,\r\n\nthe standard of  reasonable likelihood was satisfied  in this\r\n\ncase.\r\n\nB.  Sufficiency\r                           \r\n\n          Thus,  we turn to the question whether the evidence\r\n\nin  this  case  is  sufficient  to  support  Alicea-Cardoza's\r\n\nconviction.  In assessing a sufficiency challenge, we \"review\r\n\nthe record to  determine whether the evidence  and reasonable\r\n\ninferences therefrom, taken as a  whole and in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury  to\r\n\ndetermine  beyond a reasonable  doubt that the  defendant was\r\n\nguilty as charged.\"  United  States v.

And the jury could easily  find\r\n\nthat  these  communications involved  matters related  to the\r\n\nmanufacture and sale of drugs.  While it is possible that the\r\n\n\"Burbuja\"  who   sent  those  messages   was  indeed  another\r\n\n\"Burbuja\",  or that Alicea-Cardoza and Solano-Moreta had only\r\n\na non-criminal  relationship, the  jury was  not required  to\r\n\naccept either  of these conclusions.   To  the contrary,  the\r\n\nevidence  clearly  suggests that  Alicea-Cardoza  was closely\r\n\ninvolved with Solano-Moreta in the drug trade, and is plainly\r\n\nsufficient to sustain the conviction.  \r\n\n          That the jury did not also convict other members of\r\n\nthe Virgilio  D vila group  based  solely on  Alicea-Mat as's\r\n\ntestimony does  not undercut this  conclusion.  The  jury may\r\n\nwell have regarded Alicea-Mat as's  testimony as insufficient\r\n\nto  prove  the  guilt  of those  other  defendants  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt, but  this does not mean,  as Alicea-Cardoza\r\n\nargues,  that  we   must  therefore  accord   Alicea-Mat as's\r\n\ntestimony no  weight in considering  this sufficiency  claim.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nThe jury could reasonably have  found, as indeed it did, that\r\n\nAlicea-Mat as's testimony  in  conjunction  with  the  beeper\r\n\ncharts  proved  Alicea-Cardoza's  guilt  beyond a  reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.\r\n\nC.

(3)  If so, does the\r\n          variance    affect    the     defendant's\r\n          substantial rights or does the difference\r\n          between  the charged  conspiracy and  the\r\n          conspiracy  proved  amount  to  \"harmless\r\n          error?\r\n\nId.  \r               \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          As to the  first test, the evidence permits  a jury\r\n\nto find that  Alicea-Cardoza did conspire with  Solano-Moreta\r\n\nto distribute drugs and that  he was an active participant in\r\n\nthat enterprise.  Indeed, the beeper charts show that Alicea-\r\n\nCardoza  and Solano-Moreta  were  in frequent  communication.\r\n\nAccordingly,  that Alicea-Cardoza  was indicted  for  being a\r\n\nconspirator/triggerman   but  the   evidence  proved   him  a\r\n\nconspirator/runner   does   not    constitute   impermissible\r\n\nvariance.  \"So  long as the  statutory violation remains  the\r\n\nsame,  the jury  can  convict  even if  the  facts found  are\r\n\nsomewhat  different than  those  charged --  so  long as  the\r\n\ndifference does not cause unfair prejudice.

Morillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871, and amply  met its burden\r                             \r\n\nhere.  The evidence shows that the Solano-Moreta organization\r\n\nwas  a major  drug distribution  network  buying and  selling\r\n\nhundreds of  kilograms of  cocaine and  cocaine base  through\r\n\nvarious drug points,  including those at the  Virgilio D vila\r\n\nHousing  Project.  The evidence shows that Alicea-Cardoza was\r\n\na runner for those drug points at Virgilio D vila.  According\r\n\nto  the presentence report, Alicea-Cardoza \"ran\" a drug point\r\n\nat  which approximately four  kilograms of cocaine  were sold\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nmonthly, he \"ran\"  another drug point at  which approximately\r\n\none half  kilogram of cocaine  base was sold monthly.   Given\r\n\nthis  evidence, the  district court did  not commit  error in\r\n\nassigning Alicea-Cardoza a base offense level of thirty-eight\r\n\nfor  committing an offense involving 1.5 kilograms of cocaine\r\n\nbase. This  evidence at  trial is  sufficient to sustain  the\r\n\noffense level.    As to  Alicea-Cardoza's attack  on the  two\r\n\npoint increase in his offense level  for use of a weapon, the\r\n\nevidence at trial shows that Alicea-Cardoza was armed when he\r\n\nserved as a  watchman for drug points in  the Virgilio D vila\r\n\nHousing Project.  This is sufficient to sustain the increase.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n</pre>",
