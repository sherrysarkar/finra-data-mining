Appellant Gerald R. Caron was\r                                           \r\n\nconvicted  of  possessing  rifles,  shotguns  and  ammunition  in\r\n\nviolation  of  18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1),  the \"felon-in-possession\"\r\n\nlaw.  Because  at least  three of Caron's  five predicate  felony\r\n\nconvictions  were  for  crimes  of violence,  he  was  subject to\r\n\nsentence  enhancement  under   the  Armed  Career   Criminal  Act\r\n\n(\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C.   924  (e)(1).  Caron received a  prison term\r\n\nof  21 years,  10 months,  plus a  five year  term of  supervised\r\n\nrelease.  See U.S.S.G.   4B1.4. \r                       \r\n\n     The issue in this case is whether three prior  Massachusetts\r\n\nconvictions should  not be counted  as predicate crimes  under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   921(a)(20), which excludes as predicates\r\n\n     [a]ny conviction which has  been expunged, or set aside\r\n     or  for which  a person  has been  pardoned or  has had\r\n     civil  rights  restored  .  .  .  unless  such  pardon,\r\n     expungement, or restoration  of civil rights  expressly\r\n     provides  that  the  person may  not  ship,  transport,\r\n     possess, or receive firearms.\r\n\nThe  questions we  must  address relate  to  the words  preceding\r\n\n\"unless,\" and, in particular, the procedure by which one \"has had\r\n\ncivil  rights restored.\"    Under Massachusetts  laws of  general\r\n\napplication,  two of  Caron's  basic civil  rights were  restored\r\n\nautomatically after a lapse  of time or at the  expiration of his\r\n\nsentence; the remaining one was never taken away from him.  \r\n\n     In  an earlier stage of this  case,  United States v. Caron,\r                                                                          \r\n\n64 F.3d 713, 718 (1st Cir. 1995), a panel of  this court, deeming\r\n\nitself bound to follow United States v. Ramos, 961 F.2d 1003 (1st\r                                                       \r\n\nCir. 1992), held that the requirements of   921(a)(20) can be met\r\n\nonly  by \"focused,  individualized, affirmative  action,\" not  by\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nlaws  of  general  or  automatic application.    We  subsequently\r\n\ndecided to  reconsider this  holding en  banc, allowed  the panel\r                                                       \r\n\nopinion to remain in effect  as to the other issues decided,  and\r\n\nasked  for briefing  on one  additional issue:   whether,  as the\r\n\nRamos  panel  reasoned  (regarding  misdemeanors),     921(a)(20)\r               \r\n\ncannot  be satisfied  where  civil  rights  are  not  lost  as  a\r\n\ncollateral  consequence  of  conviction,   since  there  is   \"no\r\n\nindividualized official judgment\" evidencing the state's \"renewed\r\n\ntrust\" in the individual.  Ramos, 961 F.2d at 1009.\r                                          \r\n\n     The government,  after having filed a  brief urging adoption\r\n\nof  the panel's  position,  notified us  that  it was  no  longer\r\n\ndefining  the restoration  of civil  rights to  exclude automatic\r\n\naffirmative actions  based on generic statutes.   It nevertheless\r\n\ndid not retreat from its insistence that  some affirmative action\r\n\nwas required to \"restore\"  such rights.  And it  did not withdraw\r\n\nits fallback contentions that Massachusetts statutes do not fully\r\n\nrestore the civil rights  of convicted felons and, in  any event,\r\n\nexpressly  restrict   their   rights  to   possess   firearms.   \r\n\nNotwithstanding the  government's change of  position, which  was\r\n\nunexplained, we must arrive at our own independent judgment. \r\n\n     After due deliberation, we now hold, in accordance  with our\r\n\nseven sister circuits,1  that civil rights may be restored within\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1   McGrath v.

We\r\n\nalso hold that, at  least where some civil rights are restored by\r\n\nthe  operation of such  laws, the fact  that one  civil right was\r\n\nnever  lost does not prevent an individual from having \"had civil\r\n\nrights restored\" within the meaning of the provision.  \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r\n\nA.  Facts\r                   \r\n\n     We briefly set forth  the relevant facts.  On  two occasions\r\n\nin 1993, rifles, shotguns and  ammunition were seized from Caron.\r\n\nAt the time  of his  arrest, his criminal  record included  three\r\n\nMassachusetts  felony  convictions  (1958,  1959,  and  1963),  a\r\n\nCalifornia  felony  conviction  (1970),  and  a  federal firearms\r\n\nfelony conviction (1977).  All four state convictions constituted\r\n\nviolent  crimes which could  serve as predicates  under the ACCA.\r\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B).\r             \r\n\nB.  Massachusetts Statutory Scheme\r                                            \r\n\n     \"Civil  rights,\" within  the meaning  of    921(a)(20), have\r\n\nbeen generally agreed to comprise the right to vote, the right to\r\n\nseek and  hold public office, and  the right to serve  on a jury.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Cassidy, 899 F.2d 543, 549 (6th Cir. 1990).  As\r                                   \r\n\nan   initial   matter,   therefore,  we   recount   the  relevant\r\n\nMassachusetts laws corresponding to these rights.  \r\n\n     A convicted felon in Massachusetts  does not lose the  right\r\n\nto  vote.   See Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 54,     86,  103B.   He does,\r                         \r\n\nhowever, lose the right  to hold public office while  serving his\r\n\nsentence.  Mass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  279,    30.    And,  a  felon is\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndisqualified  from  juror  service  until seven  years  from  his\r\n\nconviction.   Mass. Gen. L. ch.  234A,   4.   However, even after\r\n\nseven years, a  judge can remove one from a  jury panel solely on\r\n\nthe basis of a prior felony conviction.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 234,  \r\n\n8.\r\n\n     Clearly,  the  Massachusetts  scheme  neither  provides  for\r\n\n\"individualized,   affirmative   actions\"   nor    for   complete\r\n\n\"restoration,\" as the  right to  vote is never  removed.   Ramos,\r                                                                          \r\n\ntherefore,   on  both   fronts,   would   mandate  that   Caron's\r\n\nMassachusetts convictions  count for purposes of the  ACCA.  Now,\r\n\nsitting en banc, we revisit the question whether we should depart\r                         \r\n\nfrom the positions we took in Ramos.\r                                             \r\n\n                           DISCUSSION  \r\n\nA.   Restoration of Civil Rights:  Individualized Acts Only?\r                                                                      \r\n\n     We approach  the task  of statutory interpretation  with the\r\n\nfollowing guideline foremost in mind:\r\n\n     So  long  as  the  statutory   language  is  reasonably\r\n     definite, that  language must ordinarily be regarded as\r\n     conclusive (at least in  the absence of an unmistakable\r\n     legislative intent to the contrary).\r\n\nUnited States v. Charles  George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d  685, 688\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).\r\n\n     The key words of 18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20) are \"expunged,\" \"set\r\n\naside,\"  \"pardoned,\" and  \"civil rights  restored.\"   All of  the\r\n\nwords signify a result:  strike out, efface, eliminate (expunge);\r\n\ndismiss, discard,  annul (set  aside); excuse an  offense without\r\n\npunishment, release  an offender from punishment  (pardon); bring\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nback to an  original state or condition (restore).2   They do not\r\n\naddress  the means by which  the results may  be accomplished or,\r\n\nconsequently, indicate preference for any particular means. \r\n\n     In Ramos,  our panel assumed that  pardons, expungements and\r                       \r\n\nrestorations  of  rights  all  involved  individualized  official\r\n\njudgments and procedures. 961 F.2d at 1010.  But the wide variety\r\n\nof practices  adopted by states has  since been pointed  out.  In\r\n\nUnited States v. Glaser, 14 F.3d  1213, 1218 (7th Cir. 1994), the\r                                 \r\n\ncourt  noted   that  \"[n]either  pardons  nor   expungements  are\r\n\nnecessarily   individualized,\"  citing   mass  pardons   by  both\r\n\nPresidents  Jefferson  and Carter,  and  federal  and state  laws\r\n\nproviding for  \"routine expungement\" of  convictions for juvenile\r\n\noffenses.\r\n\n     In McGrath v.  United States,  60 F.3d 1005,  1008 (2d  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1995),  the  court recognized  that  \"many  states restore  civil\r\n\nrights to convicted felons by means of a general law stating that\r\n\nall rights shall be  reinstated upon the service of  a sentence.\"\r\n\nIt  also noted  that other  states authorize  officials to  issue\r\n\ncertificates  of  restoration  after   a  given  period  of  time\r\n\nfollowing sentence or parole, while a minority of states \"restore\r\n\nrights in  piecemeal fashion,\" and twelve  states apparently have\r\n\nno provision regarding restoration of civil rights.     \r\n\n     Perhaps even more significantly,  in Dickerson v. New Banner\r                                                                           \r\n\nInst., Inc.,  460 U.S. 103  (1983), the Supreme  Court recognized\r                     \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2   These synonyms are  substantially common  to The  Random\r                                                                           \r\nHouse Dictionary (2d ed. 1987), Webster's Third New International\r                                                                           \r\nDictionary (1976), and The American Heritage Dictionary (1973). \r                                                                 \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe   diversity  of   state  post-conviction   actions  such   as\r\n\nexpungement.  It noted that over half the states had enacted such\r\n\nstatutes  and  that they  varied  \"in  almost every  particular,\"\r\n\nranging  from applicability  only to  young offenders  or certain\r\n\noffenses to  automatic expunction, and amounted  to \"nothing less\r\n\nthan  a national patchwork.\"  Id.  at 121-22.  The Court reasoned\r                                          \r\n\nthat  the  purpose  of the  federal  firearms  statute \"would  be\r\n\nfrustrated  by a ruling  that gave effect  to state expunctions,\"\r\n\nid. at 119, and reversed a lower court ruling that had given full\r            \r\n\neffect  to a  state expungement  following a  successfully served\r\n\nperiod of probation.3\r\n\n     Congressional reaction to Dickerson in large part  accounted\r                                                  \r\n\nfor  the crafting of    921(a)(20), which expressly allowed state\r\n\nlaw  to define a predicate conviction for purposes of the federal\r\n\nfirearms laws.4  See  McGrath, 60 F.3d at 1009.   In interpreting\r                                       \r\n\n   921(a)(20),  therefore,  we take  into  account  not only  the\r\n\ndiversity  of state approaches to the restoration of civil rights\r\n\nof convicted  felons but also  the clearly manifested  purpose of\r\n\nCongress  to defer to state laws, in this context, in determining\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3  The  firearm disabilities  were imposed by  18 U.S.C.    \r\n922(g)  and  (h), enacted  under Title  IV  of the  Omnibus Crime\r\nControl and  Safe Streets  Act of  1968, Pub.  L. No.  90-351, 82\r\nStat. 226 (1968) (as amended by the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.\r\nL. No.  90-618, 82 Stat.  1214 (1968)).   In  1986, the  Firearms\r\nOwners' Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (1986),\r\namended this law  by, inter  alia, changing    921(a)(20) to  its\r                                           \r\ncurrent form.\r\n\n     4    The  sentence  preceding  the sentence  at  issue  here\r\nprovides that \"[w]hat  constitutes a  conviction . .  . shall  be\r\ndetermined  in accordance  with the  law  of the  jurisdiction in\r\nwhich the proceedings were held.\"  18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20).\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\npredicate    convictions   and    the    removal    of    firearm\r\n\ndisqualifications.

Houston Welfare\r                                                                           \r\n\nRights Org., 441 U.S. 600, 608 (1979)).\r                     \r\n\n     In light of this background, we discern no basis for reading\r\n\ninto the words  at issue any gloss based on  assumed frequency of\r\n\nuse  or primacy  of  meaning.    And, we  hesitate  to  impose  a\r\n\nqualification  upon  these words  absent some  textual indication\r\n\nthat  such limitation  is warranted.5   Accordingly,  we conclude\r\n\nthat  the plain  language of    921(a)(20)  makes clear  that the\r\n\nrestoration   of   civil   rights   need  not   be   focused   or\r\n\nindividualized.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5  We do not overlook a plausible reading of the last clause\r\nof   921(a)(20)  (\"unless such  pardon . .  . expressly  provides\r\nthat the person may not . . . possess . . . firearms\"), which the\r\npanel  in   Ramos   found  supported   its  interpretation   that\r                           \r\nindividualized action was required.   961 F.2d at  1008.  But  we\r\nthink  an interpretation  consistent  with a  broader reading  is\r\nprovided by Glaser, 14 F.3d at 1218: \r                            \r\n\n     A person who contends that state statutes have restored\r\n     all of his  civil rights . . . [requires us] to examine\r\n     the whole  of state statutory law  to determine whether\r\n     the state treats  him as \"convicted\" for the purpose of\r\n     possessing firearms.  When the state gives the person a\r\n     formal  notice  of  the restoration  of  civil  rights,\r\n     however, the final  sentence of    921(a)(20) instructs\r\n     us to look, not  at the content of the  state's statute\r\n     books but at the contents of the document.\r\n\nThis interpretation jibes with the Court's instruction in Beecham\r                                                                           \r\nv.

There  was no comparable pardon provision applicable to\r\n\nthe shipping or receipt of firearms under former    922(g)(1) and\r\n\n(h)(1).   \r\n\n     In  1981,  S.  1030   was  introduced,  which,  as  revised,\r\n\ncontained  essentially the  language of  the  last sentence  of  \r\n\n921(a)(20).  See  Cassidy, 899 F.2d  at 547.  A  Senate Judiciary\r                                   \r\n\nCommittee Report  explained that the bill would  repair the above\r\n\ndescribed inconsistency between    922  and 1202 by expanding the\r\n\npardon provision to  encompass   922.  See S.  Rep. No. 476, 97th\r                                                    \r\n\nCong., 2d Sess. 18  (1982).  In addition, the  explicit reference\r\n\nto chief executives was dropped and the exemption was expanded to\r\n\ninclude expungements and restorations of civil rights.  See id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n     While  such expansion  might indicate  a movement  away from\r\n\nindividualized action, other excerpts provide  a contrary thrust.\r\n\nFor  instance, to demonstrate the  need for the  bill, the report\r\n\nexpressly cited to Thrall v. Wolfe, 503 F.2d 313 (7th Cir. 1974),\r                                            \r\n\nwhere the court held that a state pardon still did not permit one\r\n\nto receive or purchase a  firearm.  See S.  Rep. No. 476, at  18.\r                                                 \r\n\nAlthough the report  made no  mention of  the kind  of pardon  in\r\n\nThrall, it was  an individualized one.  The  report also used the\r                \r\n\nfollowing language to describe  the last clause of    921(a)(20):\r\n\n\"In the event that the official  granting the pardon, restoration\r                                         \r\n\nof  rights or expungement of record does not desire it to restore\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nthe  right  to  firearm  ownership, this  provision  is  rendered\r\n\ninapplicable where  the order  or pardon expressly  provides that\r\n\nthe person may not possess firearms.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  And\r                                                    \r\n\nit referred to  this last clause as providing \"flexibility should\r\n\nsuch  a pardon or  restoration be  based upon  considerations not\r\n\nrelating  to fitness  to  own a  firearm.\"   Id.  at  12.   Taken\r                                                          \r\n\ntogether,  these  extracts  might  indicate  that  individualized\r\n\nactions were intended.  \r\n\n     Nonetheless, we note that  S. 49, the successor to  S. 1030,\r\n\nwas explained by Senator Hatch as addressing the problem  created\r\n\nby imposing federal sanctions on persons who \"have had their full\r\n\ncivil rights restored pursuant to State law.\"   He added: \r\n\n     This  [bill] will  accommodate  State  reforms  enacted\r\n     since 1968  which permit  dismissal of charges  after a\r\n     plea  and  successful  completion  of   a  probationary\r\n     period.  Since the  Federal prohibition is triggered by\r\n     the  States' conviction,  the  States' law  as to  what\r\n     disqualifies an  individual  from firearms  use  should\r\n     govern.\r\n\n131  Cong. Rec.  S8,689  (daily ed.  June  24, 1985).   Both  the\r\n\nreference to reforms  and the  linking of state  power to  define\r\n\nboth   the   triggering   conviction   and   the   conditions  of\r\n\ndisqualification   tilt   toward   the   inclusion   of   generic\r\n\nrestorations of rights.\r\n\n     It could be  and has  been argued that  Congress, which  has\r\n\nheld itself out as endeavoring  to tighten laws against  firearms\r\n\nabusers,  would not lightly turn over final decision power to the\r\n\nstates,  allowing them  in effect  to nullify  federal sanctions.\r\n\nBut, as the Second Circuit observed, \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          The very decision to have restoration triggered by\r\n     events governed by state law insured anomalous results.\r\n     . .  . They  are the  inevitable consequence  of making\r\n     access to  the exemption  depend on the  differing laws\r\n     and policies of the several states.\r\n\nMcGrath, 60 F.3d at 1009.\r                 \r\n\n     In summary, we discern no such clear and compelling evidence\r\n\nof Congressional intent to  limit restoration of civil rights  to\r\n\nindividualized  procedures  and  judgments   as  to  change   our\r\n\ninterpretation  of  what  we  deem to  be  unambiguous  language.\r\n\nRamos' holding  regarding the  need for individualized  action is\r               \r\n\noverruled.\r\n\nB.   Restoration of Rights Not Taken Away\r                                                   \r\n\n     It remains for us to decide whether civil rights never taken\r\n\naway can be said to be \"restored.\"  The Ramos panel, dealing with\r                                                       \r\n\na person convicted of a misdemeanor, and therefore a person whose\r\n\ncivil rights were left  untouched by Massachusetts law, concluded\r\n\nthat \"restore\" meant the giving back of what had been taken away.\r\n\nIt   addressed  the   anomaly  that   those  convicted   of  mere\r\n\nmisdemeanors could  never have firearms while  those convicted of\r\n\nthe most  serious crimes could qualify, and  responded that \"[b]y\r\n\nthe affirmative  act of  pardon, expungement or  restoration, the\r\n\nstate has declared its renewed trust  in that person.\"  961  F.2d\r\n\nat 1009.\r\n\n     In  McGrath,  the  Second   Circuit  agreed,  rejecting  the\r                          \r\n\nargument  that not having suffered the loss of one's civil rights\r\n\nis the \"functional equivalent\" of restoration, explaining, \"[t]he\r\n\n'restoration'  of  a   thing  never  lost  or  diminished   is  a\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ndefinitional impossibility.\" 60  F.3d at 1007.   It discerned  an\r\n\nintent in the 1986 legislation to treat \"a subsequent forgiveness\r\n\n. . . as an acknowledgement of rehabilitation   or an affirmative\r\n\ngesture  of goodwill  that  merited exemption  from the  firearms\r\n\nbar.\"   Id.   And, as far  as the probability  of \"anomalies\" was\r                    \r\n\nconcerned,  the  court,  as   we  have  noted,  deemed  this   as\r\n\ninevitable.  It  concluded that only  Congress or the  particular\r\n\nstate can properly address the problem.\r\n\n     This   reasoning,  admittedly   technical,  is   not  easily\r\n\ndismissed.   The  use  of  the  word  \"restore\"  calls  for  some\r\n\naffirmative act  by the state.  It is not cavalierly ignored.  In\r\n\nthe instant case,  however, we  are not confronted  with a  total\r\n\nabsence  of affirmative action, as  in Ramos and  McGrath.  Here,\r                                                                   \r\n\naffirmative action has taken  place with respect to the  right to\r\n\nsit on a jury (subject to some contingency) and the right to hold\r\n\npublic  office.  Only the right to vote  was not taken away.  The\r\n\nwords of   921(a)(20) literally apply:  Caron is  \"a person [who]\r\n\n. . . has had  civil rights restored.\"   In this case, therefore,\r\n\nthe dictates of both literalism and sense are met.  \r\n\n     We leave  till another  day the  question whether,  when one\r                                                                           \r\n\ncivil right is restored but two  were never taken away, the  same\r\n\nanswer would  prevail, together  with the basic  question whether\r\n\nthe literal application  of \"restore\"  to a case  where no  civil\r\n\nrights were taken  away is so lacking in sense  as to command the\r\n\nsame result.  We  acknowledge, however, that, contrary  to Ramos'\r                                                                          \r\n\nholding, the  \"restoration\"  requirement does  not  automatically\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nexclude  the  possibility  that   rights  never  taken  away  can\r\n\nsometimes be viewed  as rights  restored.  In  addition, we  note\r\n\nthat   921(a)(20)  would seem to be in need  of revisiting by the\r\n\nCongress so that the  problems that have busied the  courts might\r\n\nbe resolved in harmony with legislative intent.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n     Our two  holdings do not dispose of this case.  There remain\r\n\nother  asserted issues, including whether  the right to  sit on a\r\n\njury has been  sufficiently restored, and whether  there has been\r\n\nan express provision that appellant may not possess firearms.  We\r\n\nmust leave to the district  court the determination whether these\r\n\nand other  issues  have  been  raised and  preserved,  and  their\r\n\ndisposition on the merits.\r\n\n     The judgment  is  vacated and  the  matter remanded  to  the\r                                                                           \r\n\ndistrict court for resentencing.

Appellant Gerald R. Caron was\r                                           \r\n\nconvicted  of  possessing  rifles,  shotguns  and  ammunition  in\r\n\nviolation  of  18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1),  the \"felon-in-possession\"\r\n\nlaw.  Because  at least  three of Caron's  five predicate  felony\r\n\nconvictions  were  for  crimes  of violence,  he  was  subject to\r\n\nsentence  enhancement  under   the  Armed  Career   Criminal  Act\r\n\n(\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C.   924  (e)(1).  Caron received a  prison term\r\n\nof  21 years,  10 months,  plus a  five year  term of  supervised\r\n\nrelease.  See U.S.S.G.   4B1.4. \r                       \r\n\n     The issue in this case is whether three prior  Massachusetts\r\n\nconvictions should  not be counted  as predicate crimes  under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   921(a)(20), which excludes as predicates\r\n\n     [a]ny conviction which has  been expunged, or set aside\r\n     or  for which  a person  has been  pardoned or  has had\r\n     civil  rights  restored  .  .  .  unless  such  pardon,\r\n     expungement, or restoration  of civil rights  expressly\r\n     provides  that  the  person may  not  ship,  transport,\r\n     possess, or receive firearms.\r\n\nThe  questions we  must  address relate  to  the words  preceding\r\n\n\"unless,\" and, in particular, the procedure by which one \"has had\r\n\ncivil  rights restored.\"    Under Massachusetts  laws of  general\r\n\napplication,  two of  Caron's  basic civil  rights were  restored\r\n\nautomatically after a lapse  of time or at the  expiration of his\r\n\nsentence; the remaining one was never taken away from him.  \r\n\n     In  an earlier stage of this  case,  United States v.

Facts\r                   \r\n\n     We briefly set forth  the relevant facts.  On  two occasions\r\n\nin 1993, rifles, shotguns and  ammunition were seized from Caron.\r\n\nAt the time  of his  arrest, his criminal  record included  three\r\n\nMassachusetts  felony  convictions  (1958,  1959,  and  1963),  a\r\n\nCalifornia  felony  conviction  (1970),  and  a  federal firearms\r\n\nfelony conviction (1977).  All four state convictions constituted\r\n\nviolent  crimes which could  serve as predicates  under the ACCA.\r\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B).\r             \r\n\nB.  Massachusetts Statutory Scheme\r                                            \r\n\n     \"Civil  rights,\" within  the meaning  of    921(a)(20), have\r\n\nbeen generally agreed to comprise the right to vote, the right to\r\n\nseek and  hold public office, and  the right to serve  on a jury.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Cassidy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538852\"><a href=\"/opinion/538852/united-states-v-calvin-cassidy/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (6th Cir. 1990).  As\r                                   \r\n\nan   initial   matter,   therefore,  we   recount   the  relevant\r\n\nMassachusetts laws corresponding to these rights.  \r\n\n     A convicted felon in Massachusetts  does not lose the  right\r\n\nto  vote.   See Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 54,     86,  103B.   He does,\r                         \r\n\nhowever, lose the right  to hold public office while  serving his\r\n\nsentence.  Mass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  279,    30.    And,  a  felon is\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndisqualified  from  juror  service  until seven  years  from  his\r\n\nconviction.   Mass. Gen. L. ch.  234A,   4.   However, even after\r\n\nseven years, a  judge can remove one from a  jury panel solely on\r\n\nthe basis of a prior felony conviction.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 234,  \r\n\n8.\r\n\n     Clearly,  the  Massachusetts  scheme  neither  provides  for\r\n\n\"individualized,   affirmative   actions\"   nor    for   complete\r\n\n\"restoration,\" as the  right to  vote is never  removed.   Ramos,\r                                                                          \r\n\ntherefore,   on  both   fronts,   would   mandate  that   Caron's\r\n\nMassachusetts convictions  count for purposes of the  ACCA.  Now,\r\n\nsitting en banc, we revisit the question whether we should depart\r                         \r\n\nfrom the positions we took in Ramos.\r                                             \r\n\n                           DISCUSSION  \r\n\nA.

The  report also used the\r                \r\n\nfollowing language to describe  the last clause of    921(a)(20):\r\n\n\"In the event that the official  granting the pardon, restoration\r                                         \r\n\nof  rights or expungement of record does not desire it to restore\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nthe  right  to  firearm  ownership, this  provision  is  rendered\r\n\ninapplicable where  the order  or pardon expressly  provides that\r\n\nthe person may not possess firearms.\"  Id.

Since the  Federal prohibition is triggered by\r\n     the  States' conviction,  the  States' law  as to  what\r\n     disqualifies an  individual  from firearms  use  should\r\n     govern.\r\n\n131  Cong.

Both  the\r\n\nreference to reforms  and the  linking of state  power to  define\r\n\nboth   the   triggering   conviction   and   the   conditions  of\r\n\ndisqualification   tilt   toward   the   inclusion   of   generic\r\n\nrestorations of rights.\r\n\n     It could be  and has  been argued that  Congress, which  has\r\n\nheld itself out as endeavoring  to tighten laws against  firearms\r\n\nabusers,  would not lightly turn over final decision power to the\r\n\nstates,  allowing them  in effect  to nullify  federal sanctions.\r\n\nBut, as the Second Circuit observed, \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          The very decision to have restoration triggered by\r\n     events governed by state law insured anomalous results.\r\n     . .  . They  are the  inevitable consequence  of making\r\n     access to  the exemption  depend on the  differing laws\r\n     and policies of the several states.\r\n\nMcGrath, 60 F.3d at 1009.\r                 \r\n\n     In summary, we discern no such clear and compelling evidence\r\n\nof Congressional intent to  limit restoration of civil rights  to\r\n\nindividualized  procedures  and  judgments   as  to  change   our\r\n\ninterpretation  of  what  we  deem to  be  unambiguous  language.\r\n\nRamos' holding  regarding the  need for individualized  action is\r               \r\n\noverruled.\r\n\nB.   Restoration of Rights Not Taken Away\r                                                   \r\n\n     It remains for us to decide whether civil rights never taken\r\n\naway can be said to be \"restored.\"  The Ramos panel, dealing with\r                                                       \r\n\na person convicted of a misdemeanor, and therefore a person whose\r\n\ncivil rights were left  untouched by Massachusetts law, concluded\r\n\nthat \"restore\" meant the giving back of what had been taken away.\r\n\nIt   addressed  the   anomaly  that   those  convicted   of  mere\r\n\nmisdemeanors could  never have firearms while  those convicted of\r\n\nthe most  serious crimes could qualify, and  responded that \"[b]y\r\n\nthe affirmative  act of  pardon, expungement or  restoration, the\r\n\nstate has declared its renewed trust  in that person.\"  961  F.2d\r\n\nat 1009.\r\n\n     In  McGrath,  the  Second   Circuit  agreed,  rejecting  the\r                          \r\n\nargument  that not having suffered the loss of one's civil rights\r\n\nis the \"functional equivalent\" of restoration, explaining, \"[t]he\r\n\n'restoration'  of  a   thing  never  lost  or  diminished   is  a\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ndefinitional impossibility.\" 60  F.3d at 1007.   It discerned  an\r\n\nintent in the 1986 legislation to treat \"a subsequent forgiveness\r\n\n. . . as an acknowledgement of rehabilitation   or an affirmative\r\n\ngesture  of goodwill  that  merited exemption  from the  firearms\r\n\nbar.\"   Id.   And, as far  as the probability  of \"anomalies\" was\r                    \r\n\nconcerned,  the  court,  as   we  have  noted,  deemed  this   as\r\n\ninevitable.  It  concluded that only  Congress or the  particular\r\n\nstate can properly address the problem.\r\n\n     This   reasoning,  admittedly   technical,  is   not  easily\r\n\ndismissed.   The  use  of  the  word  \"restore\"  calls  for  some\r\n\naffirmative act  by the state.  It is not cavalierly ignored.  In\r\n\nthe instant case,  however, we  are not confronted  with a  total\r\n\nabsence  of affirmative action, as  in Ramos and  McGrath.  Here,\r                                                                   \r\n\naffirmative action has taken  place with respect to the  right to\r\n\nsit on a jury (subject to some contingency) and the right to hold\r\n\npublic  office.  Only the right to vote  was not taken away.  The\r\n\nwords of   921(a)(20) literally apply:  Caron is  \"a person [who]\r\n\n. . . has had  civil rights restored.\"   In this case, therefore,\r\n\nthe dictates of both literalism and sense are met.  \r\n\n     We leave  till another  day the  question whether,  when one\r                                                                           \r\n\ncivil right is restored but two  were never taken away, the  same\r\n\nanswer would  prevail, together  with the basic  question whether\r\n\nthe literal application  of \"restore\"  to a case  where no  civil\r\n\nrights were taken  away is so lacking in sense  as to command the\r\n\nsame result.  We  acknowledge, however, that, contrary  to Ramos'\r                                                                          \r\n\nholding, the  \"restoration\"  requirement does  not  automatically\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nexclude  the  possibility  that   rights  never  taken  away  can\r\n\nsometimes be viewed  as rights  restored.  In  addition, we  note\r\n\nthat   921(a)(20)  would seem to be in need  of revisiting by the\r\n\nCongress so that the  problems that have busied the  courts might\r\n\nbe resolved in harmony with legislative intent.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n     Our two  holdings do not dispose of this case.  There remain\r\n\nother  asserted issues, including whether  the right to  sit on a\r\n\njury has been  sufficiently restored, and whether  there has been\r\n\nan express provision that appellant may not possess firearms.  We\r\n\nmust leave to the district  court the determination whether these\r\n\nand other  issues  have  been  raised and  preserved,  and  their\r\n\ndisposition on the merits.\r\n\n     The judgment  is  vacated and  the  matter remanded  to  the\r                                                                           \r\n\ndistrict court for resentencing.   As to all other  issues in the\r                                                                           \r\n\ncase, the original panel opinion shall remain in full force.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n</pre>",
