METZENBAUM,\r\n\n                         Appellant.\r\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin, and Stahl,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Brian Wolfman, with whom Alan B. Morrison and Public Citizen\r\nLitigation Group, were on brief for appellant.\r\n   John G. Fabiano, with whom Peter A. Spaeth, Hale and Dorr LLP,\r\nRalph C. Ferrara, Edwin G. Schallert, and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton,\r\nwere on brief for appellees.\r\n\nJune 28, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  This appeal is an offshoot of a\r\nmassive securities fraud, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duties\r\nclass-action lawsuit brought against John Hancock Mutual Life\r\nInsurance Company, John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company,\r\nand John Hancock Distributors, Inc.  (collectively \"John Hancock\"). \r\nThe underlying suit, filed in September 1995 on behalf of nearly\r\nfour million present and former policyholders, challenged a number\r\nof John Hancock's sales and marketing practices from 1979 through\r\nthe mid-1990s.  On June 6, 1997, the putative class entered into a\r\nStipulation of Settlement with John Hancock.  Eventually, the\r\ndistrict court certified the class and approved the settlement,\r\nexplaining its reasoning in a comprehensive opinion.  See Duhaime\r\nv. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. 54 (D. Mass. 1997)\r\n(\"Duhaime I\").  Because the particulars of the lawsuit and the\r\nsettlement terms are largely irrelevant to our analysis, we refer\r\ninterested readers to Duhaime I and confine our focus to facts\r\npertinent to this appeal.\r\nAfter the details of the proposed settlement were\r\ncommunicated to the class in late June 1997, seventy-seven absent\r\nclass members (i.e., class members not named as parties) came\r\nforward and filed written objections.  Among the objectors were\r\nappellant Howard M. Metzenbaum and sixteen policyholders\r\nrepresented by attorney Diane Nygaard.  We follow the lead of the\r\nparties and refer to the Nygaard-led group as the \"Rose Objectors.\" \r\nMetzenbaum initially took issue with various aspects of\r\nthe class notice and with the structure of the proposed counsel-\r\nfees award, but after negotiating changes to the notice procedures\r\nthat satisfied his concerns in this area, he chose to press only\r\nhis counsel-fees objection.  The Rose Objectors filed sweeping\r\nobjections to nearly all aspects of the proposed settlement.  On\r\nOctober 24, 1997, the district court held a hearing to evaluate the\r\nfairness of the settlement.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).  Metzenbaum\r\nand the Rose Objectors appeared to present their arguments in\r\nopposition.  On December 31, 1997, the court filed separate\r\nmemoranda and orders approving the settlement, see Duhaime I, 177\r\nF.R.D. at 72, but altering to some degree the fee-payment structure\r\nconceived by the settling parties, see Duhaime v. John Hancock\r\nMutual Life Ins. Co., 989 F. Supp. 375, 378-80 (D. Mass. 1997)\r\n(\"Duhaime II\").  In doing so, the court largely sustained\r\nMetzenbaum's objections, see id., but rejected the Rose Objectors'\r\ncomplaints as lacking in merit, see Duhaime I, 177 F.R.D. at 71-72.\r\nShortly after the district court approved the settlement,\r\nAttorney Nygaard, acting on behalf of the Rose Objectors, filed a\r\nrequest for counsel fees in the district court and a notice of\r\nappeal from the court's approval of the settlement.  When\r\nMetzenbaum's counsel learned of the appeal, he telephoned Nygaard\r\nand asked that she serve him with copies of the appellate briefs. \r\nNygaard agreed to put Metzenbaum's counsel on the service list, but\r\nadded that the appeal soon would be settled on \"very, very good\"\r\nterms for her clients.  Shortly thereafter, the Rose Objectors\r\nwithdrew with prejudice both their appeal and their still-pending\r\nrequest for counsel fees.    \r\nAt this point, Metzenbaum became concerned that something\r\nwas amiss because the Rose Objectors apparently had secured a side\r\nsettlement more favorable than the class settlement and no court\r\nhad evaluated the fairness of the side settlement.  In Metzenbaum's\r\nview (elaborated below), a post-judgment settlement of this nature\r\nviolates both the letter and spirit of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e):  \"A\r\nclass action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the\r\napproval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or\r\ncompromise shall be given to all members of the class in such\r\nmanner as the court directs.\"  See also In re General Motors Corp.\r\nPick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 804-19\r\n(3d Cir. 1995) (Rule 23(e) scrutiny entails a detailed inquiry into\r\nwhether the proposed class action settlement is fair, reasonable,\r\nand adequate).  Metzenbaum's counsel wrote to Nygaard, class\r\ncounsel, and John Hancock's counsel, advising them that the side\r\nsettlement should be presented to the district court and asking for\r\ndisclosure of its terms.  Counsel for the so-called \"settling\r\nparties\" responded that disclosure and approval were not required\r\nunder the circumstances.  The responses indicated that, in addition\r\nto resolving the claims of the Rose Objectors, the side settlement\r\nalso resolved claims of other clients of Attorney Nygaard who had\r\nopted out of the class.  The responses did not, however, disclose\r\nthe terms of the side settlement or even the parties to the side\r\nsettlement.  Metzenbaum suggests that class counsel, as well as\r\nJohn Hancock, may have been involved in negotiating the side\r\nsettlement, and we accept the suggestion for purposes of this\r\nappeal.  \r\nMetzenbaum then served discovery on John Hancock,\r\nNygaard, and class counsel, but received replies stating that the\r\ndiscovery requests were untimely and that, as an absent class\r\nmember, he was not a \"party\" entitled to discovery.  Consequently,\r\nMetzenbaum moved the district court to compel post-judgment\r\ndiscovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 and, in the event the court did\r\nnot regard him as a party entitled to discovery, to permit him to\r\nintervene as a party under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.  In making his\r\nmotion, Metzenbaum informed the court that, should the requested\r\ndiscovery reveal a substantial difference between the side\r\nsettlement with the Rose Objectors and the settlement offered to\r\nthe class, he would file a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)\r\nasking the court either to require John Hancock to offer the same\r\ndeal to all class members, including himself, or to abrogate the\r\nRose Objectors' side settlement and require that the proceeds be\r\ndisbursed to the class.  John Hancock opposed the motion, pointing\r\nout, inter alia, that the class settlement was entirely unaffected\r\nby the side settlement with the Rose Objectors.  The court denied\r\nMetzenbaum's motion by margin order.  This appeal, which only John\r\nHancock actively opposes, followed.\r\nIn framing their appellate arguments, the parties have\r\nsounded broad themes and taken a number of controversial positions. \r\nMetzenbaum asserts that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) applies even to\r\nsettlements concluded on appeal; that in the circumstances\r\npresented here, he was entitled to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 37's\r\nenforcement provisions post-judgment; that absent class members\r\nsuch as himself are \"parties\" to class actions entitled to\r\ndiscovery; and alternatively, that he was entitled to intervene as\r\na party in the district court either as of right, see Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 24(a), or by court permission, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).  John\r\nHancock counters that Metzenbaum lacked Article III standing in the\r\ndistrict court because he failed to allege an injury in fact, i.e.,\r\nthat he has suffered, or imminently will suffer, an invasion of a\r\nconcrete, particularized, and legally protected interest, see Lujan\r\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992); that absent\r\nclass members are not parties to class actions; that Metzenbaum's\r\nallegations fail to establish an entitlement to intervention,\r\neither as of right or by court permission; and that the district\r\ncourt in any event properly declined Metzenbaum's request for\r\ndiscovery because the material sought could provide no basis for\r\nupsetting the judgment.  \r\nAs to whether Metzenbaum had Article III standing, we\r\nthink it sufficient to observe that the line of argument set forth\r\nin the motion to compel (and on appeal) necessitates a discussion\r\nof the possibility of a fraud, see infra at 16-18, and that\r\nMetzenbaum, as a class member, has standing to press such an\r\nargument because he has a concrete, particularized, and legally\r\nprotected interest in both faithful representation by class counsel\r\nand in not being defrauded by an adverse party, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n60(b)(3) (recognizing \"fraud . . . misrepresentation, or other\r\nmisconduct of an adverse party\" as a basis for seeking relief from\r\njudgment).  As to the potentially difficult issues of Metzenbaum's\r\n\"party\" status and right to intervention in order to obtain\r\ndiscovery, we think they are extinguished for purposes of this case\r\nby our answer to a narrower, logically antecedent question:  Must\r\na district court scrutinize and approve as fair an appellate side\r\nsettlement between the parties who have reached a court-approved\r\nsettlement of a class action and separately represented class\r\nmembers who had objected to the settlement prior to its approval? \r\nMetzenbaum contends that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and/or general class\r\naction principles derived from the case law give class members like\r\nhimself an interest in such scrutiny and approval.  But as we\r\nexplain below, Metzenbaum reads the authority he cites too broadly. \r\nWhere, as here, the class settlement is unaffected by the side\r\nsettlement and there has been no demonstration of a fraud, absent\r\nclass members like Metzenbaum simply have no unconditional right to\r\nhave a court review and approve as fair the terms of such a side\r\nsettlement.\r\nWe start with Metzenbaum's contention that Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 23(e) explicitly requires court approval of the side settlement. \r\nAssuming arguendo that the Rule somehow applies post-judgment to\r\nthe compromise of an appeal from a district court's approval of a\r\nclass-action settlement, but see Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (\"These rules\r\ngovern the procedure in the United States district courts . . . .\")\r\n(emphasis supplied), we reject the argument on plain language\r\ngrounds.  Rule 23(e) only requires court approval of the dismissal\r\nor compromise of \"[the] class action\" itself; it in no way suggests\r\nthat negotiated resolutions of disputes peripheral to the class\r\naction need be approved.  It is for precisely this reason that\r\ncourts have declined to require full Rule 23(e) approval of\r\nseparate merits settlements that class-action defendants have\r\nnegotiated with absent class members.  See, e.g., In re General\r\nMotors Corp. Engine Interchange Litig., 594 F.2d 1106, 1138-40 (7th\r\nCir. 1979) (judicial examination of such separate merits\r\nsettlements is not to ensure the fairness of the settlements, but\r\nonly to ensure that the settlement offers provided the absent class\r\nmembers with sufficient information to make an informed decision\r\nwhether to settle or proceed); In re Shell Oil Refinery, 152 F.R.D.\r\n526, 536 (E.D. La. 1989) (same); see generally 2 Herbert Newberg &amp;\r\nAlba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions  11.75, at 11-199 (3d ed.\r\n1992); 7B Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and\r\nProcedure  1797, at 377-78 (2d ed. 1986); cf. Weight Watchers of\r\nPhiladelphia v. Weight Watchers Int'l Inc., 455 F.2d 770, 773 (2d\r\nCir. 1972) (Friendly, J.) (declining to require full Rule 23(e)\r\napproval of settlements with potential class members prior to class\r\ncertification).  Such individual side settlements are just that  \r\nside settlements; they are not a settlement of the class action\r\nitself.\r\nMetzenbaum also argues that general class action\r\nprinciples support his proposed disclosure and approval\r\nrequirement.  In support of his position, Metzenbaum cites a number\r\nof complex litigation cases in which, even though Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n23(e) did not strictly apply, courts either have required court\r\nscrutiny of or actually scrutinized agreements peripheral to the\r\nclass action.  Unlike the just-mentioned In re General Motors Corp.\r\nand In re Shell Oil Refinery cases (where, despite the\r\ninapplicability of Rule 23(e), courts scrutinized side settlements\r\nwith absent class members to ensure that those class members made\r\ninformed settlement decisions), the cases Metzenbaum cites all\r\ninvolved circumstances in which there were systemic incentives for\r\nclass counsel or the named class plaintiffs to act in disregard of\r\nfiduciary duties owed to absent class members in concluding these\r\nperipheral agreements.\r\nFor example, noting \"the danger that the lawyers might\r\nurge a class settlement at a low figure or on a less-than-optimal\r\nbasis in exchange for red-carpet treatment on fees,\" Weinberger v.\r\nGreat Northern Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 524 (1st Cir. 1991), we\r\nhave directed district courts to exercise their equitable\r\njurisdiction to review counsel-fee arrangements negotiated in\r\nconnection with class-action settlements   even where the counsel\r\nfees are not taken from a common fund but are instead paid\r\nseparately by a class-action defendant, see id. at 523-25. \r\nSimilarly, courts in two recent mass-tort settlements appear to\r\nhave required approval of settlements struck between clients of\r\nclass counsel who were not members of a class and a party opposing\r\nthe class.  See Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 157 F.R.D. 246,\r\n294-99, 307-10 (E.D. Pa. 1994), rev'd on other grounds, 83 F.3d\r\n610, 622 (3d Cir. 1996), aff'd 521 U.S. 59 (1997); In re Asbestos\r\nLitig., 90 F.3d 963, 978-80 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. granted and\r\njudgment vacated on other grounds, 117 S. Ct. 2503 (1997).  In each\r\ninstance, the court acted out of concern that class counsel's\r\nsimultaneous representation of the class and individual clients\r\noutside the class might have given rise to a conflict of interest. \r\nSee Georgine, 157 F.R.D. at 299; In re Asbestos, 90 F.3d at 980. \r\nAnd the Fourth Circuit, having reached the controversial conclusion\r\nthat Rule 23(e) does not apply prior to class certification, see\r\nShelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d 1298, 1302-04 (4th Cir. 1978),\r\nnonetheless held that pre-certification voluntary dismissals of\r\nclaims by the named plaintiffs of a putative class should be\r\nevaluated under the Rule 23(e) paradigm pursuant to the district\r\ncourt's \"supervisory power over and . . . special responsibility in\r\nactions brought as class actions,\" id. at 1306.  In Shelton, the\r\nconcern was that a named plaintiff may succumb to self-interest and\r\nsettle in such a way as to harm the interests of absent class\r\nmembers.  See id. at 1304-06 &amp; nn. 17-19. \r\nBut we see no inherent risk of victimization of the\r\nuninformed, convergence of interests of putative adversaries, or\r\nconflict of interests between or among those to whom fiduciary\r\nduties are owed, in an appellate side settlement of the type\r\nMetzenbaum challenges.  Tellingly, Metzenbaum does not explain how\r\na party to or attorney involved in such an appellate side\r\nsettlement might be tempted to act in derogation of a fiduciary\r\nduty.  This of course means that Metzenbaum has not specified how\r\nclass counsel   the only persons potentially involved in the side\r\nsettlement with fiduciary duties to absent class members like\r\nhimself   faced systemically generated incentives to violate such\r\na duty in compromising the Rose Objectors' appeal.  Instead,\r\nMetzenbaum derives from the cases just described a broader\r\nprinciple:  a generalized concern on the part of courts that\r\n\"similarly-situated class members [be] treated similarly and that\r\nmonies paid by the defendants for purposes of settlement inure to\r\nthe benefit of all class members.\"  Appellant's Brief at 16; see\r\nalso id. at 17, 19, and 23.  Using this principle as his point of\r\ndeparture, Metzenbaum argues that the injury he suffered is his\r\nalleged unequal treatment (in terms of settlement results) vis-a-\r\nvis the Rose Objectors.   \r\nMetzenbaum's statement of the applicable principle is\r\nsound insofar as it implies that courts are concerned with adequate\r\nand similar results for all similarly situated class members in a\r\nclass action settlement.  See, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55\r\nF.3d at 808 (\"One sign that a settlement may not be fair is that\r\nsome segments of the class are treated differently from others.\"). \r\nYet this is only because different recoveries for similarly harmed\r\npersons who have remained within the class and are represented by\r\nclass counsel (or high attorney-fee awards negotiated in connection\r\nwith paltry class settlements) can constitute powerful evidence\r\nthat a fiduciary obligation has not been honored.  See In re\r\nGeneral Motors Corp., 594 F.2d at 1139 (\"Rule 23(e) requires\r\njudicial approval of class action settlements to guard against\r\npossible ineffective representation of absentees' interests by the\r\nrepresentative parties.\"); see also, e.g., In re General Motors\r\nCorp., 55 F.3d at 809 (courts should \"withhold approval from any\r\nsettlement that creates conflicts among the class\"); Weinberger,\r\n925 F.2d at 524-25 (discussing oversight of attorney-fee agreements\r\nas necessary to prevent class-harming conflicts of interest between\r\nthe plaintiff class and class counsel); 7B Wright, et al., Federal\r\nPractice and Procedure  1797, at 340-41 (discussing oversight of\r\nsettlements involving representative parties as necessary to ensure\r\nthat the representative parties had not become fainthearted or\r\nsettled solely out of self-interest).  But to the extent that\r\nMetzenbaum reads cases like Weinberger, Georgine, In re Asbestos,\r\nand Shelton as broadly directing courts entertaining class actions\r\nto ensure similar recoveries by all similarly harmed persons within\r\nthe original class, regardless of the litigation decisions they\r\nhave made, he is wrong.  \r\nWe simply have no tradition of court intervention to\r\nensure that similarly victimized plaintiffs who have retained\r\nseparate counsel and have made different litigation decisions get\r\nsimilar results.  Cf., e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2) (requiring\r\nthat notice to the class explicitly inform class members that they\r\nmay opt out of the class action).  Similarly harmed plaintiffs\r\noften secure separate representation and subsequently enter into\r\nmaterially different settlements with a common defendant.  In such\r\nsituations, the settling parties have no legally protected interest\r\nin having a court scrutinize each settlement to ensure that all\r\nplaintiffs receive similar consideration for their releases.  A\r\nfundamental assumption of our adversary system is that adversaries\r\nrepresented by persons with presumably undivided loyalties will\r\ntend to negotiate acceptably fair resolutions of their disputes. \r\nAs we have implied, courts oversee class-action settlements only\r\nbecause factors unique to the class-action context   the already-\r\nnoted tendency towards a coincidence of interests between class\r\nrepresentatives and the party opposing the class, and the chasm\r\nbetween representatives and faceless, absent class members   call\r\ninto question whether the representatives' loyalties are in fact\r\nundivided. \r\nWe come then to the basic question:  Are Metzenbaum and\r\nthe Rose Objectors so \"similarly situated\" that we should view any\r\ndifference in their ultimate recoveries as evidence of a\r\nsystemically induced breach of a fiduciary duty owed to Metzenbaum\r\nand absent class members?  We think the answer clearly is \"no.\" \r\nAlthough Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors are members of the same\r\nclass and originally were represented by the same class counsel,\r\nthey eventually secured separate representation through which they\r\ntook decidedly different positions with respect to the proposed\r\nsettlement and opposite positions with respect to the final\r\njudgment.  So long as there was no fraud, that the Rose Objectors\r\nmight have obtained something in return for eventually dropping\r\ntheir efforts to disrupt the settlement constitutes no cognizable\r\ninjury to Metzenbaum, who has received or will receive the full\r\nbenefit of the bargain to which he acquiesced and which the\r\ndistrict court deemed fair under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).\r\nIn his appellate brief, Metzenbaum hints at but does not\r\nfully develop two additional rationales for court intervention\r\nwhich might be taken as alternatives to his similar-results-for-\r\nthe-similarly-harmed argument.  The first is that courts should\r\nintervene to prevent possible extortion; the second is that courts\r\nshould intervene to prevent possible fraud.  Before we conclude, we\r\nbelieve it important to say a few words about each of these two\r\narguments.\r\nThe Rose Objectors had little to lose in pressing their\r\nappeal.  If they had lost, they would have remained entitled to the\r\nrelief secured by the class.  If they had won, they almost\r\ncertainly would have brought about a more favorable settlement for\r\nthe class.  See 2 Newberg on Class Actions  11.14, at 11-18 (\"In\r\ngeneral, after a class is certified, particularly in a class action\r\nfor damages, there is a great likelihood of settlement before trial\r\nbecause of the increased assessment by defense counsel of exposure\r\nto substantial liability.\").  In the class-action context, such\r\nlittle-to-lose situations sometimes cause concern because they\r\nraise the specter of extortive legal proceedings pressed \"not to\r\nredress real wrongs, but to realize upon their nuisance value.\" \r\nCohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 548 (1949)\r\n(acknowledging the incentives management sometimes has to settle\r\n\"strike suits\" brought as shareholder derivative actions).  While\r\nwe have no reason to believe that the Rose Objectors or Attorney\r\nNygaard extorted their appellate settlement, we recognize that a\r\nclass member and his or her attorney conceivably could object to a\r\nproposed settlement solely to set up an appeal designed to obtain\r\na nuisance value recovery and/or advantageous fee arrangement.  We\r\nalso recognize that, in Weinberger, a concern with deterring\r\nextortionate settlements partially informed our decision to subject\r\nto district court scrutiny all fee arrangements negotiated in\r\nconnection with class-action settlements.  See 925 F.2d at 524-25. \r\nMetzenbaum mentions the possibility of extortion in\r\nconnection with the side settlement of the Rose Objectors' appeal. \r\nBut in doing so, he neither argues that extortion might have caused\r\nclass counsel to bargain away some portion of the class's\r\nnegotiated recovery nor seeks to assert a third-party interest  \r\ne.g., the interest John Hancock (the party most obviously\r\npositioned to press an extortion argument under the circumstances)\r\nmight have in not being subjected to an extortionate appeal   on\r\ngrounds that John Hancock is unlikely to seek court review of the\r\nside settlement.  Instead, Metzenbaum merely suggests that\r\nextortion of this type will cause a party opposing a class action\r\nto hold back funds that otherwise might have been offered to the\r\nclass in the class settlement.  Disclosure and approval is needed,\r\nhe suggests, to ensure that the class has access to these funds in\r\nsettlement negotiations.\r\nWe think that this line of argument is answered by what\r\nwe already have stated.  Courts examine the fairness of certain\r\nclass-related settlements because it is thought that, fiduciary\r\nobligations notwithstanding, circumstances unique to the complex\r\nlitigation context sometimes tempt class counsel and/or named class\r\nplaintiffs to conclude settlements that are not in the best\r\ninterests of absent class members.  In these situations, courts\r\nassess whether the settlements are fair, reasonable, and adequate,\r\nsee, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 804-19, because\r\nfair settlements can more confidently be regarded as having been\r\nnegotiated in compliance with the class representatives' fiduciary\r\nduties.  But so long as the class settlement remains unaffected,\r\nnothing about the settlement of an extortionate appeal by\r\nseparately represented, objecting, absent class members logically\r\ncalls into question whether the class has been faithfully served by\r\nits representatives.  Such a settlement thus would not give a class\r\nmember the right to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and its related\r\ndoctrines as a means of creating a bigger settlement pie post-\r\njudgment, at least under the rationale alluded to here.     \r\nOf course, matters could be different if there were some\r\nindication that the side settlement of an appeal was a vehicle for \r\nimplementing or furthering a fraud.  Unlike an appellate side\r\nsettlement which at the very most merely hints that the class might\r\nhave been able to obtain more in the class settlement, a fraud-\r\nmasking appellate settlement should be understood to involve\r\naffirmative deceit upon the class or court   e.g., use of the\r\nrecipient of the appellate settlement as a payment conduit between\r\nthe party opposing the class and class counsel in an end run around\r\na lower court's counsel-fees ruling.  Seizing on the many cases\r\nwhich mention the prevention of \"collusion\" between class counsel\r\nor class representatives and the party opposing the class as a\r\njustification for court scrutiny of class-action settlements and\r\nperipheral agreements negotiated in connection with class-action\r\nsettlements, see, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 805;\r\nWeinberger, 925 F.2d at 924-25; Georgine, 157 F.R.D. at 311,\r\nMetzenbaum appears to suggest that appellate side settlements of\r\nthe sort we consider should be subject to scrutiny and approval as\r\na means of detecting whether they are masking a fraud.\r\n But after final judgment has entered, our strong\r\ninterest in the finality of judgments leads courts to intervene in\r\na search for evidence of fraud only if there has been some showing\r\nthat a fraud actually has occurred.  See H.K. Porter Co. v.\r\nGoodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 536 F.2d 1115, 1118-22 (6th Cir. 1976)\r\n(discovery in aid of a motion attacking a final judgment on the\r\nbasis of fraud should be permitted only if there is some evidence\r\nof fraud); see also Midwest Franchise Corp. v. Metromedia\r\nRestaurant Group, Inc., 177 F.R.D. 438, 440 (N.D. Iowa 1997) (prima\r\nfacie showing of fraud required); United States ex rel. Free v.\r\nPeters, 826 F. Supp. 1153, 1154 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (same).  Plainly,\r\nthere has been no such showing here.  In making this point, we\r\nemphasize that a court's obligation to scrutinize class-action\r\nsettlements and some agreements peripheral to class-action\r\nsettlements for evidence of collusion, see, e.g., In re General\r\nMotors Corp., 55 F.3d at 805; Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 924-25, does\r\nnot in some way trump the systemic interest in finality of\r\njudgments   an interest that might be thought particularly strong\r\nin the class-action context, see Valerio v. Boise Cascade Corp., 80\r\nF.R.D. 626, 647 (N.D. Cal. 1978) (finality considerations are \"even\r\nmore pressing in the class action context\" because of the number of\r\npeople the final judgment affects).  Thus, it does not open the\r\ndoor to post-judgment discovery where there is nothing more than\r\nspeculation that a fraud might have occurred. \r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n",

(collectively \"John Hancock\"). The underlying suit, filed in           September 1995 on behalf of nearly four million present and former policyholders, challenged a number of John           Hancock's sales and marketing practices from 1979 through the mid-1990s. On June 6, 1997, the putative class           entered into a Stipulation of Settlement with John Hancock. Eventually, the district court certified the class and           approved the settlement, explaining its reasoning in a comprehensive opinion. See Duhaime v. John Hancock           Mutual Life Ins. Co., 177 F.R.D. 54 (D. Mass. 1997) (\"Duhaime I\"). Because the particulars of the lawsuit and           the settlement terms are largely irrelevant to our analysis, we refer interested readers to Duhaime I and confine           our focus to facts pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the details of the proposed settlement were communicated to the class in late June 1997, seventy-seven           absent class members (i.e., class members not named as parties) came forward and filed written objections.           Among the objectors were appellant Howard M. Metzenbaum and sixteen policyholders represented by           attorney Diane Nygaard. We follow the lead of the parties and refer to the Nygaard-led group as the \"Rose           Objectors.\"Metzenbaum initially took issue with various aspects of the class notice and with the structure of the           proposed counsel-fees award, but after negotiating changes to the notice procedures that satisfied his concerns in           this area, he chose to press only his counsel-fees objection. The Rose Objectors filed sweeping objections to           nearly all aspects of the proposed settlement. On October 24, 1997, the district court held a hearing to evaluate           the fairness of the settlement. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors appeared to           present their arguments in opposition. On December 31, 1997, the court filed separate memoranda and orders           approving the settlement, see Duhaime I, 177 F.R.D. at 72, but altering to some degree the fee-payment           structure conceived by the settling parties, see Duhaime v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., 989 F. Supp.           375, 378-80 (D. Mass. 1997) (\"Duhaime II\"). In doing so, the court largely sustained Metzenbaum's objections,           see id., but rejected the Rose Objectors' complaints as lacking in merit, see Duhaime I, 177 F.R.D. at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the district court approved the settlement, Attorney Nygaard, acting on behalf of the Rose           Objectors, filed a request for counsel fees in the district court and a notice of appeal from the court's approval of           the settlement. When Metzenbaum's counsel learned of the appeal, he telephoned Nygaard and asked that she           serve him with copies of the appellate briefs. Nygaard agreed to put Metzenbaum's counsel on the service list,           but added that the appeal soon would be settled on \"very, very good\" terms for her clients. Shortly thereafter, the           Rose Objectors withdrew with prejudice both their appeal and their still-pending request for counsel fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Metzenbaum became concerned that something was amiss because the Rose Objectors apparently           had secured a side settlement more favorable than the class settlement and no court had evaluated the fairness of           the side settlement. In Metzenbaum's view (elaborated below), a post-judgment settlement of this nature violates           both the letter and spirit of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e): \"A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without           the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of           the class in such manner as the court directs.\" See also In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank           Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 804-19 (3d Cir. 1995) (Rule 23(e) scrutiny entails a detailed inquiry into           whether the proposed class action settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate). Metzenbaum's counsel wrote to           Nygaard, class counsel, and John Hancock's counsel, advising them that the side settlement should be presented           to the district court and asking for disclosure of its terms. Counsel for the so-called \"settling parties\" responded           that disclosure and approval were not required under the circumstances. The responses indicated that, in addition           to resolving the claims of the Rose Objectors, the side settlement also resolved claims of other clients of Attorney           Nygaard who had opted out of the class. The responses did not, however, disclose the terms of the side           settlement or even the parties to the side settlement. Metzenbaum suggests that class counsel, as well as John           Hancock, may have been involved in negotiating the side settlement, and we accept the suggestion for purposes           of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metzenbaum then served discovery on John Hancock, Nygaard, and class counsel, but received replies stating           that the discovery requests were untimely and that, as an absent class member, he was not a \"party\" entitled to           discovery. Consequently, Metzenbaum moved the district court to compel post-judgment discovery under Fed.           R. Civ. P. 37 and, in the event the court did not regard him as a party entitled to discovery, to permit him to           intervene as a party under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. In making his motion, Metzenbaum informed the court that, should           the requested discovery reveal a substantial difference between the side settlement with the Rose Objectors and           the settlement offered to the class, he would file a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) asking the court either to           require John Hancock to offer the same deal to all class members, including himself, or to abrogate the Rose           Objectors' side settlement and require that the proceeds be disbursed to the class. John Hancock opposed the           motion, pointing out, inter alia, that the class settlement was entirely unaffected by the side settlement with the           Rose Objectors. The court denied Metzenbaum's motion by margin order. This appeal, which only John           Hancock actively opposes, followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In framing their appellate arguments, the parties have sounded broad themes and taken a number of controversial           positions. Metzenbaum asserts that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) applies even to settlements concluded on appeal; that           in the circumstances presented here, he was entitled to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 37's enforcement provisions           post-judgment; that absent class members such as himself are \"parties\" to class actions entitled to discovery; and           alternatively, that he was entitled to intervene as a party in the district court either as of right, see Fed. R. Civ. P.           24(a), or by court permission, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). John Hancock counters that Metzenbaum lacked           Article III standing in the district court because he failed to allege an injury in fact, i.e., that he has suffered, or           imminently will suffer, an invasion of a concrete, particularized, and legally protected interest, see Lujan v.           Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992); that absent class members are not parties to class actions; that           Metzenbaum's allegations fail to establish an entitlement to intervention, either as of right or by court permission;           and that the district court in any event properly declined Metzenbaum's request for discovery because the           material sought could provide no basis for upsetting the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to whether Metzenbaum had Article III standing, we think it sufficient to observe that the line of argument set           forth in the motion to compel (and on appeal) necessitates a Discussion of the possibility of a fraud, see infra at           16-18, and that Metzenbaum, as a class member, has standing to press such an argument because he has a           concrete, particularized, and legally protected interest in both faithful representation by class counsel and in not           being defrauded by an adverse party, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) (recognizing \"fraud . . . misrepresentation, or           other misconduct of an adverse party\" as a basis for seeking relief from judgment). As to the potentially difficult           issues of Metzenbaum's \"party\" status and right to intervention in order to obtain discovery, we think they are           extinguished for purposes of this case by our answer to a narrower, logically antecedent question: Must a district           court scrutinize and approve as fair an appellate side settlement between the parties who have reached a           court-approved settlement of a class action and separately represented class members who had objected to the           settlement prior to its approval? Metzenbaum contends that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and/or general class action           principles derived from the case law give class members like himself an interest in such scrutiny and approval. But           as we explain below, Metzenbaum reads the authority he cites too broadly. Where, as here, the class settlement           is unaffected by the side settlement and there has been no demonstration of a fraud, absent class members like           Metzenbaum simply have no unconditional right to have a court review and approve as fair the terms of such a           side settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Metzenbaum's contention that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) explicitly requires court approval of the side           settlement. Assuming arguendo that the Rule somehow applies post-judgment to the compromise of an appeal           from a district court's approval of a class- action settlement, but see Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (\"These rules govern the           procedure in the United States district courts . . . .\") (emphasis supplied), we reject the argument on plain           language grounds. Rule 23(e) only requires court approval of the dismissal or compromise of \"[the] class action\"           itself; it in no way suggests that negotiated resolutions of disputes peripheral to the class action need be           approved. It is for precisely this reason that courts have declined to require full Rule 23(e) approval of separate           merits settlements that class-action defendants have negotiated with absent class members. See, e.g., In re           General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litig., 594 F.2d 1106, 1138-40 (7th Cir. 1979) (judicial examination           of such separate merits settlements is not to ensure the fairness of the settlements, but only to ensure that the           settlement offers provided the absent class members with sufficient information to make an informed decision           whether to settle or proceed); In re Shell Oil Refinery, 152 F.R.D. 526, 536 (E.D. La. 1989) (same); see           generally 2 Herbert Newberg &amp; Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions &#167; 11.75, at 11-199 (3d ed. 1992); 7B           Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1797, at 377-78 (2d ed. 1986); cf. Weight           Watchers of Philadelphia v. Weight Watchers Int'l Inc., 455 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1972) (Friendly, J.)           (declining to require full Rule 23(e) approval of settlements with potential class members prior to class           certification). Such individual side settlements are just that - side settlements; they are not a settlement of the class           action itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metzenbaum also argues that general class action principles support his proposed disclosure and approval           requirement. In support of his position, Metzenbaum cites a number of complex litigation cases in which, even           though Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) did not strictly apply, courts either have required court scrutiny of or actually           scrutinized agreements peripheral to the class action. Unlike the just-mentioned In re General Motors Corp. and           In re Shell Oil Refinery cases (where, despite the inapplicability of Rule 23(e), courts scrutinized side settlements           with absent class members to ensure that those class members made informed settlement decisions), the cases           Metzenbaum cites all involved circumstances in which there were systemic incentives for class counsel or the           named class plaintiffs to act in disregard of fiduciary duties owed to absent class members in concluding these           peripheral agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, noting \"the danger that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a           less-than-optimal basis in exchange for red-carpet treatment on fees,\" Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa           Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 524 (1st Cir. 1991), we have directed district courts to exercise their equitable jurisdiction           to review counsel-fee arrangements negotiated in connection with class-action settlements - even where the           counsel fees are not taken from a common fund but are instead paid separately by a class-action defendant, see           id. at 523-25. Similarly, courts in two recent mass-tort settlements appear to have required approval of           settlements struck between clients of class counsel who were not members of a class and a party opposing the           class. See Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 157 F.R.D. 246, 294-99, 307-10 (E.D. Pa. 1994), rev'd on other           grounds, 83 F.3d 610, 622 (3d Cir. 1996), aff'd 521 U.S. 59 (1997); In re Asbestos Litig., 90 F.3d 963,           978-80 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. granted and judgment vacated on other grounds, 117 S. Ct. 2503 (1997). In each           instance, the court acted out of concern that class counsel's simultaneous representation of the class and           individual clients outside the class might have given rise to a conflict of interest. See Georgine, 157 F.R.D. at           299; In re Asbestos, 90 F.3d at 980. And the Fourth Circuit, having reached the controversial Conclusion that           Rule 23(e) does not apply prior to class certification, see Shelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d 1298, 1302-04 (4th           Cir. 1978), nonetheless held that pre-certification voluntary dismissals of claims by the named plaintiffs of a           putative class should be evaluated under the Rule 23(e) paradigm pursuant to the district court's \"supervisory           power over and . . . special responsibility in actions brought as class actions,\" id. at 1306. In Shelton, the           concern was that a named plaintiff may succumb to self-interest and settle in such a way as to harm the interests           of absent class members. See id. at 1304- 06 &amp; nn. 17-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we see no inherent risk of victimization of the uninformed, convergence of interests of putative adversaries, or           conflict of interests between or among those to whom fiduciary duties are owed, in an appellate side settlement of           the type Metzenbaum challenges. Tellingly, Metzenbaum does not explain how a party to or attorney involved in           such an appellate side settlement might be tempted to act in derogation of a fiduciary duty. This of course means           that Metzenbaum has not specified how class counsel - the only persons potentially involved in the side           settlement with fiduciary duties to absent class members like himself - faced systemically generated incentives to           violate such a duty in compromising the Rose Objectors' appeal. Instead, Metzenbaum derives from the cases           just described a broader principle: a generalized concern on the part of courts that \"similarly-situated class           members [be] treated similarly and that monies paid by the defendants for purposes of settlement inure to the           benefit of all class members.\" Appellant's Brief at 16; see also id. at 17, 19, and 23. Using this principle as his           point of departure, Metzenbaum argues that the injury he suffered is his alleged unequal treatment (in terms of           settlement results) vis-a-vis the Rose Objectors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metzenbaum's statement of the applicable principle is sound insofar as it implies that courts are concerned with           adequate and similar results for all similarly situated class members in a class action settlement. See, e.g., In re           General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 808 (\"One sign that a settlement may not be fair is that some segments of the           class are treated differently from others.\"). Yet this is only because different recoveries for similarly harmed           persons who have remained within the class and are represented by class counsel (or high attorney-fee awards           negotiated in connection with paltry class settlements) can constitute powerful evidence that a fiduciary obligation           has not been honored. See In re General Motors Corp., 594 F.2d at 1139 (\"Rule 23(e) requires judicial           approval of class action settlements to guard against possible ineffective representation of absentees' interests by           the representative parties.\"); see also, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 809 (courts should \"withhold           approval from any settlement that creates conflicts among the class\"); Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 524-25           (discussing oversight of attorney-fee agreements as necessary to prevent class-harming conflicts of interest           between the plaintiff class and class counsel); 7B Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1797, at           340-41 (discussing oversight of settlements involving representative parties as necessary to ensure that the           representative parties had not become fainthearted or settled solely out of self-interest). But to the extent that           Metzenbaum reads cases like Weinberger, Georgine, In re Asbestos, and Shelton as broadly directing courts           entertaining class actions to ensure similar recoveries by all similarly harmed persons within the original class,           regardless of the litigation decisions they have made, he is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We simply have no tradition of court intervention to ensure that similarly victimized plaintiffs who have retained           separate counsel and have made different litigation decisions get similar results. Cf., e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)           (requiring that notice to the class explicitly inform class members that they may opt out of the class action).           Similarly harmed plaintiffs often secure separate representation and subsequently enter into materially different           settlements with a common defendant. In such situations, the settling parties have no legally protected interest in           having a court scrutinize each settlement to ensure that all plaintiffs receive similar consideration for their releases.           A fundamental assumption of our adversary system is that adversaries represented by persons with presumably           undivided loyalties will tend to negotiate acceptably fair resolutions of their disputes. As we have implied, courts           oversee class-action settlements only because factors unique to the class-action context - the already-noted           tendency towards a coincidence of interests between class representatives and the party opposing the class, and           the chasm between representatives and faceless, absent class members - call into question whether the           representatives' loyalties are in fact undivided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come then to the basic question: Are Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors so \"similarly situated\" that we           should view any difference in their ultimate recoveries as evidence of a systemically induced breach of a fiduciary           duty owed to Metzenbaum and absent class members? We think the answer clearly is \"no.\" Although           Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors are members of the same class and originally were represented by the           same class counsel, they eventually secured separate representation through which they took decidedly different           positions with respect to the proposed settlement and opposite positions with respect to the final judgment. So           long as there was no fraud, that the Rose Objectors might have obtained something in return for eventually           dropping their efforts to disrupt the settlement constitutes no cognizable injury to Metzenbaum, who has received           or will receive the full benefit of the bargain to which he acquiesced and which the district court deemed fair           under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his appellate brief, Metzenbaum hints at but does not fully develop two additional rationales for court           intervention which might be taken as alternatives to his similar-results-for-the-similarly-harmed argument. The first           is that courts should intervene to prevent possible extortion; the second is that courts should intervene to prevent           possible fraud. Before we conclude, we believe it important to say a few words about each of these two           arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rose Objectors had little to lose in pressing their appeal. If they had lost, they would have remained entitled           to the relief secured by the class. If they had won, they almost certainly would have brought about a more           favorable settlement for the class. See 2 Newberg on Class Actions &#167; 11.14, at 11-18 (\"In general, after a class           is certified, particularly in a class action for damages, there is a great likelihood of settlement before trial because           of the increased assessment by defense counsel of exposure to substantial liability.\"). In the class-action context,           such little-to-lose situations sometimes cause concern because they raise the specter of extortive legal           proceedings pressed \"not to redress real wrongs, but to realize upon their nuisance value.\" Cohen v. Beneficial           Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 548 (1949) (acknowledging the incentives management sometimes has to settle           \"strike suits\" brought as shareholder derivative actions). While we have no reason to believe that the Rose           Objectors or Attorney Nygaard extorted their appellate settlement, we recognize that a class member and his or           her attorney conceivably could object to a proposed settlement solely to set up an appeal designed to obtain a           nuisance value recovery and/or advantageous fee arrangement. We also recognize that, in Weinberger, a concern           with deterring extortionate settlements partially informed our decision to subject to district court scrutiny all fee           arrangements negotiated in connection with class-action settlements. See 925 F.2d at 524-25.Metzenbaum           mentions the possibility of extortion in connection with the side settlement of the Rose Objectors' appeal. But in           doing so, he neither argues that extortion might have caused class counsel to bargain away some portion of the           class's negotiated recovery nor seeks to assert a third-party interest - e.g., the interest John Hancock (the party           most obviously positioned to press an extortion argument under the circumstances) might have in not being           subjected to an extortionate appeal - on grounds that John Hancock is unlikely to seek court review of the side           settlement. Instead, Metzenbaum merely suggests that extortion of this type will cause a party opposing a class           action to hold back funds that otherwise might have been offered to the class in the class settlement. Disclosure           and approval is needed, he suggests, to ensure that the class has access to these funds in settlement negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this line of argument is answered by what we already have stated. Courts examine the fairness of           certain class- related settlements because it is thought that, fiduciary obligations notwithstanding, circumstances           unique to the complex litigation context sometimes tempt class counsel and/or named class plaintiffs to conclude           settlements that are not in the best interests of absent class members. In these situations, courts assess whether           the settlements are fair, reasonable, and adequate, see, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 804-19,           because fair settlements can more confidently be regarded as having been negotiated in compliance with the class           representatives' fiduciary duties. But so long as the class settlement remains unaffected, nothing about the           settlement of an extortionate appeal by separately represented, objecting, absent class members logically calls           into question whether the class has been faithfully served by its representatives. Such a settlement thus would not           give a class member the right to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and its related doctrines as a means of creating a           bigger settlement pie post-judgment, at least under the rationale alluded to here.Of course, matters could be           different if there were some indication that the side settlement of an appeal was a vehicle for implementing or           furthering a fraud. Unlike an appellate side settlement which at the very most merely hints that the class might           have been able to obtain more in the class settlement, a fraud-masking appellate settlement should be understood           to involve affirmative deceit upon the class or court - e.g., use of the recipient of the appellate settlement as a           payment conduit between the party opposing the class and class counsel in an end run around a lower court's           counsel-fees ruling. Seizing on the many cases which mention the prevention of \"collusion\" between class counsel           or class representatives and the party opposing the class as a justification for court scrutiny of class-action           settlements and peripheral agreements negotiated in connection with class-action settlements, see, e.g., In re           General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 805; Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 924-25; Georgine, 157 F.R.D. at 311,           Metzenbaum appears to suggest that appellate side settlements of the sort we consider should be subject to           scrutiny and approval as a means of detecting whether they are masking a fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But after final judgment has entered, our strong interest in the finality of judgments leads courts to intervene in a           search for evidence of fraud only if there has been some showing that a fraud actually has occurred. See H.K.           Porter Co. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 536 F.2d 1115, 1118-22 (6th Cir. 1976) (discovery in aid of a           motion attacking a final judgment on the basis of fraud should be permitted only if there is some evidence of           fraud); see also Midwest Franchise Corp. v. Metromedia Restaurant Group, Inc., 177 F.R.D. 438, 440 (N.D.           Iowa 1997) (prima facie showing of fraud required); United States ex rel. Free v. Peters, 826 F. Supp. 1153,           1154 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (same). Plainly, there has been no such showing here. In making this point, we emphasize           that a court's obligation to scrutinize class-action settlements and some agreements peripheral to class-action           settlements for evidence of collusion, see, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 805; Weinberger, 925           F.2d at 924-25, does not in some way trump the systemic interest in finality of judgments - an interest that might           be thought particularly strong in the class-action context, see Valerio v. Boise Cascade Corp., 80 F.R.D. 626,           647 (N.D. Cal. 1978) (finality considerations are \"even more pressing in the class action context\" because of the           number of people the final judgment affects). Thus, it does not open the door to post-judgment discovery where           there is nothing more than speculation that a fraud might have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

(collectively \"John Hancock\"). The underlying suit, filed in           September 1995 on behalf of nearly four million present and former policyholders, challenged a number of John           Hancock's sales and marketing practices from 1979 through the mid-1990s. On June 6, 1997, the putative class           entered into a Stipulation of Settlement with John Hancock. Eventually, the district court certified the class and           approved the settlement, explaining its reasoning in a comprehensive opinion. See Duhaime v. John Hancock           Mutual Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></span> (D. Mass. 1997) (\"Duhaime I\"). Because the particulars of the lawsuit and           the settlement terms are largely irrelevant to our analysis, we refer interested readers to Duhaime I and confine           our focus to facts pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the details of the proposed settlement were communicated to the class in late June 1997, seventy-seven           absent class members (i.e., class members not named as parties) came forward and filed written objections.           Among the objectors were appellant Howard M. Metzenbaum and sixteen policyholders represented by           attorney Diane Nygaard. We follow the lead of the parties and refer to the Nygaard-led group as the \"Rose           Objectors.\"Metzenbaum initially took issue with various aspects of the class notice and with the structure of the           proposed counsel-fees award, but after negotiating changes to the notice procedures that satisfied his concerns in           this area, he chose to press only his counsel-fees objection. The Rose Objectors filed sweeping objections to           nearly all aspects of the proposed settlement. On October 24, 1997, the district court held a hearing to evaluate           the fairness of the settlement. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors appeared to           present their arguments in opposition. On December 31, 1997, the court filed separate memoranda and orders           approving the settlement, see Duhaime I, 177 F.R.D. at 72, but altering to some degree the fee-payment           structure conceived by the settling parties, see Duhaime v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1528424\"><a href=\"/opinion/1528424/duhaime-v-john-hancock-mut-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>           <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 378-80 (D. Mass. 1997) (\"Duhaime II\"). In doing so, the court largely sustained Metzenbaum's objections,           see id., but rejected the Rose Objectors' complaints as lacking in merit, see Duhaime I, 177 F.R.D. at 71-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the district court approved the settlement, Attorney Nygaard, acting on behalf of the Rose           Objectors, filed a request for counsel fees in the district court and a notice of appeal from the court's approval of           the settlement. When Metzenbaum's counsel learned of the appeal, he telephoned Nygaard and asked that she           serve him with copies of the appellate briefs. Nygaard agreed to put Metzenbaum's counsel on the service list,           but added that the appeal soon would be settled on \"very, very good\" terms for her clients. Shortly thereafter, the           Rose Objectors withdrew with prejudice both their appeal and their still-pending request for counsel fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Metzenbaum became concerned that something was amiss because the Rose Objectors apparently           had secured a side settlement more favorable than the class settlement and no court had evaluated the fairness of           the side settlement. In Metzenbaum's view (elaborated below), a post-judgment settlement of this nature violates           both the letter and spirit of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e): \"A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without           the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of           the class in such manner as the court directs.\" See also In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank           Prods. Liab. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696566\"><a href=\"/opinion/696566/in-re-general-motors-corporation-pick-up-truck-fuel-tank-products-liability/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span>, 804-19 (3d Cir. 1995) (Rule 23(e) scrutiny entails a detailed inquiry into           whether the proposed class action settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate). Metzenbaum's counsel wrote to           Nygaard, class counsel, and John Hancock's counsel, advising them that the side settlement should be presented           to the district court and asking for disclosure of its terms. Counsel for the so-called \"settling parties\" responded           that disclosure and approval were not required under the circumstances. The responses indicated that, in addition           to resolving the claims of the Rose Objectors, the side settlement also resolved claims of other clients of Attorney           Nygaard who had opted out of the class. The responses did not, however, disclose the terms of the side           settlement or even the parties to the side settlement. Metzenbaum suggests that class counsel, as well as John           Hancock, may have been involved in negotiating the side settlement, and we accept the suggestion for purposes           of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metzenbaum then served discovery on John Hancock, Nygaard, and class counsel, but received replies stating           that the discovery requests were untimely and that, as an absent class member, he was not a \"party\" entitled to           discovery. Consequently, Metzenbaum moved the district court to compel post-judgment discovery under Fed.           R. Civ. P. 37 and, in the event the court did not regard him as a party entitled to discovery, to permit him to           intervene as a party under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24. In making his motion, Metzenbaum informed the court that, should           the requested discovery reveal a substantial difference between the side settlement with the Rose Objectors and           the settlement offered to the class, he would file a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) asking the court either to           require John Hancock to offer the same deal to all class members, including himself, or to abrogate the Rose           Objectors' side settlement and require that the proceeds be disbursed to the class. John Hancock opposed the           motion, pointing out, inter alia, that the class settlement was entirely unaffected by the side settlement with the           Rose Objectors. The court denied Metzenbaum's motion by margin order. This appeal, which only John           Hancock actively opposes, followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In framing their appellate arguments, the parties have sounded broad themes and taken a number of controversial           positions. Metzenbaum asserts that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) applies even to settlements concluded on appeal; that           in the circumstances presented here, he was entitled to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 37's enforcement provisions           post-judgment; that absent class members such as himself are \"parties\" to class actions entitled to discovery; and           alternatively, that he was entitled to intervene as a party in the district court either as of right, see Fed. R. Civ. P.           24(a), or by court permission, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). John Hancock counters that Metzenbaum lacked           Article III standing in the district court because he failed to allege an injury in fact, i.e., that he has suffered, or           imminently will suffer, an invasion of a concrete, particularized, and legally protected interest, see Lujan v.           Defenders of Wildlife, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560 (1992); that absent class members are not parties to class actions; that           Metzenbaum's allegations fail to establish an entitlement to intervention, either as of right or by court permission;           and that the district court in any event properly declined Metzenbaum's request for discovery because the           material sought could provide no basis for upsetting the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to whether Metzenbaum had Article III standing, we think it sufficient to observe that the line of argument set           forth in the motion to compel (and on appeal) necessitates a Discussion of the possibility of a fraud, see infra at           16-18, and that Metzenbaum, as a class member, has standing to press such an argument because he has a           concrete, particularized, and legally protected interest in both faithful representation by class counsel and in not           being defrauded by an adverse party, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) (recognizing \"fraud . . . misrepresentation, or           other misconduct of an adverse party\" as a basis for seeking relief from judgment). As to the potentially difficult           issues of Metzenbaum's \"party\" status and right to intervention in order to obtain discovery, we think they are           extinguished for purposes of this case by our answer to a narrower, logically antecedent question: Must a district           court scrutinize and approve as fair an appellate side settlement between the parties who have reached a           court-approved settlement of a class action and separately represented class members who had objected to the           settlement prior to its approval? Metzenbaum contends that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and/or general class action           principles derived from the case law give class members like himself an interest in such scrutiny and approval. But           as we explain below, Metzenbaum reads the authority he cites too broadly. Where, as here, the class settlement           is unaffected by the side settlement and there has been no demonstration of a fraud, absent class members like           Metzenbaum simply have no unconditional right to have a court review and approve as fair the terms of such a           side settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Metzenbaum's contention that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) explicitly requires court approval of the side           settlement. Assuming arguendo that the Rule somehow applies post-judgment to the compromise of an appeal           from a district court's approval of a class- action settlement, but see Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (\"These rules govern the           procedure in the United States district courts . . . .\") (emphasis supplied), we reject the argument on plain           language grounds. Rule 23(e) only requires court approval of the dismissal or compromise of \"[the] class action\"           itself; it in no way suggests that negotiated resolutions of disputes peripheral to the class action need be           approved. It is for precisely this reason that courts have declined to require full Rule 23(e) approval of separate           merits settlements that class-action defendants have negotiated with absent class members. See, e.g., In re           General Motors Corp. Engine Interchange Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364689\"><a href=\"/opinion/364689/in-re-general-motors-corporation-engine-interchange-litigation-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span>, 1138-40 (7th Cir. 1979) (judicial examination           of such separate merits settlements is not to ensure the fairness of the settlements, but only to ensure that the           settlement offers provided the absent class members with sufficient information to make an informed decision           whether to settle or proceed); In re Shell Oil Refinery, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span>, 536 (E.D.

(declining to require full Rule 23(e) approval of settlements with potential class members prior to class           certification). Such individual side settlements are just that - side settlements; they are not a settlement of the class           action itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metzenbaum also argues that general class action principles support his proposed disclosure and approval           requirement. In support of his position, Metzenbaum cites a number of complex litigation cases in which, even           though Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) did not strictly apply, courts either have required court scrutiny of or actually           scrutinized agreements peripheral to the class action. Unlike the just-mentioned In re General Motors Corp. and           In re Shell Oil Refinery cases (where, despite the inapplicability of Rule 23(e), courts scrutinized side settlements           with absent class members to ensure that those class members made informed settlement decisions), the cases           Metzenbaum cites all involved circumstances in which there were systemic incentives for class counsel or the           named class plaintiffs to act in disregard of fiduciary duties owed to absent class members in concluding these           peripheral agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, noting \"the danger that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a           less-than-optimal basis in exchange for red-carpet treatment on fees,\" Weinberger v.

Similarly, courts in two recent mass-tort settlements appear to have required approval of           settlements struck between clients of class counsel who were not members of a class and a party opposing the           class.

In each           instance, the court acted out of concern that class counsel's simultaneous representation of the class and           individual clients outside the class might have given rise to a conflict of interest. See Georgine, 157 F.R.D. at           299; In re Asbestos, 90 F.3d at 980. And the Fourth Circuit, having reached the controversial Conclusion that           Rule 23(e) does not apply prior to class certification, see Shelton v.

In Shelton, the           concern was that a named plaintiff may succumb to self-interest and settle in such a way as to harm the interests           of absent class members. See id. at 1304- 06 &amp; nn. 17-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we see no inherent risk of victimization of the uninformed, convergence of interests of putative adversaries, or           conflict of interests between or among those to whom fiduciary duties are owed, in an appellate side settlement of           the type Metzenbaum challenges. Tellingly, Metzenbaum does not explain how a party to or attorney involved in           such an appellate side settlement might be tempted to act in derogation of a fiduciary duty. This of course means           that Metzenbaum has not specified how class counsel - the only persons potentially involved in the side           settlement with fiduciary duties to absent class members like himself - faced systemically generated incentives to           violate such a duty in compromising the Rose Objectors' appeal. Instead, Metzenbaum derives from the cases           just described a broader principle: a generalized concern on the part of courts that \"similarly-situated class           members [be] treated similarly and that monies paid by the defendants for purposes of settlement inure to the           benefit of all class members.\" Appellant's Brief at 16; see also id. at 17, 19, and 23. Using this principle as his           point of departure, Metzenbaum argues that the injury he suffered is his alleged unequal treatment (in terms of           settlement results) vis-a-vis the Rose Objectors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Metzenbaum's statement of the applicable principle is sound insofar as it implies that courts are concerned with           adequate and similar results for all similarly situated class members in a class action settlement. See, e.g., In re           General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 808 (\"One sign that a settlement may not be fair is that some segments of the           class are treated differently from others.\"). Yet this is only because different recoveries for similarly harmed           persons who have remained within the class and are represented by class counsel (or high attorney-fee awards           negotiated in connection with paltry class settlements) can constitute powerful evidence that a fiduciary obligation           has not been honored. See In re General Motors Corp., 594 F.2d at 1139 (\"Rule 23(e) requires judicial           approval of class action settlements to guard against possible ineffective representation of absentees' interests by           the representative parties.\"); see also, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 809 (courts should \"withhold           approval from any settlement that creates conflicts among the class\"); Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 524-25           (discussing oversight of attorney-fee agreements as necessary to prevent class-harming conflicts of interest           between the plaintiff class and class counsel); 7B Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1797, at           340-41 (discussing oversight of settlements involving representative parties as necessary to ensure that the           representative parties had not become fainthearted or settled solely out of self-interest). But to the extent that           Metzenbaum reads cases like Weinberger, Georgine, In re Asbestos, and Shelton as broadly directing courts           entertaining class actions to ensure similar recoveries by all similarly harmed persons within the original class,           regardless of the litigation decisions they have made, he is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We simply have no tradition of court intervention to ensure that similarly victimized plaintiffs who have retained           separate counsel and have made different litigation decisions get similar results. Cf., e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)           (requiring that notice to the class explicitly inform class members that they may opt out of the class action).           Similarly harmed plaintiffs often secure separate representation and subsequently enter into materially different           settlements with a common defendant. In such situations, the settling parties have no legally protected interest in           having a court scrutinize each settlement to ensure that all plaintiffs receive similar consideration for their releases.           A fundamental assumption of our adversary system is that adversaries represented by persons with presumably           undivided loyalties will tend to negotiate acceptably fair resolutions of their disputes. As we have implied, courts           oversee class-action settlements only because factors unique to the class-action context - the already-noted           tendency towards a coincidence of interests between class representatives and the party opposing the class, and           the chasm between representatives and faceless, absent class members - call into question whether the           representatives' loyalties are in fact undivided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come then to the basic question: Are Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors so \"similarly situated\" that we           should view any difference in their ultimate recoveries as evidence of a systemically induced breach of a fiduciary           duty owed to Metzenbaum and absent class members? We think the answer clearly is \"no.\" Although           Metzenbaum and the Rose Objectors are members of the same class and originally were represented by the           same class counsel, they eventually secured separate representation through which they took decidedly different           positions with respect to the proposed settlement and opposite positions with respect to the final judgment. So           long as there was no fraud, that the Rose Objectors might have obtained something in return for eventually           dropping their efforts to disrupt the settlement constitutes no cognizable injury to Metzenbaum, who has received           or will receive the full benefit of the bargain to which he acquiesced and which the district court deemed fair           under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his appellate brief, Metzenbaum hints at but does not fully develop two additional rationales for court           intervention which might be taken as alternatives to his similar-results-for-the-similarly-harmed argument. The first           is that courts should intervene to prevent possible extortion; the second is that courts should intervene to prevent           possible fraud. Before we conclude, we believe it important to say a few words about each of these two           arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rose Objectors had little to lose in pressing their appeal. If they had lost, they would have remained entitled           to the relief secured by the class. If they had won, they almost certainly would have brought about a more           favorable settlement for the class. See 2 Newberg on Class Actions &#167; 11.14, at 11-18 (\"In general, after a class           is certified, particularly in a class action for damages, there is a great likelihood of settlement before trial because           of the increased assessment by defense counsel of exposure to substantial liability.\"). In the class-action context,           such little-to-lose situations sometimes cause concern because they raise the specter of extortive legal           proceedings pressed \"not to redress real wrongs, but to realize upon their nuisance value.\" Cohen v. Beneficial           Loan Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 548 (1949) (acknowledging the incentives management sometimes has to settle           \"strike suits\" brought as shareholder derivative actions). While we have no reason to believe that the Rose           Objectors or Attorney Nygaard extorted their appellate settlement, we recognize that a class member and his or           her attorney conceivably could object to a proposed settlement solely to set up an appeal designed to obtain a           nuisance value recovery and/or advantageous fee arrangement. We also recognize that, in Weinberger, a concern           with deterring extortionate settlements partially informed our decision to subject to district court scrutiny all fee           arrangements negotiated in connection with class-action settlements. See 925 F.2d at 524-25.Metzenbaum           mentions the possibility of extortion in connection with the side settlement of the Rose Objectors' appeal. But in           doing so, he neither argues that extortion might have caused class counsel to bargain away some portion of the           class's negotiated recovery nor seeks to assert a third-party interest - e.g., the interest John Hancock (the party           most obviously positioned to press an extortion argument under the circumstances) might have in not being           subjected to an extortionate appeal - on grounds that John Hancock is unlikely to seek court review of the side           settlement. Instead, Metzenbaum merely suggests that extortion of this type will cause a party opposing a class           action to hold back funds that otherwise might have been offered to the class in the class settlement. Disclosure           and approval is needed, he suggests, to ensure that the class has access to these funds in settlement negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this line of argument is answered by what we already have stated. Courts examine the fairness of           certain class- related settlements because it is thought that, fiduciary obligations notwithstanding, circumstances           unique to the complex litigation context sometimes tempt class counsel and/or named class plaintiffs to conclude           settlements that are not in the best interests of absent class members. In these situations, courts assess whether           the settlements are fair, reasonable, and adequate, see, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 804-19,           because fair settlements can more confidently be regarded as having been negotiated in compliance with the class           representatives' fiduciary duties. But so long as the class settlement remains unaffected, nothing about the           settlement of an extortionate appeal by separately represented, objecting, absent class members logically calls           into question whether the class has been faithfully served by its representatives. Such a settlement thus would not           give a class member the right to invoke Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) and its related doctrines as a means of creating a           bigger settlement pie post-judgment, at least under the rationale alluded to here.Of course, matters could be           different if there were some indication that the side settlement of an appeal was a vehicle for implementing or           furthering a fraud. Unlike an appellate side settlement which at the very most merely hints that the class might           have been able to obtain more in the class settlement, a fraud-masking appellate settlement should be understood           to involve affirmative deceit upon the class or court - e.g., use of the recipient of the appellate settlement as a           payment conduit between the party opposing the class and class counsel in an end run around a lower court's           counsel-fees ruling. Seizing on the many cases which mention the prevention of \"collusion\" between class counsel           or class representatives and the party opposing the class as a justification for court scrutiny of class-action           settlements and peripheral agreements negotiated in connection with class-action settlements, see, e.g., In re           General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 805; Weinberger, 925 F.2d at 924-25; Georgine, 157 F.R.D. at 311,           Metzenbaum appears to suggest that appellate side settlements of the sort we consider should be subject to           scrutiny and approval as a means of detecting whether they are masking a fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But after final judgment has entered, our strong interest in the finality of judgments leads courts to intervene in a           search for evidence of fraud only if there has been some showing that a fraud actually has occurred. See H.K.           Porter Co. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336227\"><a href=\"/opinion/336227/h-k-porter-company-inc-cross-appellant-v-the-goodyear-tire-rubber/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1118-22 (6th Cir. 1976) (discovery in aid of a           motion attacking a final judgment on the basis of fraud should be permitted only if there is some evidence of           fraud); see also Midwest Franchise Corp. v. Metromedia Restaurant Group, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></span>, 440 (N.D.           Iowa 1997) (prima facie showing of fraud required); United States ex rel. Free v. Peters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1524335\"><a href=\"/opinion/1524335/us-ex-rel-free-v-peters/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span>,           1154 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (same). Plainly, there has been no such showing here. In making this point, we emphasize           that a court's obligation to scrutinize class-action settlements and some agreements peripheral to class-action           settlements for evidence of collusion, see, e.g., In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d at 805; Weinberger, 925           F.2d at 924-25, does not in some way trump the systemic interest in finality of judgments - an interest that might           be thought particularly strong in the class-action context, see Valerio v. Boise Cascade Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></span>,           647 (N.D. Cal. 1978) (finality considerations are \"even more pressing in the class action context\" because of the           number of people the final judgment affects). Thus, it does not open the door to post-judgment discovery where           there is nothing more than speculation that a fraud might have occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
