Frattallone,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n     Per  Curiam. Appellant Maria  Razo-Granado was convicted\r                            \r\r\n\nof drug offenses arising  out of a failed attempt  to smuggle\r\n\ncocaine  into  the United  States.   She  did not  appeal her\r\n\nconviction or  sentence and  is presently serving  a 78-month\r\n\nprison term.   Appellant appeals from a  district court order\r\n\nthat summarily dismissed her 28  U.S.C.   2255 motion without\r\n\nprejudice.  We affirm  the dismissal, but we modify it  to be\r\n\nwith prejudice.\r                          \r\n\n     Appellant's   2255 motion alleged three claims: (1) that\r\n\ncustoms  officers were  \"ineffective\" and  \"ignorant\" because\r\n\ninitial field  tests suggested that  the controlled substance\r\n\nappellant   was  carrying   was  heroin,  when   later  tests\r\n\ndetermined that  it was cocaine; (2)  that appellant's Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  rights   were  violated  when  she   was  stopped,\r\n\ndetained, questioned, and subjected to the warrantless search\r\n\nof her  luggage and its  contents when she  presented herself\r\n\nfor  entry at the United States border, (3) that the district\r\n\njudge erred by sentencing appellant based on the total amount\r\n\nof  cocaine that  was  recovered,  as  opposed  to  a  lesser\r\n\nquantity of pure cocaine.     As appellant's  first and third\r\n\nclaims do not assert a constitutional or jurisdictional error\r\n\nor  an  error that  resulted  in  a complete  miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice,  they are not cognizable under   2255. See Knight v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nUnited  States,   37  F.3d  769,  772-74   (1st  Cir.  1994).\r                          \r\n\nMoreover, both claims are patently meritless.1\r                                                         1\r\n\n     Appellant's Fourth Amendment claim similarly may not  be\r\n\nreviewed on  the merits due to  appellant's double procedural\r\n\ndefault.  See Knight,  37 F.3d at 774 (\"Normally,  failure to\r                                \r\n\nraise  a  constitutional  issue  on direct  appeal  will  bar\r\n\nraising the  issue on collateral attack  unless the defendant\r\n\ncan  show  cause for  the  failure  and actual  prejudice.\").\r\n\nAppellant has  not alleged  any \"cause\"  for  her failure  to\r\n\nraise this issue before the trial judge and on direct appeal.\r\n\nThus,  her Fourth  Amendment claim  may  not now  be reviewed\r\n\nunder   2255.2\r                         2\r\n\n     In  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  judgment  dismissing\r\n\nappellant's   2255 motion is affirmed and modified to reflect\r                                                                         \r\n\nthat the dismissal is with prejudice.\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1  The fact  that initial  field tests suggested  that the\r               1\r\ncontrolled  substance involved  in this  case was  heroin had\r\nabsolutely  no  impact on  appellant's trial,  conviction, or\r\nsentence.   The record further establishes  that the district\r\njudge  properly relied on  the entire weight  of the cocaine-\r\nmixture that  was recovered  from appellant's  possessions in\r\nsentencing appellant.  See U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c), n. * (1991).  \r                                      \r\n\n   2We note that the trial record strongly suggests that this\r               2\r\nclaim  is meritless  in  any  event.    And,  as  appellant's\r\nprocedural default bars review of her Fourth Amendment claim,\r\nwe need not  decide whether  Stone v. Powell,  428 U.S.  465,\r                                                        \r\n481-82, 494 (1976)(barring habeas  review of Fourth Amendment\r\nexclusionary  rule  claims  under  28 U.S.C.     2254),  also\r\napplies to proceedings under 28 U.S.C.   2255.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
