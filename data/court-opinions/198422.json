ANDREWS,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Alejandro Gustavo Zuker on brief pro se.\r\n   Anne Marie Corraro and Thomas J. Barbar on brief for appellee.\r\n\nApril 9, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.     Petitioner-Appellant Alejandro Zuker\r\nappeals from the district court's denial of his petition for\r\nthe return of his five-year-old child, pursuant to the Hague\r\nConvention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction (\"the\r\nConvention\"), as implemented by the International Child\r\nAbduction Remedies Act (\"ICARA\"), 42 U.S.C.  11601 et seq. \r\nThe petition alleged that Respondent-Appellee, Patricia K.\r\nAndrews, had wrongfully retained the parties' child, Sasha\r\nAndrew Zuker, from his \"habitual residence\" in Argentina.\r\n          \"[A] child's habitual residence is the place where he\r\nor she has been physically present for an amount of time\r\nsufficient for acclimatization and which has a 'degree of\r\nsettled purpose' from the child's perspective. . . . [A]\r\ndetermination of whether any particular place satisfies this\r\nstandard must focus on the child and consists of an analysis of\r\nthe child's circumstances in that place and the parents'\r\npresent, shared intentions regarding their child's presence\r\nthere.\" Feder v. Evans-Feder, 63 F.3d 217, 224 (3d Cir. 1995). \r\nTo find \"settled purpose,\" it is not necessary to find that\r\nthere is an intention to stay in the place indefinitely. See\r\nid. at 223.  The purpose \"'may be for a limited period.\r\nEducation, business or profession, employment, health, family\r\nor merely love of the place spring to mind as common reasons\r\nfor a choice of regular abode . . . .'\" Id. (quoting re Bates,\r\nNo. CA 122-89, High Court of Justice, Family Div'l Ct. Royal\r\nCourts of Justice, United Kingdom (1989)).\r\n          The district court made no legal error in concluding\r\nthat at the time of the retention, in February 1997, the\r\nchild's habitual residence was Massachusetts.  On appeal,\r\npetitioner argues that the district court erred because the\r\nrequisite element of \"shared intent\" was missing.  We disagree. \r\nThe evidence supports a finding that by February 1997, the\r\nparties had a \"present shared intent\" that Andrews and Sasha\r\nwould stay, at least temporarily, in Massachusetts where\r\nAndrews had work and Sasha was enrolled in daycare.  That\r\nAndrews and Zuker had not reached agreement about where the\r\nfamily ultimately would settle is immaterial. See re Bates,\r\nsupra.\r\n          The district court judgment dated April 10, 1998,\r\ndismissing the Petition for Return of Child is affirmed. See\r\nLoc. R. 27.1.  Appellee's motion to strike certain exhibits to\r\nAppellant's Brief is denied as moot.   \r\n",
