This appeal stems  from a  suit alleging\r                    Per  Curiam.\r                               \r\n\nfailure   to  pay   proper  overtime   and  other   extraordinary\r\n\ncompensation in violation of both federal statutes and local law.\r\n\nThe  plaintiff, Jesus  Rafael  Rodriguez  Rodriguez  (Rodriguez),\r\n\nalleges that his former employer, Iberia Lineas  Aereas de Espana\r\n\n(Iberia), a commercial passenger  airline, underpaid him during a\r\n\nportion of the period in which he served as its traffic manger at\r\n\nthe Luis  Munoz Marin  International Airport in  Carolina, Puerto\r\n\nRico.    Iberia  defended  on the  ground  that  the  plaintiff's\r\n\nposition was \"administrative\"  and-or \"executive\" in nature,  and\r\n\ntherefore exempt from the statutory sweep.\r\n\n          The district  court conducted a  three-day bench  trial\r\n\nconcerning Rodriguez's allegations.  The court thereafter wrote a\r\n\ncarefully reasoned opinion in which it concluded  that Iberia had\r\n\ncarried the devoir of  persuasion in regard to the  applicability\r\n\nof the cited  exemptions.  See Rodriguez v. Iberia,  923 F. Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\n304 (D.P.R. 1996).   The court thereupon dismissed  the complaint\r\n\nwith prejudice and entered judgment for the defendant.  Rodriguez\r\n\nappeals.\r\n\n          Having  read the entire record and carefully considered\r\n\nthe parties' briefs,  we find  no basis to  disturb the  district\r\n\ncourt's  decision.    Moreover,  we  have  determined  that  oral\r\n\nargument of this appeal would not advance the decisional process.\r\n\nIn the final analysis, we regard this as a suitable case in which\r\n\nto act upon our previously stated belief that when \"a trial court\r\n\nhas  produced a  first-rate  work product,  a reviewing  tribunal\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nshould  hesitate to wax longiloquent simply to hear its own words\r\n\nresonate.\"  In re  San Juan Dupont Plaza  Hotel Fire Litig.,  989\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d  36,  38  (1st Cir.  1993).    Consequently,  we affirm  the\r\n\njudgment for substantially the  reasons elucidated in the opinion\r\n\nbelow.  We add only a brief comment.\r\n\n          Rodriguez  rehashes the  evidence and  essentially asks\r\n\nthat we reweigh the facts  de novo.  Our proper  office, however,\r\n\nis  much  more  circumscribed.    Following  a  bench  trial,  an\r\n\nappellate court is  not warranted in rejecting  the trial judge's\r\n\n\"findings of  fact or conclusions drawn therefrom  unless, on the\r\n\nwhole of the  record, [the  court of appeals]  form[s] a  strong,\r\n\nunyielding belief that  a mistake  has been made.\"   Cumpiano  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBanco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990); see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed.  R. Civ. P. 52(a).  Contrary to Rodriguez's suggestion, this\r\n\nparadigm applies  full force to  findings of fact  concerning the\r\n\nsignificance (or  lack of significance) of  documentary evidence.\r\n\nSee Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n575, 576 (1st  Cir. 1989);  RCI Northeast Servs.  Div. v.

Thus,\r\n\nclear error is clearly absent.\r\n\n          This does not mean,  of course, that the case  was open\r\n\nand  shut at the district court level.
