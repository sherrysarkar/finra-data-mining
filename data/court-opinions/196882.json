Officers  at a  Maine  prison\r                                       \r\n\nreceived  a tip that a female inmate's teenage children would\r\n\nbe   smuggling  drugs   into   the  prison   in  her   infant\r\n\ngranddaughter's booties.   The superintendent of  the prison,\r\n\nerroneously believing that the tip  had been confirmed by two\r\n\nunconnected  confidential  informants,  authorized   a  strip\r\n\nsearch of the visitors.  In actuality, the tip had originated\r\n\nfrom a single anonymous and uncorroborated source.  The strip\r\n\nsearch  of   the  plaintiff   minors  turned  up   no  drugs.\r\n\nPlaintiffs brought  suit against the  superintendent and  the\r\n\nCommissioner of the Maine  Department of Corrections under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983.1  The  sole question on appeal is  whether the\r\n\ndistrict  court correctly  entered  summary  judgment on  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  damages claim  in  favor  of the  superintendent\r\n\nbased on his assertion of the qualified immunity defense.  We\r\n\nconclude that the  constitutionality of prison-visitor  strip\r\n\nsearches is governed by  the standard of reasonable suspicion\r\n\nand  that  a  reasonable  official  in  the  superintendent's\r\n\nposition  could have  believed, in  light of  the information\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The named plaintiffs  in this action are Sharon Wood; her\r\nson Philip Thamert; her daughter  Katrina Thamert, on her own\r\nbehalf  and as  parent of  Maria Thamert;  and John  and Mary\r\nFoss, as parents and next friends of Michelle Hatch,  Phillip\r\nThamert's girlfriend.  They purport to assert their claims on\r\nbehalf of  a statewide class  of individuals affected  by the\r\nalleged  strip-search  policies  of  the  Maine  Correctional\r\nCenter  (\"MCC\").    The  defendants  are  James  R.  Clemons,\r\nSuperintendent of the MCC,  and Donald L. Allen, Commissioner\r\nof the Maine Department of Corrections.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nbefore him, that the searches did not violate the plaintiffs'\r\n\nconstitutional rights.  Accordingly, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n      The record, viewed in the  light most favorable to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs, reveals the following.   Since September of 1993,\r\n\nSharon  Wood had  been an  inmate  at the  Maine Correctional\r\n\nCenter (\"MCC\")  in Windham, Maine, serving  a three-year term\r\n\nof confinement for a drug-related conviction.  From the  time\r\n\nshe   was  first   incarcerated   there,   she  was   visited\r\n\napproximately  every other  week by  her son  Phillip Thamert\r\n\n(then seventeen  years of age), her  daughter Katrina Thamert\r\n\n(then sixteen), and Phillip's girlfriend Michelle Hatch (then\r\n\nseventeen).   On each visit, Katrina brought along her infant\r\n\ndaughter  Maria (then  seven months  old).   Nothing happened\r\n\nduring any of these visits to arouse any suspicion of illegal\r\n\nactivity on  the part of Wood  or her visitors.   Wood had no\r\n\nrecord of drug violations while at MCC.\r\n\n      The  events  leading  to the  strip  search  of  Wood's\r\n\nvisitors  began with a telephone call to the MCC by Detective\r\n\nPeter   Herring,  the  State  Police  Department's  appointed\r\n\nliaison  to  the prison.   On  a  \"large number\"  of previous\r\n\noccasions,   Herring   had   provided  MCC   officials   with\r\n\ninformation obtained from his  own confidential sources about\r\n\ncriminal activity  at the prison.   Herring's information had\r\n\ninvariably turned out to be accurate in the past.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n      On January 5, 1994,  Herring called the MCC to  provide\r\n\nanother tip.  Corrections  Officers Charles Baker and Stephen\r\n\nButts,  both responsible  for criminal  investigations within\r\n\nthe MCC, fielded Herring's call together.  Herring told Baker\r\n\nand Butts that he had obtained information that inmate Sharon\r\n\nWood was receiving drugs from the outside.  Herring said that\r\n\nhe  had been told by  a confidential informant  who, in turn,\r\n\nhad  heard from an  anonymous source that  Wood was receiving\r\n\ndrugs during visits, and  that the drugs were being  smuggled\r\n\ninto  the  prison  in  her  infant  granddaughter's  booties.\r\n\nHerring disclosed  to Baker  and Butts that  he had  obtained\r\n\nthis  information on a second-hand basis, and that at no time\r\n\nhad Herring spoken directly  to the original anonymous source\r\n\nabout the tip.  Herring  himself had no personal knowledge of\r\n\nSharon Wood or the persons who were supposedly bringing drugs\r\n\nto her.  Herring did not provide Baker or Butts with the name\r\n\nof either  his confidential informant or  the original source\r\n\nof the tip.2\r\n\n      Soon after  the phone  call, Officer  Baker prepared  a\r\n\nwritten  report of  the conversation  with Herring.   Baker's\r\n\nreport,  however, contained  an important  inaccuracy.   That\r\n\ninaccuracy may be what ultimately allowed the strip search to\r\n\ntake place.   The report  implied that the  information about\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The record does not clearly indicate whether Herring ever\r\nknew the identity of the original tipster.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nWood  had  been  provided  to  Herring  by  two  independent,\r                                                                        \r\n\nmutually corroborating confidential informants:\r                                                          \r\n\n      Det Peter Herring  advised Butts  and Baker  that\r\n      he received  information from  two separate  CI's\r\n      that prisoner Sharon  Wood (Dorm 2)  is allegedly\r\n      receiving drugs  during visits.  Supposedly,  the\r\n      drugs   are  hidden   in  Wood's  granddaughter's\r\n      booties.    Security projects  office  to monitor\r\n      and   will   request   appropriate  action   when\r\n      required.\r\n\nThus,  by   indicating  that   two   unconnected  \"CI's\"   --\r                                              \r\n\nconfidential  informants  -- had  provided  Detective Herring\r\n\nwith  the  same  information,  Baker's  report  significantly\r\n\noverrepresented the actual reliability of Herring's tip.\r\n\n      Five days later,  on January 10, 1994,  defendant James\r\n\nR.  Clemons, Superintendent of  the MCC,  met with  Baker and\r\n\nButts  to conduct  their  regular weekly  review of  security\r\n\nmatters at the prison.  At this meeting, Clemons read Baker's\r\n\nreport of  the information  received from Detective  Herring.\r\n\nIt is undisputed that,  as a result of reviewing  the report,\r\n\nClemons  came  to believe  in  good faith  that  two separate\r\n\nconfidential sources had provided Herring  with precisely the\r\n\nsame tip concerning drug-smuggling by Sharon Wood's visitors.\r\n\nClemons  signed Baker's  report  to acknowledge  that he  had\r\n\nreviewed it and to confirm that the  security projects office\r\n\nrun by Baker and Butts would monitor the situation and notify\r\n\nClemons if  and when  any further action  became appropriate.\r\n\nFollowing  the  January  10  meeting,  no  one  at  the  MCC,\r\n\nincluding Clemons, conducted  any additional investigation or\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nfollow-up concerning the Herring tip.  No action was taken on\r\n\nthe tip prior to the plaintiffs' next visit to the MCC.\r\n\n      That visit  came on February  22, 1994.   At 10:00 a.m.\r\n\nthat  morning,  Officer Baker  noticed  the  names of  Wood's\r\n\nchildren  on  the  prison  visitor  schedule  for  that  day.\r\n\nRecalling  the  phone  conversation  with  Peter  Herring  on\r\n\nJanuary 5, Baker paged Superintendent Clemons, who was at his\r\n\nhome, to request authorization to  conduct a strip search  of\r\n\nthe  visitors based on the Herring tip.  About twenty minutes\r\n\nlater,  Clemons responded  to Baker's  page and  authorized a\r\n\nstrip search of Wood's scheduled visitors.  Baker then called\r\n\nDetective  Herring to  inform  him of  the impending  search.\r\n\nHerring agreed to stand by in case arrests had to be made.\r\n\n      Katrina  and  Phillip  Thamert,  Katrina's  baby,   and\r\n\nMichelle  Hatch arrived  at  the prison  at  about 1:20  p.m.\r\n\nAfter Katrina, Phillip and  Michelle signed in, Officer Baker\r\n\nand another officer took  them aside and told them  that they\r\n\nwould  have to submit to a search for contraband drugs before\r\n\nthey would be  permitted to  see Sharon Wood.   Baker read  a\r\n\n\"consent  to search\" form  to the visitors,  advising them of\r\n\ntheir constitutional rights to refuse  to give consent and to\r\n\nrequire the prison to obtain search warrants, and to withdraw\r\n\nconsent  at any time prior  to the conclusion  of the search.\r\n\nThe form also said that if the visitors refused to consent to\r\n\nthe  search, their  visiting privileges would  be immediately\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nand indefinitely  terminated.  Neither Baker  nor the consent\r\n\nform  made clear that the  search to which  the visitors were\r\n\nbeing  asked  to consent  was a  strip  search.   After Baker\r\n\nfinished reading,  each of Wood's visitors  (except the baby)\r\n\nsigned a consent form.\r\n\n      Katrina Thamert and  her baby  were then  taken by  two\r\n\nfemale officers to  a private bathroom, and Phillip was taken\r\n\nby  two  male  officers  to  a  private storage  room,  while\r\n\nMichelle Hatch  waited in the  main reception area.   Katrina\r\n\nwas asked to remove  her baby's clothing and diaper.   One of\r\n\nthe  two  female officers  visually  inspected  the baby  and\r\n\nchecked  the   baby's  clothes  and  diaper  for  contraband.\r\n\nKatrina  held  her baby  at  all times,  and  neither officer\r\n\ntouched the baby during the search.  Katrina was then told to\r\n\nput the baby's clothes back on.  Although there were no drugs\r\n\nfound on the baby or her clothing, the searches continued.\r\n\n      In the storage room,  Phillip was told by the  two male\r\n\nofficers to take off his clothing, and he did so.  One of the\r\n\nmale  officers  searched  through his  clothing  and visually\r\n\ninspected his  mouth and ears.  He was asked to lift his arms\r\n\nand his  genitals.   Neither officer  touched Phillip  at any\r\n\ntime.   He was then permitted to  dress and was taken back to\r\n\nthe reception area.\r\n\n      Phillip  held  Katrina's  baby  in  the  reception area\r\n\nwhile  Katrina was searched in the bathroom by the two female\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nofficers.  After removing her clothing, she was asked to lift\r\n\nher breasts,  and then was told  to squat and cough.   One of\r\n\nthe  officers manually  searched  her clothing  and  visually\r\n\ninspected  her mouth  and  ears.    Neither of  the  officers\r\n\ntouched  Katrina during  the search.   She  was permitted  to\r\n\ndress  and return to the reception area.  The female officers\r\n\nthen  escorted  Michelle Hatch  into  the  bathroom and  went\r\n\nthrough the same procedure as they had with Katrina.\r\n\n      None of the  searches having turned up  contraband, the\r\n\nvisitors  were  permitted  to  see  Sharon  Wood.    Katrina,\r\n\nPhillip,  and Michelle  told Wood  about the  strip searches.\r\n\nFollowing the  visit, Wood  filed an internal  grievance with\r\n\nthe  MCC.   After an  internal investigation,  Superintendent\r\n\nClemons responded  to Wood  with a memorandum  asserting that\r\n\nthe strip searches had not violated any prison  regulation or\r\n\npolicy.   Shortly thereafter,  the Commissioner of  the Maine\r\n\nDepartment of  Corrections affirmed Clemons'  decision.  This\r\n\nlawsuit followed.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n      The plaintiffs'  amended complaint  sought damages,  an\r\n\ninjunction, and  declaratory relief for a  variety of alleged\r\n\nconstitutional violations and common law torts arising out of\r\n\nthe strip searches.  The district court, on cross-motions for\r\n\nsummary judgment  and partial  summary judgment,  granted the\r\n\ndefendants' motion  for summary judgment in  its entirety and\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ndenied the plaintiffs' motions for class certification and to\r\n\nfile a second amended complaint.\r\n\n      The plaintiffs appeal solely from the district  court's\r\n\nentry of judgment in  favor of defendant Clemons as  to their\r\n\nclaim  for   damages  under    1983  based   on  his  alleged\r\n\nviolations of  the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment  rights.  The\r\n\nonly question in  this appeal is  whether the district  court\r\n\ncorrectly  concluded  that Clemons  is entitled  to qualified\r\n\nimmunity from  the  plaintiffs' damages  claim under    1983.\r\n\nThe  plaintiffs  argue  that   Clemons  is  not  entitled  to\r\n\nqualified immunity here,  because any reasonable  official in\r\n\nClemons' position would have  known that the Fourth Amendment\r\n\ndoes not  permit officials to undertake a  strip search based\r\n\non  an uncorroborated  tip received  from a  single anonymous\r\n\nsource.\r\n\n      We  review  the  district  court's  grant   of  summary\r\n\njudgment de novo.   See St.  Hilaire v.  City of Laconia,  71\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st  Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 64  U.S.L.W. 3849\r                                                      \r\n\n(1996).    The ultimate  question of  whether a  defendant is\r\n\nentitled,  on  a given  set of  facts,  to the  protection of\r\n\nqualified  immunity is  a question  of law  for the  court to\r\n\ndecide.

Here,  there is  no dispute  that\r                  \r\n\nClemons was  told by  his staff  and genuinely  believed that\r\n\nDetective   Herring   had   learned  from   two   unconnected\r                                                                         \r\n\nconfidential  informants that  Sharon  Wood's  visitors  were\r                                    \r\n\nsmuggling drugs into the MCC in her granddaughter's booties.\r\n\n      The plaintiffs  respond by  arguing that  Clemons acted\r\n\nunreasonably  in accepting  Baker's  report as  true  without\r\n\nconducting further  investigation.   We disagree.   While the\r\n\nmistake  that led  to  Clemons being  misinformed  as to  the\r\n\nnature of  the tip is not  to be condoned, we  cannot say, on\r\n\nthe totality of the circumstances  of this case, that Clemons\r\n\nwas unjustified  in accepting Officer Baker's  report at face\r\n\nvalue.     Over  the   course  of  their   five-year  working\r\n\nrelationship, Clemons had grown to trust Baker to provide him\r\n\nwith  reliable information on investigatory matters.  Indeed,\r\n\nClemons  testified at  his deposition  that Baker  had always\r\n\nprovided  him  with  accurate information  and,  in  Clemons'\r\n\nestimation, was \"not one to make assumptions.\"  Similarly, in\r\n\nClemons' experience, information provided by Peter Herring to\r\n\nthe  MCC in  a large  number of  previous investigations  had\r\n\nalways turned out to  be accurate, and Clemons had  thus come\r\n\nto consider Herring  himself to be a reliable and trustworthy\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nsource of information.   The  plaintiffs do  not allege  that\r\n\nClemons' general trust in Baker or in Herring was unjustified\r\n\nor misplaced.\r\n\n      It  is  only  fair  to  conclude  that  Clemons  had  a\r\n\nreasonable  basis  to  believe  that  the  tip  about  Wood's\r\n\nvisitors -- as reported in Baker's memorandum --  had already\r\n\nbeen tested for  reliability by both  Herring and Baker,  and\r\n\nthat there was no need for Clemons himself to conduct further\r\n\ninvestigation  into  the  tip's  sources.   And,  if  Clemons\r\n\nreasonably believed that the  tip, as reported, was reliable,\r\n\nit  would  be inconsistent  with  the  basic  purpose of  the\r\n\nqualified immunity defense --  i.e., to protect an official's\r                                               \r\n\nreasonable  judgments  from post  hoc  attack  -- to  deprive\r                                                 \r\n\nClemons  of that defense merely because the nature of the tip\r\n\nwas, through  no fault of  his own,  erroneously reported  to\r\n\nhim.6  See  United States  v. Hensley, 469  U.S. 221,  232-33\r                                                 \r\n\n(1985)  (explaining   that  police  officers   who  make   an\r\n\ninvestigatory stop  based  on  defensible  reliance  upon  an\r\n\nerroneous police  bulletin may assert immunity  in civil suit\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  There  is  no  suggestion   here  that  prison  officials\r\ndeliberately  or  systematically  misreported information  to\r\nClemons in order to obtain authorizations for strip searches.\r\nCf.

Cf. Daugherty  II, 33 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n557  (rejecting qualified  immunity  defense  where  official\r\n\nauthorized strip  search of  prison visitor based  on letters\r\n\nfrom \"an  anonymous inmate  and . . . a  non-existent person\"\r\n\nand  an uncorroborated assertion  of a corrections officer7).\r\n\nInstead, Clemons' authorization of  the searches was based on\r\n\na  tip he believed had been received from two unconnected yet\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  In Daugherty  II, the defendant warden  conceded that the\r                                \r\nletters did  not form  a basis for  reasonable suspicion  but\r\ncontended that he was  entitled to rely on the  statements of\r\nthe corrections officer.  See id. at 557.  However, there was\r                                             \r\nno indication in that case that the warden had any reason  to\r\nbe unaware  of the information's unreliability  or to believe\r\nthat  the officer's  statements  (unlike Detective  Herring's\r\nstatements  here)  were  independently trustworthy.    In any\r\nevent, in rejecting the  warden's argument, the Sixth Circuit\r\nstated,  \"we do not impose  a duty on  wardens to investigate\r\nthe  reliability of all their officers' conclusions.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n557.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nmutually  corroborating confidential informants, both of whom\r\n\nClemons believed had made the highly specific allegation that\r\n\nvisitors  were hiding  drugs in  an infant's  booties for  an\r\n\ninmate who  was serving time for a  drug conviction.  Nor can\r\n\nwe ignore  that Clemons' assessment of  the tip's reliability\r\n\nwas  favorably affected  by  his awareness  that it  had been\r\n\ndelivered to the MCC  by Peter Herring,  who, to the best  of\r\n\nClemons'   knowledge,  had   never  before   provided  prison\r\n\nofficials with information that had turned out to be false.\r\n\n      Viewed  in  this light,  it  is difficult  to  say that\r\n\nClemons'  decision to authorize the searches was \"objectively\r\n\nlegally unreasonable.\"   Anderson, 483 U.S. at  641.  Mindful\r                                             \r\n\nthat \"'if there  is a  legitimate question as  to whether  an\r\n\nofficial's  conduct  constitutes a  constitutional violation,\r\n\nthe official is entitled  to qualified immunity,'\" Singer, 49\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at  845 (internal quotations omitted),  we conclude that\r\n\nClemons  is entitled to the  protection of that  defense.  An\r\n\nobjectively  reasonable official,  presented with all  of the\r\n\ninformation  in Clemons'  possession and  similarly situated,\r\n\ncould  very well have believed that there existed a basis for\r\n\nreasonable suspicion that Wood's  visitors would be smuggling\r\n\ndrugs into the MCC.8  Cf.  United States v. Wangler, 987 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Plaintiffs do  not raise,  and we therefore  deem waived,\r\nany  argument that  the  tip's focus  on  the baby's  booties\r\nprecluded  the existence  of  individualized suspicion  as to\r\nKatrina Thamert, Phillip Thamert, or Michelle Hatch.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n228,  230  (5th  Cir.  1993) (information  provided  by  \"two\r\n\nunconnected informants\" contributed  to reasonable  suspicion\r\n\nthat suspect was carrying drugs).9\r\n\n                              IV\r\n\n      We  conclude  that  defendant  Clemons  is entitled  to\r\n\nqualified immunity  from personal liability  for his  alleged\r\n\nviolation  of the plaintiffs' constitutional right, as prison\r\n\nvisitors,  not to  be strip  searched except  upon reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion that  they were  carrying contraband.   Clemons, in\r\n\ndefensible reliance on written information provided to him by\r\n\na  trusted prison  official, believed  in good  faith  that a\r\n\npolice  detective  with  a  proven track  record  of  feeding\r\n\ninvariably accurate  investigative information to  the prison\r\n\nhad  learned that two unconnected confidential informants had\r                                 \r\n\nseparately reported  the same highly specific allegation that\r\n\nthe visitors  of a named  female inmate were  smuggling drugs\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  Of  course,  to  say  such  a  belief  would  have   been\r\nreasonable  is not to imply  that it would  have been legally\r\ncorrect.  Lowinger  v. Broderick,  50 F.3d 61,  65 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \r\n1995)  (\"[E]ven  erroneous  decisions  by  officials  may  be\r\nentitled to qualified immunity.\"); Rivera v.

Although we  sustain the defendant's assertion of\r\nthe qualified immunity  defense, we express no  opinion as to\r\nthe legal \"correctness\" of  any belief that Clemons  may have\r\nhad  (based  on the  facts as  he  knew them)  concerning the\r\nexistence of  reasonable suspicion that  the plaintiffs  were\r\nengaged in illegal activity.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ninto the prison  in her infant  granddaughter's booties.   On\r\n\nthe record  before us, an objectively  reasonable official in\r\n\npossession  of  this   information  and  otherwise  similarly\r\n\nsituated to  Clemons could have decided  there was reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion  to believe  that Sharon  Wood's visitors  would be\r\n\nsmuggling  drugs into the MCC.

The superintendent of the prison, erroneously believing that the tip had been confirmed by two unconnected confidential informants, authorized a strip search of the visitors.   In actuality, the tip had originated from a single anonymous and uncorroborated source.   The strip search of the plaintiff minors turned up no drugs.   Plaintiffs brought suit against the superintendent and the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The sole question on appeal is whether the district court correctly entered summary judgment on the plaintiffs' damages claim in favor of the superintendent based on his assertion of the qualified immunity defense.   We conclude that the constitutionality of prison-visitor strip searches is governed by the standard of reasonable suspicion and that a reasonable official in the superintendent's position could have believed, in light of the information before him, that the searches did not violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.   Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, reveals the following.   Since September of 1993, Sharon Wood had been an inmate at the Maine Correctional Center (\"MCC\") in Windham, Maine, serving a three-year term of confinement for a drug-related conviction.   From the time she was first incarcerated there, she was visited approximately every other week by her son Phillip Thamert (then seventeen years of age), her daughter Katrina Thamert (then sixteen), and Phillip's girlfriend Michelle Hatch (then seventeen).   On each visit, Katrina brought along her infant daughter Maria (then seven months old).   Nothing happened during any of these visits to arouse any suspicion of illegal activity on the part of Wood or her visitors.   Wood had no record of drug violations while at MCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events leading to the strip search of Wood's visitors began with a telephone call to the MCC by Detective Peter Herring, the State Police Department's appointed liaison to the prison.   On a \"large number\" of previous occasions, Herring had provided MCC officials with information obtained from his own confidential sources about criminal activity at the prison.   Herring's information had invariably turned out to be accurate in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1994, Herring called the MCC to provide another tip.   Corrections Officers Charles Baker and Stephen Butts, both responsible for criminal investigations within the MCC, fielded Herring's call together.   Herring told Baker and Butts that he had obtained information that inmate Sharon Wood was receiving drugs from the outside.   Herring said that he had been told by a confidential informant who, in turn, had heard from an anonymous source that Wood was receiving drugs during visits, and that the drugs were being smuggled into the prison in her infant granddaughter's booties.   Herring disclosed to Baker and Butts that he had obtained this information on a second-hand basis, and that at no time had Herring spoken directly to the original anonymous source about the tip.   Herring himself had no personal knowledge of Sharon Wood or the persons who were supposedly bringing drugs to her.   Herring did not provide Baker or Butts with the name of either his confidential informant or the original source of the tip.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the phone call, Officer Baker prepared a written report of the conversation with Herring.   Baker's report, however, contained an important inaccuracy.   That inaccuracy may be what ultimately allowed the strip search to take place.   The report implied that the information about Wood had been provided to Herring by two independent, mutually corroborating confidential informants:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Det Peter Herring advised Butts and Baker that he received information from two separate CI's that prisoner Sharon Wood (Dorm 2) is allegedly receiving drugs during visits.   Supposedly, the drugs are hidden in Wood's granddaughter's booties.   Security projects office to monitor and will request appropriate action when required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, by indicating that two unconnected \"CI's\"--confidential informants--had provided Detective Herring with the same information, Baker's report significantly overrepresented the actual reliability of Herring's tip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, on January 10, 1994, defendant James R. Clemons, Superintendent of the MCC, met with Baker and Butts to conduct their regular weekly review of security matters at the prison.   At this meeting, Clemons read Baker's report of the information received from Detective Herring.   It is undisputed that, as a result of reviewing the report, Clemons came to believe in good faith that two separate confidential sources had provided Herring with precisely the same tip concerning drug-smuggling by Sharon Wood's visitors.   Clemons signed Baker's report to acknowledge that he had reviewed it and to confirm that the security projects office run by Baker and Butts would monitor the situation and notify Clemons if and when any further action became appropriate.   Following the January 10 meeting, no one at the MCC, including Clemons, conducted any additional investigation or follow-up concerning the Herring tip.   No action was taken on the tip prior to the plaintiffs' next visit to the MCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That visit came on February 22, 1994.   At 10:00 a.m. that morning, Officer Baker noticed the names of Wood's children on the prison visitor schedule for that day.   Recalling the phone conversation with Peter Herring on January 5, Baker paged Superintendent Clemons, who was at his home, to request authorization to conduct a strip search of the visitors based on the Herring tip.   About twenty minutes later, Clemons responded to Baker's page and authorized a strip search of Wood's scheduled visitors.   Baker then called Detective Herring to inform him of the impending search.   Herring agreed to stand by in case arrests had to be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katrina and Phillip Thamert, Katrina's baby, and Michelle Hatch arrived at the prison at about 1:20 p.m.   After Katrina, Phillip and Michelle signed in, Officer Baker and another officer took them aside and told them that they would have to submit to a search for contraband drugs before they would be permitted to see Sharon Wood.   Baker read a \"consent to search\" form to the visitors, advising them of their constitutional rights to refuse to give consent and to require the prison to obtain search warrants, and to withdraw consent at any time prior to the conclusion of the search.   The form also said that if the visitors refused to consent to the search, their visiting privileges would be immediately and indefinitely terminated.   Neither Baker nor the consent form made clear that the search to which the visitors were being asked to consent was a strip search.   After Baker finished reading, each of Wood's visitors (except the baby) signed a consent form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katrina Thamert and her baby were then taken by two female officers to a private bathroom, and Phillip was taken by two male officers to a private storage room, while Michelle Hatch waited in the main reception area.   Katrina was asked to remove her baby's clothing and diaper.   One of the two female officers visually inspected the baby and checked the baby's clothes and diaper for contraband.   Katrina held her baby at all times, and neither officer touched the baby during the search.   Katrina was then told to put the baby's clothes back on.   Although there were no drugs found on the baby or her clothing, the searches continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the storage room, Phillip was told by the two male officers to take off his clothing, and he did so.   One of the male officers searched through his clothing and visually inspected his mouth and ears.   He was asked to lift his arms and his genitals.   Neither officer touched Phillip at any time.   He was then permitted to dress and was taken back to the reception area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillip held Katrina's baby in the reception area while Katrina was searched in the bathroom by the two female officers.   After removing her clothing, she was asked to lift her breasts, and then was told to squat and cough.   One of the officers manually searched her clothing and visually inspected her mouth and ears.   Neither of the officers touched Katrina during the search.   She was permitted to dress and return to the reception area.

Katrina, Phillip, and Michelle told Wood about the strip searches.   Following the visit, Wood filed an internal grievance with the MCC.   After an internal investigation, Superintendent Clemons responded to Wood with a memorandum asserting that the strip searches had not violated any prison regulation or policy.

The only question in this appeal is whether the district court correctly concluded that Clemons is entitled to qualified immunity from the plaintiffs' damages claim under &#167; 1983.   The plaintiffs argue that Clemons is not entitled to qualified immunity here, because any reasonable official in Clemons' position would have known that the Fourth Amendment does not permit officials to undertake a strip search based on an uncorroborated tip received from a single anonymous source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.

Although a generous amount of deference is given to prison officials on matters of prison safety, security, and discipline, see, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878-79, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), it is clear that visitors do not relinquish their Fourth Amendment rights at the prison gates.   See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 563 (1st Cir.1985).   Prison visitors retain the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992).   The meaning of \"reasonableness\" for Fourth Amendment purposes is highly situational.   A search that is reasonable in the prison environment may not be in other contexts less \"fraught with serious security dangers.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.   The standard of \"reasonableness\" that governs searches in a given context depends, in general, upon a balancing of \"the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\"   Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 536-37, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1735, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967);  see also Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the volatile context of a prison, the need to preserve internal security is very strong.   See Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 562 (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3200, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)).   Prison officials may well have a need to search visitors in some manner in order to prevent the smuggling of contraband (such as drugs or weapons) to inmates.   On the other side of the balance, people naturally have a \"diminished expectation of privacy\" when they enter a prison, Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564, and so \"those visiting a prison cannot credibly claim to carry with them the full panoply of rights they normally enjoy,\" id. at 563;  see also Spear v. Sowders, 71 F.3d 626, 630 (6th Cir.1995) (discussing constitutionality of routine visitor searches).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a strip search can hardly be characterized as a routine procedure or as a minimally intrusive means of maintaining prison security.   Indeed, \" 'a strip search, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.' \"  Cochrane, 949 F.2d at 13 (quoting Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235 n. 6 (1st Cir.1990)).   Accordingly, a strip search cannot be justified absent some quantum of individualized suspicion.   See Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564-65 (invalidating as unconstitutional a prison policy requiring strip searches of all visitors without any particularized suspicion of illegal activity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the level of individualized suspicion against which to test the constitutionality of prison-visitor strip searches with a view to striking the proper balance between respecting the legitimate privacy expectations of prison visitors and the need to maintain prison security, courts have converged upon one common benchmark:  the standard of \"reasonable suspicion.\"   See Spear, 71 F.3d at 630;  Romo v. Champion, 46 F.3d 1013, 1020 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 387, 133 L.Ed.2d 309 (1995);  Daugherty v.

Bilotti, 867 F.Supp. 1145, 1149 (E.D.N.Y.1994).   This court has similarly identified the reasonable suspicion standard, albeit in another context, as the one by which the constitutionality of a strip search should be determined.   See United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991) (stating, in context of border searches, that \"[w]here a search is not routine (e.g., a strip search), we have applied the 'reasonable suspicion' standard.\")  (citing United States v. Wardlaw, 576 F.2d 932, 934-35 (1st Cir.1978)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without deciding the question whether or when the reasonable suspicion standard became clearly established in the prison visitor context in this circuit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we now explicitly state that \"reasonable suspicion\" is indeed the proper standard by which to gauge the constitutionality of prison-visitor strip searches.   That standard guards against arbitrary or clearly unfounded searches by placing non-trivial constraints upon the ability of prison officials to strip search visitors, see Daugherty v. Campbell, 33 F.3d 554, 556-57 (6th Cir.1994) (Daugherty II ) (holding that uncorroborated tips without indicia of reliability do not create reasonable suspicion), but avoids unduly restricting prison officials in responding to the demands of institutional security.   The reasonable suspicion standard thus preserves an appropriate balance between visitors' legitimate privacy interests and the government's need to search.   In sum, prison officials violate the Fourth Amendment when they undertake a strip search of a prison visitor without reasonable suspicion of circumstances that justify the search.   The concrete meaning of reasonable suspicion turns on the facts of each particular case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs can overcome the defendant's assertion of the qualified immunity defense only by showing that Clemons' conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.   Assuming, without deciding, for purposes of our analysis here, that the reasonable suspicion standard was clearly established law by the date on which the plaintiffs were strip searched, we conclude that Clemons is entitled to qualified immunity.   A reasonable official in his position could have believed that there was reasonable suspicion that the plaintiffs would be bringing drugs to Sharon Wood.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"reasonable suspicion\" of wrongdoing is something stronger than a mere \"hunch,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880-81, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), but something weaker than probable cause.   See Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990);  Spear, 71 F.3d at 630.   At a minimum, the reasonable suspicion standard requires that the decision to search be based on articulable factual information bearing at least some indicia of reliability.   See, e.g., White, 496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416;  United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).   However, \"reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause.\"  White, 496 U.S. at 330, 110 S.Ct. at 2416.   Although an anonymous tip, standing alone, may typically fail to create reasonable suspicion, an anonymous tip that is corroborated in some measure by actual facts or by other sources may be enough.   See id. at 329-31, 110 S.Ct. at 2415-17;  United States v. Walker, 7 F.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1201, 127 L.Ed.2d 549 (1994);  United States v. McBride, 801 F.2d 1045, 1047-48 (8th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1100, 107 S.Ct. 1325, 94 L.Ed.2d 177 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, plaintiffs argue that the hearsay tip received by Detective Herring from his confidential informant, who had heard it from an anonymous source, did not provide reasonable suspicion, and that no reasonable official could have thought differently.   The difficulty with this argument is that it seeks to defeat Clemons' claim of immunity by charging him with notice of facts that were not actually known to him at the time he made the decision to authorize the searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal is whether Clemons, and not any other defendant or potential defendant, is entitled to qualified immunity.   The inquiry must focus on whether Clemons himself acted as a reasonable official might.   That determination can only be made \"in light of ... the information [that Clemons] possessed at the time of his allegedly unlawful conduct.\"  McBride v. Taylor, 924 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir.1991);  see also Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039-40;  Prokey, 942 F.2d at 72.   Here, there is no dispute that Clemons was told by his staff and genuinely believed that Detective Herring had learned from two unconnected confidential informants that Sharon Wood's visitors were smuggling drugs into the MCC in her granddaughter's booties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs respond by arguing that Clemons acted unreasonably in accepting Baker's report as true without conducting further investigation.   We disagree.   While the mistake that led to Clemons being misinformed as to the nature of the tip is not to be condoned, we cannot say, on the totality of the circumstances of this case, that Clemons was unjustified in accepting Officer Baker's report at face value.   Over the course of their five-year working relationship, Clemons had grown to trust Baker to provide him with reliable information on investigatory matters.   Indeed, Clemons testified at his deposition that Baker had always provided him with accurate information and, in Clemons' estimation, was \"not one to make assumptions.\"   Similarly, in Clemons' experience, information provided by Peter Herring to the MCC in a large number of previous investigations had always turned out to be accurate, and Clemons had thus come to consider Herring himself to be a reliable and trustworthy source of information.   The plaintiffs do not allege that Clemons' general trust in Baker or in Herring was unjustified or misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is only fair to conclude that Clemons had a reasonable basis to believe that the tip about Wood's visitors--as reported in Baker's memorandum--had already been tested for reliability by both Herring and Baker, and that there was no need for Clemons himself to conduct further investigation into the tip's sources.   And, if Clemons reasonably believed that the tip, as reported, was reliable, it would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of the qualified immunity defense--i.e., to protect an official's reasonable judgments from post hoc attack--to deprive Clemons of that defense merely because the nature of the tip was, through no fault of his own, erroneously reported to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 232-33, 105 S.Ct. 675, 682-83, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (explaining that police officers who make an investigatory stop based on defensible reliance upon an erroneous police bulletin may assert immunity in civil suit for Fourth Amendment violations);  cf. United States v. De Leon-Reyna, 930 F.2d 396, 399-400 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (border officer's reliance on erroneous information provided by dispatcher may be objectively reasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes, even if error was partly result of officer's own negligence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once we accept that Clemons defensibly relied upon the contents of Baker's report in making the decision to authorize the strip searches, this case can no longer be viewed (as plaintiffs would characterize it) as one in which an official knowingly relied on an uncorroborated, anonymous tip in carrying out a search.   Cf. Daugherty II, 33 F.3d at 557 (rejecting qualified immunity defense where official authorized strip search of prison visitor based on letters from \"an anonymous inmate and ... a non-existent person\" and an uncorroborated assertion of a corrections officer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>).  Instead, Clemons' authorization of the searches was based on a tip he believed had been received from two unconnected yet mutually corroborating confidential informants, both of whom Clemons believed had made the highly specific allegation that visitors were hiding drugs in an infant's booties for an inmate who was serving time for a drug conviction.   Nor can we ignore that Clemons' assessment of the tip's reliability was favorably affected by his awareness that it had been delivered to the MCC by Peter Herring, who, to the best of Clemons' knowledge, had never before provided prison officials with information that had turned out to be false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, it is difficult to say that Clemons' decision to authorize the searches was \"objectively legally unreasonable.\"  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.   Mindful that \" 'if there is a legitimate question as to whether an official's conduct constitutes a constitutional violation, the official is entitled to qualified immunity,' \" Singer, 49 F.3d at 845 (internal quotations omitted), we conclude that Clemons is entitled to the protection of that defense.   An objectively reasonable official, presented with all of the information in Clemons' possession and similarly situated, could very well have believed that there existed a basis for reasonable suspicion that Wood's visitors would be smuggling drugs into the MCC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Cf. United States v. Wangler, 987 F.2d 228, 230 (5th Cir.1993) (information provided by \"two unconnected informants\" contributed to reasonable suspicion that suspect was carrying drugs).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that defendant Clemons is entitled to qualified immunity from personal liability for his alleged violation of the plaintiffs' constitutional right, as prison visitors, not to be strip searched except upon reasonable suspicion that they were carrying contraband.   Clemons, in defensible reliance on written information provided to him by a trusted prison official, believed in good faith that a police detective with a proven track record of feeding invariably accurate investigative information to the prison had learned that two unconnected confidential informants had separately reported the same highly specific allegation that the visitors of a named female inmate were smuggling drugs into the prison in her infant granddaughter's booties.   On the record before us, an objectively reasonable official in possession of this information and otherwise similarly situated to Clemons could have decided there was reasonable suspicion to believe that Sharon Wood's visitors would be smuggling drugs into the MCC.

The superintendent of the prison, erroneously believing that the tip had been confirmed by two unconnected confidential informants, authorized a strip search of the visitors.   In actuality, the tip had originated from a single anonymous and uncorroborated source.   The strip search of the plaintiff minors turned up no drugs.   Plaintiffs brought suit against the superintendent and the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The sole question on appeal is whether the district court correctly entered summary judgment on the plaintiffs' damages claim in favor of the superintendent based on his assertion of the qualified immunity defense.   We conclude that the constitutionality of prison-visitor strip searches is governed by the standard of reasonable suspicion and that a reasonable official in the superintendent's position could have believed, in light of the information before him, that the searches did not violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.   Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, reveals the following.   Since September of 1993, Sharon Wood had been an inmate at the Maine Correctional Center (\"MCC\") in Windham, Maine, serving a three-year term of confinement for a drug-related conviction.   From the time she was first incarcerated there, she was visited approximately every other week by her son Phillip Thamert (then seventeen years of age), her daughter Katrina Thamert (then sixteen), and Phillip's girlfriend Michelle Hatch (then seventeen).   On each visit, Katrina brought along her infant daughter Maria (then seven months old).   Nothing happened during any of these visits to arouse any suspicion of illegal activity on the part of Wood or her visitors.   Wood had no record of drug violations while at MCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events leading to the strip search of Wood's visitors began with a telephone call to the MCC by Detective Peter Herring, the State Police Department's appointed liaison to the prison.   On a \"large number\" of previous occasions, Herring had provided MCC officials with information obtained from his own confidential sources about criminal activity at the prison.   Herring's information had invariably turned out to be accurate in the past.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1994, Herring called the MCC to provide another tip.   Corrections Officers Charles Baker and Stephen Butts, both responsible for criminal investigations within the MCC, fielded Herring's call together.   Herring told Baker and Butts that he had obtained information that inmate Sharon Wood was receiving drugs from the outside.   Herring said that he had been told by a confidential informant who, in turn, had heard from an anonymous source that Wood was receiving drugs during visits, and that the drugs were being smuggled into the prison in her infant granddaughter's booties.   Herring disclosed to Baker and Butts that he had obtained this information on a second-hand basis, and that at no time had Herring spoken directly to the original anonymous source about the tip.   Herring himself had no personal knowledge of Sharon Wood or the persons who were supposedly bringing drugs to her.   Herring did not provide Baker or Butts with the name of either his confidential informant or the original source of the tip.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after the phone call, Officer Baker prepared a written report of the conversation with Herring.   Baker's report, however, contained an important inaccuracy.   That inaccuracy may be what ultimately allowed the strip search to take place.   The report implied that the information about Wood had been provided to Herring by two independent, mutually corroborating confidential informants:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Det Peter Herring advised Butts and Baker that he received information from two separate CI's that prisoner Sharon Wood (Dorm 2) is allegedly receiving drugs during visits.   Supposedly, the drugs are hidden in Wood's granddaughter's booties.   Security projects office to monitor and will request appropriate action when required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, by indicating that two unconnected \"CI's\"--confidential informants--had provided Detective Herring with the same information, Baker's report significantly overrepresented the actual reliability of Herring's tip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, on January 10, 1994, defendant James R. Clemons, Superintendent of the MCC, met with Baker and Butts to conduct their regular weekly review of security matters at the prison.   At this meeting, Clemons read Baker's report of the information received from Detective Herring.   It is undisputed that, as a result of reviewing the report, Clemons came to believe in good faith that two separate confidential sources had provided Herring with precisely the same tip concerning drug-smuggling by Sharon Wood's visitors.   Clemons signed Baker's report to acknowledge that he had reviewed it and to confirm that the security projects office run by Baker and Butts would monitor the situation and notify Clemons if and when any further action became appropriate.   Following the January 10 meeting, no one at the MCC, including Clemons, conducted any additional investigation or follow-up concerning the Herring tip.   No action was taken on the tip prior to the plaintiffs' next visit to the MCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That visit came on February 22, 1994.   At 10:00 a.m. that morning, Officer Baker noticed the names of Wood's children on the prison visitor schedule for that day.   Recalling the phone conversation with Peter Herring on January 5, Baker paged Superintendent Clemons, who was at his home, to request authorization to conduct a strip search of the visitors based on the Herring tip.   About twenty minutes later, Clemons responded to Baker's page and authorized a strip search of Wood's scheduled visitors.   Baker then called Detective Herring to inform him of the impending search.   Herring agreed to stand by in case arrests had to be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katrina and Phillip Thamert, Katrina's baby, and Michelle Hatch arrived at the prison at about 1:20 p.m.   After Katrina, Phillip and Michelle signed in, Officer Baker and another officer took them aside and told them that they would have to submit to a search for contraband drugs before they would be permitted to see Sharon Wood.   Baker read a \"consent to search\" form to the visitors, advising them of their constitutional rights to refuse to give consent and to require the prison to obtain search warrants, and to withdraw consent at any time prior to the conclusion of the search.   The form also said that if the visitors refused to consent to the search, their visiting privileges would be immediately and indefinitely terminated.   Neither Baker nor the consent form made clear that the search to which the visitors were being asked to consent was a strip search.   After Baker finished reading, each of Wood's visitors (except the baby) signed a consent form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katrina Thamert and her baby were then taken by two female officers to a private bathroom, and Phillip was taken by two male officers to a private storage room, while Michelle Hatch waited in the main reception area.   Katrina was asked to remove her baby's clothing and diaper.   One of the two female officers visually inspected the baby and checked the baby's clothes and diaper for contraband.   Katrina held her baby at all times, and neither officer touched the baby during the search.   Katrina was then told to put the baby's clothes back on.   Although there were no drugs found on the baby or her clothing, the searches continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the storage room, Phillip was told by the two male officers to take off his clothing, and he did so.   One of the male officers searched through his clothing and visually inspected his mouth and ears.   He was asked to lift his arms and his genitals.   Neither officer touched Phillip at any time.   He was then permitted to dress and was taken back to the reception area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillip held Katrina's baby in the reception area while Katrina was searched in the bathroom by the two female officers.   After removing her clothing, she was asked to lift her breasts, and then was told to squat and cough.   One of the officers manually searched her clothing and visually inspected her mouth and ears.   Neither of the officers touched Katrina during the search.   She was permitted to dress and return to the reception area.   The female officers then escorted Michelle Hatch into the bathroom and went through the same procedure as they had with Katrina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the searches having turned up contraband, the visitors were permitted to see Sharon Wood.  Katrina, Phillip, and Michelle told Wood about the strip searches.   Following the visit, Wood filed an internal grievance with the MCC.   After an internal investigation, Superintendent Clemons responded to Wood with a memorandum asserting that the strip searches had not violated any prison regulation or policy.   Shortly thereafter, the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Corrections affirmed Clemons' decision.   This lawsuit followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' amended complaint sought damages, an injunction, and declaratory relief for a variety of alleged constitutional violations and common law torts arising out of the strip searches.   The district court, on cross-motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment, granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in its entirety and denied the plaintiffs' motions for class certification and to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs appeal solely from the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendant Clemons as to their claim for damages under &#167; 1983 based on his alleged violations of the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights.   The only question in this appeal is whether the district court correctly concluded that Clemons is entitled to qualified immunity from the plaintiffs' damages claim under &#167; 1983.   The plaintiffs argue that Clemons is not entitled to qualified immunity here, because any reasonable official in Clemons' position would have known that the Fourth Amendment does not permit officials to undertake a strip search based on an uncorroborated tip received from a single anonymous source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.

Here, there is no dispute that Clemons was told by his staff and genuinely believed that Detective Herring had learned from two unconnected confidential informants that Sharon Wood's visitors were smuggling drugs into the MCC in her granddaughter's booties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs respond by arguing that Clemons acted unreasonably in accepting Baker's report as true without conducting further investigation.   We disagree.   While the mistake that led to Clemons being misinformed as to the nature of the tip is not to be condoned, we cannot say, on the totality of the circumstances of this case, that Clemons was unjustified in accepting Officer Baker's report at face value.   Over the course of their five-year working relationship, Clemons had grown to trust Baker to provide him with reliable information on investigatory matters.   Indeed, Clemons testified at his deposition that Baker had always provided him with accurate information and, in Clemons' estimation, was \"not one to make assumptions.\"   Similarly, in Clemons' experience, information provided by Peter Herring to the MCC in a large number of previous investigations had always turned out to be accurate, and Clemons had thus come to consider Herring himself to be a reliable and trustworthy source of information.   The plaintiffs do not allege that Clemons' general trust in Baker or in Herring was unjustified or misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is only fair to conclude that Clemons had a reasonable basis to believe that the tip about Wood's visitors--as reported in Baker's memorandum--had already been tested for reliability by both Herring and Baker, and that there was no need for Clemons himself to conduct further investigation into the tip's sources.   And, if Clemons reasonably believed that the tip, as reported, was reliable, it would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of the qualified immunity defense--i.e., to protect an official's reasonable judgments from post hoc attack--to deprive Clemons of that defense merely because the nature of the tip was, through no fault of his own, erroneously reported to him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See United States v.

Cf. Daugherty II, 33 F.3d at 557 (rejecting qualified immunity defense where official authorized strip search of prison visitor based on letters from \"an anonymous inmate and ... a non-existent person\" and an uncorroborated assertion of a corrections officer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>).  Instead, Clemons' authorization of the searches was based on a tip he believed had been received from two unconnected yet mutually corroborating confidential informants, both of whom Clemons believed had made the highly specific allegation that visitors were hiding drugs in an infant's booties for an inmate who was serving time for a drug conviction.   Nor can we ignore that Clemons' assessment of the tip's reliability was favorably affected by his awareness that it had been delivered to the MCC by Peter Herring, who, to the best of Clemons' knowledge, had never before provided prison officials with information that had turned out to be false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, it is difficult to say that Clemons' decision to authorize the searches was \"objectively legally unreasonable.\"  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.   Mindful that \" 'if there is a legitimate question as to whether an official's conduct constitutes a constitutional violation, the official is entitled to qualified immunity,' \" Singer, 49 F.3d at 845 (internal quotations omitted), we conclude that Clemons is entitled to the protection of that defense.   An objectively reasonable official, presented with all of the information in Clemons' possession and similarly situated, could very well have believed that there existed a basis for reasonable suspicion that Wood's visitors would be smuggling drugs into the MCC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Cf.

Clemons, in defensible reliance on written information provided to him by a trusted prison official, believed in good faith that a police detective with a proven track record of feeding invariably accurate investigative information to the prison had learned that two unconnected confidential informants had separately reported the same highly specific allegation that the visitors of a named female inmate were smuggling drugs into the prison in her infant granddaughter's booties.   On the record before us, an objectively reasonable official in possession of this information and otherwise similarly situated to Clemons could have decided there was reasonable suspicion to believe that Sharon Wood's visitors would be smuggling drugs into the MCC.
