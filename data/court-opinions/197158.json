Upward Departure (U.S.S.G.   4A1.3)\r                                                 \r\n\n          The  district court granted the government's motion for\r\n\nan upward departure under  U.S.S.G.   4A1.3 (1995), from  a Total\r\n\nOffense  Level (\"TOL\")  of  18 and  a  Criminal History  Category\r\n\n(\"CHC\") of III, to TOL 20 and  CHC VI, on the ground that CHC III\r\n\nwould  have  underrepresented the  seriousness of  McMinn's prior\r\n\ncriminal  conduct  and  the  likelihood of  recidivism.    McMinn\r\n\ncontends that the  three affidavits relied  upon by the  district\r\n\ncourt for its departure-related findings were not reliable.1  \r\n\n          First,  the district  court  did  not  place  principal\r\n\nreliance on  the challenged  affidavits for its  factual findings\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1We  review factual  findings  for clear  error, see  United\r                                                                           \r\nStates v. Shrader, 56 F.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 1995), mindful that\r                           \r\nthe sentencing court  is vested with \"wide discretion\"  to deter-\r\nmine whether sentencing information is reliable.  Id. at 294. \r                                                               \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nrelating to the seriousness  of McMinn's prior criminal conduct.2\r\n\nMoreover, though McMinn claims that the affidavits were uncorrob-\r\n\norated, and  the affiants untrustworthy,  he chose not  to cross-\r\n\nexamine one of the  affiants at sentencing.  In  addition, he had\r\n\ncross-examined  the other two  affiants at  the earlier  trial on\r\n\ndrug-conspiracy charges before the same judge.  See supra note 1.\r                                                                   \r\n\nFinally,  the district  court  was  presented  with  unchallenged\r                                                                           \r\n\npolice  reports, describing various  burglaries and corroborating\r\n\nother  information  in the  affidavits.    See United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nShrader, 56  F.3d 288, 294 (1st  Cir. 1995).  There  was no clear\r                 \r\n\nerror.\r\n\nB.   Obstruction of Justice Enhancement (U.S.S.G.   3C1.1)\r          B.   Obstruction of Justice Enhancement (U.S.S.G.   3C1.1)\r                                                                   \r\n\n          Second, McMinn challenges  a two-level enhancement  for\r\n\nobstruction of justice, see U.S.S.G.   3C1.1,  based on threaten-\r                                     \r\n\ning letters  he sent in  February, April and  October of 1995  to\r\n\nSteven Serfass, a prospective  government witness.  McMinn argues\r\n\nthat Serfass  was not connected with  the investigation, prosecu-\r\n\ntion, or  sentencing of  the \"instant\" offenses  involving inter-\r\n\nstate transportation, receipt, and sale of stolen audio and video\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Rather, the  upward departure  decision was based  upon the\r\nfollowing considerations as well:\r\n     (1)  five felony drug convictions entered June 13, 1989, and\r\nsix convictions based on  criminal conduct occurring between 1990\r\nand  1994, which were not  taken into account  in calculating the\r\nCHC;\r\n     (2) an uncharged burglary;\r\n     (3) an uncharged  conspiracy to distribute large  quantities\r\nof marijuana between 1987 and 1995; and, finally, \r\n     (4) the fact that McMinn  was on bail when he committed  the\r\nstolen-property offense, and had also violated parole and commit-\r\nted various  other infractions, including drug  use, while incar-\r\ncerated.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ncomponents, since Serfass neither testified, nor were the threat-\r\n\nening  letters admitted, at the trial on these charges.  Instead,\r\n\nSerfass  testified at an earlier trial on drug charges which were\r\n\nsevered  from the stolen-property charges  on June 20,  1995.  As\r\n\nthe enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G.   3C1.1\r\n\napplies  only to  obstructing an \"investigation,  prosecution, or\r\n\nsentencing  of  the  instant  offense,\" McMinn  claims  that  the\r                                      \r\n\ndistrict  court erred  as  a matter  of  law in  concluding  that\r\n\nconduct  unconnected  with   the  stolen-property  charges  could\r\n\nsupport the enhancement.  We find no error.  \r\n\n          At the  time  McMinn mailed  the  threatening  letters,\r\n\nSerfass remained a prospective  government witness in relation to\r\n\nthe \"instant offense\"; i.e., the stolen-property charges.  It was\r                                     \r\n\nnot until January  1996, immediately  prior to the  trial on  the\r\n\nstolen-property charges, that it  became clear that Serfass would\r\n\nnot testify.   Thus, there was  no error in the  district court's\r\n\ndetermination that McMinn  attempted to obstruct the  prosecution\r\n\nof the  stolen-property charges  by mailing the  threatening let-\r\n\nters.  C. ITB Enhancement (U.S.S.G.   2B1.1(b)(4)(B)(1995))\r                 C. ITB Enhancement (U.S.S.G.   2B1.1(b)(4)(B)(1995))\r                                                                    \r\n\n          Third, McMinn contends that the district court erred in\r\n\nimposing   a  four-level   ITB  enhancement   under   U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n2B1.1(b)(4)(B)  (1995).   Relying primarily  on United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBraslawsky, 913 F.2d 466, 468 (7th Cir. 1990), he argues that  an\r                    \r\n\nITB enhancement  is impermissible unless the defendant was in the\r\n\nbusiness  of  receiving and  selling  property  stolen by  others\r                                                                           \r\n\n(i.e.,  in  the business  of  \"fencing\"  stolen  property).   The\r               \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ndistrict court ruling that  McMinn's criminal conduct came within\r\n\nthe  ITB enhancement guideline is  reviewed de novo.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992). \r                           \r\n\n          The   four-level  ITB  enhancement  guideline,  by  its\r\n\nexpress terms,  applies only  if \"the offense  involved receiving\r\n\nstolen property, and the  defendant was a person in  the business\r                                                                           \r\n\nof  receiving   and  selling   stolen  property.\"     U.S.S.G.   \r                             \r\n\n2B1.1(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added).  Thus, on its face at least, the\r\n\nITB guideline does not apply to a defendant who makes  a business\r\n\nof stealing property; that is, a professional \"thief,\" as distin-\r\n\nguished from a professional  fence.  See Braslawsky, 913  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n468 (holding that,  by its  terms, the ITB  enhancement does  not\r\n\napply to a professional thief).  \r\n\n          Under the common-law tradition, stealing  property from\r\n\nanother normally  does not equate with  \"receiving\" property from\r\n\nits  rightful owner.  See  Milanovich v. United  States, 365 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n551, 558 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\"a thief cannot be\r\n\ncharged with  committing two  offenses     that is,  stealing and\r\n\nreceiving   the  goods   he  has   stolen[,]  .   .  .   for  the\r\n\ncommonsensical,  if not  obvious,  reason that  a  man who  takes\r\n\nproperty does not at the same  time give himself the property  he\r\n\nhas  taken.\") (citations  omitted); Baugh  v. United  States, 540\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1245, 1246 (4th Cir.  1976) (\"logic . . . instructs  us that\r\n\nthere  is an  inherent inconsistency  in treating  a taking  as a\r\n\nreceipt\"); see also United States v. Trzcinski, 553 F.2d 851, 853\r                                                        \r\n\n(3d  Cir. 1976), cert. denied,  431 U.S. 919  (1977).  Therefore,\r                                       \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nstatutes which criminalize \"receiving\"  are generally not thought\r\n\nto  target the  thief himself,  but the  wrongdoer who  knowingly\r\n\nacquires  the loot  from  or  through  the  thief.    See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nMilanovich, 365  U.S. at  729-730; Heflin  v. United States,  358\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.  415, 419-20 (1959);  United States v.  Washington, 861 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n350,  352 (2d  Cir. 1988).   Thus,  a fair  reading of  the plain\r\n\nlanguage  employed  in section  2B1.1(b)(4)(B)  strongly suggests\r\n\nthat  a  defendant engaged  in selling  only  the property  he is\r\n\nresponsible  for stealing  has  not \"received\"  it  in the  sense\r\n\ncontemplated by the Sentencing Commission.  \r\n\n          Should there be any doubt about the plain language, the\r\n\nparallel development of the sentencing guideline governing thefts\r\n\nof property, see U.S.S.G.   2B1.1, and the guideline on receiving\r                          \r\n\nstolen  property, see id.   2B1.2, together with the evolution of\r                                  \r\n\nthe language  employed in  the ITB enhancement  guideline itself,\r\n\nsee id.    2B1.1(b)(4)(B), tend  to confirm  that the  Commission\r                \r\n\nenvisioned  that \"theft\"  alone not  constitute a  \"receiving\" of\r\n\nstolen property for these purposes.   Under the original Sentenc-\r\n\ning  Guidelines,  U.S.S.G.     2B1.1  (1987)  governed  \"Larceny,\r\n\nEmbezzlement and Other Forms of  Theft,\" whereas U.S.S.G.   2B1.2\r\n\n(1987)  governed \"Receiving  Stolen  Property.\"   The offense  of\r\n\nreceiving stolen property  was subject to an ITB enhancement, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2B1.2(b)(2)(A) (1987) (\"If the offense [i.e. receiving\r                                                                 \r\n\nstolen property] was  committed by  a person in  the business  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nselling  stolen  property,  increase  by  4  levels.\")  (emphasis\r                                   \r\n\nadded), which clearly  applied to the professional fence  and not\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nto  a defendant who simply sold property  he pilfered.

At the time the Sentencing Guidelines\r                            \r\n\nwere  promulgated, the  Commission consistently  demonstrated its\r\n\nintention that  like enhancements  be applicable to  both \"theft\"\r\n\nand  \"receipt\"  offenses  by  including  a  parallel  enhancement\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  Commission's  choice  of  the  word  \"resale\"  vividly\r\nsuggests a prior sale  (by the thief to the  fence) conspicuously\r\nlacking  between the  rightful owner  and the  thief.   Thus, the\r\ncommentary provides authoritative definition  to the scope of the\r\noriginal ITB enhancement.  See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n36,  38 (1993) (\" . . . commentary  in the Guidelines Manual that\r\ninterprets  or explains  a guideline  is authoritative  unless it\r\nviolates the Constitution or  a federal statute, or is  inconsis-\r\ntent with, or a plainly  erroneous reading of, that guideline.\").\r\nThe  background commentary to U.S.S.G.   2B1.2 was deleted at the\r\ntime U.S.S.G.    2B1.2 was  consolidated into  U.S.S.G.    2B1.1.\r\nSee U.S.S.G.   2B1.1, as amended by amendment 481 (effective Nov.\r                                             \r\n1, 1993).   But though there  is no longer any  commentary on the\r\nITB enhancement,  see United States  v. Richardson, 14  F.3d 666,\r                                                            \r\n674 (1st Cir. 1994), neither is there any reason to believe  that\r\nconsolidation  of the  two original  guideline sections,  and the\r\nconsequent deletion  of the  background commentary, was  meant to\r\nalter the scope  of the ITB enhancement.  Rather,  along with the\r\nconsolidation and  deletion of  24 other guideline  sections, the\r\nCommission consolidated   2B1.2 with   2B1.1 because the offenses\r\nwere  closely related and  the Commission wanted  to simplify the\r\nGuidelines Manual.

As the  Commission broadened\r\n\nthe  scope of U.S.S.G.   2B1.2 (\"Receiving Stolen Property\"), the\r\n\nlanguage  in the ITB enhancement itself was amended to retain its\r\n\nnarrow  focus  upon defendants  who  \"fence\" stolen  goods.   The\r\n\n\"Receiving  Stolen Property\"  guideline  was amended  in 1989  to\r\n\ncover  \"Transporting,  Transferring, Transmitting,  or Possessing\r\n\nStolen Property.\"   U.S.S.G.    2B1.2, as amended  by amend.  102\r                                                               \r\n\n(effective  Nov. 1,  1989).   Under the  same amendment,  the ITB\r\n\nenhancement guideline  was changed to read, \"[i]f the offense was\r\n\ncommitted  by a person in  the business of  receiving and selling\r                                                                   \r\n\nstolen property,  increase by  4 levels.\"   Id.    2B1.2(b)(3)(A)\r                                                        \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n(1989) (emphasis  added to  amendatory  language).   Thus, it  is\r\n\napparent from  the context  that the  words \"receiving  and\" were\r\n\nincluded  so as to restrict application of the ITB enhancement to\r\n\ndefendants who receive and sell stolen property (i.e. profession-\r                                    \r\n\nal  fences) and to exclude  from its reach  others, including the\r\n\nthief, who  transport, transfer,  transmit, or possess,  and then\r\n\nsell, stolen property. \r\n\n          In  1993, the  separate guideline  provisions governing\r\n\ntheft offenses and the receiving of stolen property were consoli-\r\n\ndated.  See  U.S.S.G.   2B1.1 as amended by amend. 481 (effective\r                                                     \r\n\nNov. 1, 1993).   The same 1993 amendment introduced  the language\r\n\ncurrently found  in the ITB enhancement  guideline, prescribing a\r\n\nfour-level  enhancement  \"[i]f  the  offense  involved  receiving\r                                                                           \r\n\nstolen property, and the  defendant was a person in  the business\r                         \r\n\nof receiving  and selling stolen property.\"  Id.   2B1.1(b)(5)(A)\r                                                         \r\n\n(1993) (emphasis added to amendatory language).  \r\n\n          The historical context in  which the 1993 amendment was\r\n\nadopted thus demonstrates that the reconstructed  ITB enhancement\r\n\nwas designed to  apply only to  defendants who \"received\"  stolen\r\n\nproperty and  whose offense of  conviction would come  within the\r\n\nscope of  former U.S.S.G.   2B1.2  (\"Receiving Stolen Property\"),\r\n\nas  opposed to  defendants who  pilfered the  property  and whose\r\n\noffense of  conviction  therefore came  within the  scope of  the\r\n\noriginal version of U.S.S.G.   2B1.1.  It seems reasonably clear,\r\n\ntherefore, viewed  in an  historical perspective, that  the words\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n\"receiving and\" were added  to preserve the limited reach  of the\r\n\nITB enhancement.\r\n\n          On the other hand, the interpretation propounded by the\r\n\ngovernment  presumes that  the Commission  twice amended  the ITB\r\n\nenhancement  so as to make  it applicable only  to defendants who\r\n\n\"receive\" stolen  property, yet intended the  term \"receiving\" to\r\n\nmean merely \"taking possession  of,\" thereby encompassing  simple\r\n\ntheft.  Though as a literal matter, without regard to its histor-\r\n\nical context,  the term \"receiving\" does  not necessarily exclude\r\n\n\"theft,\"  we  conclude  that  the references  to  defendants  who\r\n\n\"receive and sell\" stolen  property were not meant to apply  to a\r\n\ndefendant who simply sells only property he has stolen.\r\n\n          Our construction is guided by conventional interpretive\r\n\nprinciples.  See United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n\n1994) (applying  customary rules  of statutory  interpretation to\r\n\nsentencing guidelines).   It  avoids interpreting the  words \"re-\r\n\nceiving  and\" out of the ITB enhancement guideline as surplusage.\r\n\nSee  United States  v.  Campos-Serrano, 404  U.S.  293, 301  n.14\r                                                \r\n\n(1971)  (\"A statute  ought, upon  the whole,  to be  so construed\r\n\nthat, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or  word shall\r\n\nbe  superfluous, void, or insignificant.\").   Whereas, were we to\r\n\nadopt the government's view     that the language in  the current\r\n\nITB enhancement (\"in the business of receiving and selling stolen\r\n\nproperty\") reaches both the  thief and the professional fence    \r\n\nthen  the  language  of the  original  ITB  enhancement (\"in  the\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nbusiness . . . of selling stolen property\") need never have  been\r\n\namended in 1989. \r\n\n          Our  interpretation  comports   with  basic   guideline\r\n\nsentencing policy  as  well.   See  18  U.S.C.     3553(a)(1),(2)\r                                            \r\n\n(A),(B),(C)&amp;(5).  The services of a professional fence undoubted-\r\n\nly facilitate  the ready,  advantageous  disposition of  property\r\n\nstolen  by  the less  well-situated  thief,  thereby providing  a\r\n\nsignificant  inducement to  commit  theft offenses.   See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

It is reasonable\r\n\nto  assume, as a general rule, that a professional fencing opera-\r\n\ntion  efficiently can  dispose  of greater  quantities of  stolen\r\n\ngoods than could  the individual thieves  who supply the  profes-\r\n\nsional fence, see  Klockars at 69-135, thereby enabling  both the\r                           \r\n\nthieves  and  the   fence  to  realize  greater   returns.    Cf.\r                                                                          \r\n\nBraslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468.  Thus, as a rule professional fences\r                    \r\n\nmay be expected to induce more stealing. \r\n\n          Furthermore,  the  interposition  of   a  sophisticated\r\n\nfencing operation between the thief and the ultimate purchaser of\r\n\nthe stolen  property may  confound or obstruct  the investigation\r\n\nand prosecution  of theft offenses.   Often, the  stolen property\r\n\nitself  may be the only tangible evidence connecting the thief to\r\n\nthe  crime.  Since the professional fence is better positioned to\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nmove stolen goods quickly  into the hands of the  ultimate \"black\r\n\nmarket\" consumer, see  Klockars at  77 n.2, 106-13,  the loot  is\r                               \r\n\nmore  likely to be dispersed before  law enforcement agencies can\r\n\nrespond.   Consequently, the fence  not only affords  the thief a\r\n\nless  risky and more  efficient alternative for  disposing of the\r\n\nbooty,  but the  increased  efficiency comes  at  the expense  of\r\n\neffective law enforcement.4\r\n\n          The  government  argues,  nonetheless,  that   the  ITB\r\n\nenhancement guideline should be construed simply to require proof\r\n\nthat McMinn's sales of  stolen goods had a certain  regularity or\r\n\nsophistication.  Cf. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 703 (adopting a \"total-\r                                      \r\n\nity of the circumstances\"  test).  For the reasons  stated above,\r\n\nwe reject the government's interpretation as less consistent with\r\n\nthe language, history, and purpose of the  ITB enhancement guide-\r\n\nline.5         We  think  it  important  to point  out  that  our\r\n\nopinion in St. Cyr does not support the position advocated by the\r                            \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4These considerations  represent an especially  serious hin-\r\ndrance to law enforcement when the professional  fence utilizes a\r\nlegitimate \"front,\" such  as a pawn shop or an  outlet dealing in\r\ndistressed goods at sharply  lower prices.  See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\nRobinson, 698 F.2d 448, 453 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Klockars at 69-135.\r                  \r\nThe \"front\"  may afford  a superficially valid  justification for\r\nthe low sale prices (i.e. the goods were pawned to the \"front\" or\r                                   \r\nacquired  as distressed goods) and thus serve to impede an infer-\r\nence that the fence knew the goods were stolen.  \r\n\n     5Nor is the caselaw in other circuits  inconsistent with the\r\nrequirement that the defendant must be a \"fence\" in order for the\r\nITB  enhancement  to apply.

Nothing\r\n\nprevents  a professional  thief  from also  conducting a  fencing\r\n\noperation  of sufficient size  and continuity to  qualify for the\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nITB enhancement; criminals, too,  may have more than one  line of\r\n\nbusiness.   For the reasons we have already indicated, however, a\r\n\nthief would not qualify for the ITB enhancement if the only goods\r\n\nhe distributed were those which he had stolen.\r\n\n          There is nothing in the government's analysis or in the\r\n\ndistrict court's  findings to indicate that  McMinn sold property\r\n\nwhich  he had not stolen.  Of course, since reasonable inferences\r\n\nare  always permitted, the case  might be quite  different if the\r\n\nonly  evidence were that McMinn had stored and sold large quanti-\r\n\nties of stolen  property.  Here,  however, the evidence  revealed\r\n\nthat  McMinn  had stolen  a great  deal of  property and,  as the\r\n\nrecord now  stands, we have no  basis to suppose that  he did not\r\n\nsteal it all.\r\n\n          Finally, the  government argues in the alternative that\r\n\nMcMinn  should be  treated  as a  professional  fence because  he\r\n\nneither proffered  evidence, nor  admitted, that he  had pilfered\r\n\nall  the stolen  goods  he sold.   Since  it is  the government's\r\n\nburden to prove  that McMinn  received and sold  goods stolen  by\r\n\nothers, however,  its argument is fundamentally flawed.   See St.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCyr, 977 F.2d at 702 (\"the government bears the burden  of estab-\r             \r\n\nlishing that the ITB enhancement applies in a given case\").6\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6As the ITB  enhancement is  inapplicable to  McMinn, it  is\r\nunnecessary  to resolve  the  \"double counting\"  claim; that  is,\r\nwhether  it was appropriate to consider the same criminal conduct\r\nin determining the upward departure and the ITB enhancement.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  the district court judgment\r\n\nis vacated and  the case is remanded  for resentencing consistent\r\n\nwith this opinion.  \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n",

See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 2314 &amp; 2315.  As the sentence enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) for engaging \"in the business of receiving and selling stolen property\" (\"ITB\" enhancement) constituted error, we vacate the district court judgment and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

McMinn contends that the three affidavits relied upon by the district court for its departure-related findings were not reliable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court did not place principal reliance on the challenged affidavits for its factual findings relating to the seriousness of McMinn's prior criminal conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Moreover, though McMinn claims that the affidavits were uncorroborated, and the affiants untrustworthy, he chose not to cross-examine one of the affiants at sentencing.  In addition, he had cross-examined the other two affiants at the earlier trial on drug-conspiracy charges before the same judge.  See supra note 1.  Finally, the district court was presented with unchallenged police reports, describing various burglaries and corroborating other information in the affidavits.  See United States v. Shrader, 56 F.3d 288, 294 (1st Cir.1995).  There was no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>B. Obstruction of Justice Enhancement (U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, McMinn challenges a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, based on threatening letters he sent in February, April and October of 1995 to Steven Serfass, a prospective government witness.  McMinn argues that Serfass was not connected with the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the \"instant\" offenses involving interstate transportation, receipt, and sale of stolen audio and video components, since Serfass neither testified, nor were the threatening letters admitted, at the trial on these charges.  Instead, Serfass testified at an earlier trial on drug charges which were severed from the stolen-property charges on June 20, 1995.  As the enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 applies only to obstructing an \"investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense,\" McMinn claims that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that conduct unconnected with the stolen-property charges could support the enhancement.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time McMinn mailed the threatening letters, Serfass remained a prospective government witness in relation to the \"instant offense\";  i.e., the stolen-property charges.  It was not until January 1996, immediately prior to the trial on the stolen-property charges, that it became clear that Serfass would not testify.  Thus, there was no error in the district court's determination that McMinn attempted to obstruct the prosecution of the stolen-property charges by mailing the threatening letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>C. ITB Enhancement (U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B)(1995))</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, McMinn contends that the district court erred in imposing a four-level ITB enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) (1995).  Relying primarily on United States v. Braslawsky, 913 F.2d 466, 468 (7th Cir.1990), he argues that an ITB enhancement is impermissible unless the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling property stolen by others (i.e., in the business of \"fencing\" stolen property).  The district court ruling that McMinn's criminal conduct came within the ITB enhancement guideline is reviewed de novo.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four-level ITB enhancement guideline, by its express terms, applies only if \"the offense involved receiving stolen property, and the defendant was a person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added).  Thus, on its face at least, the ITB guideline does not apply to a defendant who makes a business of stealing property;  that is, a professional \"thief,\" as distinguished from a professional fence.  See Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468 (holding that, by its terms, the ITB enhancement does not apply to a professional thief).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the common-law tradition, stealing property from another normally does not equate with \"receiving\" property from its rightful owner.  See Milanovich v. United States, 365 U.S. 551, 558, 81 S.Ct. 728, 732, 5 L.Ed.2d 773 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\"a thief cannot be charged with committing two offenses--that is, stealing and receiving the goods he has stolen[,] ... for the commonsensical, if not obvious, reason that a man who takes property does not at the same time give himself the property he has taken.\")  (citations omitted);  Baugh v. United States, 540 F.2d 1245, 1246 (4th Cir.1976) (\"logic ... instructs us that there is an inherent inconsistency in treating a taking as a receipt\");  see also United States v. Trzcinski, 553 F.2d 851, 853 (3d Cir.1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 919, 97 S.Ct. 2185, 53 L.Ed.2d 230 (1977).  Therefore, statutes which criminalize \"receiving\" are generally not thought to target the thief himself, but the wrongdoer who knowingly acquires the loot from or through the thief.  See, e.g., Milanovich, 365 U.S. at 552-56, 81 S.Ct. at 729-730;  Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 419-20, 79 S.Ct. 451, 453-54, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959);  United States v. Washington, 861 F.2d 350, 352 (2d Cir.1988).  Thus, a fair reading of the plain language employed in section 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) strongly suggests that a defendant engaged in selling only the property he is responsible for stealing has not \"received\" it in the sense contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should there be any doubt about the plain language, the parallel development of the sentencing guideline governing thefts of property, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, and the guideline on receiving stolen property, see id.  &#167;  2B1.2, together with the evolution of the language employed in the ITB enhancement guideline itself, see id.  &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B), tend to confirm that the Commission envisioned that \"theft\" alone not constitute a \"receiving\" of stolen property for these purposes.  Under the original Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1 (1987) governed \"Larceny, Embezzlement and Other Forms of Theft,\" whereas U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 (1987) governed \"Receiving Stolen Property.\"   The offense of receiving stolen property was subject to an ITB enhancement, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2(b)(2)(A) (1987) (\"If the offense [i.e. receiving stolen property] was committed by a person in the business of selling stolen property, increase by 4 levels.\")  (emphasis added), which clearly applied to the professional fence and not to a defendant who simply sold property he pilfered.  See id.  &#167; 2B1.2, comment (backg'd) (1987) (\"Persons who receive stolen property for resale receive a sentence enhancement ....\") (emphasis added);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468.   The guideline governing theft crimes included no corresponding ITB enhancement.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disjunctive treatment required under these two guideline sections clearly implied that the Commission did not intend that the ITB enhancement apply to defendants responsible only for the theft of the ill-gotten property and not its \"resale.\"   See supra note 3.  At the time the Sentencing Guidelines were promulgated, the Commission consistently demonstrated its intention that like enhancements be applicable to both \"theft\" and \"receipt\" offenses by including a parallel enhancement provision in each guideline.  See id.  &#167;&#167; 2B1.1(b)(2);  2B1.2(b)(3) (1987) (parallel enhancements relating to stealing and receiving (stolen) firearm, destructive device or controlled substance);  id.  &#167;&#167; 2B1.1(b)(4);  2B1.2(b)(2)(B) (1987) (parallel enhancements for more than minimal planning relating to stealing and receiving (stolen) property);  id.  &#167;&#167; 2B1.1(b)(6);  2B1.2(b)(4) (1987) (parallel enhancements for engaging in organized criminal activity relating to stealing and receiving (stolen) property);  see also U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 117 (effective Nov. 1, 1989) (adding ITB enhancement to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B6.1--trafficking in motor vehicles with altered or obliterated identification numbers--\"to resolve an inconsistency between ... section [2B6.1] and &#167; 2B1.2\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsequent evolution of the ITB enhancement guideline likewise substantiates that it was meant to cover the professional fence, not the thief.  As the Commission broadened the scope of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 (\"Receiving Stolen Property\"), the language in the ITB enhancement itself was amended to retain its narrow focus upon defendants who \"fence\" stolen goods.  The \"Receiving Stolen Property\" guideline was amended in 1989 to cover \"Transporting, Transferring, Transmitting, or Possessing Stolen Property.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2, as amended by amend. 102 (effective Nov. 1, 1989).  Under the same amendment, the ITB enhancement guideline was changed to read, \"[i]f the offense was committed by a person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property, increase by 4 levels.\"  Id. &#167; 2B1.2(b)(3)(A) (1989) (emphasis added to amendatory language).  Thus, it is apparent from the context that the words \"receiving and\" were included so as to restrict application of the ITB enhancement to defendants who receive and sell stolen property (i.e. professional fences) and to exclude from its reach others, including the thief, who transport, transfer, transmit, or possess, and then sell, stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the separate guideline provisions governing theft offenses and the receiving of stolen property were consolidated.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1 as amended by amend. 481 (effective Nov. 1, 1993).  The same 1993 amendment introduced the language currently found in the ITB enhancement guideline, prescribing a four-level enhancement \"[i]f the offense involved receiving stolen property, and the defendant was a person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property.\"  Id. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(5)(A) (1993) (emphasis added to amendatory language).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historical context in which the 1993 amendment was adopted thus demonstrates that the reconstructed ITB enhancement was designed to apply only to defendants who \"received\" stolen property and whose offense of conviction would come within the scope of former U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 (\"Receiving Stolen Property\"), as opposed to defendants who pilfered the property and whose offense of conviction therefore came within the scope of the original version of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1.  It seems reasonably clear, therefore, viewed in an historical perspective, that the words \"receiving and\" were added to preserve the limited reach of the ITB enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the interpretation propounded by the government presumes that the Commission twice amended the ITB enhancement so as to make it applicable only to defendants who \"receive\" stolen property, yet intended the term \"receiving\" to mean merely \"taking possession of,\" thereby encompassing simple theft.  Though as a literal matter, without regard to its historical context, the term \"receiving\" does not necessarily exclude \"theft,\" we conclude that the references to defendants who \"receive and sell\" stolen property were not meant to apply to a defendant who simply sells only property he has stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our construction is guided by conventional interpretive principles.  See United States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1994) (applying customary rules of statutory interpretation to sentencing guidelines).  It avoids interpreting the words \"receiving and\" out of the ITB enhancement guideline as surplusage.  See United States v. Campos-Serrano, 404 U.S. 293, 301 n. 14, 92 S.Ct. 471, 476 n. 14, 30 L.Ed.2d 457 (1971) (\"A statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\").  Whereas, were we to adopt the government's view--that the language in the current ITB enhancement (\"in the business of receiving and selling stolen property\") reaches both the thief and the professional fence--then the language of the original ITB enhancement (\"in the business ... of selling stolen property\") need never have been amended in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation comports with basic guideline sentencing policy as well.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(1),(2)(A),(B),(C) &amp; (5).  The services of a professional fence undoubtedly facilitate the ready, advantageous disposition of property stolen by the less well-situated thief, thereby providing a significant inducement to commit theft offenses.  See United States v. Sutton, 77 F.3d 91, 94 (5th Cir.1996);  Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468;  United States v. Bolin, 423 F.2d 834, 838 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 954, 90 S.Ct. 1882, 26 L.Ed.2d 297 (1970);  Carl Klockars, The Professional Fence 144 (1974) (discussing the adage, \"if there were no receivers, there would be no thieves\").  It is reasonable to assume, as a general rule, that a professional fencing operation efficiently can dispose of greater quantities of stolen goods than could the individual thieves who supply the professional fence, see Klockars at 69-135, thereby enabling both the thieves and the fence to realize greater returns.  Cf. Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468.   Thus, as a rule professional fences may be expected to induce more stealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the interposition of a sophisticated fencing operation between the thief and the ultimate purchaser of the stolen property may confound or obstruct the investigation and prosecution of theft offenses.  Often, the stolen property itself may be the only tangible evidence connecting the thief to the crime.  Since the professional fence is better positioned to move stolen goods quickly into the hands of the ultimate \"black market\" consumer, see Klockars at 77 n. 2, 106-13, the loot is more likely to be dispersed before law enforcement agencies can respond.  Consequently, the fence not only affords the thief a less risky and more efficient alternative for disposing of the booty, but the increased efficiency comes at the expense of effective law enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, nonetheless, that the ITB enhancement guideline should be construed simply to require proof that McMinn's sales of stolen goods had a certain regularity or sophistication.  Cf. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 703 (adopting a \"totality of the circumstances\" test).  For the reasons stated above, we reject the government's interpretation as less consistent with the language, history, and purpose of the ITB enhancement guideline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it important to point out that our opinion in St. Cyr does not support the position advocated by the government.  St. Cyr neither expressed nor implied disapproval of the basic proposition that the ITB enhancement guideline should apply only to \"professional fences.\"   See id. at 703 (\"We think this assessment fits harmoniously ... with the decisions of those few circuit courts that have addressed the meaning of [the ITB guideline].\").  Rather, the St. Cyr panel observed that a \"professional fence\" test is not particularly helpful.  Id. at 702-03 (\"Defining the term 'professional fence' is as chancy as defining the language of the guideline itself.\").  Although the \"totality of the circumstances\" test announced in St. Cyr did define the term \"in the business,\" the court never reached the question squarely presented here;  viz., whether a defendant need have been in the business of \"receiving and selling\" stolen property (i.e. acting as a fence) in order for the ITB enhancement to apply.  See also United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 675 (1st Cir.1994) (\"evidence ... clearly demonstrates that defendant was a fence\");  cf. United States v. Tutiven, 40 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1994) (\"As it was stipulated that Tutiven did not steal the motor vehicles ... logic pretty much compels the conclusion that Tutiven knowingly 'received stolen property.' \"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1391, 131 L.Ed.2d 243 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government in our case points to substantial evidence that McMinn engaged not only in extensive thievery but in storing and disseminating stolen property as well.  Nothing prevents a professional thief from also conducting a fencing operation of sufficient size and continuity to qualify for the ITB enhancement;  criminals, too, may have more than one line of business.  For the reasons we have already indicated, however, a thief would not qualify for the ITB enhancement if the only goods he distributed were those which he had stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in the government's analysis or in the district court's findings to indicate that McMinn sold property which he had not stolen.  Of course, since reasonable inferences are always permitted, the case might be quite different if the only evidence were that McMinn had stored and sold large quantities of stolen property.  Here, however, the evidence revealed that McMinn had stolen a great deal of property and, as the record now stands, we have no basis to suppose that he did not steal it all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government argues in the alternative that McMinn should be treated as a professional fence because he neither proffered evidence, nor admitted, that he had pilfered all the stolen goods he sold.  Since it is the government's burden to prove that McMinn received and sold goods stolen by others, however, its argument is fundamentally flawed.  See St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 702 (\"the government bears the burden of establishing that the ITB enhancement applies in a given case\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Cyr, J., was not present at oral argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We review factual findings for clear error, see United States v.

Thus, the commentary provides authoritative definition to the scope of the original ITB enhancement.  See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\"... commentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\").  The background commentary to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 was deleted at the time U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 was consolidated into U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, as amended by amendment 481 (effective Nov. 1, 1993).  But though there is no longer any commentary on the ITB enhancement, see United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 674 (1st Cir.1994), neither is there any reason to believe that consolidation of the two original guideline sections, and the consequent deletion of the background commentary, was meant to alter the scope of the ITB enhancement.  Rather, along with the consolidation and deletion of 24 other guideline sections, the Commission consolidated &#167; 2B1.2 with &#167; 2B1.1 because the offenses were closely related and the Commission wanted to simplify the Guidelines Manual.

See United States v. Robinson, 698 F.2d 448, 453 (D.C.Cir.1983);  Klockars at 69-135.  The \"front\" may afford a superficially valid justification for the low sale prices (i.e. the goods were pawned to the \"front\" or acquired as distressed goods) and thus serve to impede an inference that the fence knew the goods were stolen</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Nor is the caselaw in other circuits inconsistent with the requirement that the defendant must be a \"fence\" in order for the ITB enhancement to apply.

As the sentence enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) for engaging \"in the business of receiving and selling stolen property\" (\"ITB\" enhancement) constituted error, we vacate the district court judgment and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* DISCUSSION</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

In addition, he had cross-examined the other two affiants at the earlier trial on drug-conspiracy charges before the same judge.  See supra note 1.  Finally, the district court was presented with unchallenged police reports, describing various burglaries and corroborating other information in the affidavits.  See United States v.

McMinn argues that Serfass was not connected with the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the \"instant\" offenses involving interstate transportation, receipt, and sale of stolen audio and video components, since Serfass neither testified, nor were the threatening letters admitted, at the trial on these charges.  Instead, Serfass testified at an earlier trial on drug charges which were severed from the stolen-property charges on June 20, 1995.  As the enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 applies only to obstructing an \"investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense,\" McMinn claims that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that conduct unconnected with the stolen-property charges could support the enhancement.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time McMinn mailed the threatening letters, Serfass remained a prospective government witness in relation to the \"instant offense\";  i.e., the stolen-property charges.  It was not until January 1996, immediately prior to the trial on the stolen-property charges, that it became clear that Serfass would not testify.  Thus, there was no error in the district court's determination that McMinn attempted to obstruct the prosecution of the stolen-property charges by mailing the threatening letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>C.

Relying primarily on United States v. Braslawsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547531\"><a href=\"/opinion/547531/united-states-v-fred-s-braslawsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 468 (7th Cir.1990), he argues that an ITB enhancement is impermissible unless the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling property stolen by others (i.e., in the business of \"fencing\" stolen property).  The district court ruling that McMinn's criminal conduct came within the ITB enhancement guideline is reviewed de novo.  See United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The four-level ITB enhancement guideline, by its express terms, applies only if \"the offense involved receiving stolen property, and the defendant was a person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added).  Thus, on its face at least, the ITB guideline does not apply to a defendant who makes a business of stealing property;  that is, a professional \"thief,\" as distinguished from a professional fence.  See Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468 (holding that, by its terms, the ITB enhancement does not apply to a professional thief).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the common-law tradition, stealing property from another normally does not equate with \"receiving\" property from its rightful owner.

Therefore, statutes which criminalize \"receiving\" are generally not thought to target the thief himself, but the wrongdoer who knowingly acquires the loot from or through the thief.  See, e.g., Milanovich, 365 U.S. at 552-56, 81 S.Ct. at 729-730;  Heflin v.

Thus, a fair reading of the plain language employed in section 2B1.1(b)(4)(B) strongly suggests that a defendant engaged in selling only the property he is responsible for stealing has not \"received\" it in the sense contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should there be any doubt about the plain language, the parallel development of the sentencing guideline governing thefts of property, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, and the guideline on receiving stolen property, see id.  &#167;  2B1.2, together with the evolution of the language employed in the ITB enhancement guideline itself, see id.  &#167; 2B1.1(b)(4)(B), tend to confirm that the Commission envisioned that \"theft\" alone not constitute a \"receiving\" of stolen property for these purposes.  Under the original Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1 (1987) governed \"Larceny, Embezzlement and Other Forms of Theft,\" whereas U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 (1987) governed \"Receiving Stolen Property.\"   The offense of receiving stolen property was subject to an ITB enhancement, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2(b)(2)(A) (1987) (\"If the offense [i.e. receiving stolen property] was committed by a person in the business of selling stolen property, increase by 4 levels.\")  (emphasis added), which clearly applied to the professional fence and not to a defendant who simply sold property he pilfered.  See id.  &#167; 2B1.2, comment (backg'd) (1987) (\"Persons who receive stolen property for resale receive a sentence enhancement ....\") (emphasis added);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468.

At the time the Sentencing Guidelines were promulgated, the Commission consistently demonstrated its intention that like enhancements be applicable to both \"theft\" and \"receipt\" offenses by including a parallel enhancement provision in each guideline.  See id.  &#167;&#167; 2B1.1(b)(2);  2B1.2(b)(3) (1987) (parallel enhancements relating to stealing and receiving (stolen) firearm, destructive device or controlled substance);  id.  &#167;&#167; 2B1.1(b)(4);  2B1.2(b)(2)(B) (1987) (parallel enhancements for more than minimal planning relating to stealing and receiving (stolen) property);  id.  &#167;&#167; 2B1.1(b)(6);  2B1.2(b)(4) (1987) (parallel enhancements for engaging in organized criminal activity relating to stealing and receiving (stolen) property);  see also U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 117 (effective Nov. 1, 1989) (adding ITB enhancement to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B6.1--trafficking in motor vehicles with altered or obliterated identification numbers--\"to resolve an inconsistency between ... section [2B6.1] and &#167; 2B1.2\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsequent evolution of the ITB enhancement guideline likewise substantiates that it was meant to cover the professional fence, not the thief.  As the Commission broadened the scope of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 (\"Receiving Stolen Property\"), the language in the ITB enhancement itself was amended to retain its narrow focus upon defendants who \"fence\" stolen goods.  The \"Receiving Stolen Property\" guideline was amended in 1989 to cover \"Transporting, Transferring, Transmitting, or Possessing Stolen Property.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2, as amended by amend. 102 (effective Nov. 1, 1989).  Under the same amendment, the ITB enhancement guideline was changed to read, \"[i]f the offense was committed by a person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property, increase by 4 levels.\"  Id. &#167; 2B1.2(b)(3)(A) (1989) (emphasis added to amendatory language).  Thus, it is apparent from the context that the words \"receiving and\" were included so as to restrict application of the ITB enhancement to defendants who receive and sell stolen property (i.e. professional fences) and to exclude from its reach others, including the thief, who transport, transfer, transmit, or possess, and then sell, stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the separate guideline provisions governing theft offenses and the receiving of stolen property were consolidated.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1 as amended by amend. 481 (effective Nov. 1, 1993).  The same 1993 amendment introduced the language currently found in the ITB enhancement guideline, prescribing a four-level enhancement \"[i]f the offense involved receiving stolen property, and the defendant was a person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property.\"  Id. &#167; 2B1.1(b)(5)(A) (1993) (emphasis added to amendatory language).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historical context in which the 1993 amendment was adopted thus demonstrates that the reconstructed ITB enhancement was designed to apply only to defendants who \"received\" stolen property and whose offense of conviction would come within the scope of former U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 (\"Receiving Stolen Property\"), as opposed to defendants who pilfered the property and whose offense of conviction therefore came within the scope of the original version of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1.  It seems reasonably clear, therefore, viewed in an historical perspective, that the words \"receiving and\" were added to preserve the limited reach of the ITB enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the interpretation propounded by the government presumes that the Commission twice amended the ITB enhancement so as to make it applicable only to defendants who \"receive\" stolen property, yet intended the term \"receiving\" to mean merely \"taking possession of,\" thereby encompassing simple theft.  Though as a literal matter, without regard to its historical context, the term \"receiving\" does not necessarily exclude \"theft,\" we conclude that the references to defendants who \"receive and sell\" stolen property were not meant to apply to a defendant who simply sells only property he has stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our construction is guided by conventional interpretive principles.  See United States v. DeLuca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195223\"><a href=\"/opinion/195223/united-states-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1994) (applying customary rules of statutory interpretation to sentencing guidelines).  It avoids interpreting the words \"receiving and\" out of the ITB enhancement guideline as surplusage.  See United States v. Campos-Serrano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108419\"><a href=\"/opinion/108419/united-states-v-campos-serrano/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, 301 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108419\"><a href=\"/opinion/108419/united-states-v-campos-serrano/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span> (1971) (\"A statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\").  Whereas, were we to adopt the government's view--that the language in the current ITB enhancement (\"in the business of receiving and selling stolen property\") reaches both the thief and the professional fence--then the language of the original ITB enhancement (\"in the business ... of selling stolen property\") need never have been amended in 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation comports with basic guideline sentencing policy as well.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(1),(2)(A),(B),(C) &amp; (5).  The services of a professional fence undoubtedly facilitate the ready, advantageous disposition of property stolen by the less well-situated thief, thereby providing a significant inducement to commit theft offenses.  See United States v. Sutton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8614\"><a href=\"/opinion/8614/united-states-v-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 94 (5th Cir.1996);  Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468;  United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></span> (1970);  Carl Klockars, The Professional Fence 144 (1974) (discussing the adage, \"if there were no receivers, there would be no thieves\").  It is reasonable to assume, as a general rule, that a professional fencing operation efficiently can dispose of greater quantities of stolen goods than could the individual thieves who supply the professional fence, see Klockars at 69-135, thereby enabling both the thieves and the fence to realize greater returns.  Cf. Braslawsky, 913 F.2d at 468.   Thus, as a rule professional fences may be expected to induce more stealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the interposition of a sophisticated fencing operation between the thief and the ultimate purchaser of the stolen property may confound or obstruct the investigation and prosecution of theft offenses.  Often, the stolen property itself may be the only tangible evidence connecting the thief to the crime.  Since the professional fence is better positioned to move stolen goods quickly into the hands of the ultimate \"black market\" consumer, see Klockars at 77 n. 2, 106-13, the loot is more likely to be dispersed before law enforcement agencies can respond.  Consequently, the fence not only affords the thief a less risky and more efficient alternative for disposing of the booty, but the increased efficiency comes at the expense of effective law enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, nonetheless, that the ITB enhancement guideline should be construed simply to require proof that McMinn's sales of stolen goods had a certain regularity or sophistication.  Cf. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 703 (adopting a \"totality of the circumstances\" test).  For the reasons stated above, we reject the government's interpretation as less consistent with the language, history, and purpose of the ITB enhancement guideline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it important to point out that our opinion in St. Cyr does not support the position advocated by the government.  St. Cyr neither expressed nor implied disapproval of the basic proposition that the ITB enhancement guideline should apply only to \"professional fences.\"   See id. at 703 (\"We think this assessment fits harmoniously ... with the decisions of those few circuit courts that have addressed the meaning of [the ITB guideline].\").  Rather, the St. Cyr panel observed that a \"professional fence\" test is not particularly helpful.  Id. at 702-03 (\"Defining the term 'professional fence' is as chancy as defining the language of the guideline itself.\").  Although the \"totality of the circumstances\" test announced in St. Cyr did define the term \"in the business,\" the court never reached the question squarely presented here;  viz., whether a defendant need have been in the business of \"receiving and selling\" stolen property (i.e. acting as a fence) in order for the ITB enhancement to apply.  See also United States v. Richardson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span>, 675 (1st Cir.1994) (\"evidence ... clearly demonstrates that defendant was a fence\");  cf. United States v. Tutiven, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195725\"><a href=\"/opinion/195725/united-states-v-tutiven/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994) (\"As it was stipulated that Tutiven did not steal the motor vehicles ... logic pretty much compels the conclusion that Tutiven knowingly 'received stolen property.' \"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nothing prevents a professional thief from also conducting a fencing operation of sufficient size and continuity to qualify for the ITB enhancement;  criminals, too, may have more than one line of business.  For the reasons we have already indicated, however, a thief would not qualify for the ITB enhancement if the only goods he distributed were those which he had stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in the government's analysis or in the district court's findings to indicate that McMinn sold property which he had not stolen.  Of course, since reasonable inferences are always permitted, the case might be quite different if the only evidence were that McMinn had stored and sold large quantities of stolen property.  Here, however, the evidence revealed that McMinn had stolen a great deal of property and, as the record now stands, we have no basis to suppose that he did not steal it all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the government argues in the alternative that McMinn should be treated as a professional fence because he neither proffered evidence, nor admitted, that he had pilfered all the stolen goods he sold.  Since it is the government's burden to prove that McMinn received and sold goods stolen by others, however, its argument is fundamentally flawed.  See St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 702 (\"the government bears the burden of establishing that the ITB enhancement applies in a given case\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Cyr, J., was not present at oral argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We review factual findings for clear error, see United States v.

Thus, the commentary provides authoritative definition to the scope of the original ITB enhancement.  See Stinson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The background commentary to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 was deleted at the time U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.2 was consolidated into U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, as amended by amendment 481 (effective Nov. 1, 1993).  But though there is no longer any commentary on the ITB enhancement, see United States v. Richardson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span>, 674 (1st Cir.1994), neither is there any reason to believe that consolidation of the two original guideline sections, and the consequent deletion of the background commentary, was meant to alter the scope of the ITB enhancement.  Rather, along with the consolidation and deletion of 24 other guideline sections, the Commission consolidated &#167; 2B1.2 with &#167; 2B1.1 because the offenses were closely related and the Commission wanted to simplify the Guidelines Manual.  See U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 481 (1995)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> These considerations represent an especially serious hindrance to law enforcement when the professional fence utilizes a legitimate \"front,\" such as a pawn shop or an outlet dealing in distressed goods at sharply lower prices.  See United States v.

The \"front\" may afford a superficially valid justification for the low sale prices (i.e. the goods were pawned to the \"front\" or acquired as distressed goods) and thus serve to impede an inference that the fence knew the goods were stolen</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Nor is the caselaw in other circuits inconsistent with the requirement that the defendant must be a \"fence\" in order for the ITB enhancement to apply.
