Alejandro De Jesus Granada appeals his\r                                \r\n\nsentence on two grounds.  We affirm.\r\n\n          1.  Role in the offense.  Appellant argues that the\r                                             \r\n\ndistrict  court erred in failing  to grant his  request for a\r\n\ntwo-level reduction in the offense level based upon his minor\r\n\nrole in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G.    3B1.2.  The plea\r\n\nagreement   entered  between  appellant  and  the  government\r\n\nexpressly provided that, beyond the adjustment for acceptance\r\n\nof responsibility, \"no further adjustments to the defendant's\r\n\nbase offense level  shall be  made.\"  It  might therefore  be\r\n\nargued  that  appellant  waived   his  right  to  request  an\r\n\nadjustment for his  role in  the offense, but  there is  some\r\n\ndifference  among  the  circuits  on when  and  whether  such\r\n\nstipulations are  binding on the  district court and  we have\r\n\nnot resolved  this issue.   Compare United States  v. Isirov,\r                                                                        \r\n\n996 F.2d 183, 186-87  (7th Cir. 1993), with United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLong, 77 F.3d 1060, 1061 (8th Cir. 1996).\r                \r\n\n          In all events, Granada was convicted of importing a\r\n\nspecific  shipment of  heroin.   He is  the one  who  did the\r\n\nimporting  and while  there is  some indication  that someone\r\n\nelse furnished him with the drugs, there is almost nothing to\r\n\nindicate  that his role in this importation was minor.  Given\r\n\nthat  the burden was on Granada  to show that he was entitled\r\n\nto the downward adjustment, the district court did not err in\r\n\nits conclusion that the adjustment was unwarranted.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          2.    Departure  Pursuant  to   U.S.S.G.     5K2.0.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAppellant contends  that the district court  erred in failing\r\n\nto  depart downward under U.S.S.G.   5K2.0, on account of his\r\n\nsubstantial  assistance  to  the government,  notwithstanding\r\n\nthat  the government did not move for a departure pursuant to\r\n\n  5K1.1.  \"It  is by now axiomatic that a  criminal defendant\r\n\ncannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary\r\n\ndecision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r                                   \r\n\n          In  his brief,  appellant does  not argue  that the\r\n\ndistrict court misunderstood  its legal authority  to depart.\r\n\nThe transcript  of the  sentencing hearing does  not indicate\r\n\nthat  the  court  suffered   from  such  a  misunderstanding.\r\n\nTherefore,  this  court  lacks  jurisdiction  to  review  the\r\n\nsentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart.\r\n\n          3.   Pro Se Motion to  Supplement Appellate Record.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAppellant  filed a pro se  motion with this  court seeking to\r                                     \r\n\nsupplement  the  record  by adding  a  letter  from  a prison\r\n\npsychologist. In his motion, Granada suggests that the letter\r\n\ncalls into question  the validity  of his guilty  plea.   The\r\n\nletter  was never before the district court.  Nor has Granada\r\n\nraised  the issue  of  the validity  of  his guilty  plea  in\r\n\ndistrict court.   \"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has\r\n\nnot  presented an argument to the district court, she may not\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nunveil it in the court of appeals.\"  United  States v.

R. 27.1.\r                                                           \r\n\nAppellant's pro se motion to supplement the record on  appeal\r                              \r\n\nis denied.\r                     \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
