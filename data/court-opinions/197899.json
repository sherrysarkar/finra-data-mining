Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nJudy Cheng on brief pro se.\r\nLynne Alix Morrison, Adrienne M. Markham and Goulston &amp; Storrs on\r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                         April 9, 1998\r\n                                          \r\n\n       Per Curiam.   In this employment discrimination\r\naction, plaintiff appeals the dismissal of her complaint as a\r\nsanction for failure to comply with a discovery order. \r\nPlaintiff allegedly failed to comply with the court's March 31,\r\n1997 order by withholding from her document production\r\napproximately 5,000 pages of diary and calendar entries.  The\r\ndiary and calendars were kept by plaintiff for her personal use\r\nand contain, inter alia, a running commentary on things that\r\nplaintiff thought, saw, heard, and did during the employment\r\nperiod.\r\n         Having carefully reviewed the record leading to the\r\ndismissal, it appears that the March 31 order does not\r\nspecifically command the production of these documents, but\r\ngenerally directs plaintiff to respond to defendants' document\r\nrequest.  The document request, in turn, generally requests\r\ndocuments about subjects relevant to the issues in suit, but\r\ndoes not specifically designate these diary and calendar pages. \r\n       Plaintiff produced documents in response to the March\r\n31 order, and defendants' demands, including, significantly,\r\nmany pages from the personal diary and calendars.  She argues\r\nhere, as below, that this production exhausted all documents in\r\nher possession that are \"relevant\" to the subjects in suit. \r\nDefendants did not refute plaintiff's assertion; rather they\r\nurged that the withheld pages seem \"reasonably calculated\" to\r\nlead to admissible evidence.  \r\n         We tred lightly here so as not to intrude on the\r\ndistrict court's broad discretion to manage evolving discovery\r\ndemands under Fed. R. Civ. P. 34, nor to substitute our own\r\nview as to any management orders.  This dismissal, however,\r\ncannot stand because it is not authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n37(b)(2).  The sanction of dismissal under Rule 37(b)(2) is\r\nauthorized only if the order allegedly violated gave notice\r\nthat the withholding of the specific material would constitute\r\na defiance of the order.  R.W. Int'l Corp. v. Welch Foods,\r\nInc., 937 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n    [W]hen a court issues a broad-form discovery order,\r\n    and the party to whom it is addressed complies with\r\n    it somewhat less than fully, withholding documents\r\n    arguably outside the order's scope, the district\r\n    court cannot dismiss without first entering an order\r\n    commanding production of the specific materials.\r\n\nId. at 16.\r\n         The March 31 order did not unarguably command\r\nproduction of the specific documents withheld, so the sanction\r\nof dismissal was not authorized.  Plaintiff's arguments at the\r\nJune 12, 1997 hearing, where the issue was aired for the first\r\ntime, cannot be construed (on the basis of the \"cold\"\r\ntranscript alone) as expressing a determination to violate a\r\nspecific production order.\r\n         We also find no support for defendant's re-\r\ncharacterization of the dismissal as one based on a \"pattern of\r\ndiscovery abuses\" by the plaintiff.  This ground was not urged\r\nin the district court, and there were no express findings to\r\nthat effect.  We cannot readily infer from this record that the\r\ndiscovery events listed in defendants' brief, even\r\ncumulatively, involved an \"abuse\" of the process.  See Robsonv. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1996).  Nothing that we say\r\nhere, of course, precludes the district court from considering\r\nany motion based on a supportable pattern of discovery abuse. \r\nId. at 3.    \r\n         Plaintiff's remaining assignments of error, most\r\nsignificantly the denial of her motions seeking to reinstate\r\nher Equal Pay Act claim, are not properly before us at this\r\ntime.  Where the reason for the denial of an amendment is not\r\nobvious from the record, however, we urge the district court to\r\nenter specific, reviewable findings.  \r\n         Although we do not consider plaintiff's allegation of\r\njudicial bias because it was not raised, ab initio, in the\r\ndistrict court, we think it prudent that, on remand, the case\r\nbe reassigned to a judge other than the district court judge to\r\nwhom it was originally assigned.  See D. Mass. R. 40.1(i). \r\n         The judgment of dismissal is vacated and this case is\r\nremanded to the district court for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this decision.  No costs.\n",
