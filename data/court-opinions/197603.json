Plaintiff-appellant Craig  J. Mercer,\r                                \r\n\nan Ohio  prisoner, appeals pro  se from the dismissal  of his\r                                              \r\n\ncomplaint under 42 U.S.C.   1983 alleging that the Sheriff of\r\n\nCumberland County (Maine) unlawfully detained Mercer and then\r\n\nunlawfully  transferred him  to Ohio authorities,  without an\r\n\nextradition  hearing,   to  face   final  parole   revocation\r\n\nproceedings.   See  28 U.S.C.     1915(e)(2)(B),  1915A.   We\r                              \r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          Contrary to Mercer's  suggestion, we  do not  think\r\n\nthat he stated  a claim for unlawful detention.   Pursuant to\r\n\nMaine's Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision, the\r\n\nsheriff  had the  authority  to  detain  Mercer  pending  the\r\n\npreliminary parole revocation hearing in Maine, and, since it\r\n\nappeared that  a retaking was  likely, for a  reasonable time\r\n\nthereafter.  Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A,   9861.   We are\r\n\nnot  persuaded that the  length of  detention in  the instant\r\n\ncase was unreasonable.        The  Uniform  Act  for  Out-of-\r\n\nState  Parolee Supervision  also permits  the  retaking of  a\r\n\nparolee subject to  the Act without \"formalities\"  other than\r\n\n\"establishing the authority  of the officer and  the identity\r\n\nof the person to be retaken.\"  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34-A,\r\n\n  9803.  Mercer makes  no argument that this Act incorporates\r\n\nthe  procedural  protections  afforded  by  Maine's  Criminal\r\n\nExtradition Act, and the language of   9803 would suggest the\r\n\ncontrary.    Under  the  circumstances,  and  passing without\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndeciding  the question  whether  a  failure  to  comply  with\r\n\nextradition  procedures creates  a cause  of  action under   \r\n\n1983, we find no error in the dismissal.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
