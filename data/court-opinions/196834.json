Gentile, Senior Legal Counsel,  R.I. Department of Corrections,  on\r                  \r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n     Per  Curiam.   Having carefully  examined the  record in\r                            \r\r\n\nthis  case, we  affirm  the dismissal  of appellant  Lother's\r\n\ncomplaint,  albeit for somewhat  different reasons than those\r\n\narticulated below.  \r\n\n     First, since both the Morris rules and the Rhode  Island\r\n\nAdministrative  Procedure Acts  are state  laws,  the alleged\r\n\nviolation  of either, in and  of itself, is  not a sufficient\r\n\npredicate  to  sustain a  damage  action  under federal  law.\r\n\nComplaints of such violations therefore should be directed to\r\n\nstate  court.    Furthermore,  insofar  as   appellant  seeks\r\n\ninjunctive or  declaratory relief for  alleged violations  of\r\n\nthe Morris rules, he  is precluded by our prior  holding that\r\n\ninmates  may not  bring individual  section 1983  actions for\r\n\ninjunctive or  declaratory relief which are  based on consent\r\n\ndecree violations.  See Martel v. Fridovich, 14 F.3d 1, 3 n.4\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     Second,  Lother's allegation that  his being required to\r\n\nprovide a  urine sample violated his  Fourth Amendment rights\r\n\nis without merit.  Urine tests of inmates may be searches for\r\n\nFourth Amendment purposes.   See, e.g., Lucero v.  Gunter, 52\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 874, 877  (10th Cir.  1995); Forbes v.  Trigg, 976  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n308,  312 (7th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 950 (1993);\r                                                   \r\n\nSpence  v.  Farrier,  807  F.2d  753,  755  (8th  Cir. 1986).\r                               \r\n\nPrisoners  therefore may have a  right not to  be required to\r\n\nsubmit to  unreasonable requests  for urine tests.   However,\r\n\nLother claims only that  the test in this case  was conducted\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nwithout a superior officer present.  That fact may indicate a\r\n\nviolation of  the Morris  rules; standing alone,  however, it\r\n\ndoes not raise Fourth Amendment concerns.\r\n\n     Finally, even if we  assume without deciding that Lother\r\n\nretains  a  liberty  interest  in preserving  the  good  time\r\n\ncredits  he  has  earned or  in  not  being  deprived of  his\r\n\nvisitation  privileges, Lother  has  still  failed to  allege\r\n\nsufficient facts to  sustain a  claim that his  right to  due\r\n\nprocess  has  been  violated.     Even  read  liberally,  his\r\n\ncomplaint at  most alleges that the  disciplinary board which\r\n\nfound him  guilty of  the drug violation  \"used inappropriate\r\n\ncriteria  to  substanciate  [sic] [the]  discipline  report.\"\r\n\nWhile  due  process  requires  that  a  disciplinary  board's\r\n\nfinding  of guilt  be  supported by  \"some  evidence\" in  the\r\n\nrecord, Superintendent, Mass.  Correctional Inst., Walpole v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHill, 472 U.S.  445, 455-56 (1985),  Lother has only  alleged\r                \r\n\nthat the drug test which  led to the challenged  disciplinary\r\n\naction was unsupported by  a second test.   Since he has  not\r\n\nalleged that the  test itself  was false, he  has not  denied\r\n\nthat \"some evidence\" exists to support the board's finding of\r\n\nguilt.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
