He  alleges that:  (1) the\r\n\ndistrict  court  relied  on  the  mere  fact  that  he  knowingly\r\n\nparticipated  in the kickback scheme  to conclude that  he was as\r\n\nculpable  as  the  other  conspiracy members;  (2)  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  finding that Cohen was not less culpable than the others\r\n\nwas clearly erroneous in  the face of the  probation department's\r\n\nand the  U.S. Attorney's1 allegedly contrary  assertions; and (3)\r\n\nthe amount of fraudulent  loans Cohen received and the  bribes he\r\n\npaid to bank  officials had  already been taken  into account  in\r\n\nestablishing  the base offense level, implying that consideration\r\n\nof  these  amounts  in  determining  that  he  was  not  a  minor\r\n\nparticipant amounted to double-counting.  Cohen claims that these\r\n\nthree  errors require that  we reverse  his sentence  and remand.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   While  the U.S.  Attorney's Office  apparently conceded  that\r\nCohen was less culpable than the other members of the conspiracy,\r\nthe Office  made clear at the sentencing  hearing that it did not\r\nbelieve that Cohen  was less culpable than the  average defendant\r\nwho commits this sort of bank fraud.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nBeyond these broad and conclusory assertions, however, he has not\r\n\nbeen able to point  to facts in the  record sufficient to  compel\r\n\nthe conclusion  that his culpability was  significantly less than\r\n\nthat of  the other participants in  the scheme or --  more to the\r\n\npoint -- that  his culpability was less than that  of the average\r\n\ndefendant who commits  bank fraud  and bribery.   Nor does  Cohen\r\n\ndevelop or support his argument that  the district court's ruling\r\n\nregarding  his  culpability  relative  to  the  other  conspiracy\r\n\nparticipants,  contrary  to assertions  of  the  parties and  the\r\n\nprobation department, is necessarily reversible error.\r\n\n          In  addition to  noting Cohen's  failure to  present us\r\n\nwith  evidentiary  support  for  a  minor  participant   downward\r\n\nadjustment,  we find no error  in the district court's conclusion\r\n\nthat  he was not  entitled to such  an adjustment.   The district\r\n\ncourt  specifically noted  that  Cohen's  conduct, including  his\r\n\nactive participation in the  conspiracy's intended purposes, made\r\n\nhim at least as culpable as the other criminal participants.  The\r\n\nrecord  specifically reveals  that, during  a one-and-a-half-year\r\n\ntime period,  Cohen repeatedly  applied  for loans  for which  he\r\n\nprovided bribes and from  which he received considerable benefit.\r\n\nAs sole borrower  of four loans, Cohen's role was integral to the\r\n\nsuccess  of the  scheme as related  to these  loans.   We find no\r\n\nerror  in the  district court's  refusal to  grant Cohen  a minor\r\n\nparticipant downward adjustment.\r\n\n          Upon   full  consideration  of  the  record,  appellate\r\n\nbriefs,  and argument of counsel,  we affirm the  decision of the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict court on the basis of its rulings at Cohen's August  20,\r\n\n1996, Sentencing Hearing.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n",

The district\r\n\ncourt  specifically noted  that  Cohen's  conduct, including  his\r\n\nactive participation in the  conspiracy's intended purposes, made\r\n\nhim at least as culpable as the other criminal participants.  The\r\n\nrecord  specifically reveals  that, during  a one-and-a-half-year\r\n\ntime period,  Cohen repeatedly  applied  for loans  for which  he\r\n\nprovided bribes and from  which he received considerable benefit.\r\n\nAs sole borrower  of four loans, Cohen's role was integral to the\r\n\nsuccess  of the  scheme as related  to these  loans.   We find no\r\n\nerror  in the  district court's  refusal to  grant Cohen  a minor\r\n\nparticipant downward adjustment.\r\n\n          Upon   full  consideration  of  the  record,  appellate\r\n\nbriefs,  and argument of counsel,  we affirm the  decision of the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict court on the basis of its rulings at Cohen's August  20,\r\n\n1996, Sentencing Hearing.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n</pre>",
