Petitioner Cindy Grant-Chase\r\nappeals the denial of her application for a writ of habeas corpus\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  2254.  Her appeal presents two questions. \r\nFirst, is 1st Cir. R. 22.1(c) (Interim Local Rule) inconsistent\r\nwith 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(1) and Fed. R. App. P. 22(b) (as these\r\nprovisions were amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\r\nPenalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\")) insofar as it requires appellants\r\nseeking collateral relief under 28 U.S.C.  2254 or 2255 who\r\nalready have obtained a certificate of appealability (\"COA\") from\r\na district judge as to one or more issues also to obtain a COA on\r\nthose issues from the court of appeals?  Second, if the merits of\r\nthis case are properly before us, did the district court err in\r\nconcluding that the challenged state ruling was neither contrary\r\nto, nor involved an unreasonable application of, \"clearly\r\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States\"?  28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1).  We conclude that\r\n1st Cir. R. 22.1(c) is inconsistent with 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(1)\r\nand Fed. R. App. P. 22(b) in requiring a second COA in the\r\ncircumstances just described, but reject petitioner's appeal on\r\nthe merits.\r\n                              I.\r\nWe take the facts directly from State v. Grant-Chase,\r\n140 N.H. 264 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1140 (1996).\r\n  On December 28, 1990, the [petitioner]\r\nand the victim, George Tegelaar, were in a\r\nphysical struggle that resulted in the\r\n[petitioner] shooting and wounding the\r\nvictim.  Both the victim and the [petitioner]\r\nwere transported to the hospital for\r\ntreatment of their injuries.  Because the\r\n[petitioner] was a suspect in the case,\r\nOfficers Langley and Folini went to the\r\nhospital to question the [petitioner], hoping\r\nto elicit incriminating statements.  The\r\n[petitioner] was under constant police watch\r\nand was not free to leave.  Officer Langley\r\nwas within three to five feet of her while\r\nshe was in the emergency room.  During that\r\ntime the [petitioner] asked Officer Langley\r\nfor her purse and if she could call her\r\nlawyer.  Once the hospital staff had\r\ncompleted their testing, the [petitioner]\r\ntelephoned her lawyer.  During the five- to\r\nten-minute telephone call Officer Langley\r\nremained present but could not overhear the\r\nsubstance of the conversation.  After the\r\n[petitioner] ended her phone call, Officers\r\nLangley and Folini approached her to initiate\r\nquestioning.  Until this point the police had\r\nnot subjected the [petitioner] to questioning\r\nor its functional equivalent.  Officer Folini\r\nasked her if it was all right to ask some\r\nquestions about the incident.  The\r\n[petitioner] told him that she had talked to\r\nher attorney, who advised her to cooperate\r\nwith the investigation.  The officers\r\nexplained to the [petitioner] her Mirandarights, see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\r\n. . . (1966), which she explicitly waived by\r\nsigning a waiver form, and elicited\r\nincriminating statements.\r\n\nId. at 265-66.\r\nPrior to trial, petitioner moved to suppress the\r\nstatements she had given to Officers Langley and Folini, arguing\r\nthat the statements had been obtained in violation of, interalia, her right to have counsel present during custodial\r\ninterrogation.  See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 469-73.  The state trial\r\ncourt rejected her argument, ruling that petitioner did not\r\n\"adequately indicate[] to the officers that she sought the\r\nassistance of counsel.\"  Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267\r\n(summarizing the trial court's ruling).  Thereafter, a jury\r\nconvicted petitioner of first degree assault.\r\nPetitioner appealed her conviction to the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court, contending that statements elicited in violation\r\nof, inter alia, the rules of Miranda were used to convict her. \r\nOn December 14, 1994, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed\r\npetitioner's conviction.  Petitioner moved for and was granted\r\nreconsideration of this decision.  But on October 3, 1995, the\r\ncourt handed down a new opinion that again affirmed petitioner's\r\nconviction.\r\nDisagreeing with the trial court, the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court first ruled that petitioner's request to call her\r\nlawyer was \"an invocation of the right to counsel.\"  Grant-Chase,\r\n140 N.H. at 267.  The court then opined that, \"[h]ad the\r\n[petitioner] made her request for counsel after Miranda warnings\r\nhad been given or after interrogation had begun, there would have\r\nbeen an irrebuttable presumption that the [petitioner] asked for\r\nthe assistance of counsel for the purpose of having counsel\r\npresent during any further questioning . . . .\"  Id. (citing\r\nMinnick v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. 146, 153 (1990)).  But because\r\nthe request preceded Miranda warnings and the inception of\r\ninterrogation, the court declined to indulge such a presumption. \r\nId. (citing Minnick, 498 U.S. at 153).  Rather, the court\r\nscrutinized the nature of petitioner's actual invocation, and\r\nconcluded that it was \"ambiguous as to purpose.\"  Id. at 268.  A\r\nfair reading of the opinion reveals that the ambiguity detected\r\nwas whether petitioner \"wanted advice from counsel regarding how\r\nto handle the imminent questioning, or whether the [petitioner]\r\nwanted counsel present for interrogation . . . .\"  Id. at 267-68. \r\nThe police officers therefore were within their rights to\r\n\"clarify the ambiguity by asking the [petitioner] if . . . she\r\nwishe[d] to go forward with interrogation.\"  Id. at 268 (citing\r\nDavis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 461 (1994)).  And given\r\npetitioner's unambiguous affirmative response to this attempt at\r\nclarification, the court found petitioner's subsequent waiver of\r\nher Miranda rights to be effective.  Id. \r\nSubsequently, petitioner applied for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2254.  The application challenged\r\nas clearly unconstitutional the New Hampshire Supreme Court's\r\nunwillingness to extend to those in custody and facing imminent\r\ninterrogation the \"irrebuttable presumption\" the court appears to\r\nhave inferred from Minnick:  that any \"request for counsel\" made\r\nduring custodial interrogation (as opposed to just prior to\r\ninterrogation) is for the purpose of invoking the right to\r\ncounsel's presence during further questioning.  See Grant-Chase,\r\n140 N.H. at 267.  The district court denied the petition,\r\nreasoning that (1) under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1), it was\r\nprohibited from granting the writ unless the challenged state\r\nruling was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\r\nof, clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent;\r\nand (2) the United States Supreme Court has never explicitly or\r\nimplicitly endorsed application of such a presumption to\r\nsituations preceding the commencement of custodial interrogation. \r\nThe court did, however, issue petitioner a COA as to this issue\r\npursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2253(c).  \r\nIn accordance with 1st Cir. R. 22.1(c), an interim\r\nrule adopted in 1996 in the wake of the AEDPA's amendments to 28\r\nU.S.C.  2253(c) and Fed. R. App. P. 22(b), petitioner then asked\r\nthis court to grant her a second COA with respect to the Mirandaissue.  Noting that other circuits have determined that litigants\r\nwho have obtained a COA on one or more issues from a district\r\njudge may proceed with their appeals of those issues forthwith,\r\nwe decided to reexamine 1st Cir. R. 22.1(c) and requested that\r\npetitioner and respondent file supplemental briefs discussing\r\n\"whether a petitioner who obtains a [COA] from a district court\r\njudge must also obtain one from the court of appeals before the\r\nappeal may proceed.\"  We also invited the Federal Defender and\r\nthe United States Attorney to file amicus briefs on this issue. \r\nIn their helpful supplemental and amicus briefs, petitioner,\r\nrespondent, the Federal Defender, and the United States Attorney\r\nall took the view that 1st Cir. R. 22.1(c) is inconsistent with\r\nthe 1996 amendments to 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(1) and Fed. R. App. P.\r\n22(b) insofar as the Rule requires litigants in possession of a\r\nCOA from a district judge to apply for a second certificate from\r\nthis court.  As a result, petitioner, respondent, and amici join\r\nin urging us to revise 1st Cir. R. 22.1(c) to dispense with this\r\nrequirement. \r\n                             II.\r\nA.  1st Cir. R. 22.1(c)\r\n   Upon due consideration of the arguments set forth in\r\nthe supplemental and amicus briefs, we agree that 1st Cir. R.\r\n22.1(c) should be revised to eliminate the requirement that\r\nlitigants in possession of a COA from a district judge as to one\r\nor more issues apply for a second COA with respect to those\r\nissues from the court of appeals.  As an initial matter, we\r\nobserve that every court of appeals that has considered the\r\nquestion has concluded that a district judge may issue a COA. \r\nSee, e.g., Tiedeman v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 522 (8th Cir. 1997)\r\n(listing seven other court of appeals cases, involving appeals of\r\ndenials of both 28 U.S.C.  2254 petitions and 28 U.S.C.  2255\r\nmotions, to similar effect); see also 7th Cir. R. 22.1(b).  The\r\nbasis for this unanimous view is well summarized in Judge Carnes'\r\ncomprehensive opinion in Hunter v. United States, 101 F.3d 1565,\r\n1573-84 (11th Cir. 1996) (en banc), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1695\r\n(1997), and, in the absence of any suggestion that 1st Cir. R.\r\n22.1(c) improperly countenances the issuance of a COA by a\r\ndistrict judge, we see no reason to reinvent the wheel.  Suffice\r\nit to say that we endorse the views expressed in Hunter and\r\nexplicitly now hold that a district judge has the authority under\r\nthe AEDPA to issue a COA under 28 U.S.C.  2253(c) and Fed. R.\r\nApp. P. 22(b).\r\n   Once such authority is recognized, the superfluity of\r\n1st Cir. R. 22.1(c)'s \"second certificate\" requirement becomes\r\napparent.  Though couched in the negative, 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)\r\nexplicitly contemplates the issuance of only one certificate\r\nbefore an appeal to this court may be taken.  See supra note 2\r\n(\"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a [COA], an appeal may\r\nnot be taken to the court of appeals from [a final order denying\r\na 28 U.S.C.  2254 petition or a 28 U.S.C.  2255\r\nmotion].\")(emphases supplied).  And Fed. R. App. P. 22(b) even\r\nmore explicitly recognizes that an appeal may proceed once a\r\nlitigant has a COA from a district judge.  See id. (\"In a habeas\r\ncorpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out\r\nof process issued by a State court, an appeal by the applicant\r\nfor the writ may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge\r\nissues a [COA] pursuant to section 2253(c) of title 28, United\r\nStates Code.\")(emphases supplied).  \r\n   We therefore rule that a COA from a district judge as\r\nto an issue is itself sufficient to permit an appeal of the issue\r\nin 28 U.S.C.  2254 and 2255 proceedings.  In so ruling, we note\r\nthat the Eleventh Circuit has explicitly reached the same\r\nconclusion, see Hunter, 101 F.3d at 1576 n.9 (requiring a second\r\nCOA from the court of appeals is \"inconsistent with the plain\r\nlanguage\" of 28 U.S.C.  2253(c) and Fed. R. App. P. 22(b)), and\r\nthat all other courts of appeals that have touched upon the\r\nquestion have at least implicitly followed suit, see, e.g., 7th\r\nCir. R. 22.1(b) (permitting an appeal to proceed upon issuance of\r\na COA by a district judge); Teideman, 122 F.3d at 522 (\"Normally,\r\na [COA] granted by a district judge, if regular on its face and\r\nnot procedurally defective, would mean that the appeal would\r\nproceed in this Court in the ordinary course.\"); Houchin v.\r\nZavaras, 107 F.3d 1465, 1469 (10th Cir. 1997) (similar); Else v.\r\nJohnson, 104 F.3d 82, 83 (5th Cir. 1997) (similar).  Accordingly,\r\npending revision of 1st Cir. R. 22.1(c), litigants in possession\r\nof a COA as to an issue from a district judge need not apply to\r\nthis court for issuance of a second certificate on that issue;\r\nthey need only present this court with a copy of the district\r\ncourt order granting a certificate of appealability.  See supranote 1.  Upon such presentation, the appeal shall proceed in this\r\ncourt in the ordinary course.\r\nB.  The Merits\r\n   Turning to the merits of petitioner's appeal, we detect\r\nno error in the district court's denial of her petition.  As\r\npreviously noted, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined that\r\npetitioner's pre-interrogation request to call counsel was\r\n\"ambiguous as to purpose\"   i.e., it was ambiguous as to \"whether\r\nthe [petitioner] wanted advice from counsel regarding how to\r\nhandle the imminent questioning, or whether the [petitioner]\r\nwanted counsel present for interrogation . . . .\"  Grant-Chase,\r\n140 N.H. at 267-68.  The court also determined that when Officer\r\nFolini subsequently \"asked [petitioner] if it was all right to\r\nask some questions about the incident,\" id. at 266, he was\r\nseeking \"to clarify the purpose of her call,\" id. at 268.  Given\r\nthese determinations (which petitioner does not challenge), we\r\nhave some difficulty understanding why the New Hampshire Supreme\r\nCourt overruled the state trial court's ruling that petitioner\r\ndid not adequately indicate to the officers that she sought \"the\r\nassistance of counsel.\"  Id. at 267.  After all, the trial\r\ncourt's ruling must, in context, be understood as a determination\r\nthat petitioner had not actually invoked her right to the\r\nassistance of an attorney in dealing with the forthcominginterrogation.  And the New Hampshire Supreme Court's \"ambiguous\r\nas to purpose\" ruling would seem to evince agreement, rather than\r\ndisagreement, with this determination.\r\n   In any event, the United States Supreme Court has quite\r\nclearly held that the rule of Miranda \"applies only when the\r\nsuspect has expressed his wish for the particular type of\r\nlawyerly assistance that is the subject of Miranda.\"  McNeil v.\r\nWisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178 (1991) (citation and internal\r\nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original); see also id.(defining the type of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of\r\nMiranda as \"the right to the assistance of an attorney in dealingwith a custodial interrogation by the police\") (emphasis in\r\noriginal).  So too has the Court held that the wish for this type\r\nof assistance must be \"unambiguously\" expressed, meaning \"a\r\nstatement either is . . . an assertion of the right to counsel or\r\nit is not.\"  Davis, 512 U.S. 459 (citation and internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).  Thus, when a suspect has made a statement that\r\nmight or might not amount to an expression of a wish for the\r\nassistance of counsel during interrogation, the police are within\r\ntheir rights not only to clarify whether the suspect wants an\r\nattorney present, see id. at 461 (observing that such a\r\nclarification \"will often be good police practice\"), but also\r\nsimply to continue the interrogation without asking for\r\nclarification, see id. 461-62.  \r\n   Here, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined, and\r\nthe record confirms, that petitioner's intentions were at first\r\nunclear; that Officer Folini asked petitioner to clarify her\r\nintentions; that petitioner unambiguously informed the officers\r\nthat she intended to cooperate with the investigation; that the\r\nofficers read petitioner her Miranda rights; and that petitioner\r\nwaived those rights.  In our view, this scenario falls squarely\r\nwithin the rule of Davis.  We therefore see no basis for\r\nconcluding that the admission into evidence of petitioner's\r\nsubsequent statements was \"contrary to, or involved an\r\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\r\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.S.C.\r\n2254(d)(1); see O'Brien v. DuBois, No. 97-1979, slip op. at 10-\r\n23 (1st Cir. May 26, 1998) (interpreting  2254(d)(1)).           \r\n                             III.\r\n   For the reasons stated, we hold that if a litigant has\r\nobtained from a district judge a COA as to one or more issues\r\naddressed in the denial of a 28 U.S.C.  2254 petition or a 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255 motion, the litigant need not apply for a second\r\nCOA from this court as to these issues.  To the extent that 1st\r\nCir. R. 22.1(c) imposes such a \"second certificate\" requirement,\r\nit should be disregarded.  As to the merits of this appeal, we\r\naffirm the district court's denial of petitioner Cindy Grant-\r\nChase's application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \r\n2254.     BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring).  Although I do\r\nnot quarrel with the majority's intricate analysis of Miranda, as\r\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court, I would decide the case on a\r\nsimpler basis.\r\n   Plaintiff asked and received permission to call her\r\nattorney after she arrived at the hospital.  She did so, and he\r\ntold her to cooperate with the police.  After she finished talking\r\nto her lawyer, the police asked if they could talk to her.  She\r\nreplied that she would do so, stating that her lawyer had told her\r\nto cooperate with the police.  Before interrogating her, the police\r\nadvised her of her rights under Miranda.  She signed the Mirandawaiver.  I see no Miranda problem.\r\n",

See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 469-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602.   The state trial court rejected her argument, ruling that petitioner did not \"adequately indicate[ ] to the officers that she sought the assistance of counsel.\"  Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267, 665 A.2d 380 (summarizing the trial court's ruling).  Thereafter, a jury convicted petitioner of first degree assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner appealed her conviction to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, contending that statements elicited in violation of, inter alia, the rules of Miranda were used to convict her.  On December 14, 1994, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction.  Petitioner moved for and was granted reconsideration of this decision.  But on October 3, 1995, the court handed down a new opinion that again affirmed petitioner's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disagreeing with the trial court, the New Hampshire Supreme Court first ruled that petitioner's request to call her lawyer was \"an invocation of the right to counsel.\"  Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267, 665 A.2d 380.   The court then opined that, \"[h]ad the [petitioner] made her request for counsel after Miranda warnings had been given or after interrogation had begun, there would have been an irrebuttable presumption that the [petitioner] asked for the assistance of counsel for the purpose of having counsel present during any further questioning....\"  Id.  (citing Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. 146, 153, 111 S.Ct. 486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489 (1990)).  But because the request preceded Miranda warnings and the inception of interrogation, the court declined to indulge such a presumption.  Id. (citing Minnick, 498 U.S. at 153, 111 S.Ct. 486).   Rather, the court scrutinized the nature of petitioner's actual invocation, and concluded that it was \"ambiguous as to purpose.\"  Id. at 268.   A fair reading of the opinion reveals that the ambiguity detected was whether petitioner \"wanted advice from counsel regarding how to handle the imminent questioning, or whether the [petitioner] wanted counsel present for interrogation....\" ....\"  Id. at 267-68.   The police officers therefore were within their rights to \"clarify the ambiguity by asking the [petitioner] if ... she wishe[d] to go forward with interrogation.\"  Id. at 268 (citing Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994)).  And given petitioner's unambiguous affirmative response to this attempt at clarification, the court found petitioner's subsequent waiver of her Miranda rights to be effective.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.  The application challenged as clearly unconstitutional the New Hampshire Supreme Court's unwillingness to extend to those in custody and facing imminent interrogation the \"irrebuttable presumption\" the court appears to have inferred from Minnick:  that any \"request for counsel\" made during custodial interrogation (as opposed to just prior to interrogation) is for the purpose of invoking the right to counsel's presence during further questioning.  See Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267, 665 A.2d 380.   The district court denied the petition, reasoning that (1) under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), it was prohibited from granting the writ unless the challenged state ruling was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent;  and (2) the United States Supreme Court has never explicitly or implicitly endorsed application of such a presumption to situations preceding the commencement of custodial interrogation.  The court did, however, issue petitioner a COA as to this issue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> an interim rule adopted in 1996 in the wake of the AEDPA's amendments to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b), petitioner then asked this court to grant her a second COA with respect to the Miranda issue.  Noting that other circuits have determined that litigants who have obtained a COA on one or more issues from a district judge may proceed with their appeals of those issues forthwith, we decided to reexamine 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) and requested that petitioner and respondent file supplemental briefs discussing \"whether a petitioner who obtains a[COA] from a district court judge must also obtain one from the court of appeals before the appeal may proceed.\"   We also invited the Federal Defender and the United States Attorney to file amicus briefs on this issue.  In their helpful supplemental and amicus briefs, petitioner, respondent, the Federal Defender, and the United States Attorney all took the view that 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) is inconsistent with the 1996 amendments to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> insofar as the Rule requires litigants in possession of a COA from a district judge to apply for a second certificate from this court.  As a result, petitioner, respondent, and amici join in urging us to revise 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) to dispense with this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A. 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon due consideration of the arguments set forth in the supplemental and amicus briefs, we agree that 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) should be revised to eliminate the requirement that litigants in possession of a COA from a district judge as to one or more issues apply for a second COA with respect to those issues from the court of appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As an initial matter, we observe that every court of appeals that has considered the question has concluded that a district judge may issue a COA.  See, e.g., Tiedeman v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 522 (8th Cir.1997) (listing seven other court of appeals cases, involving appeals of denials of both 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 petitions and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motions, to similar effect);  see also 7th Cir.  R. 22.1(b).  The basis for this unanimous view is well summarized in Judge Carnes' comprehensive opinion in Hunter v. United States, 101 F.3d 1565, 1573-84 (11th Cir.1996) (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1695, 137 L.Ed.2d 822 (1997), and, in the absence of any suggestion that 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) improperly countenances the issuance of a COA by a district judge, we see no reason to reinvent the wheel.  Suffice it to say that we endorse the views expressed in Hunter and explicitly now hold that a district judge has the authority under the AEDPA to issue a COA under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once such authority is recognized, the superfluity of 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c)'s \"second certificate\" requirement becomes apparent.  Though couched in the negative, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) explicitly contemplates the issuance of only one certificate before an appeal to this court may be taken.  See supra note 2 (\"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a [COA], an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from [a final order denying a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 petition or a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion].\")(emphases supplied).  And Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b) even more explicitly recognizes that an appeal may proceed once a litigant has a COA from a district judge.  See id.  (\"In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a [COA] pursuant to section 2253(c) of title 28, United States Code.\")  (emphases supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore rule that a COA from a district judge as to an issue is itself sufficient to permit an appeal of the issue in 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2254 and 2255 proceedings.  In so ruling, we note that the Eleventh Circuit has explicitly reached the same conclusion, see Hunter, 101 F.3d at 1576 n. 9 (requiring a second COA from the court of appeals is \"inconsistent with the plain language\" of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)), and that all other courts of appeals that have touched upon the question have at least implicitly followed suit, see, e.g., 7th Cir.  R. 22.1(b) (permitting an appeal to proceed upon issuance of a COA by a district judge);  Tiedeman, 122 F.3d at 522 (\"Normally, a[COA] granted by a district judge, if regular on its face and not procedurally defective, would mean that the appeal would proceed in this Court in the ordinary course.\");  Houchin v. Zavaras, 107 F.3d 1465, 1469 (10th Cir.1997) (similar);  Else v. Johnson, 104 F.3d 82, 83 (5th Cir.1997) (similar).  Accordingly, pending revision of 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c), litigants in possession of a COA as to an issue from a district judge need not apply to this court for issuance of a second certificate on that issue;  they need only present this court with a copy of the district court order granting a certificate of appealability.  See supra note 1. Upon such presentation, the appeal shall proceed in this court in the ordinary course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits of petitioner's appeal, we detect no error in the district court's denial of her petition.  As previously noted, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined that petitioner's pre-interrogation request to call counsel was \"ambiguous as to purpose\"--i.e., it was ambiguous as to \"whether the [petitioner] wanted advice from counsel regarding how to handle the imminent questioning, or whether the [petitioner] wanted counsel present for interrogation....\"  Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267-68, 665 A.2d 380.   The court also determined that when Officer Folini subsequently \"asked [petitioner] if it was all right to ask some questions about the incident,\" id. at 266, 665 A.2d 380, he was seeking \"to clarify the purpose of her call,\" id. at 268, 665 A.2d 380.   Given these determinations (which petitioner does not challenge), we have some difficulty understanding why the New Hampshire Supreme Court overruled the state trial court's ruling that petitioner did not adequately indicate to the officers that she sought \"the assistance of counsel.\"  Id. at 267, 665 A.2d 380.   After all, the trial court's ruling must, in context, be understood as a determination that petitioner had not actually invoked her right to the assistance of an attorney in dealing with the forthcoming interrogation.   And the New Hampshire Supreme Court's \"ambiguous as to purpose\" ruling would seem to evince agreement, rather than disagreement, with this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the United States Supreme Court has quite clearly held that the rule of Miranda \"applies only when the suspect has expressed his wish for the particular type of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of Miranda.\"  McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original);  see also id.  (defining the type of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of Miranda as \"the right to the assistance of an attorney in dealing with a custodial interrogation by the police \") (emphasis in original).  So too has the Court held that the wish for this type of assistance must be \"unambiguously\" expressed, meaning \"a statement either is ... an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not.\"  Davis, 512 U.S. at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, when a suspect has made a statement that might or might not amount to an expression of a wish for the assistance of counsel during interrogation, the police are within their rights not only to clarify whether the suspect wants an attorney present, see id. at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (observing that such a clarification \"will often be good police practice\"), but also simply to continue the interrogation without asking for clarification, see id. at 461-62, 114 S.Ct. 2350.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined, and the record confirms, that petitioner's intentions were at first unclear;  that Officer Folini asked petitioner to clarify her intentions;  that petitioner unambiguously informed the officers that she intended to cooperate with the investigation;  that the officers read petitioner her Miranda rights;  and that petitioner waived those rights.  In our view, this scenario falls squarely within the rule of Davis.   We therefore see no basis for concluding that the admission into evidence of petitioner's subsequent statements was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1);  see O'Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d 16, 20-25 (1st Cir.1998) (interpreting &#167; 2254(d)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we hold that if a litigant has obtained from a district judge a COA as to one or more issues addressed in the denial of a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 petition or a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion, the litigant need not apply for a second COA from this court as to these issues.  To the extent that 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) imposes such a \"second certificate\" requirement, it should be disregarded.  As to the merits of this appeal, we affirm the district court's denial of petitioner Cindy GrantChase's application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I do not quarrel with the majority's intricate analysis of Miranda, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, I would decide the case on a simpler basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asked and received permission to call her attorney after she arrived at the hospital.

Ten days after the district court file has been received in this court, the clerk will present the record to the court, with or without a separate motion for a certificate of appealability, addressed to that court.  If no sufficient memorandum has been filed by that time, the certificate may be denied without further consideration.

See United States v. Cota-Loaiza, 936 F.Supp. 756, 760-61 (D.Colo.1996).  We decline to adopt this approach for the reasons set forth in Hunter.

But in light of McNeil and, especially, Davis, we have some doubt about the correctness of the New Hampshire Supreme Court's suggestion that, if made during custodial interrogation, even requests for counsel that are truly ambiguous as to purpose give rise, as a matter of law, to an irrebuttable presumption that they are made for the purpose of having counsel present during any further questioning.  See Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267, 665 A.2d 380.

Both the victim and the [petitioner] were transported to the hospital for treatment of their injuries.  Because the [petitioner] was a suspect in the case, Officers Langley and Folini went to the hospital to question the [petitioner], hoping to elicit incriminating statements.  The [petitioner] was under constant police watch and was not free to leave.  Officer Langley was within three to five feet of her while she was in the emergency room.  During that time the [petitioner] asked Officer Langley for her purse and if she could call her lawyer.  Once the hospital staff had completed their testing, the [petitioner] telephoned her lawyer.  During the five- to ten-minute telephone call Officer Langley remained present but could not overhear the substance of the conversation.  After the [petitioner] ended her phone call, Officers Langley and Folini approached her to initiate questioning.  Until this point the police had not subjected the [petitioner] to questioning or its functional equivalent.  Officer Folini asked her if it was all right to ask some questions about the incident.  The [petitioner] told him that she had talked to her attorney, who advised her to cooperate with the investigation.  The officers explained to the [petitioner] her Miranda rights, see Miranda v.

The court then opined that, \"[h]ad the [petitioner] made her request for counsel after Miranda warnings had been given or after interrogation had begun, there would have been an irrebuttable presumption that the [petitioner] asked for the assistance of counsel for the purpose of having counsel present during any further questioning....\"  Id.

The application challenged as clearly unconstitutional the New Hampshire Supreme Court's unwillingness to extend to those in custody and facing imminent interrogation the \"irrebuttable presumption\" the court appears to have inferred from Minnick:  that any \"request for counsel\" made during custodial interrogation (as opposed to just prior to interrogation) is for the purpose of invoking the right to counsel's presence during further questioning.  See Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>.   The district court denied the petition, reasoning that (1) under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), it was prohibited from granting the writ unless the challenged state ruling was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent;  and (2) the United States Supreme Court has never explicitly or implicitly endorsed application of such a presumption to situations preceding the commencement of custodial interrogation.  The court did, however, issue petitioner a COA as to this issue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with 1st Cir.

Noting that other circuits have determined that litigants who have obtained a COA on one or more issues from a district judge may proceed with their appeals of those issues forthwith, we decided to reexamine 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) and requested that petitioner and respondent file supplemental briefs discussing \"whether a petitioner who obtains a[COA] from a district court judge must also obtain one from the court of appeals before the appeal may proceed.\"   We also invited the Federal Defender and the United States Attorney to file amicus briefs on this issue.  In their helpful supplemental and amicus briefs, petitioner, respondent, the Federal Defender, and the United States Attorney all took the view that 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) is inconsistent with the 1996 amendments to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> insofar as the Rule requires litigants in possession of a COA from a district judge to apply for a second certificate from this court.  As a result, petitioner, respondent, and amici join in urging us to revise 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) to dispense with this requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A. 1st Cir.

R. 22.1(c) should be revised to eliminate the requirement that litigants in possession of a COA from a district judge as to one or more issues apply for a second COA with respect to those issues from the court of appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As an initial matter, we observe that every court of appeals that has considered the question has concluded that a district judge may issue a COA.  See, e.g., Tiedeman v. Benson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744813\"><a href=\"/opinion/744813/john-r-tiedeman-v-dennis-benson-warden-state-of-minnesota/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 522 (8th Cir.1997) (listing seven other court of appeals cases, involving appeals of denials of both 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 petitions and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motions, to similar effect);  see also 7th Cir.  R. 22.1(b).  The basis for this unanimous view is well summarized in Judge Carnes' comprehensive opinion in Hunter v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730980\"><a href=\"/opinion/730980/charles-edward-hunter-v-united-states-of-america-henry-c-bailey-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1565</span></a></span>, 1573-84 (11th Cir.1996) (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></span> (1997), and, in the absence of any suggestion that 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c) improperly countenances the issuance of a COA by a district judge, we see no reason to reinvent the wheel.  Suffice it to say that we endorse the views expressed in Hunter and explicitly now hold that a district judge has the authority under the AEDPA to issue a COA under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once such authority is recognized, the superfluity of 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c)'s \"second certificate\" requirement becomes apparent.  Though couched in the negative, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) explicitly contemplates the issuance of only one certificate before an appeal to this court may be taken.  See supra note 2 (\"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a [COA], an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from [a final order denying a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 petition or a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion].\")(emphases supplied).  And Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b) even more explicitly recognizes that an appeal may proceed once a litigant has a COA from a district judge.  See id.  (\"In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a [COA] pursuant to section 2253(c) of title 28, United States Code.\")  (emphases supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore rule that a COA from a district judge as to an issue is itself sufficient to permit an appeal of the issue in 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2254 and 2255 proceedings.  In so ruling, we note that the Eleventh Circuit has explicitly reached the same conclusion, see Hunter, 101 F.3d at 1576 n. 9 (requiring a second COA from the court of appeals is \"inconsistent with the plain language\" of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c) and Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b)), and that all other courts of appeals that have touched upon the question have at least implicitly followed suit, see, e.g., 7th Cir.  R. 22.1(b) (permitting an appeal to proceed upon issuance of a COA by a district judge);  Tiedeman, 122 F.3d at 522 (\"Normally, a[COA] granted by a district judge, if regular on its face and not procedurally defective, would mean that the appeal would proceed in this Court in the ordinary course.\");  Houchin v. Zavaras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736951\"><a href=\"/opinion/736951/william-c-houchin-jr-v-aristedes-w-zavaras-director-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span>, 1469 (10th Cir.1997) (similar);  Else v.

Accordingly, pending revision of 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c), litigants in possession of a COA as to an issue from a district judge need not apply to this court for issuance of a second certificate on that issue;  they need only present this court with a copy of the district court order granting a certificate of appealability.  See supra note 1. Upon such presentation, the appeal shall proceed in this court in the ordinary course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits of petitioner's appeal, we detect no error in the district court's denial of her petition.  As previously noted, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined that petitioner's pre-interrogation request to call counsel was \"ambiguous as to purpose\"--i.e., it was ambiguous as to \"whether the [petitioner] wanted advice from counsel regarding how to handle the imminent questioning, or whether the [petitioner] wanted counsel present for interrogation....\"  Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267-68, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>.   The court also determined that when Officer Folini subsequently \"asked [petitioner] if it was all right to ask some questions about the incident,\" id. at 266, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>, he was seeking \"to clarify the purpose of her call,\" id. at 268, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>.   Given these determinations (which petitioner does not challenge), we have some difficulty understanding why the New Hampshire Supreme Court overruled the state trial court's ruling that petitioner did not adequately indicate to the officers that she sought \"the assistance of counsel.\"  Id. at 267, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>.   After all, the trial court's ruling must, in context, be understood as a determination that petitioner had not actually invoked her right to the assistance of an attorney in dealing with the forthcoming interrogation.   And the New Hampshire Supreme Court's \"ambiguous as to purpose\" ruling would seem to evince agreement, rather than disagreement, with this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the United States Supreme Court has quite clearly held that the rule of Miranda \"applies only when the suspect has expressed his wish for the particular type of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of Miranda.\"  McNeil v.

(defining the type of lawyerly assistance that is the subject of Miranda as \"the right to the assistance of an attorney in dealing with a custodial interrogation by the police \") (emphasis in original).

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2350</span></a></span> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, when a suspect has made a statement that might or might not amount to an expression of a wish for the assistance of counsel during interrogation, the police are within their rights not only to clarify whether the suspect wants an attorney present, see id. at 461, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117863\"><a href=\"/opinion/117863/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In our view, this scenario falls squarely within the rule of Davis.

If such a request is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate.  If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to constitute a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals.  If an appeal is taken by a State or its representative, a certificate of appealability is not required.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We have followed the procedure outlined in Gallagher v. Wilton Enter., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582535\"><a href=\"/opinion/582535/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1251-58-empl-prac-dec-p-41431-carolyn-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 124 n. 4 (1st Cir.1992), and circulated this opinion to all active judges of this court for pre-publication comment on our ruling with respect to 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c).  No judge has raised an objection.  Nonetheless, this remains a panel opinion;  the parties remain free to petition us to rehear and/or to suggest that we rehear en banc any issue (including those pertaining to 1st Cir.  R. 22.1(c)) raised in this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although Fed.  R.App. 22 is captioned \"Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings,\" Fed.  R.App. P. 22(b) mysteriously makes explicit reference only to \"habeas ... proceeding[s] in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court.\"   As a result, at least one court has ruled that district judges have the authority to issue a COA in a 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 proceeding, but not in a &#167; 2255 proceeding.  See United States v. Cota-Loaiza, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span>, 760-61 (D.Colo.1996).  We decline to adopt this approach for the reasons set forth in Hunter.   See 101 F.3d at 1575 n. 8 (rejecting the result in Cota-Loaiza because it requires a court to conclude that 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)'s \"circuit justice or judge\" language means one thing for 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 proceedings but something different for &#167; 2255 proceedings, and because it is inconsistent with the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We recognize that a request to talk to a lawyer made during custodial interrogation is far less likely to be \"ambiguous as to purpose\" than a pre-interrogation request such as that made here.  Thus, as a matter of fact, we concur with the New Hampshire Supreme Court's emphasis on the difference between requests for counsel made during interrogation and requests for counsel made prior to interrogation.  But in light of McNeil and, especially, Davis, we have some doubt about the correctness of the New Hampshire Supreme Court's suggestion that, if made during custodial interrogation, even requests for counsel that are truly ambiguous as to purpose give rise, as a matter of law, to an irrebuttable presumption that they are made for the purpose of having counsel present during any further questioning.  See Grant-Chase, 140 N.H. at 267, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></span>.   As we read McNeil and Davis, the police may always seek to clarify a suspect's intentions when faced with a truly ambiguous assertion</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
