Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    Carlos J. Martínez for appellant.\n\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and James H.\nLeavey, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        November 1, 2000\n\f-2-\n\f            BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.    This case returns to us\n\nafter a remand to the district court for further consideration\n\nof the sentencing ramifications of defendant-appellant Jesús\n\nDiPina’s juvenile criminal dispositions.          See United States v.\n\nDiPina, 178 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 1999).        On remand, the district\n\ncourt determined that DiPina's admission of sufficient facts on\n\njuvenile heroin charges should count toward his criminal history\n\nunder the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and that he was\n\ntherefore    ineligible   for    the    “safety    valve”   provision.\n\nAccordingly, the court reimposed its previous sentence.             We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            On November 22, 1994, DiPina pled guilty to possession\n\nwith intent to distribute more than one hundred grams of heroin\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) (1994).           He\n\nentered a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to\n\nthe charge in exchange for the government's promise to recommend\n\nthat the district court impose the shortest term of imprisonment\n\nunder the sentencing guidelines.        The government also promised\n\nto recommend that DiPina receive the benefits of the \"safety\n\nvalve\" provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1 (1997),\n\nwhich would exempt him from the mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nfive years' imprisonment.       The safety valve would only apply,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhowever, if DiPina did not have more than one criminal history\n\npoint.\n\n              The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) prepared by\n\nthe Probation Department described DiPina's criminal record as\n\nincluding three juvenile dispositions, all in the Rhode Island\n\nFamily   Court:    (1)     tampering    with   a   motor    vehicle,   \"Admits\n\nSufficient Facts, one year probation, special condition fifty-\n\npercent restitution\"; (2) resisting arrest, \"Nolo, 16 months\n\nprobation\";      and   (3)    unlawful      delivery   of    heroin,   \"Admits\n\nSufficient Facts, eighteen months Rhode Island Training School.\"\n\nThe district court counted each of these dispositions as a\n\n\"prior sentence\" under the sentencing guidelines.                 See U.S.S.G.\n\n§§ 4A1.2(a)(1), (d)(2).            Accordingly, it found that DiPina had\n\nfour criminal history points, placing him in criminal history\n\ncategory III.      DiPina therefore was ineligible for the safety\n\nvalve provision.       On February 13, 1995, he was sentenced to the\n\nstatutory minimum of five years in prison.                  See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).\n\n              After some intermediate litigation not relevant to the\n\npresent case, DiPina appealed, contending that the district\n\ncourt erred in determining his criminal history category.                     He\n\nargued that two of his three prior juvenile dispositions -- for\n\nthe   motor      vehicle     and   heroin    offenses,     both   carrying   the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fnotation \"admits sufficient facts\" -- should not count toward\n\nhis   criminal   history.1    If   those   two   dispositions   were\n\ndisregarded, DiPina's criminal history would be in category I\n\ninstead of category III, and he would be eligible for the safety\n\nvalve.    On January 29, 1999, while the appeal was pending,\n\nDiPina completed his prison term and began serving his five-year\n\nterm of supervised release.\n\n          On May 27, 1999, this court held that DiPina's appeal\n\nraised issues that depended on \"certain factual determinations\n\nand the record is not clear enough as to these issues for us to\n\nresolve the dispute.\"    See DiPina, 178 F.3d at 78.     We vacated\n\nDiPina's sentence and remanded for further proceedings, stating:\n\n          [O]n remand, the district court must first\n          determine whether DiPina's prior juvenile\n          dispositions constituted diversions, such\n          that subsection 4A1.2(f) applies.     If so,\n          because Family Court is the juvenile court\n          in Rhode Island, these dispositions cannot\n          be counted toward DiPina's criminal history.\n\n              If, on the other hand, DiPina's prior\n          juvenile dispositions were not diversionary\n          dispositions, then the district court must\n          determine whether his admitting sufficient\n          facts in Rhode Island Family Court was\n\n\n      1\n     At the original sentencing, DiPina did not dispute that the\ncharge of resisting arrest counted toward his criminal history.\nAs discussed infra, he now contends that the PSR was erroneous\nin stating that he pled nolo contendere to the resisting arrest\ncharge.    Rather, DiPina says, the transcript from that\ndisposition indicates that he admitted sufficient facts, just as\nin the other two dispositions at issue.\n\n                               -5-\n\f           tantamount to a plea of guilty or nolo under\n           U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1). . . If DiPina's\n           prior   juvenile   dispositions   were   not\n           tantamount to a plea of guilty or nolo, then\n           they may not be counted toward his criminal\n           history.\n\nId. at 78.\n\n           On remand, the district court limited its consideration\n\nto only one of DiPina's juvenile dispositions:         his admission of\n\nsufficient facts as to the unlawful delivery of heroin charges,\n\nwhich had resulted in an eighteen-month sentence at the Rhode\n\nIsland Training School (RITS).           The government introduced the\n\nfollowing evidence:      On July 15, 1992, the state of Rhode Island\n\nfiled four charges against DiPina based on allegations that he\n\ndelivered heroin to an undercover officer in violation of R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(2)(a).2         Based on the state's allegation\n\nthat DiPina was a danger to the community, he was remanded to\n\nthe custody of RITS.          DiPina waived his right to a probable\n\ncause hearing.\n\n           On   August   7,    1992,   DiPina,   DiPina's   lawyer,   and\n\nDiPina's mother signed the first page of a two-page document\n\nentitled \"Request for Admission of Specific Facts or Admission\"\n\n(\"RFA\").     The first page of the RFA described the \"offense(s)\"\n\n\n\n    2R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(2)(a) makes it a crime \"for any\nperson to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to\nmanufacture or deliver a controlled substance.\"\n\n                                   -6-\n\fas \"Ct-1 - Ct-4 unlawful delivery.\"                 As to those offenses,\n\nDiPina affirmed that he was \"request[ing] Court permission to\n\nwithdraw [his] denial and to enter an ADMISSION TO SUFFICIENT\n\nFACTS OR ADMISSION.\"         DiPina also stated:\n\n           I   understand   that   the   ADMISSION   OF\n           SUFFICIENT FACTS is for all purposes the\n           same as an ADMISSION and that I will be\n           admitting sufficient facts to substantiate\n           the offense(s) which [have] been brought\n           against me in the cases to which these pleas\n           relate.\n\n           In the RFA, DiPina affirmed that by changing his plea\n\nhe would be \"giving up and waiving\" seven enumerated rights: (1)\n\nthe right to a judge trial and to an appeal of any finding of\n\ndelinquency or waywardness; (2) the right to insist that the\n\nstate offer evidence proving the elements of the offenses beyond\n\na reasonable doubt; (3) the presumption of innocence; (4) the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination; (5) the right to confront\n\nand cross-examine the witnesses against him; (6) the right to\n\npresent evidence and witnesses on his own behalf and to testify\n\non his own behalf; and (7) the right to appeal the sentence\n\nimposed   by   the   court    after   the   entry    of   his   admission   of\n\nsufficient facts.       He also affirmed that he had received no\n\npromises other than that the court would impose a sentence of\n\neighteen months in RITS, effective July 14, 1992, and that other\n\npending         charges           would        be         dismissed.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f              Finally, DiPina affirmed that:        (1) he understood that\n\nthe   court    could   \"keep   jurisdiction\"       over   him   until   he   was\n\ntwenty-one years old; (2) he understood that absent the court's\n\npermission, he would not be allowed to withdraw his plea after\n\nthe disposition was imposed; (3) he had discussed the RFA with\n\nhis attorney, who had explained the RFA to him; (4) he had \"no\n\nquestions\" concerning the meaning of the RFA and understood the\n\nRFA   \"completely\";     and    (5)   he    swore    to    the   truth   of   all\n\nstatements in the RFA.\n\n              DiPina's RFA was presented to the Rhode Island Family\n\nCourt on August 7, 1992.       DiPina's counsel confirmed that he had\n\nadvised DiPina of the rights he would be waiving, and summarized\n\nthe rights discussed in the RFA.           The prosecutor stated that the\n\nstate was prepared to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nDiPina \"did deliver unlawfully heroin to an undercover officer\n\nfrom the Providence Police on July 1st, July 7th, July 8th and\n\nJuly 14th of this year.\"\n\n              The family court then addressed DiPina personally and\n\nestablished, inter alia, that DiPina:              (1) was seventeen years\n\nold; (2) had entered an earlier plea before the court; (3) had\n\nbeen detained at RITS since July 14, 1992; (4) had not recently\n\nused drugs or alcohol; and (5) understood \"each and every one of\n\nthe rights\" he was giving up.               In response to the court's\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fquestions, DiPina admitted that on July 1, 1992, at 1:25 p.m.,\n\nhe sold heroin to a man on Comstock Street in Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland.   DiPina further admitted that he sold heroin to the same\n\nman on July 7th, 8th and 14th in 1992.              DiPina stated that each\n\nsale was for a different amount of heroin, but that he could not\n\nrecall the exact amounts of heroin that he sold.\n\n           At the conclusion of the hearing, the family court\n\npronounced the following judgment and sentence:\n\n           I'll accept an admission of sufficient facts\n           for a finding that [DiPina] is delinquent on\n           all four petitions.   [DiPina] is committed\n           to the Training School for 18 months.\n\nIn written orders of the same date, the court stated that DiPina\n\nhad been advised of his rights, had waived those rights, and had\n\n\"admit[ted]    sufficient         facts    and      submit[ted]         to   court\n\njurisdiction.\"          The court entered a finding that DiPina was\n\n\"delinquent\"      and    committed   him   to    the   custody    of    RITS     for\n\neighteen months.\n\n           Also     on    that    date,    the    family     court      signed     a\n\n\"Certificate of Judge\" on the second page of the RFA.                        There,\n\nthe court certified that the parties had provided the court with\n\nthe RFA and that the court had established at the hearing that\n\nDiPina    understood       the   rights    listed      in   the   RFA    and     the\n\nconsequences of his plea.         The court further certified:               (1) \"I\n\nhave also been satisfied by the prosecutor's statement of the\n\n                                     -9-\n\ffacts, [DiPina's] answers and the content of the [RFA], that\n\nthere is a factual basis for [DiPina's] plea\"; and (2) \"I find\n\nthat this plea is made voluntarily, intelligently and with\n\nknowledge and understanding of all matters set forth in the\n\nattached [RFA].\"\n\n             In determining whether this family court disposition\n\nshould be counted in DiPina's criminal history, the district\n\ncourt first focused on the second question posed by the remand\n\norder: whether the disposition was tantamount to a guilty or\n\nnolo contendere plea.        The court stated that DiPina \"clearly\n\nadmitted guilt of four sales of heroin to an undercover agent at\n\nfour different times,\" and hence had essentially entered a\n\nguilty plea.\n\n             The district court then addressed the first question\n\nposed by the remand order: whether the heroin disposition was\n\ndiversionary within the meaning of § 4A1.2(f).             It noted that\n\nthe state court had sentenced DiPina not to a treatment center,\n\nhospital or school, but to eighteen months at RITS, which it\n\nfound   to   be   a   \"juvenile   prison\"   in   which   males   who   have\n\ncommitted serious crimes can be incarcerated until age twenty-\n\none.    The district court concluded that the heroin disposition\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f\"was       certainly    not   a   diversion     from    the   criminal    justice\n\nsystem.\"3\n\n              Accordingly, the district court resentenced DiPina to\n\nsixty months’ imprisonment and five years’ supervised release,\n\nthe same sentence that it had previously imposed.                    The court\n\nnoted that DiPina had served the prison term, but that his term\n\nof   supervised        release    was   still   in     effect. 4   This    appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              We begin with the text of the relevant sentencing\n\nguidelines.       Sections 4A1.1(a)-(c) of the guidelines, titled\n\n\"Criminal History Category,\" read in pertinent part:\n\n\n       3\n     The district court employed the following definition of\ndiversionary disposition:\n\n              A diversion is when there is a disposition\n              that takes the particular defendant out of\n              the criminal justice system as where someone\n              is sent, for example, to a treatment center\n              instead of incarcerating them, where someone\n              is sent to a hospital, or where, in the case\n              of a juvenile, may be sent to a special\n              school of some sort.\n       4\n     At oral argument, DiPina stated that the district court had\nimposed the term of supervised release to run anew from the date\nof resentencing, rather than giving him credit for supervised\nrelease already served.    The transcript of the resentencing,\nhowever, does not support this contention; rather, it indicates\nthat the court simply reimposed the previous sentence, while\nacknowledging that DiPina had already served some of it. DiPina\nhas not pointed to any other evidence (i.e. documentation from\nthe Probation Department) that he has been doubly sentenced.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f         The total points from items (a) through (f)\n         determine the criminal history category in\n         the Sentencing Table in Chapter Five, Part\n         A.\n            (a) Add 3 points for each prior sentence\n         of imprisonment exceeding one year and one\n         month.\n            (b) Add 2 points for each prior sentence\n         of imprisonment of at least sixty days not\n         counted in (a).\n            (c) Add 1 point for each prior sentence\n         not counted in (a) or (b), up to a total of\n         4 points for this item.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, offenses committed prior to age\n\neighteen are counted under § 4A1.1.       See id., cmt. n.2 (citing\n\n§ 4A1.2(d)).   As to those offenses, § 4A1.2(d)(2) instructs the\n\nsentencing court to\n\n           (A) add 2 points under § 4A1.1(b) for each\n         adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of\n         at least sixty days if the defendant was\n         released from such confinement within five\n         years of his commencement of the instant\n         offense; [and]\n           (B) add 1 point under § 4A1.1(c) for each\n         adult or juvenile sentence imposed within\n         five years of the defendant's commencement\n         of the instant offense not covered in (A).\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2).\n\n         Section   4A1.1   refers    us   to   §   4A1.2(a)   for   the\n\ndefinition of the term \"prior sentence\":\n\n         (a) Prior Sentence Defined\n         (1) The term \"prior sentence\" means any\n         sentence     previously     imposed     upon\n         adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty\n         plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for\n         conduct not part of the instant offense.\n\n\n                              -12-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1).         Certain prior sentences, however, \"are\n\nnot counted or are counted only under certain conditions.\"                        §\n\n4A1.1,    cmt.    n.3.     Of   relevance          here   is   the   \"diversionary\n\ndisposition,\" which \"is counted only where there is a finding or\n\nadmission    of    guilt   in       a    judicial    proceeding.\"         Id.   The\n\ncommentary references \"Diversionary Dispositions,\" § 4A1.2(f),\n\nwhich provides:\n\n            Diversion from the judicial process without\n            a   finding   of   guilt   (e.g.,   deferred\n            prosecution) is not counted. A diversionary\n            disposition resulting from a finding or\n            admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo\n            contendere, in a judicial proceeding is\n            counted as a sentence under § 4A1.1(c) even\n            if a conviction is not formally entered,\n            except that diversion from juvenile court is\n            not counted.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f) (emphasis added).\n\n                                          III.\n\n            In    reviewing     a       sentence    under   the   guidelines,    we\n\ndetermine the applicability of each guideline to a particular\n\ncase de novo.      See United States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 575 (1st\n\nCir.     1996).      We    review          the     district     court's     factual\n\ndeterminations for clear error, giving \"due deference to the\n\ndistrict court’s application of the guidelines to the facts.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            On appeal, DiPina asserts several points:                       (1) the\n\ncourt erroneously concluded that his juvenile dispositions were\n\n                                          -13-\n\fnot diversionary within the meaning of § 4A1.2(f); (2) the court\n\nerroneously determined that his admission of sufficient facts in\n\nRhode Island Family Court was tantamount to a guilty plea; (3)\n\nthe court violated Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 at the resentencing; (4)\n\nthe   court   incorrectly       calculated   DiPina's     criminal      history\n\nscore; and (5) the judge was biased.\n\n                A.   \"Diversionary disposition\"\n\n          First,     DiPina      contends    that   his      juvenile     court\n\nproceedings were diversionary dispositions within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f).      In our earlier decision in this case, we\n\nnoted:\n\n          [T]he guidelines do not specifically define\n          what   they   mean   by   a   \"diversionary\n          disposition,\" nor did the drafters make it\n          particularly clear what they intended to\n          mean by that term. They offer one, and only\n          one, example -- a \"deferred prosecution\" --\n          which is certainly not exhaustive.\n\nDiPina, 178 F.3d at 78 (citing § 4A1.2(f)).           Although this court\n\nhas not assembled a comprehensive definition of a diversionary\n\ndisposition, our cases provide some examples.                In United States\n\nv. Morillo, 178 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1999), we held that a\n\n\"continuance    without     a    finding,\"    based     on    a   defendant's\n\nadmission of facts sufficient for a guilty finding on charges of\n\nviolating a domestic violence restraining order and threatening\n\nto commit a crime, was diversionary within the meaning of the\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fguidelines.      See also United States v. Nicholas, 133 F.3d 133,\n\n133-35 (1st Cir. 1998).         We also affirmed the application of the\n\ndiversionary disposition label to an \"'adjudication withheld'\n\nbattery conviction.\"           See United States v. Cadavid, 192 F.3d\n\n230,    235    (1st     Cir.   1999).      In        these    cases,   either      the\n\nadjudication or the sentence was deferred in some way; in none\n\ndid the court         immediately impose a sentence of imprisonment.\n\n              This is consistent with case law from other circuits.\n\nIn United States v. Shazier, 179 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.\n\n1999),    the    Eleventh      Circuit    concluded          that   there    was     no\n\ndiversionary      disposition     where        the    defendant     had     served    a\n\nsix-month prison term:          \"Although not specifically defined, it\n\nis clear that [§ 4A1.2(f)] does not apply to sentences where\n\nconfinement is imposed and served.\"                   Id.    In United States v.\n\nCrawford, 83 F.3d 964, 966 (8th Cir. 1996), the Eighth Circuit\n\nrejected the defendant’s contention that his juvenile sentence\n\nfor    assault   constituted      a   diversionary           disposition,     on   the\n\nground that he \"had completed [his] probation and community\n\nservice, and thus discharged the sentence imposed.\"                       Id.\n\n              Without    adopting       wholesale       the     district     court's\n\ndefinition of “diversionary,” see note 3, supra, we conclude\n\nthat there was no error in the determination that the heroin\n\ndisposition was not diversionary.               There was no deferral in the\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fprosecution, adjudication, or sentencing on DiPina's heroin\n\ncharges and DiPina was sentenced to imprisonment.                   The family\n\ncourt   entered     a   finding    that    DiPina    was    \"delinquent\"     and\n\nimmediately sentenced him to an eighteen-month term in the\n\ncustody of RITS, of which at least seven months were actually\n\nserved.       RITS, the district court found, was a prison in which\n\nserious juvenile offenders were incarcerated.               Cf. United States\n\nv. Unger, 915 F.2d 759, 763 (1st Cir. 1990) (assuming that a\n\nRITS sentence constituted \"imprisonment\").                  This disposition\n\ndoes not, therefore, resemble cases in which courts have found\n\ndiversion within the meaning of § 4A1.2(f) on the ground that\n\nthe adjudication was somehow withheld, stayed, or deferred.                  See\n\nMorillo, 178 F.3d at 20; see also United States v. Amster, 193\n\nF.3d 779, 779-80 (3d Cir. 1999) (diversionary disposition where\n\ndefendant pled nolo contendere, \"adjudication was withheld,\" and\n\ncase    was    dismissed   after    defendant       complied    with   certain\n\nconditions); United States v. Bagheri, 999 F.2d 80, 82-83 (4th\n\nCir.    1993)     (diversionary    disposition       where     court   imposed\n\n\"probation      without    entry   of     judgment\");      United   States    v.\n\nRockman, 993 F.2d 811, 812-14 (11th Cir. 1993) (diversionary\n\ndisposition where defendant pled nolo contendere and \"the state\n\ncourt withheld adjudication of guilt\"); United States v. Frank,\n\n932 F.2d 700, 701 (8th Cir. 1991) (diversionary disposition\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fwhere defendant pled guilty and \"the state court stayed the\n\nadjudication\" and imposed probation).\n\n              DiPina argues that he was found \"delinquent\" in the\n\nheroin disposition, which is not the same as finding that he\n\ncommitted the crime.5              Assuming this is true, it does not lead\n\nto    the     conclusion        that    dispositions     involving           delinquency\n\nfindings       are    necessarily        diversionary.            Rhode      Island      has\n\nspecific provisions for the diversion of juvenile offenders,\n\nwhich apparently were not applied to DiPina's case.                           R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws § 42-72-33(a) describes a \"youth diversion program\" that\n\napplies to certain first-time offenders between the ages of nine\n\nand    seventeen         \"who    may   be   the    subject   of     a     family     court\n\npetition.\"           Under      this   statute,    \"[r]eferrals         to    the    youth\n\ndiversionary program shall be served for a maximum of ninety\n\n(90)       days\"   and    certain      services     shall    be    rendered         to   the\n\noffenders.         Id.; see also R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-32(4).                            The\n\nexistence of these provisions suggests that Rhode Island does\n\n\n\n       5\n     Rhode Island defines \"delinquent\" as \"any child -- who has\ncommitted any offense which, if committed by an adult, would\nconstitute a felony . . .\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-3(5). It is\ntrue that Rhode Island law distinguishes between a finding of\njuvenile delinquency and a criminal conviction.      See In re\nBernard H., 557 A.2d 864, 867 (R.I. 1989); In re John D., 479\nA.2d 1173, 1176 (R.I. 1984).      For purposes of calculating\ncriminal history, however, the sentencing guidelines are\nconcerned not with prior convictions, but with \"prior\nsentences.\" See U.S.S.G. §§ 4A1.1, 4A1.2(a).\n\n                                            -17-\n\fnot    regard    an    adjudication          of      delinquency        resulting     in\n\nincarceration in RITS as diversionary.\n\n             More importantly, it is federal law, not Rhode Island\n\nlaw,    that    controls       the       analysis       of    whether     the    heroin\n\ndisposition was diversionary.                See Unger, 915 F.2d at 762-63.\n\nAccordingly,     we    focus        on    the     substantive      import       of   the\n\ndisposition, not the state-law terminology describing it.                            See\n\nid.; see also United States v. Kirby, 893 F.2d 867, 868 (6th\n\nCir. 1990) (fact that defendant had been adjudicated delinquent\n\nas a minor could be considered in determining his criminal\n\nhistory     category    under        sentencing        guidelines,       even    though\n\nadjudication of delinquency by a juvenile court could not be\n\ndeemed a conviction under state law).                   As discussed supra, there\n\nwas    no   deferral    or    diversion         of     DiPina’s   adjudication        or\n\nsentencing on the heroin charges; the finding of delinquency\n\ndoes not change the result.\n\n             DiPina    also    contends         that    the   judge     erred   in   not\n\nconsidering     whether       his    other      juvenile      dispositions       –   for\n\ndisorderly conduct and tampering with a motor vehicle – were\n\ndiversionary.     Such analysis was not necessary, however, as the\n\nheroin disposition alone raised his criminal history points to\n\na level at which the safety valve provision was unavailable.\n\nSee DiPina, 178 F.3d at 75 (\"it would appear that counting one\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fsuch prior disposition would be enough to produce the criminal\n\nhistory level required to sustain DiPina's sentence in the\n\npresent case, regardless of how the other prior disposition is\n\ntreated\").\n\n                    B.    Tantamount to guilty plea\n\n           Second,         DiPina     challenges        the    district      court’s\n\nconclusion that his admission of sufficient facts in the heroin\n\ndisposition was tantamount to a guilty plea.                         In our earlier\n\nopinion, we said that in order to so conclude, \"the court must\n\nhave found that the defendant has confessed to certain events or\n\nthat other evidence proves such events, and that the events\n\nconstituted     a    crime.\"         DiPina,     178    F.3d    at     75   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).            Specifically, we recommended that the\n\ndistrict court examine factors such as whether the prosecutor\n\nrecited what the state would prove if the case were to proceed\n\nto   trial;    whether      the     defendant    accepted       the    prosecutor's\n\nversion   of   the       events;    and   whether      the    family    court   judge\n\ndetermined that the admitted facts, if proved, would constitute\n\nan offense.      Id. at 74.          If these factors were present, the\n\nadmission of sufficient facts would likely be tantamount to a\n\nguilty or nolo plea.         If, on the other hand, \"the prosecutor and\n\nthe defendant or his counsel . . . [did] little more than tell\n\nthe judge that the parties have agreed to dispose of the matter\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fby a continuance, admission to sufficient facts, and a treatment\n\nprogram” it would not appear that the defendant had admitted to\n\na crime.     Id.\n\n             The    record     permits     no    conclusion   other   than   that\n\nDiPina’s admission of sufficient facts on the heroin charges,\n\ngiven what transpired at the hearing, effectively constituted a\n\nconfession to events that constituted a crime.                   See id. at 75.\n\nDuring the family court hearing, the prosecutor recited what the\n\nstate would prove if the matter were to proceed to trial: that\n\nDiPina \"did deliver unlawfully heroin to an undercover officer\n\nfrom the Providence Police on July 1st, July 7th, July 8th and\n\nJuly    14th       of    [1992].\"         DiPina     expressly    and    without\n\nqualification admitted those facts.               Furthermore, he affirmed in\n\nthe    RFA   that       he   would   be   \"admitting    sufficient      facts   to\n\nsubstantiate the offense(s) which [have] been brought against me\n\nin the cases to which these pleas relate.\"                Finally, the family\n\ncourt determined that DiPina's conduct constituted an offense\n\nunder Rhode Island law, R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(2)(a).\n\nHence, we conclude that the district court correctly determined\n\nthat the heroin disposition was equivalent to a guilty plea for\n\nsentencing purposes.           We do not hold that a simple \"admission to\n\nsufficient facts\" is automatically enough in the absence of\n\nsafeguards such as occurred here.\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\f            DiPina complains that the family court failed to inform\n\nhim of all of the rights enumerated in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.\n\nNowhere in our earlier opinion, however, did we suggest that\n\ncompliance with Rule 11 is a prerequisite to determining that an\n\nadmission of sufficient facts is tantamount to a guilty or nolo\n\ncontendere plea, and DiPina cites no authority to support his\n\nposition.    We have, in fact, previously stated that any sequence\n\nthat   gives     \"reasonable     assurance     that    the   defendant   had\n\nconfessed to certain events and that the events constituted a\n\ncrime . . . would make the admission effectively an admission of\n\nguilt under the guidelines.\"         United States v. Roberts, 39 F.3d\n\n10, 13 (1st Cir. 1994).         As it happens, the record supports the\n\nconclusion that the family court substantially complied with\n\nRule   11   in   the   heroin   disposition.     The    court   effectively\n\ninformed DiPina of the nature of the charges against him; the\n\nmaximum possible penalty; his right to contest the charges and\n\nchoose to proceed to trial; his right to assistance of counsel;\n\nhis right against compelled self-incrimination; that by entering\n\nthe plea he was waiving his right to trial; and that he was\n\nwaiving his right to appeal.           See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c).\n\nMoreover, the family court addressed DiPina and ascertained that\n\nhe understood the rights he was giving up, that the plea was\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fentered voluntarily and was based on sufficient facts.             See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 11(d).\n\n              C.    Fed. R. Crim. P. 32\n\n              DiPina contends that the district court violated Fed.\n\nR.    Crim.    P.   32   in   not   providing   him   an   opportunity   for\n\nallocution before reimposing the sentence.            This court has held,\n\nhowever, that Rule 32 does not require that opportunity where\n\nthe court merely reimposes a sentence identical to one imposed\n\nbefore, as long as the rationale for the sentence is the same.\n\nSee United States v. Garafano, 61 F.3d 113, 116-17 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).     Here, the district court’s rationale was identical to\n\nthat of the original sentence: that DiPina was ineligible for\n\nthe safety valve provision due to a juvenile disposition that\n\nincreased his criminal history points above one.\n\n              DiPina also asserts that the court erred in failing to\n\nverify whether DiPina and his counsel read and discussed the PSR\n\nand in failing to determine whether they had any objections to\n\nit.    Nothing in the record indicates, however, that a new PSR\n\nwas issued prior to the resentencing.            See id. at 117.    Hence,\n\nthe court was under no obligation to revisit the issue.6            See id.\n\n\n       6\n     To the extent that DiPina additionally argues that the\ncourt erred in failing to inform him of his right to appeal at\nthe resentencing, his timely appeal makes clear that any such\nerror was harmless. See Pequero v. United States, 526 U.S. 23,\n24 (1999).\n\n                                      -22-\n\f            D.   Calculation error\n\n            DiPina contends that the court incorrectly calculated\n\nhis criminal history points at resentencing.          He argues that the\n\nPSR erroneously stated that he had pled nolo contendere to the\n\nresisting    arrest     charge,   while   in   fact   he   had   admitted\n\nsufficient facts.7       Therefore, he contends, this disposition\n\nshould not yield any criminal history points.\n\n            At his original sentencing, DiPina did not dispute that\n\nthe charge of resisting arrest counted toward his criminal\n\nhistory.     Even assuming arguendo that DiPina may raise this\n\nissue now, it cannot change the outcome.        The heroin disposition\n\nalone raises DiPina's criminal history points to two.               As we\n\nhave said, having more than one point makes him ineligible for\n\nthe safety valve.       Hence, we need not consider any of DiPina's\n\nother juvenile dispositions.\n\n            E.   Bias\n\n            DiPina contends that the district judge exhibited bias\n\nagainst him based on his remarks at the resentencing.            The judge\n\ntwice characterized DiPina's legal arguments as \"worthless,\" and\n\ncommented on his criminal conduct.8        DiPina also complains that\n\n\n    7He contends, moreover, that the charge was of disorderly\nconduct, not resisting arrest.\n    8The judge's comments included the following:\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fbias was evidenced by the court's reliance on Unger despite our\n\nstatement that Unger did not control this case; its failure to\n\nmake the necessary findings of fact and rulings of law upon\n\nremand; and its failure to comply with Rule 32.\n\n         It is unclear whether DiPina is seeking the recusal of\n\nthe district judge and reversal of the resentencing, or whether\n\nhe is simply requesting that any additional proceedings be\n\nprospectively assigned to a different judge.   It does not appear\n\nthat DiPina moved below for the judge's recusal or otherwise\n\nraised the issue of bias, and we therefore consider it waived.\n\nSee In re Abijoe Realty Corp., 943 F.2d 121, 127 (1st Cir.\n\n1991); United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 294 n.11 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).   Moreover, because we do not remand for any further\n\n\n\n    In fact the defendant was at one time sent to a\n    special school in Narragansett, but he didn't learn\n    anything from that, and he became a juvenile heroin\n    dealer, just about as bad as you can be in the drug\n    field. The worst of all drugs. The most addictive of\n    all drugs.    And he graduated.      He graduated to\n    becoming an adult heroin dealer.\n                            * * * *\n    I suppose technically his supervised release was not\n    in effect, but it certainly is going to be in effect\n    as of now, and if he's charged with another drug\n    offense, he'll be a violator, and we'll deal with him.\n                            * * * *\n    The defendant is on his way to doing life on the\n    installment plan.    He's going to be in and out of\n    prison most of the rest of his life because he is a\n    habitual offender. He's a drug dealer, and he hasn't\n    changed, apparently.\n\n                             -24-\n\fproceedings, we need not consider assigning the matter to a\n\ndifferent judge in the future.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -25-\n\f",

This case returns to us\n\nafter a remand to the district court for further consideration\n\nof the sentencing ramifications of defendant-appellant Jesús\n\nDiPina’s juvenile criminal dispositions.          See United States v.\n\nDiPina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764365\"><a href=\"/opinion/764365/no-98-2142/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1999).        On remand, the district\n\ncourt determined that DiPina's admission of sufficient facts on\n\njuvenile heroin charges should count toward his criminal history\n\nunder the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and that he was\n\ntherefore    ineligible   for    the    “safety    valve”   provision.\n\nAccordingly, the court reimposed its previous sentence.             We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            On November 22, 1994, DiPina pled guilty to possession\n\nwith intent to distribute more than one hundred grams of heroin\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) (1994).           He\n\nentered a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to\n\nthe charge in exchange for the government's promise to recommend\n\nthat the district court impose the shortest term of imprisonment\n\nunder the sentencing guidelines.        The government also promised\n\nto recommend that DiPina receive the benefits of the \"safety\n\nvalve\" provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1 (1997),\n\nwhich would exempt him from the mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nfive years' imprisonment.       The safety valve would only apply,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhowever, if DiPina did not have more than one criminal history\n\npoint.\n\n              The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) prepared by\n\nthe Probation Department described DiPina's criminal record as\n\nincluding three juvenile dispositions, all in the Rhode Island\n\nFamily   Court:    (1)     tampering    with   a   motor    vehicle,   \"Admits\n\nSufficient Facts, one year probation, special condition fifty-\n\npercent restitution\"; (2) resisting arrest, \"Nolo, 16 months\n\nprobation\";      and   (3)    unlawful      delivery   of    heroin,   \"Admits\n\nSufficient Facts, eighteen months Rhode Island Training School.\"\n\nThe district court counted each of these dispositions as a\n\n\"prior sentence\" under the sentencing guidelines.                 See U.S.S.G.\n\n§§ 4A1.2(a)(1), (d)(2).            Accordingly, it found that DiPina had\n\nfour criminal history points, placing him in criminal history\n\ncategory III.      DiPina therefore was ineligible for the safety\n\nvalve provision.       On February 13, 1995, he was sentenced to the\n\nstatutory minimum of five years in prison.                  See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).\n\n              After some intermediate litigation not relevant to the\n\npresent case, DiPina appealed, contending that the district\n\ncourt erred in determining his criminal history category.                     He\n\nargued that two of his three prior juvenile dispositions -- for\n\nthe   motor      vehicle     and   heroin    offenses,     both   carrying   the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fnotation \"admits sufficient facts\" -- should not count toward\n\nhis   criminal   history.1    If   those   two   dispositions   were\n\ndisregarded, DiPina's criminal history would be in category I\n\ninstead of category III, and he would be eligible for the safety\n\nvalve.    On January 29, 1999, while the appeal was pending,\n\nDiPina completed his prison term and began serving his five-year\n\nterm of supervised release.\n\n          On May 27, 1999, this court held that DiPina's appeal\n\nraised issues that depended on \"certain factual determinations\n\nand the record is not clear enough as to these issues for us to\n\nresolve the dispute.\"    See DiPina, 178 F.3d at 78.     We vacated\n\nDiPina's sentence and remanded for further proceedings, stating:\n\n          [O]n remand, the district court must first\n          determine whether DiPina's prior juvenile\n          dispositions constituted diversions, such\n          that subsection 4A1.2(f) applies.     If so,\n          because Family Court is the juvenile court\n          in Rhode Island, these dispositions cannot\n          be counted toward DiPina's criminal history.\n\n              If, on the other hand, DiPina's prior\n          juvenile dispositions were not diversionary\n          dispositions, then the district court must\n          determine whether his admitting sufficient\n          facts in Rhode Island Family Court was\n\n\n      1\n     At the original sentencing, DiPina did not dispute that the\ncharge of resisting arrest counted toward his criminal history.\nAs discussed infra, he now contends that the PSR was erroneous\nin stating that he pled nolo contendere to the resisting arrest\ncharge.    Rather, DiPina says, the transcript from that\ndisposition indicates that he admitted sufficient facts, just as\nin the other two dispositions at issue.\n\n                               -5-\n\f           tantamount to a plea of guilty or nolo under\n           U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1). . . If DiPina's\n           prior   juvenile   dispositions   were   not\n           tantamount to a plea of guilty or nolo, then\n           they may not be counted toward his criminal\n           history.\n\nId. at 78.\n\n           On remand, the district court limited its consideration\n\nto only one of DiPina's juvenile dispositions:         his admission of\n\nsufficient facts as to the unlawful delivery of heroin charges,\n\nwhich had resulted in an eighteen-month sentence at the Rhode\n\nIsland Training School (RITS).           The government introduced the\n\nfollowing evidence:      On July 15, 1992, the state of Rhode Island\n\nfiled four charges against DiPina based on allegations that he\n\ndelivered heroin to an undercover officer in violation of R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(2)(a).2         Based on the state's allegation\n\nthat DiPina was a danger to the community, he was remanded to\n\nthe custody of RITS.          DiPina waived his right to a probable\n\ncause hearing.\n\n           On   August   7,    1992,   DiPina,   DiPina's   lawyer,   and\n\nDiPina's mother signed the first page of a two-page document\n\nentitled \"Request for Admission of Specific Facts or Admission\"\n\n(\"RFA\").     The first page of the RFA described the \"offense(s)\"\n\n\n\n    2R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(2)(a) makes it a crime \"for any\nperson to manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to\nmanufacture or deliver a controlled substance.\"\n\n                                   -6-\n\fas \"Ct-1 - Ct-4 unlawful delivery.\"                 As to those offenses,\n\nDiPina affirmed that he was \"request[ing] Court permission to\n\nwithdraw [his] denial and to enter an ADMISSION TO SUFFICIENT\n\nFACTS OR ADMISSION.\"         DiPina also stated:\n\n           I   understand   that   the   ADMISSION   OF\n           SUFFICIENT FACTS is for all purposes the\n           same as an ADMISSION and that I will be\n           admitting sufficient facts to substantiate\n           the offense(s) which [have] been brought\n           against me in the cases to which these pleas\n           relate.\n\n           In the RFA, DiPina affirmed that by changing his plea\n\nhe would be \"giving up and waiving\" seven enumerated rights: (1)\n\nthe right to a judge trial and to an appeal of any finding of\n\ndelinquency or waywardness; (2) the right to insist that the\n\nstate offer evidence proving the elements of the offenses beyond\n\na reasonable doubt; (3) the presumption of innocence; (4) the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination; (5) the right to confront\n\nand cross-examine the witnesses against him; (6) the right to\n\npresent evidence and witnesses on his own behalf and to testify\n\non his own behalf; and (7) the right to appeal the sentence\n\nimposed   by   the   court    after   the   entry    of   his   admission   of\n\nsufficient facts.       He also affirmed that he had received no\n\npromises other than that the court would impose a sentence of\n\neighteen months in RITS, effective July 14, 1992, and that other\n\npending         charges           would        be         dismissed.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f              Finally, DiPina affirmed that:        (1) he understood that\n\nthe   court    could   \"keep   jurisdiction\"       over   him   until   he   was\n\ntwenty-one years old; (2) he understood that absent the court's\n\npermission, he would not be allowed to withdraw his plea after\n\nthe disposition was imposed; (3) he had discussed the RFA with\n\nhis attorney, who had explained the RFA to him; (4) he had \"no\n\nquestions\" concerning the meaning of the RFA and understood the\n\nRFA   \"completely\";     and    (5)   he    swore    to    the   truth   of   all\n\nstatements in the RFA.\n\n              DiPina's RFA was presented to the Rhode Island Family\n\nCourt on August 7, 1992.       DiPina's counsel confirmed that he had\n\nadvised DiPina of the rights he would be waiving, and summarized\n\nthe rights discussed in the RFA.           The prosecutor stated that the\n\nstate was prepared to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nDiPina \"did deliver unlawfully heroin to an undercover officer\n\nfrom the Providence Police on July 1st, July 7th, July 8th and\n\nJuly 14th of this year.\"\n\n              The family court then addressed DiPina personally and\n\nestablished, inter alia, that DiPina:              (1) was seventeen years\n\nold; (2) had entered an earlier plea before the court; (3) had\n\nbeen detained at RITS since July 14, 1992; (4) had not recently\n\nused drugs or alcohol; and (5) understood \"each and every one of\n\nthe rights\" he was giving up.               In response to the court's\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fquestions, DiPina admitted that on July 1, 1992, at 1:25 p.m.,\n\nhe sold heroin to a man on Comstock Street in Providence, Rhode\n\nIsland.   DiPina further admitted that he sold heroin to the same\n\nman on July 7th, 8th and 14th in 1992.              DiPina stated that each\n\nsale was for a different amount of heroin, but that he could not\n\nrecall the exact amounts of heroin that he sold.\n\n           At the conclusion of the hearing, the family court\n\npronounced the following judgment and sentence:\n\n           I'll accept an admission of sufficient facts\n           for a finding that [DiPina] is delinquent on\n           all four petitions.   [DiPina] is committed\n           to the Training School for 18 months.\n\nIn written orders of the same date, the court stated that DiPina\n\nhad been advised of his rights, had waived those rights, and had\n\n\"admit[ted]    sufficient         facts    and      submit[ted]         to   court\n\njurisdiction.\"          The court entered a finding that DiPina was\n\n\"delinquent\"      and    committed   him   to    the   custody    of    RITS     for\n\neighteen months.\n\n           Also     on    that    date,    the    family     court      signed     a\n\n\"Certificate of Judge\" on the second page of the RFA.                        There,\n\nthe court certified that the parties had provided the court with\n\nthe RFA and that the court had established at the hearing that\n\nDiPina    understood       the   rights    listed      in   the   RFA    and     the\n\nconsequences of his plea.         The court further certified:               (1) \"I\n\nhave also been satisfied by the prosecutor's statement of the\n\n                                     -9-\n\ffacts, [DiPina's] answers and the content of the [RFA], that\n\nthere is a factual basis for [DiPina's] plea\"; and (2) \"I find\n\nthat this plea is made voluntarily, intelligently and with\n\nknowledge and understanding of all matters set forth in the\n\nattached [RFA].\"\n\n             In determining whether this family court disposition\n\nshould be counted in DiPina's criminal history, the district\n\ncourt first focused on the second question posed by the remand\n\norder: whether the disposition was tantamount to a guilty or\n\nnolo contendere plea.        The court stated that DiPina \"clearly\n\nadmitted guilt of four sales of heroin to an undercover agent at\n\nfour different times,\" and hence had essentially entered a\n\nguilty plea.\n\n             The district court then addressed the first question\n\nposed by the remand order: whether the heroin disposition was\n\ndiversionary within the meaning of § 4A1.2(f).             It noted that\n\nthe state court had sentenced DiPina not to a treatment center,\n\nhospital or school, but to eighteen months at RITS, which it\n\nfound   to   be   a   \"juvenile   prison\"   in   which   males   who   have\n\ncommitted serious crimes can be incarcerated until age twenty-\n\none.    The district court concluded that the heroin disposition\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f\"was       certainly    not   a   diversion     from    the   criminal    justice\n\nsystem.\"3\n\n              Accordingly, the district court resentenced DiPina to\n\nsixty months’ imprisonment and five years’ supervised release,\n\nthe same sentence that it had previously imposed.                    The court\n\nnoted that DiPina had served the prison term, but that his term\n\nof   supervised        release    was   still   in     effect. 4   This    appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              We begin with the text of the relevant sentencing\n\nguidelines.       Sections 4A1.1(a)-(c) of the guidelines, titled\n\n\"Criminal History Category,\" read in pertinent part:\n\n\n       3\n     The district court employed the following definition of\ndiversionary disposition:\n\n              A diversion is when there is a disposition\n              that takes the particular defendant out of\n              the criminal justice system as where someone\n              is sent, for example, to a treatment center\n              instead of incarcerating them, where someone\n              is sent to a hospital, or where, in the case\n              of a juvenile, may be sent to a special\n              school of some sort.\n       4\n     At oral argument, DiPina stated that the district court had\nimposed the term of supervised release to run anew from the date\nof resentencing, rather than giving him credit for supervised\nrelease already served.    The transcript of the resentencing,\nhowever, does not support this contention; rather, it indicates\nthat the court simply reimposed the previous sentence, while\nacknowledging that DiPina had already served some of it. DiPina\nhas not pointed to any other evidence (i.e. documentation from\nthe Probation Department) that he has been doubly sentenced.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f         The total points from items (a) through (f)\n         determine the criminal history category in\n         the Sentencing Table in Chapter Five, Part\n         A.\n            (a) Add 3 points for each prior sentence\n         of imprisonment exceeding one year and one\n         month.\n            (b) Add 2 points for each prior sentence\n         of imprisonment of at least sixty days not\n         counted in (a).\n            (c) Add 1 point for each prior sentence\n         not counted in (a) or (b), up to a total of\n         4 points for this item.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, offenses committed prior to age\n\neighteen are counted under § 4A1.1.       See id., cmt. n.2 (citing\n\n§ 4A1.2(d)).   As to those offenses, § 4A1.2(d)(2) instructs the\n\nsentencing court to\n\n           (A) add 2 points under § 4A1.1(b) for each\n         adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of\n         at least sixty days if the defendant was\n         released from such confinement within five\n         years of his commencement of the instant\n         offense; [and]\n           (B) add 1 point under § 4A1.1(c) for each\n         adult or juvenile sentence imposed within\n         five years of the defendant's commencement\n         of the instant offense not covered in (A).\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2).\n\n         Section   4A1.1   refers    us   to   §   4A1.2(a)   for   the\n\ndefinition of the term \"prior sentence\":\n\n         (a) Prior Sentence Defined\n         (1) The term \"prior sentence\" means any\n         sentence     previously     imposed     upon\n         adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty\n         plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for\n         conduct not part of the instant offense.\n\n\n                              -12-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1).         Certain prior sentences, however, \"are\n\nnot counted or are counted only under certain conditions.\"                        §\n\n4A1.1,    cmt.    n.3.     Of   relevance          here   is   the   \"diversionary\n\ndisposition,\" which \"is counted only where there is a finding or\n\nadmission    of    guilt   in       a    judicial    proceeding.\"         Id.   The\n\ncommentary references \"Diversionary Dispositions,\" § 4A1.2(f),\n\nwhich provides:\n\n            Diversion from the judicial process without\n            a   finding   of   guilt   (e.g.,   deferred\n            prosecution) is not counted. A diversionary\n            disposition resulting from a finding or\n            admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo\n            contendere, in a judicial proceeding is\n            counted as a sentence under § 4A1.1(c) even\n            if a conviction is not formally entered,\n            except that diversion from juvenile court is\n            not counted.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f) (emphasis added).\n\n                                          III.\n\n            In    reviewing     a       sentence    under   the   guidelines,    we\n\ndetermine the applicability of each guideline to a particular\n\ncase de novo.      See United States v.

We    review          the     district     court's     factual\n\ndeterminations for clear error, giving \"due deference to the\n\ndistrict court’s application of the guidelines to the facts.\"\n\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            On appeal, DiPina asserts several points:                       (1) the\n\ncourt erroneously concluded that his juvenile dispositions were\n\n                                          -13-\n\fnot diversionary within the meaning of § 4A1.2(f); (2) the court\n\nerroneously determined that his admission of sufficient facts in\n\nRhode Island Family Court was tantamount to a guilty plea; (3)\n\nthe court violated Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 at the resentencing; (4)\n\nthe   court   incorrectly       calculated   DiPina's     criminal      history\n\nscore; and (5) the judge was biased.\n\n                A.   \"Diversionary disposition\"\n\n          First,     DiPina      contends    that   his      juvenile     court\n\nproceedings were diversionary dispositions within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(f).      In our earlier decision in this case, we\n\nnoted:\n\n          [T]he guidelines do not specifically define\n          what   they   mean   by   a   \"diversionary\n          disposition,\" nor did the drafters make it\n          particularly clear what they intended to\n          mean by that term.

Such analysis was not necessary, however, as the\n\nheroin disposition alone raised his criminal history points to\n\na level at which the safety valve provision was unavailable.\n\nSee DiPina, 178 F.3d at 75 (\"it would appear that counting one\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fsuch prior disposition would be enough to produce the criminal\n\nhistory level required to sustain DiPina's sentence in the\n\npresent case, regardless of how the other prior disposition is\n\ntreated\").\n\n                    B.    Tantamount to guilty plea\n\n           Second,         DiPina     challenges        the    district      court’s\n\nconclusion that his admission of sufficient facts in the heroin\n\ndisposition was tantamount to a guilty plea.                         In our earlier\n\nopinion, we said that in order to so conclude, \"the court must\n\nhave found that the defendant has confessed to certain events or\n\nthat other evidence proves such events, and that the events\n\nconstituted     a    crime.\"         DiPina,     178    F.3d    at     75   (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).            Specifically, we recommended that the\n\ndistrict court examine factors such as whether the prosecutor\n\nrecited what the state would prove if the case were to proceed\n\nto   trial;    whether      the     defendant    accepted       the    prosecutor's\n\nversion   of   the       events;    and   whether      the    family    court   judge\n\ndetermined that the admitted facts, if proved, would constitute\n\nan offense.      Id. at 74.          If these factors were present, the\n\nadmission of sufficient facts would likely be tantamount to a\n\nguilty or nolo plea.         If, on the other hand, \"the prosecutor and\n\nthe defendant or his counsel . . . [did] little more than tell\n\nthe judge that the parties have agreed to dispose of the matter\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fby a continuance, admission to sufficient facts, and a treatment\n\nprogram” it would not appear that the defendant had admitted to\n\na crime.     Id.\n\n             The    record     permits     no    conclusion   other   than   that\n\nDiPina’s admission of sufficient facts on the heroin charges,\n\ngiven what transpired at the hearing, effectively constituted a\n\nconfession to events that constituted a crime.                   See id. at 75.\n\nDuring the family court hearing, the prosecutor recited what the\n\nstate would prove if the matter were to proceed to trial: that\n\nDiPina \"did deliver unlawfully heroin to an undercover officer\n\nfrom the Providence Police on July 1st, July 7th, July 8th and\n\nJuly    14th       of    [1992].\"         DiPina     expressly    and    without\n\nqualification admitted those facts.               Furthermore, he affirmed in\n\nthe    RFA   that       he   would   be   \"admitting    sufficient      facts   to\n\nsubstantiate the offense(s) which [have] been brought against me\n\nin the cases to which these pleas relate.\"                Finally, the family\n\ncourt determined that DiPina's conduct constituted an offense\n\nunder Rhode Island law, R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(2)(a).\n\nHence, we conclude that the district court correctly determined\n\nthat the heroin disposition was equivalent to a guilty plea for\n\nsentencing purposes.           We do not hold that a simple \"admission to\n\nsufficient facts\" is automatically enough in the absence of\n\nsafeguards such as occurred here.\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\f            DiPina complains that the family court failed to inform\n\nhim of all of the rights enumerated in Fed.

We have, in fact, previously stated that any sequence\n\nthat   gives     \"reasonable     assurance     that    the   defendant   had\n\nconfessed to certain events and that the events constituted a\n\ncrime . . . would make the admission effectively an admission of\n\nguilt under the guidelines.\"         United States v.

As it happens, the record supports the\n\nconclusion that the family court substantially complied with\n\nRule   11   in   the   heroin   disposition.     The    court   effectively\n\ninformed DiPina of the nature of the charges against him; the\n\nmaximum possible penalty; his right to contest the charges and\n\nchoose to proceed to trial; his right to assistance of counsel;\n\nhis right against compelled self-incrimination; that by entering\n\nthe plea he was waiving his right to trial; and that he was\n\nwaiving his right to appeal.           See Fed. R. Crim.

This court has held,\n\nhowever, that Rule 32 does not require that opportunity where\n\nthe court merely reimposes a sentence identical to one imposed\n\nbefore, as long as the rationale for the sentence is the same.\n\nSee United States v.

Here, the district court’s rationale was identical to\n\nthat of the original sentence: that DiPina was ineligible for\n\nthe safety valve provision due to a juvenile disposition that\n\nincreased his criminal history points above one.\n\n              DiPina also asserts that the court erred in failing to\n\nverify whether DiPina and his counsel read and discussed the PSR\n\nand in failing to determine whether they had any objections to\n\nit.    Nothing in the record indicates, however, that a new PSR\n\nwas issued prior to the resentencing.            See id. at 117.    Hence,\n\nthe court was under no obligation to revisit the issue.6            See id.\n\n\n       6\n     To the extent that DiPina additionally argues that the\ncourt erred in failing to inform him of his right to appeal at\nthe resentencing, his timely appeal makes clear that any such\nerror was harmless.

Calculation error\n\n            DiPina contends that the court incorrectly calculated\n\nhis criminal history points at resentencing.          He argues that the\n\nPSR erroneously stated that he had pled nolo contendere to the\n\nresisting    arrest     charge,   while   in   fact   he   had   admitted\n\nsufficient facts.7       Therefore, he contends, this disposition\n\nshould not yield any criminal history points.\n\n            At his original sentencing, DiPina did not dispute that\n\nthe charge of resisting arrest counted toward his criminal\n\nhistory.     Even assuming arguendo that DiPina may raise this\n\nissue now, it cannot change the outcome.        The heroin disposition\n\nalone raises DiPina's criminal history points to two.               As we\n\nhave said, having more than one point makes him ineligible for\n\nthe safety valve.       Hence, we need not consider any of DiPina's\n\nother juvenile dispositions.\n\n            E.   Bias\n\n            DiPina contends that the district judge exhibited bias\n\nagainst him based on his remarks at the resentencing.            The judge\n\ntwice characterized DiPina's legal arguments as \"worthless,\" and\n\ncommented on his criminal conduct.8        DiPina also complains that\n\n\n    7He contends, moreover, that the charge was of disorderly\nconduct, not resisting arrest.\n    8The judge's comments included the following:\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fbias was evidenced by the court's reliance on Unger despite our\n\nstatement that Unger did not control this case; its failure to\n\nmake the necessary findings of fact and rulings of law upon\n\nremand; and its failure to comply with Rule 32.\n\n         It is unclear whether DiPina is seeking the recusal of\n\nthe district judge and reversal of the resentencing, or whether\n\nhe is simply requesting that any additional proceedings be\n\nprospectively assigned to a different judge.   It does not appear\n\nthat DiPina moved below for the judge's recusal or otherwise\n\nraised the issue of bias, and we therefore consider it waived.\n\nSee In re Abijoe Realty Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567588\"><a href=\"/opinion/567588/in-re-abijoe-realty-corporation-debtor-in-re-abijoe-realty-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127 (1st Cir.\n\n1991); United States v.

He graduated to\n    becoming an adult heroin dealer.\n                            * * * *\n    I suppose technically his supervised release was not\n    in effect, but it certainly is going to be in effect\n    as of now, and if he's charged with another drug\n    offense, he'll be a violator, and we'll deal with him.\n                            * * * *\n    The defendant is on his way to doing life on the\n    installment plan.    He's going to be in and out of\n    prison most of the rest of his life because he is a\n    habitual offender. He's a drug dealer, and he hasn't\n    changed, apparently.\n\n                             -24-\n\fproceedings, we need not consider assigning the matter to a\n\ndifferent judge in the future.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -25-\n\f</pre>",
