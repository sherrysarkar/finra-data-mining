Appellant Oscar Diaz-Cruz appeals from\r                                \r\n\nthe denial of a  motion to vacate his sentence filed under 28\r\n\nU.S.C.    2255.   He  claims that  the disparity  between his\r\n\nsentence and those of two of his co-defendants is unwarranted\r\n\nand  unreasonable.  For the following  reasons, we agree that\r\n\nthe   2255 motion was meritless.\r\n\n          Only certain kinds of alleged sentencing errors may\r\n\nbe raised in a collateral proceeding under   2255.  These are\r\n\nthat (1) a sentence violates  the Constitution or the laws of\r\n\nthe  United  States,  (2)  the  district  court  was  without\r\n\njurisdiction  to impose  the sentence,  (3)  the sentence  is\r\n\ngreater than the statutory maximum, and (4) the sentence  \"is\r\n\notherwise subject  to collateral  attack.\"   See 28  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n2255; Knight  v.

Nor  could  he.   A  defendant  has  no\r\n\nconstitutional  right to receive the same sentence as another\r\n\nconvicted of the  same offense.   Williams  v. Illinois,  399\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 235, 243 (1970) (\"[t]he Constitution permits qualitative\r\n\ndifferences  in meting out punishment\").  Appellant also does\r\n\nnot assert  that the  district court  lacked jurisdiction  or\r\n\nthat his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum.\r\n\n          This leaves  the last  ground.   The Supreme  Court\r\n\n\"has   narrowly  confined  the   scope  and  availability  of\r\n\ncollateral   attack   for   claims   that   do   not   allege\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nconstitutional or jurisdictional errors.\"  Knight, 37 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n772.\r\n\n          Such claims are properly  brought under  \r\n          2255  only if  the  claimed  error is  \"a\r\n          fundamental   defect   which   inherently\r\n          results  in  a  complete  miscarriage  of\r\n          justice\"  or  \"an  omission  inconsistent\r\n          with  the  rudimentary  demands  of  fair\r\n          procedure.\"    The  error  must  \"present\r\n          exceptional circumstances where  the need\r\n          for the  remedy afforded  by the  writ of\r\n          habeas corpus is apparent.\"\r                                   \r\n\nId.

Appellant fails  to  state  any extraordinary\r\n\ncircumstances  surrounding his case;  he relies instead  on a\r\n\nfairness argument.  In this context, we note that the general\r\n\nrule in this  circuit is that it is not proper for a district\r\n\ncourt  to depart  from  a  guideline range  in  an effort  to\r\n\nequalize  the  sentences  of similarly  situated  defendants.\r\n\nUnited States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1448 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 502 U.S. 969 (1991).

See, e.g., Entrekin v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates,  508 F.2d  1328, 1330  (8th  Cir. 1974)  (defendant's\r                  \r\n\nassertion that his sentence was harsher than that received by\r\n\nhis co-defendant cannot be raised  in a   2255 motion), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 421 U.S. 977 (1975).\r                  \r\n\n          We  add  only  that  to  the  extent  appellant  is\r\n\nseparately challenging the  trial court's enhancement of  his\r\n\nbase offense level by two, \"[a] non-constitutional claim that\r\n\ncould have been,  but was not, raised  on appeal, may not  be\r\n\nasserted by collateral attack under   2255 absent exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances.\"  Knight, 37  F.3d at 772.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span> (1995).   Appellant fails to state any extraordinary circumstances surrounding his case;  he relies instead on a fairness argument.   In this context, we note that the general rule in this circuit is that it is not proper for a district court to depart from a guideline range in an effort to equalize the sentences of similarly situated defendants.  United States v. Wogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1448 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></span> (1991).   Given appellant's lack in this case of a \"fundamental interest\" in a sentence equal to those of his co-defendants, his claim of disparate treatment is not cognizable on a &#167; 2255 motion.  See, e.g., Entrekin v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324470\"><a href=\"/opinion/324470/walter-j-entrekin-jr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></a></span>, 1330 (8th Cir.1974) (defendant's assertion that his sentence was harsher than that received by his co-defendant cannot be raised in a &#167; 2255 motion), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></span> (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add only that to the extent appellant is separately challenging the trial court's enhancement of his base offense level by two, \"[a] non-constitutional claim that could have been, but was not, raised on appeal, may not be asserted by collateral attack under &#167; 2255 absent exceptional circumstances.\"  Knight, 37 F.3d at 772.   We can perceive no obstacle that would have prevented appellant from challenging the two-level enhancement on direct appeal.  \"Having bypassed his opportunity to raise the claim on direct appeal, he cannot raise it now on collateral attack.\"  Id. at 773.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
