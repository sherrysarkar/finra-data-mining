Having carefully reviewed the record in\r\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties, we affirm the\r\njudgment of the district court, essentially for the reasons\r\ngiven by the district court in its findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law, dated August 21, 1997.  We limit ourselves \r\nto the following remarks. \r\n          Like the district court, we find that the investment\r\nof pooled funds in a common account from which investors were\r\nto be paid interest on a pro rata basis constitutes a \"common\r\nenterprise\" for the purpose of investment contract analysis. \r\nThe claim that the fixed interest payments promised investors\r\ndoes not constitute \"profit\" was not raised with sufficient\r\nclarity below and hence has been waived on appeal absent\r\nexceptional circumstances.  See In re Rauh, 119 F.3d 46, 51\r\n(1st. Cir. 1997).  No such circumstances exist in this case.\r\n          We further find no clear error in the district court\r\ndetermination that defendants/appellants acted with the\r\nrequired scienter in offering these securities.  Finally, the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the\r\npenalties it assessed or in denying the belated request for a\r\njury trial made by defendants/appellants.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
