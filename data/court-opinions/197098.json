The Pension  Fund has since settled\r\n\nwith WWI, so that only the Health Plan remains party to  this\r\n\nlitigation.

Local  Rule 27.1.   We add only  the following few\r\n\nthoughts.   We recognize  that these  \"alter ego\"  cases have\r\n\nserious consequences  for each  party  to the  dispute.   The\r\n\ncases  are  largely  fact-driven, and  general  statements of\r\n\ndoctrine go only  so far.   In NLRB  v. Hospital San  Rafael,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.,   42  F.3d  45  (1st  Cir.  1994),  we  noted  that  in\r                \r\n\ndetermining alter ego status the NLRB and courts have:\r\n\n          considered a range of  criteria including\r\n          the  similarity between  the old  and new\r\n          companies  in   relation  to  management,\r\n          business  purpose, operation,  equipment,\r\n          customers  and  supervision,  as well  as\r\n          ownership.   In  most  cases,  a  further\r\n          important factor in determining alter ego\r\n          status  is whether the  alleged alter ego\r\n          entity  was  created  and  maintained  in\r\n          order to avoid labor obligations.\r\n\nId.  at 50.   We  have also  noted that  \"[n]o one  factor is\r              \r\n\ncontrolling  and all need not be present to support a finding\r\n\nof alter ego status.\"   C.E.K. Indus.

NLRB, 921 F.2d 350, 354 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                        \r\n\n          Here there is strong evidence of similarity between\r\n\nthe old and new companies in that there is common management,\r\n\nan identical business purpose, and substantial similarity  in\r\n\noperations.   These similarities  are compounded by  the fact\r\n\nthat  despite nominally  separate ownership,  CWI essentially\r\n\nprovided WWI  with free equipment (trucks  and company cars),\r\n\nfree  use of office and warehouse space,  and free use of its\r\n\nservice mark.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          As  we  said  in  Hospital San  Rafael,  anti-union\r                                                            \r\n\nanimus  is  not  always a  sine  qua  non  of an  \"alter-ego\"\r                                                     \r\n\nfinding.

But this case\r                                         \r\n\ndoes  not test  the \"reasonable  limits,\" id.  at 52,  of the\r                                                         \r\n\nHospital  San  Rafael  doctrine because  there  is sufficient\r                                 \r\n\nevidence here to infer anti-union animus from the sequence of\r\n\nevents  (although  this evidence  is  not as  strong  as that\r\n\nrecited earlier pertaining to  the similarity between the old\r\n\nand new companies).   These facts are sufficient to  make out\r\n\nan alter-ego case, although WWI's arguments on this point are\r\n\nfar from frivolous.1\r\n\n          We acknowledge the able  briefing and advocacy  for\r\n\nboth sides here.  \r\n\n          For these reasons, we affirm.  No costs.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Of far less merit is WWI's alternate argument that the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement which WWI eventually signed\r\nwith the union somehow bars the claims of the Health Plan. \r\nFor one thing, the Plan was not a party to this agreement. \r\nIn addition, the agreement on its face is silent on the\r\nquestion of liability for past claims.  And finally,\r\ncollective bargaining agreements by their very nature govern\r\nprospective relations between the parties.  We decline to\r                       \r\nread in a waiver of past claims absent any indication in the\r\nagreement itself that the parties intended it to address such\r\nmatters.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n",

United Paperworkers, 64 F.3d at 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm on the district court's well-reasoned opinion.  Local Rule 27.1.  We add only the following few thoughts.  We recognize that these \"alter ego\" cases have serious consequences for each party to the dispute.  The cases are largely fact-driven, and general statements of doctrine go only so far.  In  NLRB v. Hospital San Rafael, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684075\"><a href=\"/opinion/684075/national-labor-relations-board-v-hospital-san-rafael-inc-and-centro/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), we noted that in determining alter ego status the NLRB and courts have:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">considered a range of criteria including the similarity between the old and new companies in relation to management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers and supervision, as well as ownership.  In most cases, a further important factor in determining alter ego status is whether the alleged alter ego entity was created and maintained in order to avoid labor obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 50.  We have also noted that \"[n]o one factor is controlling and all need not be present to support a finding of alter ego status.\"   C.E.K. Indus.  Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553166\"><a href=\"/opinion/553166/cek-industrial-mechanical-contractors-inc-v-national-labor-relations/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 354 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here there is strong evidence of similarity between the old and new companies in that there is common management, an identical business purpose, and substantial similarity in operations.  These similarities are compounded by the fact that despite nominally separate ownership, CWI essentially provided WWI with free equipment (trucks and company cars), free use of office and warehouse space, and free use of its service mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we said in Hospital San Rafael, anti-union animus is not always a sine qua non of an \"alter-ego\" finding.   Hospital San Rafael, 42 F.3d at 51.   But this case does not test the \"reasonable limits,\"  id. at 52, of the Hospital San Rafael doctrine because there is sufficient evidence here to infer anti-union animus from the sequence of events (although this evidence is not as strong as that recited earlier pertaining to the similarity between the old and new companies).  These facts are sufficient to make out an alter-ego case, although WWI's arguments on this point are far from frivolous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge the able briefing and advocacy for both sides here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we affirm.  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Of far less merit is WWI's alternate argument that the collective bargaining agreement which WWI eventually signed with the union somehow bars the claims of the Health Plan.  For one thing, the Plan was not a party to this agreement.  In addition, the agreement on its face is silent on the question of liability for past claims.  And finally, collective bargaining agreements by their very nature govern prospective relations between the parties.  We decline to read in a waiver of past claims absent any indication in the agreement itself that the parties intended it to address such matters</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
