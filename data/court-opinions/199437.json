Appellants Axell and Lucrezia\n\nEmmanuel appeal a district court decision granting the United States\n\nsummary judgment on all counts.        We affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          While the Emmanuels contend that many of the underlying facts\n\nremain in dispute, the following bare-bones version of events is\n\nuncontested.   Axell and Lucrezia Emmanuel, a married couple, had\n\nchartered a ship from Hans Isbrandtsen for the business purpose of\n\ntransporting cars from Boston, Massachusetts to Haiti. In December\n\n1995, they arrived in St. Marc, Haiti on said ship with vehicles for\n\nunloading. A dispute arose between the Emmanuels and Isbrandtsen which\n\nprompted Isbrandtsen to contact the United States embassy, report his\n\nconcern for the safety of the ship's crew, and request assistance.\n\n          An embassy official then contacted the United Nations Mission\n\nin Haiti (\"UNMIH\"). Major Roy Thomas (a Canadian military officer) of\n\nthe UNMIH sent a United Nations military unit commanded by Captain\n\nGarth Estadt, a U.S. Army officer, to the scene to investigate the\n\ndisturbance. Once there, a physical confrontation between Lucrezia\n\nEmmanuel and Master Sergeant Francis Norbury occurred, resulting in\n\ninjuries to both of them. The Emmanuels brought this suit in federal\n\ncourt in Massachusetts against Isbrandtsen and the United States.\n\nTheir claims against the United States, which are the only relevant\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fones for purposes of this appeal, allege negligence and tortious acts\n\nof United States agents resulting in personal and financial injury.\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\nUnited States and ordered all claims against the United States to be\n\ndismissed. Emmanuel v. United States, Civ. No. 97-12787-RWZ (D. Mass.\n\nMay 6, 2000) (Mem. of Decision). The court held that the Emmanuels'\n\nclaims were barred due to the immunity afforded the United States under\n\nthe Status of Forces Agreement between the United Nations and Haiti.1\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          As explained by the district court, the UNMIH assumed full\n\nresponsibility for United Nations peacekeeping operations in Haiti in\n\n1994. In order to effectuate this goal, the United Nations and Haiti\n\nexecuted a Status of Forces Agreement (\"U.N.-Haiti SOFA\"), formally\n\nknown as the \"Agreement Between the United Nations and the Government\n\nof Haiti on the Status of the United Nations Mission in Haiti.\" The\n\nU.N.-Haiti SOFA extends the immunity enjoyed by the United Nations2 to\n\n\n\n1 The district court also dismissed the Emmanuels' Federal Tort Claims\nAct claims that were based on negligence of United States embassy\npersonnel, finding that any acts or omissions attributed to U.S.\nembassy personnel were not the proximate cause of any harm that came to\nthe Emmanuels. The Emmanuels have not appealed the dismissal of their\nFTCA claims.\n2 United Nations immunity is absolute unless expressly waived. United\nNations Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations,\nFeb. 13, 1946, art. II, § 2, 21 U.S.T. 1418, 1422, T.I.A.S. 6900,\nacceded to by the United States in 1970. See Askir v. Boutros-Ghali,\n933 F. Supp. 368, 371 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (Op. and Order).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthe UNMIH, as well as \"to the property, funds and assets of\n\nparticipating States used in connection with the UNMIH.\" U.N.-Haiti\n\nSOFA, ¶ 4.   The United States is a \"participating state\"3 and,\n\naccordingly, entitled to immunity from claims arising from UNMIH\n\nconduct.\n\n           The Emmanuels attempt to dodge this immunity by claiming\n\nthat: (1) the U.N.-Haiti SOFA does not apply to them, as an agreement\n\nexclusively between the government of Haiti and the United Nations; and\n\n(2) the dispatch of a United Nations unit to the scene of the dispute\n\nbetween the Emmanuels and Isbrandtsen was an action outside the scope\n\nof the UNMIH mandate, and not entitled to United Nations immunity.\n\nBoth assertions are easily rebutted.\n\n           The language of the U.N.-Haiti SOFA demonstrates that the\n\nagreement covers claims such as the one brought by the Emmanuels:\n\n           Except as provided in paragraph 52, any dispute\n           or claim of a private law character to which\n           UNMIH or any member thereof is a party and over\n           which the courts of Haiti do not have\n           jurisdiction because of any provision of the\n           present Agreement, shall be settled by a standing\n           claims commission to be established for that\n           purpose.\n\n\n\n\n3 \"'Participating State' means a State contributing personnel to the\naforementioned components of UNMIH.\" U.N.-Haiti SOFA, ¶ 1(d). It is\nundisputed that the United States contributes such personnel.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fU.N.-Haiti SOFA, ¶ 50 (emphasis added).4 The agreement, in referencing\n\n\"any dispute or claim of a private law character\" without mentioning\n\nthe government of Haiti, dispels any argument that the U.N.-Haiti SOFA\n\napplies only to Haiti and the UNMIH and not to individuals in Haiti.\n\nIn addition, the absolute immunity enjoyed by the United Nations and\n\nextended unequivocally to the UNMIH covers all suits brought by any\n\nparty, including private individuals like the Emmanuels. See Askir v.\n\nBoutros-Ghali, 933 F. Supp. 368, 368-371 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (Op. and\n\nOrder) (finding that the United Nations enjoyed immunity against\n\ndamages suit brought by a Somali citizen). The argument, then, that\n\nthe U.N.-Haiti SOFA does not apply to the Emmanuels is meritless.\n\n          The second argument, that the particular actions taken here\n\nwere outside the scope of the UNMIH mandate and not entitled to United\n\nNations immunity, is equally unavailing. The Emmanuels claim that\n\ntheir dispute with Isbrandtsen was within the exclusive jurisdiction of\n\nthe Haitian Port Authority. The district court disagreed, concluding\n\nfrom affidavits submitted by the United States that \"the UNMIH\n\nroutinely dispatched troops to respond to reported civil disturbances\n\nbecause of the lack of trained Haitian police.\" Emmanuel, Civ. No. 97-\n\n12787-RWZ, at 5. The district court went on, holding that, regardless\n\nof the propriety of the intervention by the UNMIH unit, the order to\n\n\n\n4 Paragraph 52 does not apply to this case, covering only disputes\n\"between UNMIH and the Government [of Haiti].\" U.N.-Haiti SOFA, ¶ 52.\n\n                                 -6-\n\finvestigate \"came from the U.N. through its chain of command.\" Id.\n\nThe military personnel that were involved in the altercation were\n\naccordingly \"acting in connection with the U.N. mission.\" Id.; see\n\nAskir, 933 F. Supp. at 370 n.3 (\"The mere allegation that the United\n\nNations did not possess the authority to undertake its mission in\n\nSomalia does not make whatever actions Connor may have taken to carry\n\nout those missions any less a part of his official function.\"). We\n\nfind the reasoning of the district court to be unassailable, and adopt\n\nthe district court's opinion regarding this issue in full.\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          The district court decision granting summary judgment and\n\ndismissing the United States from this suit is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

Both assertions are easily rebutted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the U.N.-Haiti SOFA demonstrates that the agreement covers claims such as the one brought by the Emmanuels:  Except as provided in paragraph 52, any dispute or claim of a private law character to which UNMIH or any member thereof is a party and over which the courts of Haiti do not have jurisdiction because of any provision of the present Agreement, shall be settled by a standing claims commission to be established for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.N.-Haiti SOFA, &#182; 50 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The agreement, in referencing \"any dispute or claim of a private law character\" without mentioning the government of Haiti, dispels any argument that the U.N.-Haiti SOFA applies only to Haiti and the UNMIH and not to individuals in Haiti. In addition, the absolute immunity enjoyed by the United Nations and extended unequivocally to the UNMIH covers all suits brought by any party, including private individuals like the Emmanuels. See Askir v. Boutros-Ghali, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741560\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741560/askir-v-boutros-ghali/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 368-371 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (Op. and Order) (finding that the United Nations enjoyed immunity against damages suit brought by a Somali citizen). The argument, then, that the U.N.-Haiti SOFA does not apply to the Emmanuels is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second argument, that the particular actions taken here were outside the scope of the UNMIH mandate and not entitled to United Nations immunity, is equally unavailing. The Emmanuels claim that their dispute with Isbrandtsen was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Haitian Port Authority. The district court disagreed, concluding from affidavits submitted by the United States that \"the UNMIH routinely dispatched troops to respond to reported civil disturbances because of the lack of trained Haitian police.\" Emmanuel, Civ. No. 97-12787-RWZ, at 5. The district court went on, holding that, regardless of the propriety of the intervention by the UNMIH unit, the order to investigate \"came from the U.N. through its chain of command.\" Id. The military personnel that were involved in the altercation were accordingly \"acting in connection with the U.N. mission.\" Id.; see Askir, 933 F. Supp. at 370 n.3 (\"The mere allegation that the United Nations did not possess the authority to undertake its mission in Somalia does not make whatever actions Connor may have taken to carry out those missions any less a part of his official function.\"). We find the reasoning of the district court to be unassailable, and adopt the district court's opinion regarding this issue in full.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decision granting summary judgment and dismissing the United States from this suit is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court also dismissed the Emmanuels' Federal Tort Claims Act claims that were based on negligence of United States embassy personnel, finding that any acts or omissions attributed to U.S. embassy personnel were not the proximate cause of any harm that came to the Emmanuels.
