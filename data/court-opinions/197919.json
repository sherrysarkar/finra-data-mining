Fralich with whom Peter J. DeTroy and Norman, Hanson\r\n&amp; DeTroy were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                    April 21, 1998\r\n\n                             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Norman L. Berthiaume was a Maine\r\nnurse practitioner licensed by the Maine Board of Nursing.  In July\r\n1990, Berthiaume pleaded guilty to the violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n1462, which prohibits the importation of obscene materials. \r\nBerthiaume had ordered and received from a United States Customs\r\nService undercover operation in Mexico, through the mails, a\r\nvideotape depicting children engaged in sexual activity.  He was\r\ngiven two years' probation and a $2,000 fine; the sentencing judge\r\nsaid that the crime was an aberration.\r\nWhile the charges were still pending, Berthiaume notified\r\nthe Board of the situation and applied for a renewal of his nursing\r\nlicense.  He said that he had purchased the child pornography out\r\nof professional interest.  In November 1990, the Board met with\r\nBerthiaume and his attorney at an informal conference.  Afterwards,\r\nthe Board renewed his license on a probationary basis pending a\r\npsychological evaluation by an independent psychologist.\r\nJames Bivins, a government lawyer who was advising the\r\nBoard, contacted two psychologists in an effort to find someone who\r\ncould evaluate Berthiaume.  One of the psychologists recommended\r\nDr. William O'Donohue, a psychologist who was then an assistant\r\nprofessor at the University of Maine specializing in the evaluation\r\nof sex offenders.  Jean Caron, the Board's executive director (a\r\nnon-voting staff position), contacted O'Donohue, who told her and\r\nBivins about the tests he employed and considered appropriate in\r\nsuch an evaluation.\r\nThese tests, O'Donohue told them, included interviews,\r\nfilling out surveys, and a penile plethysmograph test.  He\r\nexplained that in the plethysmograph test, the subject places on\r\nhis penis a device that measures its circumference and thus the\r\nlevel of the subject's arousal as he is shown sexually explicit\r\nslides or listens to sexually explicit audio \"scenes.\"  Caron and\r\nBivins reported their conversation to Betty Clark, the chair of the\r\nBoard, who told them to retain O'Donohue's services.\r\nBivins arranged the evaluation and informed Berthiaume\r\nthat it would include a penile plethysmograph test.  Berthiaume was\r\ntold that if he refused to take the test, the Board would take\r\nsteps to revoke his nursing license.  Berthiaume expressed\r\nreservations orally and in writing but ultimately agreed to the\r\ntest and signed the informed consent form he was given by\r\nO'Donohue.  Berthiaume says he signed it under duress and disputes\r\nwhether he was given enough information about the test to make his\r\nconsent truly informed.  \r\nO'Donohue administered the battery of tests, surveys, and\r\ninterviews that he had discussed with Bivins and Caron and sent a\r\nreport to the Board.  In his report, O'Donohue stated that the\r\nplethysmograph test was \"inconclusive.\"  However, O'Donohue made a\r\ndiagnosis of probable pedophilia, relying primarily on Berthiaume's\r\nspecific request for pornography depicting boys of particular ages\r\nand an admission (later retracted) by Berthiaume during an\r\ninterview with O'Donohue that he had regular sexual fantasies about\r\nboys and girls between the ages of 12 and 15.\r\nIn December 1990, the Board voted to renew Berthiaume's\r\nlicense on a probationary basis for two years.  He was required to\r\ntell employers and supervisors about his agreement with the Board,\r\nlimit his clientele to patients older than 18, and receive\r\npsychological counseling.  Berthiaume entered into a consent\r\nagreement with the Board in February 1991 agreeing to these\r\nconditions.\r\nBerthiaume then brought suit in the federal district\r\ncourt in Maine,  seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and the\r\nMaine Civil Rights Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,  4682,\r\nalleging violation of his rights under the United States and Maine\r\nconstitutions.   The defendants included Clark, Caron, Bivins, and\r\nO'Donohue.  The defendants countered with a summary judgment\r\nmotion asserting defenses of absolute immunity for officials\r\ninvolved in quasi-judicial proceedings and qualified immunity for\r\nofficials who do not violate clearly established rights.\r\nThe district court rejected the absolute immunity\r\ndefense, which we need not reach.  As to qualified immunity, the\r\ndistrict court denied the defendants' request to dismiss, relying\r\non our decision in Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (1st Cir. 1992);\r\nthe court said that \"factual issues\" remained open that were\r\nnecessary to the decision whether the defendants violated a clearly\r\nestablished right and thus forfeited immunity.  These open issues\r\nincluded:\r\n(1) whether Defendants acted reasonably in\r\nfailing to consider alternative approaches to\r\nmeeting the Board's need for additional\r\ninformation without requiring Plaintiff to\r\ntake the penile plethysmograph test; (2)\r\nwhether the test was shocking, degrading, and\r\nhumiliating and, if so, whether Defendants\r\nacted reasonably in failing to consider the\r\nimpact of the procedure on Plaintiff; (3)\r\nwhether the penile plethysmograph was\r\nscientifically capable of meeting the\r\nlegitimate state interest in this case; and\r\n(4) whether the extent of Defendants' inquiry\r\ninto the scientific validity of the penile\r\nplethysmograph was reasonable in light of the\r\nintrusiveness and invasiveness of the test.\r\nThe defendants have now appealed.  At the threshold,\r\nBerthiaume argues that we do not have jurisdiction to consider\r\nthese appeals.  Ordinarily, the  district court's rejection of a\r\nqualified immunity defense is immediately reviewable under the\r\ncollateral order doctrine, for reasons explained by the Supreme\r\nCourt in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 524-30 (1985). \r\nHowever, the rule is subject to a recent exception established in\r\nJohnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995), which Berthiaume invokes\r\nhere.  \r\nIn Johnson, the Supreme Court held that interlocutory\r\nappeals would not be permitted to challenge one type of ruling\r\ndenying qualified immunity.  Where qualified immunity turns on a\r\nquestion of fact and the district court declines to grant summary\r\njudgment because it says that the fact is genuinely disputed, there\r\nis no interlocutory review.  515 U.S. at 313.  The Court's reason\r\nfor the exception was prudential; it wanted to foreclose a narrow,\r\ntime-consuming inquiry whose resolution by interlocutory appeal was\r\na game not worth the candle.  See id. at 316-17.\r\nConversely, a defendant who concedes arguendo the facts\r\nfound to be disputed is not barred by Johnson from taking an\r\ninterlocutory appeal on a legal claim that the defendant is\r\nnevertheless entitled to qualified immunity on facts not\r\ncontroverted.  This view of Johnson, set forth in Stella v. Kelley,\r\n63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995), has been confirmed by Behrens v.\r\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 313 (1996).  The Court in Behrensrecognized that determining which facts are uncontroverted may\r\nrequire a certain amount of appellate effort including review of\r\nthe record.  Id. at 313.\r\nOne other point needs to be borne in mind.  The genuine\r\ndisputes insulated from immediate review under Johnson are those\r\ninvolving facts, such as what happened.  Questions of law\r\napplication--for example, whether a set of assumed facts add up to\r\na constitutional violation--are not so insulated and are ordinarily\r\nsubject to de novo review.  Behrens, 516 U.S. at 312-13.  This is\r\nequally true in deciding whether the assumed facts show a violation\r\nof \"clearly established\" law.  \r\nWe turn now to the \"merits\" of the immunity dispute: \r\nwhether, assuming that facts found controverted were resolved in\r\nfavor of Berthiaume, the defendants were nevertheless entitled to\r\nqualified immunity as a matter of law based upon facts not\r\ncontroverted.  In section 1983 cases, the classical formulation is\r\nthat an official is immune if his or her actions did not violate\r\nthe plaintiff's \"clearly established\" constitutional rights. \r\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19 (1982).  Subsequent case\r\nlaw has elaborated upon this concept in two significant ways:\r\nFirst, the case law makes clear that the question is not\r\nwhether some right has been established clearly at a highly\r\nabstract level, for example, the right to be free from unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures.  Rather, the question is whether, under the\r\ncircumstances that confronted the official, \"a reasonable official\r\nwould understand that what he is doing violate[d] that right.\" \r\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987); see also Hunter v.\r\nBryant, 502 U.S. 224, 228-29 (1991) (per curiam); Brown v. Ives,\r\n129 F.3d 209, 211-12 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 66\r\nU.S.L.W. 3531 (Mar. 23, 1998).\r\nSecond, qualified immunity may exist even though in\r\nhindsight a court might determine that the action of the official\r\nviolated the Constitution.  The doctrine of qualified immunity\r\nleaves \"ample room for mistaken judgments\" and protects \"all but\r\nthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" \r\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).  This is consistent\r\nwith the purpose of qualified immunity to avoid unduly chilling\r\nofficial action by exposing officials to personal damage liability\r\nfor good faith judgments.  Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814-15.\r\nBerthiaume describes the defendants' actions as ones that\r\n\"shock the conscience\" and thereby violate his right to substantive\r\ndue process.  Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172 (1952). \r\nAlternatively, he claims that the plethysmograph test violated his\r\nright to be free of unwanted bodily searches under the Fourth and\r\nFourteenth Amendments.  Depending on circumstances, these might be\r\ntwo quite different claims; but in this case we think the\r\nconsiderations are similar, although the two constitutional\r\nstandards are different.\r\nThe \"shock the conscience\" test is, here as in the\r\nordinary case, largely directed to the substance of what the\r\ndefendants did, including the nature of the conduct and the reasons\r\nfor it.  The same issues of intrusiveness and justification are\r\npertinent in examining the matter through a Fourth Amendment lens,\r\nwhere the touchstone is reasonableness.  In some cases procedural\r\nissues dominate the Fourth Amendment inquiry--the securing of a\r\nwarrant from a neutral magistrate, for example--but Berthiaume\r\nmakes no procedural claim in this instance.\r\nStarting with the conduct itself, Berthiaume's main\r\nobjection is to the plethysmograph test.  Of course, the procedure\r\nwas being carried out in the course of a psychological examination,\r\nand there are plenty of ordinary medical procedures that are\r\ndisagreeable or upsetting to the patient.  Competency examinations\r\nin criminal cases are similarly intrusive.  But we think that the\r\nnature of the test in this case would strike most people as\r\nespecially unpleasant and offensive.\r\nThe problem of justification is more complicated--indeed,\r\nit is the heart of the case--and it needs to be considered at two\r\ndifferent levels.  One is the decision to insist that Berthiaume\r\nsubject himself to psychological screening, and the other is the\r\ndecision to use the plethysmograph test in the course of that\r\nexamination.  The former involves an administrative judgment, and\r\nthe latter implicates some measure of the expertise and the\r\npractice of a profession.\r\nStarting with the administrative judgment, we think it\r\nwas not unreasonable, and certainly not shocking, for the Board to\r\nrequire Berthiaume--as a condition of retaining his nursing\r\nlicense--to submit to psychological testing by an expert. \r\nBerthiaume had pled guilty to the federal felony of importing\r\nobscene materials, and the materials involved children engaged in\r\nsexual activity.  There was no reason why the Board had to accept\r\nBerthiaume's unvarnished assertion that he had acquired the child\r\npornography out of professional interest.\r\nThe Board is charged under Maine law with responsibility\r\nfor the fitness of persons who hold themselves out as nurses.  SeeMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32,  2101.  Like doctors, nurses are a\r\npart of the medical profession and are entrusted with patient care,\r\nwhere reliance is normally placed on the competence of the nurse or\r\ndoctor.  Given that children were the subject of Berthiaume's\r\npornography, many people would have regarded the Board as downright\r\nremiss if it had not insisted on further review.\r\nIt is no answer to assert, as Berthiaume does, that\r\ngovernment employment or other benefits cannot be conditioned on a\r\nsurrender of constitutional rights.  In some contexts this is true,\r\nsee Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 568 (1st Cir. 1985); but in\r\nothers, government employment or other benefits may be conditioned\r\non steps that could not be demanded as of right.  E.g., Rankin v.\r\nMcPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 388-89 (1987); Wiley v. Mayor and City\r\nCouncil of Baltimore, 48 F.3d 773, 777-78 (4th Cir.), cert. denied,\r\n516 U.S. 824 (1995).  See J. Nowak &amp; R. Rotunda, Constitutional Law 14.46, at 958 (5th ed. 1995).\r\nThe more troublesome decision is the use of the penile\r\nplethysmograph, but here the main focus must be upon O'Donohue\r\nrather than the other defendants.  There may be procedures so\r\nbizarre that lay persons and lawyers could not conceivably stand\r\nbehind a doctor or psychologist who proposed their use.  But  this\r\nhardly appears to be such a case.  Indeed, we conclude that\r\nO'Donohue himself has not engaged in a violation of clearly\r\nestablished law.  It follows that the other defendants did not do\r\nso either.\r\nWhatever its scientific origins, pedophilia does not have\r\nrevealing physical features like the measles, and the condition is\r\none that the patient himself would be likely to deny.  Given the\r\nneed for inquiry, O'Donohue thus had good reason to consider the\r\nuse of any legitimate tool of investigation.  The critical question\r\nis whether the test was so far outside the range of legitimate\r\nprofessional judgment that its use in the present case was shocking\r\nto the conscience, or constitutionally unreasonable, and also\r\nviolated clearly established law.\r\nO'Donohue said in his deposition that he regarded the\r\ntest as a legitimate one.  But O'Donohue's version of the\r\nscientific scene was in some degree controverted by Berthiaume's\r\nexpert; just how far is a different question.  Given the usual\r\nstandard on summary judgment, St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71\r\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 116 S. Ct.\r\n2548 (1996), which is doubly appropriate in light of Johnson, we\r\nwill assume that Berthiaume's expert is to be believed as to facts,\r\nalthough not necessarily as to legal labels.\r\nThe difficulty is that Berthiaume's own expert does not \r\neven begin to assert that the penile plethysmograph is quack\r\nscience and that its use would be considered outlandish in the\r\nmedical community.  Rather, he admitted that the device is an\r\naccepted tool in the assessment and treatment of, for example,\r\nknown child molesters.  He called it \"pretty much a standard\r\npractice in treatment programs for sex offenders,\" and said that by\r\nthe late 1980s, the test \"had gone from a procedure that was\r\nexperimental . . . [to one] being used all over North America by\r\nlarge numbers of professionals.\"\r\nThis expert's testimony shows a dispute in the scientific\r\ncommunity as to how far the device is useful in assessing people\r\nnot previously shown to have deviant sexual interests.  The expert\r\nsaid that the plethysmograph is not useful to identify pedophilia\r\nbecause the test has a high rate of false negatives, that is to\r\nsay, it will pass as normal on persons who are actually pedophiles. \r\nThe expert said that this lack of \"sensitivity,\" combined with its\r\nintrusiveness, made it inappropriate for use in cases (like this\r\none) where it is used for screening rather than treatment.\r\nBut Berthiaume's expert admitted that, while he had\r\ncriticized the use of the device for screening purposes in a\r\nmonograph, the issue had not been definitively resolved in the\r\nscientific community.  Further, he conceded that the device was the\r\nmost sensitive of all tools that are employed to screen for\r\npedophilia--the least worse of a bad lot, in his opinion.  Finally,\r\nhe agreed with O'Donohue's lawyer that the decision whether to\r\nadminister the plethysmograph test was a question of \"professional\r\njudgment.\"  \r\nIn short, the situation amounts to this:  there was good\r\nreason for the Board to determine whether Berthiaume was afflicted\r\nwith pedophilia and only limited means available for that task; the\r\nplethysmograph is widely used in the scientific community for the\r\ntreatment of pedophilia; its use for screening is debatable and the\r\nscientific community is not of one mind;  and whether to administer\r\nthe test was a question of professional judgment.  It is doubtful\r\nthat this testimony would show negligence in a simple case of\r\nmedical malpractice.\r\nBe that as it may, this testimony would not permit the\r\nconclusion that O'Donohue's conduct was so outrageous or\r\nunreasonable as to establish a violation of \"clearly established\"\r\nlaw.  We need not suppose that a court would necessarily have\r\nupheld a denial of Berthiaume's license if he had refused to take\r\nthe test.  It is enough that there is no prior case law condemning\r\nthe conduct as unconstitutional, nor is it so plainly beyond the\r\nbounds of civilized or rational behavior as to make it an obvious\r\nconstitutional violation even without direct precedent.\r\nThis brings us to Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (1st\r\nCir. 1992), relied on by the district court in denying summary\r\njudgment.  There, on the basis of doubtful testimony by a child, a\r\ntown police officer became one of 170 individuals accused of child\r\nabuse.  The police officer was neither formally charged nor\r\nconvicted of a crime, but the town's city manager insisted on a\r\npsychological examination, which included the penile\r\nplethysmograph, as a condition of continued police duties.  When\r\nthe police officer sued under section 1983, this court held that\r\nthe claim of qualified immunity by the same manager could not be\r\nresolved on summary judgment.\r\nThe court's original opinion asserted that Harrington was\r\n\"the unusual case in which the question whether a constitutional\r\nright has been violated and the question whether that right was\r\nclearly established are essentially coincident.\"  Id. at 45.  This\r\nproposition is in some tension with the Supreme Court's view that\r\nqualified immunity leaves \"ample room for mistaken judgments,\"\r\nMalley, 475 U.S. at 341, and with later cases in this circuit. \r\nVeilleux v. Perschau, 101 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996) (en banc) (per\r\ncuriam); Roy v. Inhabitants of the City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691,\r\n695 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nIndeed, in Harrington itself, the court's treatment of\r\nqualified immunity and the merits as coextensive was attacked by a\r\npetition for rehearing urging that the court had not faced up to\r\nthe question whether the right was \"clearly established.\"  The\r\ncourt then wrote a memorandum denying rehearing, asserting that the\r\nrecord on summary judgment was insufficient to decide whether the\r\ndevice was an impermissible intrusion and whether the city manager\r\ncould reasonably have believed it was permissible. See Harrington,\r\n977 F.2d at 46.\r\nWhatever the state of the record in Harrington--and the\r\nopinion reveals nothing about what evidence had been offered by\r\neither side--we think the plaintiffs' own expert in this case\r\nvirtually conceded that the use of the test, even for screening, is\r\na matter of debate and professional judgment.  Further, Harrington\r\nitself did not condemn the procedure outright, so it is doubly\r\ndifficult to describe its use by O'Donohue as shocking the\r\nconscience or unreasonable under clearly established law.  This is\r\nespecially so since the basis for any required testing in\r\nHarrington was far slimmer than Berthiaume's guilty plea and\r\nconfessed conduct.\r\nOne final point remains.  We have thus far appeared to\r\nignore Berthiaume's purported consent to O'Donohue's examination,\r\nincluding the plethysmograph test.  Berthiaume, despite his\r\nobjections, gave a written consent and had the advantage of a\r\nlawyer's advice.  While the Board was threatening Berthiaume's\r\nlicense, it would have been easy enough to refuse the test and seek\r\nan immediate injunction against the Board's attempt to revoke the\r\nlicense or compel the test.  Ordinarily, consent would end the\r\nmatter.\r\nNevertheless, Berthiaume has made allegations of duress\r\nand said he had inadequate information about the nature of the\r\ntest, and it might be difficult to resolve these issues on the\r\nexisting record.  Thus, we have assumed arguendo that Berthiaume's\r\nclaim is not barred by his consent.  Still, the appearance of\r\nconsent is highly pertinent.  Forcible administration of a test of\r\nthis kind would be an entirely different case.\r\nWe conclude that the defendants are entitled to qualified\r\nimmunity on the claims under the federal Constitution.  As the\r\nfederal claims must be dismissed prior to trial, and there is no\r\nindependent basis for jurisdiction over the state claims, the state\r\nclaims should be dismissed without prejudice.  See, e.g., Martinezv. Colon, 54 F.3d 980 (1st Cir. 1995); Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888\r\nF.2d 189 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\nReversed.\n",

Fralich with whom Peter J. DeTroy and Norman, Hanson\r\n&amp; DeTroy were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                    April 21, 1998\r\n\n                             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Norman L. Berthiaume was a Maine\r\nnurse practitioner licensed by the Maine Board of Nursing.  In July\r\n1990, Berthiaume pleaded guilty to the violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n1462, which prohibits the importation of obscene materials. \r\nBerthiaume had ordered and received from a United States Customs\r\nService undercover operation in Mexico, through the mails, a\r\nvideotape depicting children engaged in sexual activity.  He was\r\ngiven two years' probation and a $2,000 fine; the sentencing judge\r\nsaid that the crime was an aberration.\r\nWhile the charges were still pending, Berthiaume notified\r\nthe Board of the situation and applied for a renewal of his nursing\r\nlicense.  He said that he had purchased the child pornography out\r\nof professional interest.  In November 1990, the Board met with\r\nBerthiaume and his attorney at an informal conference.  Afterwards,\r\nthe Board renewed his license on a probationary basis pending a\r\npsychological evaluation by an independent psychologist.\r\nJames Bivins, a government lawyer who was advising the\r\nBoard, contacted two psychologists in an effort to find someone who\r\ncould evaluate Berthiaume.  One of the psychologists recommended\r\nDr. William O'Donohue, a psychologist who was then an assistant\r\nprofessor at the University of Maine specializing in the evaluation\r\nof sex offenders.  Jean Caron, the Board's executive director (a\r\nnon-voting staff position), contacted O'Donohue, who told her and\r\nBivins about the tests he employed and considered appropriate in\r\nsuch an evaluation.\r\nThese tests, O'Donohue told them, included interviews,\r\nfilling out surveys, and a penile plethysmograph test.  He\r\nexplained that in the plethysmograph test, the subject places on\r\nhis penis a device that measures its circumference and thus the\r\nlevel of the subject's arousal as he is shown sexually explicit\r\nslides or listens to sexually explicit audio \"scenes.\"  Caron and\r\nBivins reported their conversation to Betty Clark, the chair of the\r\nBoard, who told them to retain O'Donohue's services.\r\nBivins arranged the evaluation and informed Berthiaume\r\nthat it would include a penile plethysmograph test.  Berthiaume was\r\ntold that if he refused to take the test, the Board would take\r\nsteps to revoke his nursing license.  Berthiaume expressed\r\nreservations orally and in writing but ultimately agreed to the\r\ntest and signed the informed consent form he was given by\r\nO'Donohue.  Berthiaume says he signed it under duress and disputes\r\nwhether he was given enough information about the test to make his\r\nconsent truly informed.  \r\nO'Donohue administered the battery of tests, surveys, and\r\ninterviews that he had discussed with Bivins and Caron and sent a\r\nreport to the Board.  In his report, O'Donohue stated that the\r\nplethysmograph test was \"inconclusive.\"  However, O'Donohue made a\r\ndiagnosis of probable pedophilia, relying primarily on Berthiaume's\r\nspecific request for pornography depicting boys of particular ages\r\nand an admission (later retracted) by Berthiaume during an\r\ninterview with O'Donohue that he had regular sexual fantasies about\r\nboys and girls between the ages of 12 and 15.\r\nIn December 1990, the Board voted to renew Berthiaume's\r\nlicense on a probationary basis for two years.  He was required to\r\ntell employers and supervisors about his agreement with the Board,\r\nlimit his clientele to patients older than 18, and receive\r\npsychological counseling.  Berthiaume entered into a consent\r\nagreement with the Board in February 1991 agreeing to these\r\nconditions.\r\nBerthiaume then brought suit in the federal district\r\ncourt in Maine,  seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and the\r\nMaine Civil Rights Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,  4682,\r\nalleging violation of his rights under the United States and Maine\r\nconstitutions.   The defendants included Clark, Caron, Bivins, and\r\nO'Donohue.  The defendants countered with a summary judgment\r\nmotion asserting defenses of absolute immunity for officials\r\ninvolved in quasi-judicial proceedings and qualified immunity for\r\nofficials who do not violate clearly established rights.\r\nThe district court rejected the absolute immunity\r\ndefense, which we need not reach.  As to qualified immunity, the\r\ndistrict court denied the defendants' request to dismiss, relying\r\non our decision in Harrington v. Almy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992);\r\nthe court said that \"factual issues\" remained open that were\r\nnecessary to the decision whether the defendants violated a clearly\r\nestablished right and thus forfeited immunity.  These open issues\r\nincluded:\r\n(1) whether Defendants acted reasonably in\r\nfailing to consider alternative approaches to\r\nmeeting the Board's need for additional\r\ninformation without requiring Plaintiff to\r\ntake the penile plethysmograph test; (2)\r\nwhether the test was shocking, degrading, and\r\nhumiliating and, if so, whether Defendants\r\nacted reasonably in failing to consider the\r\nimpact of the procedure on Plaintiff; (3)\r\nwhether the penile plethysmograph was\r\nscientifically capable of meeting the\r\nlegitimate state interest in this case; and\r\n(4) whether the extent of Defendants' inquiry\r\ninto the scientific validity of the penile\r\nplethysmograph was reasonable in light of the\r\nintrusiveness and invasiveness of the test.\r\nThe defendants have now appealed.  At the threshold,\r\nBerthiaume argues that we do not have jurisdiction to consider\r\nthese appeals.  Ordinarily, the  district court's rejection of a\r\nqualified immunity defense is immediately reviewable under the\r\ncollateral order doctrine, for reasons explained by the Supreme\r\nCourt in Mitchell v. Forsyth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524-30 (1985). \r\nHowever, the rule is subject to a recent exception established in\r\nJohnson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), which Berthiaume invokes\r\nhere.  \r\nIn Johnson, the Supreme Court held that interlocutory\r\nappeals would not be permitted to challenge one type of ruling\r\ndenying qualified immunity.  Where qualified immunity turns on a\r\nquestion of fact and the district court declines to grant summary\r\njudgment because it says that the fact is genuinely disputed, there\r\nis no interlocutory review.  515 U.S. at 313.  The Court's reason\r\nfor the exception was prudential; it wanted to foreclose a narrow,\r\ntime-consuming inquiry whose resolution by interlocutory appeal was\r\na game not worth the candle.  See id. at 316-17.\r\nConversely, a defendant who concedes arguendo the facts\r\nfound to be disputed is not barred by Johnson from taking an\r\ninterlocutory appeal on a legal claim that the defendant is\r\nnevertheless entitled to qualified immunity on facts not\r\ncontroverted.  This view of Johnson, set forth in Stella v. Kelley,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196256\"><a href=\"/opinion/196256/stella-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (1st Cir. 1995), has been confirmed by Behrens v.\r\nPelletier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (1996).  The Court in Behrensrecognized that determining which facts are uncontroverted may\r\nrequire a certain amount of appellate effort including review of\r\nthe record.  Id. at 313.\r\nOne other point needs to be borne in mind.  The genuine\r\ndisputes insulated from immediate review under Johnson are those\r\ninvolving facts, such as what happened.  Questions of law\r\napplication--for example, whether a set of assumed facts add up to\r\na constitutional violation--are not so insulated and are ordinarily\r\nsubject to de novo review.  Behrens, 516 U.S. at 312-13.  This is\r\nequally true in deciding whether the assumed facts show a violation\r\nof \"clearly established\" law.  \r\nWe turn now to the \"merits\" of the immunity dispute: \r\nwhether, assuming that facts found controverted were resolved in\r\nfavor of Berthiaume, the defendants were nevertheless entitled to\r\nqualified immunity as a matter of law based upon facts not\r\ncontroverted.  In section 1983 cases, the classical formulation is\r\nthat an official is immune if his or her actions did not violate\r\nthe plaintiff's \"clearly established\" constitutional rights. \r\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818-19 (1982).  Subsequent case\r\nlaw has elaborated upon this concept in two significant ways:\r\nFirst, the case law makes clear that the question is not\r\nwhether some right has been established clearly at a highly\r\nabstract level, for example, the right to be free from unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures.  Rather, the question is whether, under the\r\ncircumstances that confronted the official, \"a reasonable official\r\nwould understand that what he is doing violate[d] that right.\" \r\nAnderson v. Creighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (1987); see also Hunter v.\r\nBryant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112671\"><a href=\"/opinion/112671/hunter-v-bryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228-29 (1991) (per curiam); Brown v.

The doctrine of qualified immunity\r\nleaves \"ample room for mistaken judgments\" and protects \"all but\r\nthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" \r\nMalley v. Briggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (1986).  This is consistent\r\nwith the purpose of qualified immunity to avoid unduly chilling\r\nofficial action by exposing officials to personal damage liability\r\nfor good faith judgments.  Harlow, 457 U.S. at 814-15.\r\nBerthiaume describes the defendants' actions as ones that\r\n\"shock the conscience\" and thereby violate his right to substantive\r\ndue process.  Rochin v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104943\"><a href=\"/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (1952). \r\nAlternatively, he claims that the plethysmograph test violated his\r\nright to be free of unwanted bodily searches under the Fourth and\r\nFourteenth Amendments.  Depending on circumstances, these might be\r\ntwo quite different claims; but in this case we think the\r\nconsiderations are similar, although the two constitutional\r\nstandards are different.\r\nThe \"shock the conscience\" test is, here as in the\r\nordinary case, largely directed to the substance of what the\r\ndefendants did, including the nature of the conduct and the reasons\r\nfor it.  The same issues of intrusiveness and justification are\r\npertinent in examining the matter through a Fourth Amendment lens,\r\nwhere the touchstone is reasonableness.  In some cases procedural\r\nissues dominate the Fourth Amendment inquiry--the securing of a\r\nwarrant from a neutral magistrate, for example--but Berthiaume\r\nmakes no procedural claim in this instance.\r\nStarting with the conduct itself, Berthiaume's main\r\nobjection is to the plethysmograph test.  Of course, the procedure\r\nwas being carried out in the course of a psychological examination,\r\nand there are plenty of ordinary medical procedures that are\r\ndisagreeable or upsetting to the patient.  Competency examinations\r\nin criminal cases are similarly intrusive.  But we think that the\r\nnature of the test in this case would strike most people as\r\nespecially unpleasant and offensive.\r\nThe problem of justification is more complicated--indeed,\r\nit is the heart of the case--and it needs to be considered at two\r\ndifferent levels.  One is the decision to insist that Berthiaume\r\nsubject himself to psychological screening, and the other is the\r\ndecision to use the plethysmograph test in the course of that\r\nexamination.  The former involves an administrative judgment, and\r\nthe latter implicates some measure of the expertise and the\r\npractice of a profession.\r\nStarting with the administrative judgment, we think it\r\nwas not unreasonable, and certainly not shocking, for the Board to\r\nrequire Berthiaume--as a condition of retaining his nursing\r\nlicense--to submit to psychological testing by an expert. \r\nBerthiaume had pled guilty to the federal felony of importing\r\nobscene materials, and the materials involved children engaged in\r\nsexual activity.  There was no reason why the Board had to accept\r\nBerthiaume's unvarnished assertion that he had acquired the child\r\npornography out of professional interest.\r\nThe Board is charged under Maine law with responsibility\r\nfor the fitness of persons who hold themselves out as nurses.  SeeMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32,  2101.  Like doctors, nurses are a\r\npart of the medical profession and are entrusted with patient care,\r\nwhere reliance is normally placed on the competence of the nurse or\r\ndoctor.  Given that children were the subject of Berthiaume's\r\npornography, many people would have regarded the Board as downright\r\nremiss if it had not insisted on further review.\r\nIt is no answer to assert, as Berthiaume does, that\r\ngovernment employment or other benefits cannot be conditioned on a\r\nsurrender of constitutional rights.  In some contexts this is true,\r\nsee Blackburn v. Snow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457687\"><a href=\"/opinion/457687/ruth-blackburn-v-linwood-snow/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (1st Cir. 1985); but in\r\nothers, government employment or other benefits may be conditioned\r\non steps that could not be demanded as of right.  E.g., Rankin v.\r\nMcPherson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111946\"><a href=\"/opinion/111946/rankin-v-mcpherson/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 388-89 (1987); Wiley v.

See J. Nowak &amp; R. Rotunda, Constitutional Law 14.46, at 958 (5th ed. 1995).\r\nThe more troublesome decision is the use of the penile\r\nplethysmograph, but here the main focus must be upon O'Donohue\r\nrather than the other defendants.  There may be procedures so\r\nbizarre that lay persons and lawyers could not conceivably stand\r\nbehind a doctor or psychologist who proposed their use.  But  this\r\nhardly appears to be such a case.  Indeed, we conclude that\r\nO'Donohue himself has not engaged in a violation of clearly\r\nestablished law.  It follows that the other defendants did not do\r\nso either.\r\nWhatever its scientific origins, pedophilia does not have\r\nrevealing physical features like the measles, and the condition is\r\none that the patient himself would be likely to deny.  Given the\r\nneed for inquiry, O'Donohue thus had good reason to consider the\r\nuse of any legitimate tool of investigation.  The critical question\r\nis whether the test was so far outside the range of legitimate\r\nprofessional judgment that its use in the present case was shocking\r\nto the conscience, or constitutionally unreasonable, and also\r\nviolated clearly established law.\r\nO'Donohue said in his deposition that he regarded the\r\ntest as a legitimate one.  But O'Donohue's version of the\r\nscientific scene was in some degree controverted by Berthiaume's\r\nexpert; just how far is a different question.  Given the usual\r\nstandard on summary judgment, St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709033\"><a href=\"/opinion/709033/kathy-st-hilaire-etc-v-city-of-laconia/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied,    U.S.   , </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">2548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), which is doubly appropriate in light of Johnson, we\r\nwill assume that Berthiaume's expert is to be believed as to facts,\r\nalthough not necessarily as to legal labels.\r\nThe difficulty is that Berthiaume's own expert does not \r\neven begin to assert that the penile plethysmograph is quack\r\nscience and that its use would be considered outlandish in the\r\nmedical community.  Rather, he admitted that the device is an\r\naccepted tool in the assessment and treatment of, for example,\r\nknown child molesters.  He called it \"pretty much a standard\r\npractice in treatment programs for sex offenders,\" and said that by\r\nthe late 1980s, the test \"had gone from a procedure that was\r\nexperimental . . . [to one] being used all over North America by\r\nlarge numbers of professionals.\"\r\nThis expert's testimony shows a dispute in the scientific\r\ncommunity as to how far the device is useful in assessing people\r\nnot previously shown to have deviant sexual interests.  The expert\r\nsaid that the plethysmograph is not useful to identify pedophilia\r\nbecause the test has a high rate of false negatives, that is to\r\nsay, it will pass as normal on persons who are actually pedophiles. \r\nThe expert said that this lack of \"sensitivity,\" combined with its\r\nintrusiveness, made it inappropriate for use in cases (like this\r\none) where it is used for screening rather than treatment.\r\nBut Berthiaume's expert admitted that, while he had\r\ncriticized the use of the device for screening purposes in a\r\nmonograph, the issue had not been definitively resolved in the\r\nscientific community.  Further, he conceded that the device was the\r\nmost sensitive of all tools that are employed to screen for\r\npedophilia--the least worse of a bad lot, in his opinion.  Finally,\r\nhe agreed with O'Donohue's lawyer that the decision whether to\r\nadminister the plethysmograph test was a question of \"professional\r\njudgment.\"  \r\nIn short, the situation amounts to this:  there was good\r\nreason for the Board to determine whether Berthiaume was afflicted\r\nwith pedophilia and only limited means available for that task; the\r\nplethysmograph is widely used in the scientific community for the\r\ntreatment of pedophilia; its use for screening is debatable and the\r\nscientific community is not of one mind;  and whether to administer\r\nthe test was a question of professional judgment.  It is doubtful\r\nthat this testimony would show negligence in a simple case of\r\nmedical malpractice.\r\nBe that as it may, this testimony would not permit the\r\nconclusion that O'Donohue's conduct was so outrageous or\r\nunreasonable as to establish a violation of \"clearly established\"\r\nlaw.  We need not suppose that a court would necessarily have\r\nupheld a denial of Berthiaume's license if he had refused to take\r\nthe test.  It is enough that there is no prior case law condemning\r\nthe conduct as unconstitutional, nor is it so plainly beyond the\r\nbounds of civilized or rational behavior as to make it an obvious\r\nconstitutional violation even without direct precedent.\r\nThis brings us to Harrington v. Almy, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\r\nCir. 1992), relied on by the district court in denying summary\r\njudgment.  There, on the basis of doubtful testimony by a child, a\r\ntown police officer became one of 170 individuals accused of child\r\nabuse.  The police officer was neither formally charged nor\r\nconvicted of a crime, but the town's city manager insisted on a\r\npsychological examination, which included the penile\r\nplethysmograph, as a condition of continued police duties.  When\r\nthe police officer sued under section 1983, this court held that\r\nthe claim of qualified immunity by the same manager could not be\r\nresolved on summary judgment.\r\nThe court's original opinion asserted that Harrington was\r\n\"the unusual case in which the question whether a constitutional\r\nright has been violated and the question whether that right was\r\nclearly established are essentially coincident.\"  Id. at 45.  This\r\nproposition is in some tension with the Supreme Court's view that\r\nqualified immunity leaves \"ample room for mistaken judgments,\"\r\nMalley, 475 U.S. at 341, and with later cases in this circuit. \r\nVeilleux v. Perschau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729793\"><a href=\"/opinion/729793/michael-d-veilleux-v-jeffrey-perschau-detective-for-the-manchester/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1996) (en banc) (per\r\ncuriam); Roy v. Inhabitants of the City of Lewiston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195798\"><a href=\"/opinion/195798/roy-v-inhabitants/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n695 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nIndeed, in Harrington itself, the court's treatment of\r\nqualified immunity and the merits as coextensive was attacked by a\r\npetition for rehearing urging that the court had not faced up to\r\nthe question whether the right was \"clearly established.\"  The\r\ncourt then wrote a memorandum denying rehearing, asserting that the\r\nrecord on summary judgment was insufficient to decide whether the\r\ndevice was an impermissible intrusion and whether the city manager\r\ncould reasonably have believed it was permissible. See Harrington,\r\n977 F.2d at 46.\r\nWhatever the state of the record in Harrington--and the\r\nopinion reveals nothing about what evidence had been offered by\r\neither side--we think the plaintiffs' own expert in this case\r\nvirtually conceded that the use of the test, even for screening, is\r\na matter of debate and professional judgment.  Further, Harrington\r\nitself did not condemn the procedure outright, so it is doubly\r\ndifficult to describe its use by O'Donohue as shocking the\r\nconscience or unreasonable under clearly established law.  This is\r\nespecially so since the basis for any required testing in\r\nHarrington was far slimmer than Berthiaume's guilty plea and\r\nconfessed conduct.\r\nOne final point remains.  We have thus far appeared to\r\nignore Berthiaume's purported consent to O'Donohue's examination,\r\nincluding the plethysmograph test.  Berthiaume, despite his\r\nobjections, gave a written consent and had the advantage of a\r\nlawyer's advice.  While the Board was threatening Berthiaume's\r\nlicense, it would have been easy enough to refuse the test and seek\r\nan immediate injunction against the Board's attempt to revoke the\r\nlicense or compel the test.  Ordinarily, consent would end the\r\nmatter.\r\nNevertheless, Berthiaume has made allegations of duress\r\nand said he had inadequate information about the nature of the\r\ntest, and it might be difficult to resolve these issues on the\r\nexisting record.  Thus, we have assumed arguendo that Berthiaume's\r\nclaim is not barred by his consent.  Still, the appearance of\r\nconsent is highly pertinent.  Forcible administration of a test of\r\nthis kind would be an entirely different case.\r\nWe conclude that the defendants are entitled to qualified\r\nimmunity on the claims under the federal Constitution.  As the\r\nfederal claims must be dismissed prior to trial, and there is no\r\nindependent basis for jurisdiction over the state claims, the state\r\nclaims should be dismissed without prejudice.
