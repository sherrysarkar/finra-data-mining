Defendants Alfred and James Craven, two\r\nbrothers charged with an assortment of drug-related offenses,\r\nappeal from orders of pretrial detention.  After conducting\r\nhearings over four days, the magistrate judge (\"magistrate\")\r\nconcluded, in a pair of comprehensive opinions, that no\r\ncombination of conditions would reasonably assure (1) the\r\nappearance of either defendant as required or (2) the safety of\r\nthe community.  See 28 U.S.C.  3142(e).  The district judge\r\nupheld the detention orders after holding further hearings,\r\ndeeming it sufficient to rely on risk-of-flight grounds alone. \r\nHaving scrutinized the record before us, we affirm on that\r\nbasis as well.  \r\n                              I.\r\n    At the outset, defendants allege that the district court,\r\nrather than engaging in \"de novo review\" of the magistrate's\r\norders as mandated by United States v. Tortora, 922 F.2d 880,\r\n883 n.4 (1st Cir. 1990), instead applied an overly deferential\r\nstandard of review.  The court's articulated standard,\r\napparently drawn from a pre-Tortora district court decision\r\nrelied on by the government, is indeed somewhat ambiguous.  Yet\r\ndefendants voiced no objection thereto below.  (In fact, with\r\nregard to one favorable aspect of the magistrate's decision,\r\nAlfred Craven's attorney appeared to endorse a deferential\r\napproach.)  And the district court's standard, if erroneous at\r\nall, was not so mistaken as to constitute prejudicial error. \r\nThe fact that the court revoked the detention orders of two\r\ncodefendants, for example, suffices to belie any suggestion\r\nthat wholesale deference was being accorded the magistrate's\r\nrulings.  \r\n    The issue is largely beside the point in any event.  The\r\nunderlying facts are virtually undisputed.  What defendants\r\nhave objected to is the magistrate's ultimate finding, based on\r\nthose facts, that detention was warranted.  There is no\r\nindication that the district court deemed such a legal\r\nconclusion to be subject to anything other than de novo review.\r\n                             II.\r\n    Having conducted an independent review tempered by a due\r\ndegree of deference, see, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948\r\nF.2d 789, 791 (1st Cir. 1991); Tortora, 922 F.2d at 882-83, we\r\ndecline to disturb the lower court's conclusion that the\r\ndetention of these defendants is warranted on risk-of-flight\r\ngrounds.  The Craven brothers are two of 21 individuals charged\r\nwith participating in a large-scale marijuana distribution\r\nring, involving the transport of well over 1000 kilograms of\r\nmarijuana from California to Massachusetts and the transfer of\r\nmillions of dollars in proceeds back to California.  Alfred\r\nCraven is said to have been one of the ringleaders; his younger\r\nbrother James allegedly served in a somewhat subordinate, but\r\nnonetheless supervisory capacity.  At least from a preliminary\r\nstandpoint, the evidence against each appears to be strong.   \r\nBoth are facing lengthy prison terms.    Neither has close ties\r\nto the area; while the two brothers were raised in\r\nMassachusetts, they have resided in California for a number of\r\nyears.  Neither owns property in either state.  Their criminal\r\nrecords, while relatively minor, each include one or more\r\ndefaults.  And each brother is faced with charges that trigger\r\nthe rebuttable presumption of risk of flight.  See 18 U.S.C. \r\n3142(e).\r\n    This last factor is of considerable force here.  The\r\nstatutory presumption, even when rebutted, retains particular\r\nweight where, as in the instant case, defendants closely\r\ncorrespond to the congressional paradigm.  See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1416 (1st Cir. 1991) (per\r\ncuriam).  The presumption \"reflects Congress' findings that\r\ndrug traffickers often have the resources and foreign contacts\r\nto escape to other countries\" and therefore \"pose special\r\nflight risks.\"  United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15,\r\n17 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).  Defendants' evidentiary\r\nproffers, even if deemed sufficient to satisfy their burden of\r\nproduction, fall short of demonstrating that \"what is true in\r\ngeneral [regarding risk of flight by drug traffickers] is not\r\ntrue in the particular case.\"  United States v. Jessup, 757\r\nF.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir. 1985).  To the contrary, a number of\r\nfactors--including defendants' ties to southern California, the\r\nsophisticated nature of the alleged drug ring, the large\r\namounts of money supposedly involved, and the number of alleged\r\nparticipants--indicate that Congress' general concerns are\r\napplicable here.  Moreover, Alfred Craven once reportedly told\r\nan informant that he would flee to Mexico or South America\r\nrather than face criminal charges.   \r\n    Defendants' countervailing arguments, four of which we\r\nshall mention, do not call for a different result.  Alfred\r\nCraven alleges that, five hours before his own arrest, he\r\nlearned of his brother's arrest but did not take flight.  Yet\r\nhe could not have known of the charges he would be facing (the\r\nindictment having been sealed), and his inaction during such a\r\nbrief period of time is otherwise not particularly telling. \r\nCf. United States v. King, 849 F.2d 485, 488-89 (11th Cir.\r\n1988) (affirming detention order in face of argument that\r\ndefendant knew of pending indictment six months before it was\r\nreturned).  Alfred also contends that his ability to flee is\r\nconstrained by the presence in Massachusetts of his girlfriend\r\nand their young child, along with his mother.  Yet all three\r\nwere living with him in California and only moved east\r\nfollowing his arrest.  James Craven observes that he never\r\ndefaulted during the 22 months (between 1994 and 1996) that he\r\nwas free on bail pending disposition of related state drug\r\ncharges.  Yet the penalties he is now facing are substantially\r\nhigher, providing a greater incentive to flee.  \r\n    Finally, both defendants emphasize that their elderly\r\ngrandmother is willing to post over $100,000 of equity in her\r\nMassachusetts home as security.  Yet the drug ring here is\r\nalleged to have handled millions of dollars; one of the counts\r\nin the indictment seeks forfeiture of \"at least $3 million\"\r\nfrom Alfred Craven alone.  One can therefore conclude, as we\r\nnoted in a similar case, that \"[t]he forfeiture of $100,000\r\nworth of property would have little financial impact on such an\r\norganization.\"  Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d at 18; accord, e.g.,\r\nDillon, 938 F.2d at 1416-17 (observing that drug organization\r\n\"probably could absorb the loss of $200,000 worth of\r\nsecurity\").\r\n                             III.\r\n    For these reasons, we conclude that pretrial detention of\r\nAlfred and James Craven is warranted on risk-of-flight grounds. \r\nWe therefore need not address whether detention would also be\r\nappropriate on the basis of dangerousness.  See, e.g., id. at\r\n1417.\r\n    The motions for oral argument are denied, and the orders\r\nof pretrial detention are affirmed.\n",
