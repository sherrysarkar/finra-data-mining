  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\n\nNo. 98-1297\r\n\nKENNETH C. YUNKER AND COLLEEN F. YUNKER,\r\nPlaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\nv.\r\n\nNORTHWESTERN NATIONAL LIFE\r\nINSURANCE COMPANY, ET AL.,\r\nDefendants, Appellees.\r\n\n\n\nNo. 98-1363\r\n\nKENNETH C. YUNKER AND COLLEEN F. YUNKER,\r\nPlaintiffs, Appellees,\r\n\nv.\r\n\nNORTHWESTERN NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY,\r\nDefendant, Appellee.\r\n\n\n\nZURN INDUSTRIES, INC. AND\r\nZURN INDUSTRIES INC. HEALTH PLAN,\r\nDefendants, Appellants.\r\n\n\n\nAPPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n[Hon. David M. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n\n\nBefore\r\n\nBoudin, Circuit Judge,\r\nReavley, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lipez, Circuit Judge. \r\n\n\nJohn H. Montgomery, with whom Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer &amp; Nelsonwas on brief, for appellants Kenneth and Colleen Yunker.\r\nArthur J. Lamothe, with whom Law Office of Arthur J. Lamothewas on brief, for appellees Zurn Industries, Inc. and Zurn Industries Inc. Health Plan.\r\n\n\n\nOctober 29, 1998\r\n Per Curiam.  The judgment of the district court is affirmed for the following reasons:\r\n1.  The Plan's right to reimbursement is not contingent upon its participation in the state court action.  The language of the plan expressly gives the Plan this right to recover from the employee personally any amount received in damages or payments.  The Plan may choose to pursue its subrogation right against a tortfeasor, but it is not limited to that recourse.\r\n2.  The Plan expressly requires the employee to pay his own legal fees, allowing no latitude for the contention that the Plan should pay a share of the expense to recover a common fund.\r\n3.  The Plan's motion for additional findings raised an additional issue of whether it was entitled to full reimbursement of its expenses despite Yunker's contention that part of those expenses were unnecessary and due to an erroneous and unjustified requirement of the Plan.  The resolution of that dispute may turn on the outcome of the state court action.  The district court was well within its discretion in refusing the motion.\r\nAffirmed.  Each party should bear their own costs.\n",
