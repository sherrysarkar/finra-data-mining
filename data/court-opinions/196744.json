This is  an appeal  from the  denial of  a\r                           \r\n\nmotion  for preliminary injunctive  relief.   Plaintiffs, who\r\n\ninclude  two incumbent  state legislators  and four  of their\r\n\nsupporters,  challenge  the   validity  of  the   Maine  Term\r\n\nLimitation Act of  1993.  21-A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.    551-54.\r\n\nOn April 10, 1996, the date their notice of appeal was filed,\r\n\nplaintiffs  moved  for  an expedited  briefing  schedule  and\r\n\nrequested that a decision  from this court issue by  \"the end\r\n\nof  April\"--a circumstance  prompted by  the need  to prepare\r\n\nabsentee  ballots  in time  for  the June  11  state primary.\r\n\nComprehensive briefs have been submitted by the parties on an\r\n\nexpedited basis.   Having considered  the matter in  full, we\r\n\nnow dispense with oral argument, see Loc. R. 34.1(a)(2)(iii),\r                                                \r\n\nand  affirm  substantially for  the  reasons  recited by  the\r\n\ndistrict court  in its  discussion of plaintiffs'  failure to\r\n\nshow a likelihood of success on the merits. \r\n\n     We find nothing in  plaintiffs' arguments that calls the\r\n\nlower  court's   reasoning  into   serious   question.     In\r\n\nparticular, given the rationale of such  cases as Clements v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFashing,  457 U.S. 957 (1982), and given the uniform holdings\r                   \r\n\nof  the various  state  court decisions  that have  addressed\r\n\nanalogous   arguments,  we   agree   that   plaintiffs   have\r\n\nestablished something  less than a probability  of success on\r\n\nthe  merits of  their  federal claims.    We reach  the  same\r\n\nconclusion with  regard to  plaintiffs'  contention that  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndecision  in  Opinion of  the  Justices, 623  A.2d  1258 (Me.\r                                                   \r\n\n1993), will likely be  revised in light of U.S.  Term Limits,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v. Thornton, 115 S. Ct. 1842 (1995).\r                            \r\n\n     Given this failure  to show a  likelihood of success  on\r\n\nthe  merits, there  is certainly  nothing in  the plaintiffs'\r\n\nshowing  as to  the  equities that  would warrant  a contrary\r\n\nresult.   If anything,  the arguments  based on the  equities\r\n\ntend  to support the  denial of a  preliminary injunction, as\r\n\nindicated in the district  court's decision.  See also  Bates\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Jones, 904 F. Supp. 1080 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (where the court\r                    \r\n\ndenied a preliminary injunction  against state term limits on\r\n\nequitable  grounds).   Since the  law and  the equities  both\r\n\nfavor  the defendants, there was certainly no error of law or\r\n\nabuse  of  discretion  in   the  denial  of  the  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
