His sole argument on appeal is\r\n\nthat the  district court  erred by declining  to grant  him a\r\n\ndownward departure   because he  has AIDS due to  the court's\r\n\nmistaken assumption that  health cannot form  the basis of  a\r\n\ndeparture.   Because  appellant never  requested  a  downward\r\n\ndeparture  below, this  issue has  been waived.
