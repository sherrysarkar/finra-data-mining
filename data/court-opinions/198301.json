Bruce Rich and\r\nJonathan Bloom for Association of American Publishers, Inc., on\r\nbrief for amici curiae. \r\n\nJanuary 27, 1999\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  In 1996, Congress enacted\r\nthe Child Pornography Prevention Act (the \"CPPA\"), 18 U.S.C.\r\n2252A, to attack the rise of computerized or \"virtual\" child\r\npornography.  These images may take many forms   a photograph of\r\na real child may be scanned and replicated, an innocent picture of\r\na child may be manipulated by computer to create a sexually-\r\noriented photo, or a fake child (ranging from a simple cartoon\r\ncharacter to a high-resolution image resembling a real child) can\r\nbe generated wholly by computer graphics.  \r\nThe law prohibits, inter alia, knowing possession of\r\nvisual images depicting minors or those who \"appear to be\" minors\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct.  This case presents\r\nconstitutional issues of first impression in this circuit:  whether\r\nthe CPPA's definition of child pornography is so overbroad as to\r\ncontravene the First Amendment or so vague as to violate due\r\nprocess. \r\nIn resolving defendant David Hilton's motion to dismiss\r\nthe indictment in his favor, the United States District Court for\r\nthe District of Maine answered both questions in the affirmative. \r\nThe court was troubled by a perceived difficulty in determining\r\nwhether a depicted person appeared to be under 18 years old and by\r\nits belief that the statute impermissibly criminalizes possession\r\nof adult pornography. \r\nWe reverse.  We hold that the law, properly construed,\r\nsurvives Hilton's facial constitutional challenge.  It neither\r\nimpinges substantially on protected expression nor is so vague as\r\nto offend due process. \r\n                           I\r\nWe assess the constitutionality of the CPPA de novo.  SeeUnited States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 40 n.19 (1st Cir. 1998).  In\r\ndoing so, we must carefully consider fundamental constitutional\r\nnorms in light of recent technological advances to determine\r\nwhether Congress's objectives and the statutory scheme it has\r\nestablished are in accord with our constitutional design.\r\nWe begin by providing an overview of the CPPA and by\r\nconsidering the underlying legislative purposes of the Act.  \r\nCongress enacted the CPPA to modernize federal law by enhancing its\r\nability to combat child pornography in the cyberspace era.  See S.\r\nRep. No. 104-358, at pt. I (1996) (declaring that statute addresses\r\n\"problem of 'high-tech kiddie porn'\").  Lawmakers wished to improve\r\nlaw enforcement tools to keep pace with technological improvements\r\nthat have made it possible for child pornographers to use computers\r\nto \"morph\" or alter innocent images of actual children to create a\r\ncomposite image showing them in sexually explicit poses.  Through\r\nreadily available desktop computer programs, one can even create a\r\nrealistic picture of an imaginary child engaged in sexual activity\r\nand pass off that creation as an image of a real child. \r\nThe statute's operative provisions, taken together,\r\ncriminalize the reproduction, possession, sale, and distribution of\r\nchild pornography.  See 18 U.S.C.  2252A(a).  They also prohibit\r\nthe pandering of material as child pornography by making it a crime\r\nto advertise, promote, or present material \"in such a manner that\r\nit conveys the impression that the material is, or contains\" child\r\npornography.  18 U.S.C.  2256(8)(D).  \r\nThe statute defines child pornography as: \r\nany visual depiction, including any photo-\r\ngraph, film, video, picture, or computer or\r\ncomputer-generated image or picture, whether\r\nmade or produced by electronic, mechanical, or\r\nother means, of sexually explicit conduct,\r\nwhere   (A) the production of such visual\r\ndepiction involves the use of a minor engaging\r\nin sexually explicit conduct; (B) such visual\r\ndepiction is, or appears to be, of a minor\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct;\r\n(C) such visual depiction has been created,\r\nadapted, or modified to appear that an\r\nidentifiable minor is engaging in sexually\r\nexplicit conduct; or (D) such visual depiction\r\nis advertised, promoted, presented, described,\r\nor distributed in such a manner that conveys\r\nthe impression that the material is or\r\ncontains a visual depiction of a minor\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct . . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  2256(8).  A \"visual depiction\" includes   but is not\r\nnecessarily limited to   \"undeveloped film and videotape, and data\r\nstored on computer disk or by electronic means which is capable of\r\nconversion into a visual image.\"  18 U.S.C.  2256(5).  A \"minor,\"\r\nin turn, means \"any person under the age of eighteen years.\"  18\r\nU.S.C.  2256(1).  Sexually explicit conduct is described as\r\n\"actual or simulated   (A) sexual intercourse, including genital-\r\ngenital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between\r\npersons of the same sex or opposite sex; (B) bestiality; (C)\r\nmasturbation; (D) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or (E) lascivious\r\nexhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n2256(2).  \r\nThere is some overlap in the definition of child\r\npornography   material created by manipulating an image of an\r\n\"identifiable minor\" would typically, but not necessarily, appear\r\nto be of a minor; similarly, an image showing an actual minor would\r\nprobably also \"appear to be a minor.\"  On the other hand, images of\r\na purely fictional child might only satisfy the \"appears to be a\r\nminor\" test.  Under the statutory framework established by\r\nCongress, a defendant charged with unlawful distribution or sale\r\nwould be entitled to a complete defense by showing that the person\r\ndepicted actually was an adult (provided that the material was not\r\npromoted or presented to give the impression that it depicts an\r\nactual minor).  See 18 U.S.C.  2252A(c).  The affirmative defense\r\nis not made available, however, to those charged with unlawful\r\npossession of child pornography. \r\nCongress broadened the scope of federal anti-child\r\npornography statutes to address a set of related concerns aimed at\r\nthe ultimate goal of destroying the underground supply of child\r\npornography in all of its manifestations.  First, the legislature\r\ndesired to reduce the sheer volume of computerized child\r\npornography that could be used by child molesters and pedophiles to\r\n\"stimulate or whet their own sexual appetites.\"  S. Rep. 104-358,\r\nat pt. IV(B). \r\nSecond, Congress sought to ban computer-generated images\r\nthat are \"virtually indistinguishable\" from those of real children,\r\nbut are made without live children.  Id.  These images can be\r\ncreated with very little expense, and often are bought, sold, or\r\ntraded in the same manner as images created through the use of real\r\nchildren.  They can be downloaded from Internet Web sites, viewed\r\non computer screens, or stored on hard drives or floppy disks for\r\nlater use.  Until now, such materials were largely beyond the reach\r\nof federal law, which had focused on representations of actual\r\nminors. \r\nThird, the new law was designed to protect the privacy of\r\nactual children whose innocuous images are altered to create\r\nsexually explicit pictures.  Lawmakers hoped to deter the creation\r\nof such invasive material and encourage the destruction of that\r\nwhich currently exists.  See id. at  2(7). \r\nFourth, Congress wished to deprive child abusers of a\r\n\"criminal tool\" frequently used to facilitate the sexual abuse of\r\nchildren.  After hearing from an array of experts, Congress\r\nspecifically found that virtual pornography created without the\r\ninvolvement of real minors (often via computer technology alone) is\r\nincreasingly used by pedophiles and child molesters to seduce or\r\nentice children into participating in sexual activity by breaking\r\ndown their natural inhibitions.  Congress determined that \"a child\r\nwho is reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to\r\npose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced\r\nby viewing depictions of other children 'having fun' participating\r\nin such activity.\"  Id. at 2(3).  This material is routinely used\r\nto instruct children how to perform certain sexual acts.  Images\r\nmade by manipulating an innocent picture of a real child to show\r\nsexual conduct can also be used to blackmail that child into\r\nsubmitting to abuse and remaining in fearful silence about it. \r\nCongress deemed the threat of these forms of physical and emotional\r\nabuse to be as grave as when images of real children are used, for\r\na child shown a computer-generated image cannot be expected to know\r\nwhether the child portrayed in an image is that of a real child or\r\nmerely a fanciful creation.\r\n                           II\r\nWe recount the relatively short history of this case.  On\r\nDecember 17, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted Hilton for\r\ncriminal possession of computer disks containing three or more\r\nimages of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n2252A(a)(5)(B).  Well before trial, Hilton moved to dismiss the\r\nindictment, mounting solely a facial attack on the CPPA.  He argued\r\nthat the statute, by its terms, was unconstitutionally vague and\r\noverbroad, and therefore unenforceable. \r\nOn March 26, 1998, the United States District Court for\r\nthe District of Maine agreed.  The court determined that the CPPA\r\nwas a content-neutral regulation \"designed to ameliorate\r\nsignificant harmful secondary effects of the protected speech\r\nrather than suppress the speech itself.\"  United States v. Hilton,\r\n999 F. Supp. 131, 134 (D. Me. 1998).  Nevertheless, the court\r\nconcluded that the statutory definition of \"child pornography\" was\r\nboth vague and overbroad.  It found the \"appears to be a minor\"\r\nlanguage overly subjective, creating \"substantial uncertainty for\r\nviewers presented with materials depicting post-pubescent\r\nindividuals\" because it may be difficult to distinguish between\r\nteenagers and young adults.  Id. at 136.  The court further found\r\nthe definition unconstitutionally overbroad, impacting a\r\n\"significant amount of adult pornography featuring adults who\r\nappear youthful.\"  Id. at 137.  Despite holding this portion of the\r\nCPPA's definition of child pornography unconstitutional, the\r\ndistrict court made no effort to ascertain the impact of its ruling\r\non the statute as a whole by examining and applying the statute's\r\nseverability clause.  Instead, it simply dismissed the indictment. \r\nThe government now appeals.\r\n                          III\r\nThe government attacks the district court's analysis in\r\nseveral critical respects.  It first questions the lower court's\r\nconclusion that the statute is overbroad.  In its view, the CPPA\r\ndoes not reach innocuous pictures of children or criminalize\r\nprotected adult pornography.  The government also takes issue with\r\nthe district court's determination that the Act is too vague.  The\r\ngovernment urges us to hold that the statute allows persons of\r\nordinary intelligence to determine what types of material are\r\nbanned and to conform their conduct accordingly.  To require\r\nfurther specificity, it insists, would be not only impractical, but\r\nunrealistic.  Additionally, the government asks us to deem the\r\n\"appears to be a minor\" standard to be grounded in prosecutorial\r\nnecessity because it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,\r\nfor an expert to discern whether an image is one of a real child. \r\nThe broadening of the definition of child pornography is critical,\r\nthe government argues, because in more and more cases involving\r\nvirtual child pornography, the prosecution is unable to prove that\r\nreal children under a specified age are depicted.  \r\nWe turn our attention to familiar constitutional terrain. \r\nThe First Amendment declares that \"Congress shall make no law . .\r\n. abridging freedom of speech.\"  U.S. Const., amend. I.  We offer\r\na few words about the doctrines that have developed over time to\r\ngive meaning to the protective force of the First Amendment.  In\r\ngeneral, laws that aim only to prescribe the conditions under which\r\ncertain speech may be carried out may be upheld as neutral time,\r\nplace or manner restrictions.  See United States v. Grace, 461 U.S.\r\n171, 177 (1983) (\"[T]he government may enforce reasonable time,\r\nplace, and manner regulations as long as the restrictions 'are\r\ncontent neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant\r\ngovernment interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of\r\ncommunication.'\") (citation omitted).  But a statute or regulation\r\nthat discriminates based on the content of the speech itself\r\ntypically must comport with the following standards to survive a\r\nconstitutional challenge:  it must be (1) animated by one or more\r\ncompelling state interests; and (2) narrowly tailored toward\r\nfulfilling those concerns.  Nevertheless, certain types of\r\nexpression   chief among them fighting words, libel, and obscenity\r\nare unprotected altogether.  See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505\r\nU.S. 377, 383-85 (1992).  Child pornography falls into the category\r\nof unprotected speech.  See New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 764\r\n(1982).  Finally, an otherwise valid law may be so overbroad that\r\nit encroaches on protected expression or so vague that prosecuting\r\na person under the statute would effectively deprive that person of\r\ndue process of law.  See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357-58\r\n(1983).   \r\nFor the sake of clarifying this area of law, we find it\r\nnecessary to point out that the district court misapplied the time,\r\nplace or manner doctrine by mistaking the CPPA for a content-\r\nneutral law.  A distinct line of cases upholds reasonably-crafted\r\nregulations where the state acts not to suppress certain speech but\r\nto direct, in a content-neutral way, how or when that speech may be\r\nexpressed in the public sphere.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nKokinda, 497 U.S. 720 (1990) (upholding federal regulation\r\nprohibiting solicitation on postal property).  Still, \"[a]ny\r\nrestriction on speech, the application of which turns on the\r\ncontent of the speech, is a content-based restriction regardless of\r\nthe motivation that lies behind it.\"  Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312,\r\n335-36 (1988) (Brennan, J., concurring).  Of course, if a law is\r\ndirected at the impact of the speech on its viewers, it cannot be\r\nevaluated as a time, place or manner restriction.  See Reno v.\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844,   , 117 S. Ct. 2329,\r\n2342-43 (1997) (rejecting argument that Communications Decency Act,\r\nwhich banned on-line transmission of \"obscene or indecent\"\r\nmessages, was time, place or manner regulation); Forsyth County v.\r\nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 134 (1992) (\"Listeners'\r\nreaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis for\r\nregulation.\"). \r\nThe CPPA fails both tests for substantive neutrality: it\r\nexpressly aims to curb a particular category of expression (child\r\npornography) by singling out that type of expression based on its\r\ncontent and banning it.  Blanket suppression of an entire type of\r\nspeech is by its very nature a content-discriminating act. \r\nFurthermore, Congress has not kept secret that one of its\r\nmotivating reasons for enacting the CPPA was to counter the primary\r\neffect child pornography has on those who view it.  See S. Rep.\r\n104-358, at pt. III, IV(A) (reflecting congressional concern that\r\na \"child molester or pedophile [may use] the material to whet his\r\nsexual appetites,\" that child pornography \"poisons the minds and\r\nspirits of our youth,\" and that, if shown to children, the material\r\nmay \"make children more susceptible of acceding to sexual demands\r\nof would-be abusers); see also id. at pt. IV(B) (observing that \"a\r\nmajor part of the threat to children posed by child pornography is\r\nits effect on the viewers of such material\").  For these related\r\nreasons, the child pornography law is plainly activated by a\r\n\"content-based classification of speech.\"  Ferber, 458 U.S. at 763. \r\nMoreover, the statute makes no effort to permit\r\nalternative methods of disseminating or possessing the material in\r\nquestion.  In this respect, the district court also erred in\r\nfinding that adequate alternative avenues of expression exist.  The\r\nCPPA is a quintessential content-specific statute, and therefore\r\ncannot be properly understood as a time, place or manner\r\nregulation. \r\nBut to say that the CPPA is content-based does not end\r\nthe matter, for it is well-settled that child pornography, an\r\nunprotected category of expression identified by its content, may\r\nbe freely regulated.  We are asked to determine: first, whether the\r\nstatute's definition of child pornography, expanded in an effort to\r\noutlaw computerized child pornography, satisfies the First\r\nAmendment; and second, assuming its sweep is appropriate, whether\r\nthe law is adequately precise as to provide fair warning. \r\nTo resolve these issues, we start by reviewing the\r\nSupreme Court's pronouncements on the government's power to\r\nregulate child pornography.  In Ferber, the Supreme Court first\r\nupheld the constitutionality of a state law proscribing the\r\ndistribution of material depicting sexual performances by children\r\nunder the age of 16.  See 458 U.S. 747.  In doing so, it carved out\r\nan entire category of speech \"which, like obscenity, is unprotected\r\nby the First Amendment.\"  Id. at 764.  The Court likened child\r\npornography to obscenity in that both kinds of expression may be\r\nbanned, but explained that because of the state's \"compelling\r\ninterest in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation\r\nof children,\" see id. at 761, a law regulating child pornography\r\nneed not adhere mechanistically to the three-part test for\r\nobscenity originally enunciated in Miller v. California, 413 U.S.\r\n15 (1973).  One reason for allowing a departure from the obscenity\r\nrule and, as a result, somewhat greater authority to regulate child\r\npornography is that \"a work which . . . contains serious literary,\r\nartistic, political, or scientific value may nevertheless embody\r\nthe hardest core of child pornography.\"  Id. \r\nThe Ferber Court did not establish a single one-size-\r\nfits-all constitutional definition of child pornography (as the\r\nCourt arguably has done for obscenity), but provided general\r\nguiding principles.  Ultimately, to pass constitutional muster, a\r\nparticular anti-child pornography statute must be \"adequately\r\ndefined.\"  458 U.S. at 764.  In Ferber, the Court pointed out that\r\nNew York's prohibition was confined to works that \"visually depict\r\nsexual conduct by children below a specified age.\"  Id. (Emphasis\r\nin original).  It was also persuaded that the law's definition of\r\nsexual activity was \"suitably limited and described.\" Id.\r\nThe Court further developed the contours of its child\r\npornography jurisprudence in Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990). \r\nThere, the Court evaluated a state law prohibiting the possession\r\nand viewing of material depicting a nude minor \"where such nudity\r\nconstitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the\r\ngenitals.\"  A defendant charged with unlawful possession attacked\r\nthe statute as overbroad and vague.  Rebuffing his twin challenges,\r\nthe Court found that the statute was not aimed at controlling a\r\nperson's private thoughts, but had been enacted to \"protect victims\r\nof child pornography\" and to \"destroy[] a market for the\r\nexploitative use of children.\"  495 U.S. at 109.  The Osborne Court\r\nexplicitly approved the following legislative goals:  stamping out\r\nchild pornography because it often serves as a record of abuse of\r\nreal children; and denying pedophiles and would-be child abusers\r\naccess to child pornography, which could be used to seduce or\r\ncoerce children into sexual activity.  See id. at 110-11.  The\r\nformer remains intricately tied to the need to protect real\r\nchildren represented in the pictures, but the latter marks a\r\nsubtle, yet crucial, extension of a state's legitimate interest to\r\nthe protection of children not actually depicted in prohibited\r\nimages. \r\nAs these cases demonstrate, the line between unprotected\r\nchild pornography and otherwise protected expression (including\r\npossession of adult pornography, see Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S.\r\n557 (1969)) is not entirely tangle-free.  Nonetheless, four lessons\r\ncan be drawn from the decisions.\r\nFirst, sexually explicit material may be seen to fall\r\nalong a constitutional continuum entitling it to varying degrees of\r\nprotection.  At one end of the spectrum, pictures of actual\r\nchildren in sexually compromising positions, deemed to have little\r\nor no social value, are entitled to no constitutional protection. \r\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, non-obscene images involving\r\nactual adults are entitled to full protection.  Sexually explicit\r\nmaterial created without the benefit of a live child model but\r\nwhich appears to depict an actual minor, or produced by having an\r\nadult pose as a minor and later presented or sold as if it depicted\r\nas an actual minor, arguably falls somewhere in between. \r\nSecond, considerations beyond preventing the direct abuse\r\nof actual children can qualify as compelling government objectives\r\nwhere child pornography is concerned.  When child pornography is\r\nthe target, government is justified in not only driving it from the\r\nmarketplace through aggressive anti-trafficking laws, but\r\nforbidding the private possession or personal viewing of these\r\nproducts altogether.  See Osborne, 495 U.S. at 110 (approving of\r\nstate's efforts to \"stamp out this vice at all levels in the\r\ndistribution chain\").  In this sense, concerns about how adults may\r\nuse child pornography vis-a-vis children and how children might\r\nbehave after viewing it legitimately inform legislators' collective\r\ndecision to ban this material. \r\nThird, in effecting such a prohibition, a criminal\r\nstatute must cabin government authority by \"adequately defin[ing]\"\r\nthe type of image that is to be forbidden.  The cases require not\r\nonly that the term \"minor\" be defined, but also that the type of\r\ncondemned sexual depiction be carefully described.  \r\nFourth, wherever the constitutional demarcation is to be\r\nproperly drawn, \"greater leeway\" ought to be afforded legislatures\r\nto regulate sexual depictions of children.  Ferber, 458 U.S. at\r\n756.  The Court's instruction to federal courts to permit Congress\r\nslightly more room to operate in this area is bolstered by its view\r\nthat \"[t]he value of permitting . . . photographic reproductions of\r\nchildren engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if\r\nnot de minimis.\"  Id. at 762.  As a result, some discretion has\r\nbeen given legislatures to set out the parameters of anti-\r\npornography restrictions.  For instance, the Court has repeatedly\r\nacknowledged that states have latitude to set the age at which an\r\nimage is of a child rather than an adult.  See, e.g., United Statesv. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 67 (1994) (upholding\r\nfederal law that employs 18 as age of majority); Ferber, 458 U.S.\r\nat 749 (law set age of majority at 16).  Congress and statehouses\r\nhave some leeway in defining the kind of sexual depiction to be\r\nproscribed as well.  See X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at 78-79\r\n(holding that it is constitutionally permissible to use either\r\nformulation   \"lewd\" or \"lascivious\" display of children's\r\ngenitals). \r\nWith this analytic framework in mind, we turn to the task\r\nof assessing the constitutionality of the CPPA.  The initial step\r\nis to ascertain the general scope of the statutory definition of\r\nchild pornography, a task of pure statutory interpretation. \r\nComparison of the law with prevailing constitutional precepts then\r\nfollows.   \r\n                          IV \r\nWe first evaluate the district court's conclusion that\r\nthe CPPA is unconstitutionally overbroad.  Overbroad statutes by\r\ntheir nature present a host of difficulties for our system of\r\nordered liberty, not the least of which is a chilling effect on the\r\ncommunication of lawful ideas.  But a statute will not be\r\ninvalidated as overbroad unless its overbreadth is \"real, but\r\nsubstantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly\r\nlegitimate sweep.\"  Osborne, 495 U.S. at 112 (citation omitted). \r\nAs the Court has admonished, the overbreadth doctrine is \"strong\r\nmedicine\" that should be utilized \"only as a last resort.\"  Ferber,\r\n458 U.S. at 769 (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 613\r\n(1973)).  \r\nJudicial disinclination to employ the overbreadth\r\ndoctrine is rooted in several important considerations.  The first\r\nis an appreciation for the \"wide-reaching effects of striking down\r\na statute on its face.\"  Id.  Another related reason is that it may\r\nbe inefficient to do so: facial invalidation is unwarranted if the\r\nlikely number of lawful applications of the challenged statute far\r\noutstrips the few arguably problematic prosecutions under the law. \r\nIt makes little sense to strike down an entire statute in response\r\nto a facial attack when potential difficulties can be remedied in\r\nfuture cases through fact-specific as-applied challenges.  A third\r\nreason to hesitate before invoking the overbreadth doctrine is that\r\ndoing so may be unwise.  Deciding constitutional questions in the\r\nabstract is a recipe for making bad law.  See id. at 781 (Stevens,\r\nJ., concurring) (\"Hypothetical rulings are inherently treacherous\r\nand prone to lead us into unforeseen efforts; they are\r\nqualitatively less reliable than the products of case-by-case\r\nadjudication.\").\r\nThe key question, then, is whether the CPPA poses\r\nsubstantial problems of overbreadth sufficient to justify\r\noverturning the judgment of the lawmaking branches.  We conclude\r\nthat it does not.  We begin with the language of the statute.  To\r\nthe extent the CPPA criminalizes the possession, reproduction or\r\ndistribution of a visual representation of an actual minor engaged\r\nin sexual conduct, it falls easily within the parameters\r\nestablished by Ferber and Osborne.  The government's interests in\r\ndeterring the direct abuse of children and destroying the illicit\r\nchild pornography trade amply justify these steps, and the CPPA's\r\nmethods of eradicating such images are appropriate. \r\nWhether or not the prohibition of material that \"appears\r\nto be\" of a minor comports with the First Amendment is more\r\ntroublesome.  At first blush, potential problems threaten to doom\r\nthe law.  First and foremost, \"appears\" to whom?  The statute\r\nitself is silent as to whether the test is meant to be objective or\r\nsubjective or some combination of the two.  On its face, the\r\nstatute might also reach depictions with political, artistic,\r\nscientific, or educational value.  If so, it is unclear whether\r\nthat would be constitutionally permissible.  And if, as Hilton and\r\namici insist, the phrase \"appears to be a minor\" criminalizes\r\npossession of adult pornography created with models over the age of\r\nmajority who look youthful, this too might pose additional\r\nconstitutional difficulties. \r\nA correct interpretation of the \"appears to be a minor\"\r\nstandard and a full understanding of the interplay between the\r\nlegal protections afforded an individual, we believe, puts the bulk\r\nof these concerns to rest.  As to the breadth of the material\r\ncovered by the statute, Congress's statements provide us with a\r\nprecise and limited understanding of the \"appears to be\" language. \r\nWe are obligated to follow it.  \"Where a statute is susceptible of\r\ntwo constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful\r\nconstitutional questions arise and by the other of which such\r\nquestions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.\" \r\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224,   , 118 S. Ct.\r\n1219, 1234 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting United States\r\nex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware and Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366,\r\n408 (1909)); see also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 769 n.24 (\"When a federal\r\ncourt is dealing with a federal statute challenged as overbroad, it\r\nshould . . . construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems,\r\nif the statute is subject to such a limiting construction.\"); Viegav. McGee, 26 F.3d 1206, 1212 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"In the absence of\r\nclear legislative intent, we will not adopt an interpretation of a\r\nstatute that would render it constitutionally suspect.\").  \r\nWe take our cue from the legislative record, which makes\r\nplain that the new language was intended to target only a narrow\r\nclass of images   visual depictions \"which are virtually\r\nindistinguishable to unsuspecting viewers from unretouched\r\nphotographs of actual children engaging in identical sexual\r\nconduct.\"  S. Rep. 104-358, at pt. I, IV(B).  The Senate, in\r\nenacting S. 1237, explicitly stated that the \"appears to be\"\r\nlanguage \"applies to the same type of photographic images already\r\nprohibited, but which does not require the use of an actual minor\r\nin its production.\"  Id. at pt. IV(C).  The Senate clearly\r\nindicated that, by employing the phrase \"appears to be,\" it was\r\n\"extend[ing] [the prohibition against child pornography] from\r\nphotographic depictions of actual minors engaging in sexually\r\nexplicit conduct to the identical type of depiction, one which is\r\nvirtually indistinguishable from the banned photographic\r\ndepiction,\" and no further.  Id.  (Emphasis added).\r\nA few observations logically flow from this narrow\r\nconstruct.  The primary one is that Congress meant only to extend\r\nfederal authority in an important but limited fashion to a specific\r\nsubset of visual images   those which are easily mistaken for that\r\nof real children.  \r\nIt follows that drawings, cartoons, sculptures, and\r\npaintings depicting youthful persons in sexually explicit poses\r\nplainly lie beyond the reach of the Act.  By definition, they\r\nwould not be \"virtually indistinguishable\" from an image of an\r\nactual minor.  The CPPA therefore does not pose a threat to the\r\nvast majority of every day artistic expression, even to speech\r\ninvolving sexual themes.  \r\nHilton (and assorted amici) nevertheless insist that the\r\nFirst Amendment allows regulation of sexually explicit material\r\nonly where actual children are abused in its creation.  They also\r\ncontend that the statute is impermissibly expansive because it is\r\nvery difficult to determine whether a person looks 17 or 18; they\r\nbelieve that the statute is bound to criminalize possession of\r\nprotected adult pornography. \r\nTheir first argument amounts to an effort to draw a\r\nbright line in an area of law in which courts have resisted\r\ncreating clear-cut categories.  Relying on Ferber's discussion of\r\nthe importance of protecting children from sexual exploitation,\r\nthey argue that the Supreme Court has strictly limited regulation\r\nof child pornography to images manufactured with the use of live\r\nchildren.  But we find no firm basis for this overly restrictive\r\nreading of precedent.  We do not read the cases to say that\r\nCongress has power to remedy only the abuse of children during the\r\nprocess used to produce traditional forms of child pornography. \r\nWhile the Court certainly has been concerned with the \"surpassing\r\nimportance\" of protecting the actual abuse of children who appear\r\nin pornographic material, it has not limited the government's\r\nauthority to achieving that objective, and that objective alone. \r\nFerber, 458 U.S. at 757.  Rather, it has mandated that government\r\nbe permitted a certain degree of flexibility in how it chooses to\r\ngrapple with new problems presented by the evolving nature of the\r\nchild pornography industry.  See Osborne, 495 U.S. at 110.  The\r\ncases do suggest, however, that an appropriate set of governmental\r\ngoals (and the government's methods of fulfilling those goals)\r\nshould be reasonably related to the primary aim of \"safeguarding\r\nthe physical and psychological well-being\" of children, and, by\r\nextension, crippling the clandestine child pornography trade.  Id.at 109 (citation omitted). \r\nThe laws in force when the Court decided Ferber and\r\nOsborne uniformly defined child pornography by focusing on material\r\ninvolving the use of actual children.  The Court in those cases\r\nused, for purposes of its constitutional discussion, the statutory\r\ndefinition of child pornography then before it.  The legal issues\r\npresented in this case, including Congress's justifications offered\r\nfor extending child pornography statutes to stem the flow of\r\nvirtual child pornography, have not been analyzed by this, or any\r\nother, court of appeals.  \r\nWe think that it is a logical and permissible extension\r\nof the rationales in Ferber and Osborne to allow the regulation of\r\nsexual materials that appear to be of children but did not, in\r\nfact, involve the use of live children in their production.  Like\r\nsexually explicit material produced with actual children, there is\r\nlittle, if any, social value in this type of expression.  In\r\nconstitutional terms, sexually explicit material produced without\r\nthe benefit of a live child model but giving the appearance as if\r\nhad been is more akin to traditionally unprotected child\r\npornography than adult pornography.  The same is true of material\r\ncreated by having a youthful-looking adult pose as a minor that is\r\nsold or presented as though it contained a pornographic image of an\r\nactual minor.  Such depictions can be readily used so as to further\r\nthe child pornography trade or to facilitate the abuse of children.\r\nThe government's interest in safeguarding the welfare of\r\nchildren is compelling in these situations.  Computer-created or\r\nenhanced material can be bought, sold, or traded like any other\r\nform of child pornography, adding further fuel to the underground\r\nchild pornography industry.  It can be used just as effectively as\r\npictures of actual children to entice or blackmail children into\r\ncooperating with would-be abusers.  Moreover, the material may have\r\nbeen created through the abuse of an actual minor but altered so\r\nthat it may be impossible to show that a real child was ever\r\ninvolved in its creation.  As technology improves and access to\r\ntechnology increases, efforts to eradicate the child pornography\r\nindustry could be effectively frustrated if Congress were prevented\r\nfrom targeting sexually explicit material that \"appears to be\" of\r\nreal children.  The government's interest in addressing these forms\r\nof child pornography is no less powerful than in instances where an\r\nactual child is actually used and abused during the production\r\nprocess.  We will not second-guess Congress's decision to address\r\nthe social ills posed by the various types of virtual child\r\npornography.  \r\nHilton's and amici's next objection also misses the mark. \r\nThey maintain that the inherent difficulty of determining whether\r\na depicted person \"appears to be\" 17 or 18 renders the definition\r\noverly broad.  They fear that persons will be convicted of\r\npossessing sexually explicit material of adults who look or dress\r\nin a youthful manner.  We think this danger is overstated.  The\r\nmain flaw in the argument is its inordinate focus on the arguably\r\nfuzzy line between age 17 and 18, a line which, as with many laws,\r\nmust be drawn somewhere.  More importantly, we are satisfied that\r\nthe vast majority of prosecutions under the \"appears to be a minor\"\r\nprovision would involve images of pre-pubescent children or persons\r\nwho otherwise clearly appear to be under the age of 18.  Congress,\r\nrelying on the opinion of experts, has determined that purveyors of\r\nchild pornography usually cater to pedophiles, who by definition\r\nhave a predilection for pre-pubertal children.  See S. Rep. 104-\r\n358, at  2, pts. IV(A), (C).  The apparent age of a pre-pubescent\r\nchild can easily be established through objective proof.  While it\r\nis theoretically possible that there may be prosecutions of\r\nindividuals selling or possessing images of youthful-looking\r\nadults, it is unlikely that they would comprise a substantial\r\nproportion of the prosecutions under the statute.  \r\nThe existence of a few possibly impermissible\r\napplications of the Act does not warrant its condemnation.  As the\r\nCourt has repeatedly made plain, even if a statute at its margins\r\ninfringes on protected activity, the solution is not invalidation\r\nof the entire scheme.  See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 488\r\n(1988) (declining to evaluate all \"hypothetical applications\" of\r\nordinance in resolving facial challenge).  Whatever overbreadth may\r\nexist at the edges are more appropriately cured through a more\r\nprecise case-by-case evaluation of the facts in a given case.  SeeNew York State Club Assoc., Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1,\r\n14 (1988).\r\nWe recognize that the Court has said that adult models\r\nmay be employed under certain circumstances to simulate minors\r\nposing in a sexually provocative manner for serious artistic,\r\neducational, or scientific purposes.  Indeed, in Ferber, the Court\r\nobserved that \"if it were necessary for literary or artistic value,\r\na person over the statutory age who perhaps looked younger could be\r\nutilized.\"  458 U.S. at 763; see also X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at\r\n72 (\"[N]on-obscene, sexually explicit materials involving persons\r\nover the age of 17 are protected by the First Amendment.\").  \r\nTake, for example, a film version of Nabokov's Lolita. \r\nA director might legitimately wish to employ a youthful-looking\r\nadult to portray, in a non-obscene manner, a sexual encounter\r\nbetween Lolita and Humbert.  Similarly, use of an adult model to\r\nsimulate the sexual behavior of a child might be necessary for\r\nscientific research.  The social value of these works obviously\r\ncould not be shrugged off as de minimis.  They would be far from\r\nthe \"hardest core of child pornography.\"  Ferber, 458 U.S. at 761. \r\nThe First Amendment interest in permitting dissemination of such\r\nmaterial would be sufficiently strong to warrant its protection.  \r\nAt the same time, the government's countervailing interest in\r\nprotecting children \"is likely to be far less compelling\" when \"the\r\ndepiction is a serious contribution to art or science.\"  Id. at 776\r\n(Brennan, J., concurring).  Should the government decide to\r\nprosecute someone for distributing or possessing such material, we\r\nbelieve there would be an affirmative First Amendment defense\r\navailable to the accused, although we need not define now its\r\nprecise dimensions.  Recognizing such a defense is consistent with\r\nCongress's general view that the law generally \"does not, and is\r\nnot intended to, apply to a depiction produced using adults\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct, even where a depicted\r\nindividual may appear to be a minor.\"  S. Rep. 104-358, at pt.\r\nIV(C).  It is also consonant with the Court's teachings in Ferber,\r\nwhere the Court assumed that even if in some rare instance the\r\ndepiction of children performing sexual acts might be necessary for\r\nliterary or artistic reasons, \"a person over the statutory age who\r\nperhaps looked younger could be utilized.\"  458 U.S. at 763. \r\nWe need not fully explore the details of this exception\r\ntoday.  Suffice it to say that the existence of a tiny fraction of\r\nmaterial that could conceivably qualify for heightened protection\r\nbut might nevertheless fall within the purview of the Act (i.e.,\r\nwhere youthful adults pose as children for sexually provocative\r\nimages with redeeming social value) does not render the statute as\r\na whole substantially overbroad.  The appropriate remedy is\r\nreversal of an unconstitutional conviction should the circumstance\r\narise, not invalidation of the statute in toto at this stage. \r\nOnce the phrase \"appears to be a minor\" is properly\r\nunderstood, the constitutional barriers fall away.  The fear of a\r\nchilling effect on protected speech subsides.  We conclude,\r\ntherefore, that the CPPA is not unconstitutionally overbroad.\r\n                           V\r\nWe next consider whether the district court erred in\r\nholding the CPPA unconstitutionally vague.  The touchstone of our\r\nsystem of justice is the right to fair warning of criminal charges. \r\nAn ambiguous law fails to provide the requisite notice and\r\nundermines public confidence that the laws are equally enforced.\r\nThe standard for overturning a law on vagueness grounds\r\nis a stringent one.  A statute will not be held void for vagueness\r\nunless it fails to \"define the criminal offense with sufficient\r\ndefiniteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is\r\nprohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary or\r\ndiscriminatory enforcement.\"  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357; see alsoUnited States v. Bohai Trading Co., 45 F.3d 577, 580 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (proper inquiry is whether statute \"provide[s] a\r\nconstitutionally adequate warning to those whose activities are\r\ngoverned\") (citation omitted).  When a law directly impinges on\r\nfreedom of expression, as the CPPA does here, we must scrutinize\r\nthe law with an even more skeptical eye.  We are obliged do so\r\nbecause the threat of severe criminal sanctions and the full force\r\nof social stigma, coupled with uncertain notice of criminal\r\nliability offered by a poorly-worded statute, \"may well cause\r\nspeakers to remain silent rather than communicate even arguably\r\nunlawful words, ideas, and images.\"  Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. at   ,\r\n117 S. Ct. at 2345.\r\nThe district court found the CPPA unduly vague because it\r\nbelieved the \"appears to be a minor\" standard to be purely\r\nsubjective in nature.  To the contrary, we hold that the standard\r\nis an objective one.  A jury must decide, based on the totality of\r\nthe circumstances, whether a reasonable unsuspecting viewer would\r\nconsider the depiction to be of an actual individual less than 18\r\nengaged in sexual activity.  See S. Rep. 104-358, at pt. IV(C).\r\nWithout limiting a priori the type of evidence that would\r\nbe admissible on this question in a given case, the following proof\r\ncould be offered to establish the apparent age of the person shown:\r\nthe physical characteristics of the person; expert testimony as to\r\nthe physical development of the depicted person; how the disk,\r\nfile, or video was labeled or marked by the creator or the\r\ndistributor of the image, or the defendant himself, see, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Robinson, 137 F.3d 652, 652 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(photographs labeled by names, dates taken, and ages of boys\r\ndepicted); and the manner in which the image was described,\r\ndisplayed, or advertised.  While this list is hardly exhaustive, it\r\ngives a flavor of the ways in which a depicted person's apparent\r\nage might be objectively proven.\r\nThe element of scienter also must be satisfied by the\r\nprosecution before a valid conviction may be obtained   for\r\ninstance, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nan individual \"knowingly\" possessed the child pornography.  See 18\r\nU.S.C.  2252A(a)(5)(B).  This statutory requirement serves as an\r\nadditional safeguard, for the government must show not only that\r\nthe individual purposefully acquired or distributed the material,\r\nbut that he did so believing that the material was sexually\r\nexplicit in nature and that it depicted a person who appeared to\r\nhim to be (or that he anticipated would be) under 18 years old. \r\nSee X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. at 78 (holding that scienter\r\nrequirement in related anti-child pornography statute \"extends to\r\nboth the sexually explicit nature of the material and to the age of\r\nthe performers\"). \r\nThe CPPA offers an added measure of protection.  It\r\nprovides an affirmative defense if the person depicted actually was\r\nan adult at the time the image was created.  When the defense is\r\nappropriate, the fact that the person depicted was a live model at\r\nleast 18 years of age typically will lead to dismissal of the\r\ncharge.  Although Congress did not make the affirmative defense\r\navailable to someone accused of unlawful possession (as opposed to\r\nany of the other offenses such as distribution), what an individual\r\nactually believed to be the age of the depicted person still goes\r\nto his state of mind in possessing the material.  Thus, a defendant\r\nwho honestly believes that the individual depicted in the image\r\nappears to be 18 years old or older (and is believed by a jury), or\r\nwho can show that he knew the images were created by having\r\nyouthful-looking adults pose for them, must be acquitted, so long\r\nas the image was not presented or marketed as if it contained a\r\nreal minor.  \r\nWe believe, in short, that the statute's provisions\r\n\"suitably limit\" the reach of the Act so that a person of ordinary\r\nintelligence can easily discern likely unlawful conduct and conform\r\nhis or her conduct appropriately.  The statute carefully defines\r\nthe term \"minor.\"  The scope of its prohibition, like the law\r\nevaluated in Ferber, is restricted to visual images.  The statute\r\ndescribes, in painstaking detail, the types of sexually explicit\r\ndepictions of children that are forbidden.  As the Court said in\r\nOsborne, such limiting language \"avoid[s] penalizing persons for\r\nviewing or possessing innocuous photographs of naked children.\" \r\n495 U.S. at 114.  \r\nWe disagree with the district court's assumption that the\r\nuse of a legal standard requiring an evaluation of the appearance\r\nof an image renders the test arbitrary or overly susceptible to\r\nmanipulation.  Reasonable objective assessments of the impression\r\nconveyed by a person's actions or how an image \"appears\" are\r\nroutinely made by judges and juries.  See, e.g., Liteky v. United\r\nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 553 n.2 (1994) (noting that recusal motions\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  455(a) are governed by \"objective appearance of\r\npartiality\" test); Ferber, 458 U.S. at 751 (approved definition of\r\nchild pornography banned \"simulated\" sexual conduct, which in\r\nordinary usage means \"to have or take on the appearance of\");\r\nMiller, 413 U.S. at 24 (obscenity depends in part on whether\r\nmaterial appeals to prurient interest of average person).\r\nYet Hilton returns to a familiar refrain: that it is\r\nterribly difficult to distinguish between an apparent 17 year old\r\nand an apparent 18 year old.  This problem, he argues, renders the\r\nstatute unduly vague (as well as overbroad).  We think not.  As\r\ndiscussed earlier, any number of objective signs should be enough\r\nto warn an ordinary viewer of sexually explicit material of the\r\napparent age of the person depicted, including his or her physical\r\ncharacteristics and how the image is labeled or marketed.  And\r\nthose involved in the production of lawful sexually explicit\r\nmaterial can easily protect themselves by verifying the ages of the\r\nmodels they employ or by taking steps to visually demonstrate that\r\na computer-generated image is meant to portray an adult. \r\nThere is another reason why Hilton's vagueness challenge\r\nfails: there are few equally efficacious alternatives.  At oral\r\nargument, defense counsel suggested that a better approach would be\r\nto prohibit images of persons who are or appear to be \"physically\r\nsexually immature.\"  Such a test, had Congress selected it, might\r\nvery well have been more precise than the one Congress chose to\r\nadopt, which turns on the age or apparent age of the person\r\ndepicted.  It is often said that because we are \"[c]ondemned to the\r\nuse of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our\r\nlanguage.\"  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 109 (1972). \r\nThat lesson applies here. \r\nBut even if the proffered standard were more exact, there\r\nwould still be a more fundamental problem   it would fail to reach\r\na whole category of persons Congress intended to protect, namely,\r\nthose youngsters who appear \"physically sexually mature\" but are\r\nunder the age of consent.  We reject the suggestion that Congress\r\nmust be confined to addressing pornographic images of some\r\nchildren, but not others.  Firmly satisfied that it is well within\r\nCongress's power to regulate virtual pornography of minors of all\r\nages (infancy through age of majority as set by the legislature),\r\nwe are aware of few other linguistic approaches that would achieve\r\nthe same goals.  Defendant's proposal does not fit the bill.  The\r\n\"appears to be a minor\" test, by comparison, is sufficiently\r\nprecise to pass constitutional muster and yet flexible enough to\r\nmeet the challenges posed by computerized child pornography. \r\nWe see no reason to strike down the CPPA as\r\nunconstitutionally vague.  The language of the statute affords an\r\nordinary consumer of sexually explicit material adequate notice of\r\nthe kinds of images to avoid.  The interaction between the\r\napplicable legal standards, moreover, offers the average person\r\nadditional protection.  These safeguards, working in concert,\r\nminimize the danger that this law might be enforced in an arbitrary\r\nor discriminatory fashion by overzealous police officers or\r\nprosecutors.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is reversed.\n",

In 1996, Congress enacted\r\nthe Child Pornography Prevention Act (the \"CPPA\"), 18 U.S.C.\r\n2252A, to attack the rise of computerized or \"virtual\" child\r\npornography.  These images may take many forms   a photograph of\r\na real child may be scanned and replicated, an innocent picture of\r\na child may be manipulated by computer to create a sexually-\r\noriented photo, or a fake child (ranging from a simple cartoon\r\ncharacter to a high-resolution image resembling a real child) can\r\nbe generated wholly by computer graphics.  \r\nThe law prohibits, inter alia, knowing possession of\r\nvisual images depicting minors or those who \"appear to be\" minors\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct.  This case presents\r\nconstitutional issues of first impression in this circuit:  whether\r\nthe CPPA's definition of child pornography is so overbroad as to\r\ncontravene the First Amendment or so vague as to violate due\r\nprocess. \r\nIn resolving defendant David Hilton's motion to dismiss\r\nthe indictment in his favor, the United States District Court for\r\nthe District of Maine answered both questions in the affirmative. \r\nThe court was troubled by a perceived difficulty in determining\r\nwhether a depicted person appeared to be under 18 years old and by\r\nits belief that the statute impermissibly criminalizes possession\r\nof adult pornography. \r\nWe reverse.  We hold that the law, properly construed,\r\nsurvives Hilton's facial constitutional challenge.  It neither\r\nimpinges substantially on protected expression nor is so vague as\r\nto offend due process. \r\n                           I\r\nWe assess the constitutionality of the CPPA de novo.  SeeUnited States v.

In\r\ndoing so, we must carefully consider fundamental constitutional\r\nnorms in light of recent technological advances to determine\r\nwhether Congress's objectives and the statutory scheme it has\r\nestablished are in accord with our constitutional design.\r\nWe begin by providing an overview of the CPPA and by\r\nconsidering the underlying legislative purposes of the Act.  \r\nCongress enacted the CPPA to modernize federal law by enhancing its\r\nability to combat child pornography in the cyberspace era.  See S.\r\nRep. No. 104-358, at pt. I (1996) (declaring that statute addresses\r\n\"problem of 'high-tech kiddie porn'\").  Lawmakers wished to improve\r\nlaw enforcement tools to keep pace with technological improvements\r\nthat have made it possible for child pornographers to use computers\r\nto \"morph\" or alter innocent images of actual children to create a\r\ncomposite image showing them in sexually explicit poses.  Through\r\nreadily available desktop computer programs, one can even create a\r\nrealistic picture of an imaginary child engaged in sexual activity\r\nand pass off that creation as an image of a real child. \r\nThe statute's operative provisions, taken together,\r\ncriminalize the reproduction, possession, sale, and distribution of\r\nchild pornography.  See 18 U.S.C.  2252A(a).  They also prohibit\r\nthe pandering of material as child pornography by making it a crime\r\nto advertise, promote, or present material \"in such a manner that\r\nit conveys the impression that the material is, or contains\" child\r\npornography.  18 U.S.C.  2256(8)(D).  \r\nThe statute defines child pornography as: \r\nany visual depiction, including any photo-\r\ngraph, film, video, picture, or computer or\r\ncomputer-generated image or picture, whether\r\nmade or produced by electronic, mechanical, or\r\nother means, of sexually explicit conduct,\r\nwhere   (A) the production of such visual\r\ndepiction involves the use of a minor engaging\r\nin sexually explicit conduct; (B) such visual\r\ndepiction is, or appears to be, of a minor\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct;\r\n(C) such visual depiction has been created,\r\nadapted, or modified to appear that an\r\nidentifiable minor is engaging in sexually\r\nexplicit conduct; or (D) such visual depiction\r\nis advertised, promoted, presented, described,\r\nor distributed in such a manner that conveys\r\nthe impression that the material is or\r\ncontains a visual depiction of a minor\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct . . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  2256(8).  A \"visual depiction\" includes   but is not\r\nnecessarily limited to   \"undeveloped film and videotape, and data\r\nstored on computer disk or by electronic means which is capable of\r\nconversion into a visual image.\"  18 U.S.C.  2256(5).  A \"minor,\"\r\nin turn, means \"any person under the age of eighteen years.\"  18\r\nU.S.C.  2256(1).  Sexually explicit conduct is described as\r\n\"actual or simulated   (A) sexual intercourse, including genital-\r\ngenital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between\r\npersons of the same sex or opposite sex; (B) bestiality; (C)\r\nmasturbation; (D) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or (E) lascivious\r\nexhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n2256(2).  \r\nThere is some overlap in the definition of child\r\npornography   material created by manipulating an image of an\r\n\"identifiable minor\" would typically, but not necessarily, appear\r\nto be of a minor; similarly, an image showing an actual minor would\r\nprobably also \"appear to be a minor.\"  On the other hand, images of\r\na purely fictional child might only satisfy the \"appears to be a\r\nminor\" test.  Under the statutory framework established by\r\nCongress, a defendant charged with unlawful distribution or sale\r\nwould be entitled to a complete defense by showing that the person\r\ndepicted actually was an adult (provided that the material was not\r\npromoted or presented to give the impression that it depicts an\r\nactual minor).  See 18 U.S.C.  2252A(c).  The affirmative defense\r\nis not made available, however, to those charged with unlawful\r\npossession of child pornography. \r\nCongress broadened the scope of federal anti-child\r\npornography statutes to address a set of related concerns aimed at\r\nthe ultimate goal of destroying the underground supply of child\r\npornography in all of its manifestations.  First, the legislature\r\ndesired to reduce the sheer volume of computerized child\r\npornography that could be used by child molesters and pedophiles to\r\n\"stimulate or whet their own sexual appetites.\"  S. Rep. 104-358,\r\nat pt. IV(B). \r\nSecond, Congress sought to ban computer-generated images\r\nthat are \"virtually indistinguishable\" from those of real children,\r\nbut are made without live children.  Id.  These images can be\r\ncreated with very little expense, and often are bought, sold, or\r\ntraded in the same manner as images created through the use of real\r\nchildren.  They can be downloaded from Internet Web sites, viewed\r\non computer screens, or stored on hard drives or floppy disks for\r\nlater use.  Until now, such materials were largely beyond the reach\r\nof federal law, which had focused on representations of actual\r\nminors. \r\nThird, the new law was designed to protect the privacy of\r\nactual children whose innocuous images are altered to create\r\nsexually explicit pictures.  Lawmakers hoped to deter the creation\r\nof such invasive material and encourage the destruction of that\r\nwhich currently exists.  See id. at  2(7). \r\nFourth, Congress wished to deprive child abusers of a\r\n\"criminal tool\" frequently used to facilitate the sexual abuse of\r\nchildren.  After hearing from an array of experts, Congress\r\nspecifically found that virtual pornography created without the\r\ninvolvement of real minors (often via computer technology alone) is\r\nincreasingly used by pedophiles and child molesters to seduce or\r\nentice children into participating in sexual activity by breaking\r\ndown their natural inhibitions.  Congress determined that \"a child\r\nwho is reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to\r\npose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced\r\nby viewing depictions of other children 'having fun' participating\r\nin such activity.\"  Id. at 2(3).  This material is routinely used\r\nto instruct children how to perform certain sexual acts.  Images\r\nmade by manipulating an innocent picture of a real child to show\r\nsexual conduct can also be used to blackmail that child into\r\nsubmitting to abuse and remaining in fearful silence about it. \r\nCongress deemed the threat of these forms of physical and emotional\r\nabuse to be as grave as when images of real children are used, for\r\na child shown a computer-generated image cannot be expected to know\r\nwhether the child portrayed in an image is that of a real child or\r\nmerely a fanciful creation.\r\n                           II\r\nWe recount the relatively short history of this case.  On\r\nDecember 17, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted Hilton for\r\ncriminal possession of computer disks containing three or more\r\nimages of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n2252A(a)(5)(B).  Well before trial, Hilton moved to dismiss the\r\nindictment, mounting solely a facial attack on the CPPA.  He argued\r\nthat the statute, by its terms, was unconstitutionally vague and\r\noverbroad, and therefore unenforceable. \r\nOn March 26, 1998, the United States District Court for\r\nthe District of Maine agreed.  The court determined that the CPPA\r\nwas a content-neutral regulation \"designed to ameliorate\r\nsignificant harmful secondary effects of the protected speech\r\nrather than suppress the speech itself.\"  United States v. Hilton,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2267439\"><a href=\"/opinion/2267439/united-states-v-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (D. Me. 1998).  Nevertheless, the court\r\nconcluded that the statutory definition of \"child pornography\" was\r\nboth vague and overbroad.  It found the \"appears to be a minor\"\r\nlanguage overly subjective, creating \"substantial uncertainty for\r\nviewers presented with materials depicting post-pubescent\r\nindividuals\" because it may be difficult to distinguish between\r\nteenagers and young adults.  Id. at 136.  The court further found\r\nthe definition unconstitutionally overbroad, impacting a\r\n\"significant amount of adult pornography featuring adults who\r\nappear youthful.\"  Id. at 137.  Despite holding this portion of the\r\nCPPA's definition of child pornography unconstitutional, the\r\ndistrict court made no effort to ascertain the impact of its ruling\r\non the statute as a whole by examining and applying the statute's\r\nseverability clause.  Instead, it simply dismissed the indictment. \r\nThe government now appeals.\r\n                          III\r\nThe government attacks the district court's analysis in\r\nseveral critical respects.  It first questions the lower court's\r\nconclusion that the statute is overbroad.  In its view, the CPPA\r\ndoes not reach innocuous pictures of children or criminalize\r\nprotected adult pornography.  The government also takes issue with\r\nthe district court's determination that the Act is too vague.  The\r\ngovernment urges us to hold that the statute allows persons of\r\nordinary intelligence to determine what types of material are\r\nbanned and to conform their conduct accordingly.  To require\r\nfurther specificity, it insists, would be not only impractical, but\r\nunrealistic.  Additionally, the government asks us to deem the\r\n\"appears to be a minor\" standard to be grounded in prosecutorial\r\nnecessity because it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,\r\nfor an expert to discern whether an image is one of a real child. \r\nThe broadening of the definition of child pornography is critical,\r\nthe government argues, because in more and more cases involving\r\nvirtual child pornography, the prosecution is unable to prove that\r\nreal children under a specified age are depicted.  \r\nWe turn our attention to familiar constitutional terrain. \r\nThe First Amendment declares that \"Congress shall make no law . .\r\n. abridging freedom of speech.\"  U.S. Const., amend. I.  We offer\r\na few words about the doctrines that have developed over time to\r\ngive meaning to the protective force of the First Amendment.  In\r\ngeneral, laws that aim only to prescribe the conditions under which\r\ncertain speech may be carried out may be upheld as neutral time,\r\nplace or manner restrictions.  See United States v. Grace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110918\"><a href=\"/opinion/110918/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 (1983) (\"[T]he government may enforce reasonable time,\r\nplace, and manner regulations as long as the restrictions 'are\r\ncontent neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant\r\ngovernment interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of\r\ncommunication.'\") (citation omitted).  But a statute or regulation\r\nthat discriminates based on the content of the speech itself\r\ntypically must comport with the following standards to survive a\r\nconstitutional challenge:  it must be (1) animated by one or more\r\ncompelling state interests; and (2) narrowly tailored toward\r\nfulfilling those concerns.  Nevertheless, certain types of\r\nexpression   chief among them fighting words, libel, and obscenity\r\nare unprotected altogether.  See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383-85 (1992).  Child pornography falls into the category\r\nof unprotected speech.  See New York v. Ferber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764\r\n(1982).  Finally, an otherwise valid law may be so overbroad that\r\nit encroaches on protected expression or so vague that prosecuting\r\na person under the statute would effectively deprive that person of\r\ndue process of law.  See Kolender v. Lawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110926\"><a href=\"/opinion/110926/kolender-v-lawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357-58\r\n(1983).   \r\nFor the sake of clarifying this area of law, we find it\r\nnecessary to point out that the district court misapplied the time,\r\nplace or manner doctrine by mistaking the CPPA for a content-\r\nneutral law.  A distinct line of cases upholds reasonably-crafted\r\nregulations where the state acts not to suppress certain speech but\r\nto direct, in a content-neutral way, how or when that speech may be\r\nexpressed in the public sphere.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nKokinda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112486\"><a href=\"/opinion/112486/united-states-v-kokinda/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990) (upholding federal regulation\r\nprohibiting solicitation on postal property).  Still, \"[a]ny\r\nrestriction on speech, the application of which turns on the\r\ncontent of the speech, is a content-based restriction regardless of\r\nthe motivation that lies behind it.\"  Boos v. Barry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112027\"><a href=\"/opinion/112027/boos-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n335-36 (1988) (Brennan, J., concurring).  Of course, if a law is\r\ndirected at the impact of the speech on its viewers, it cannot be\r\nevaluated as a time, place or manner restriction.  See Reno v.\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118147\"><a href=\"/opinion/118147/reno-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n2342-43 (1997) (rejecting argument that Communications Decency Act,\r\nwhich banned on-line transmission of \"obscene or indecent\"\r\nmessages, was time, place or manner regulation); Forsyth County v.\r\nNationalist Movement, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112767\"><a href=\"/opinion/112767/forsyth-county-v-nationalist-movement/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 (1992) (\"Listeners'\r\nreaction to speech is not a content-neutral basis for\r\nregulation.\"). \r\nThe CPPA fails both tests for substantive neutrality: it\r\nexpressly aims to curb a particular category of expression (child\r\npornography) by singling out that type of expression based on its\r\ncontent and banning it.  Blanket suppression of an entire type of\r\nspeech is by its very nature a content-discriminating act. \r\nFurthermore, Congress has not kept secret that one of its\r\nmotivating reasons for enacting the CPPA was to counter the primary\r\neffect child pornography has on those who view it.  See S. Rep.\r\n104-358, at pt. III, IV(A) (reflecting congressional concern that\r\na \"child molester or pedophile [may use] the material to whet his\r\nsexual appetites,\" that child pornography \"poisons the minds and\r\nspirits of our youth,\" and that, if shown to children, the material\r\nmay \"make children more susceptible of acceding to sexual demands\r\nof would-be abusers); see also id. at pt. IV(B) (observing that \"a\r\nmajor part of the threat to children posed by child pornography is\r\nits effect on the viewers of such material\").  For these related\r\nreasons, the child pornography law is plainly activated by a\r\n\"content-based classification of speech.\"  Ferber, 458 U.S. at 763. \r\nMoreover, the statute makes no effort to permit\r\nalternative methods of disseminating or possessing the material in\r\nquestion.  In this respect, the district court also erred in\r\nfinding that adequate alternative avenues of expression exist.  The\r\nCPPA is a quintessential content-specific statute, and therefore\r\ncannot be properly understood as a time, place or manner\r\nregulation. \r\nBut to say that the CPPA is content-based does not end\r\nthe matter, for it is well-settled that child pornography, an\r\nunprotected category of expression identified by its content, may\r\nbe freely regulated.  We are asked to determine: first, whether the\r\nstatute's definition of child pornography, expanded in an effort to\r\noutlaw computerized child pornography, satisfies the First\r\nAmendment; and second, assuming its sweep is appropriate, whether\r\nthe law is adequately precise as to provide fair warning. \r\nTo resolve these issues, we start by reviewing the\r\nSupreme Court's pronouncements on the government's power to\r\nregulate child pornography.  In Ferber, the Supreme Court first\r\nupheld the constitutionality of a state law proscribing the\r\ndistribution of material depicting sexual performances by children\r\nunder the age of 16.  See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  In doing so, it carved out\r\nan entire category of speech \"which, like obscenity, is unprotected\r\nby the First Amendment.\"  Id. at 764.  The Court likened child\r\npornography to obscenity in that both kinds of expression may be\r\nbanned, but explained that because of the state's \"compelling\r\ninterest in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation\r\nof children,\" see id. at 761, a law regulating child pornography\r\nneed not adhere mechanistically to the three-part test for\r\nobscenity originally enunciated in Miller v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108838\"><a href=\"/opinion/108838/miller-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).  One reason for allowing a departure from the obscenity\r\nrule and, as a result, somewhat greater authority to regulate child\r\npornography is that \"a work which . . . contains serious literary,\r\nartistic, political, or scientific value may nevertheless embody\r\nthe hardest core of child pornography.\"  Id. \r\nThe Ferber Court did not establish a single one-size-\r\nfits-all constitutional definition of child pornography (as the\r\nCourt arguably has done for obscenity), but provided general\r\nguiding principles.  Ultimately, to pass constitutional muster, a\r\nparticular anti-child pornography statute must be \"adequately\r\ndefined.\"  458 U.S. at 764.  In Ferber, the Court pointed out that\r\nNew York's prohibition was confined to works that \"visually depict\r\nsexual conduct by children below a specified age.\"  Id. (Emphasis\r\nin original).  It was also persuaded that the law's definition of\r\nsexual activity was \"suitably limited and described.\" Id.\r\nThe Court further developed the contours of its child\r\npornography jurisprudence in Osborne v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112417\"><a href=\"/opinion/112417/osborne-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). \r\nThere, the Court evaluated a state law prohibiting the possession\r\nand viewing of material depicting a nude minor \"where such nudity\r\nconstitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the\r\ngenitals.\"  A defendant charged with unlawful possession attacked\r\nthe statute as overbroad and vague.  Rebuffing his twin challenges,\r\nthe Court found that the statute was not aimed at controlling a\r\nperson's private thoughts, but had been enacted to \"protect victims\r\nof child pornography\" and to \"destroy[] a market for the\r\nexploitative use of children.\"  495 U.S. at 109.  The Osborne Court\r\nexplicitly approved the following legislative goals:  stamping out\r\nchild pornography because it often serves as a record of abuse of\r\nreal children; and denying pedophiles and would-be child abusers\r\naccess to child pornography, which could be used to seduce or\r\ncoerce children into sexual activity.  See id. at 110-11.  The\r\nformer remains intricately tied to the need to protect real\r\nchildren represented in the pictures, but the latter marks a\r\nsubtle, yet crucial, extension of a state's legitimate interest to\r\nthe protection of children not actually depicted in prohibited\r\nimages. \r\nAs these cases demonstrate, the line between unprotected\r\nchild pornography and otherwise protected expression (including\r\npossession of adult pornography, see Stanley v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107898\"><a href=\"/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1969)) is not entirely tangle-free.  Nonetheless, four lessons\r\ncan be drawn from the decisions.\r\nFirst, sexually explicit material may be seen to fall\r\nalong a constitutional continuum entitling it to varying degrees of\r\nprotection.  At one end of the spectrum, pictures of actual\r\nchildren in sexually compromising positions, deemed to have little\r\nor no social value, are entitled to no constitutional protection. \r\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, non-obscene images involving\r\nactual adults are entitled to full protection.  Sexually explicit\r\nmaterial created without the benefit of a live child model but\r\nwhich appears to depict an actual minor, or produced by having an\r\nadult pose as a minor and later presented or sold as if it depicted\r\nas an actual minor, arguably falls somewhere in between. \r\nSecond, considerations beyond preventing the direct abuse\r\nof actual children can qualify as compelling government objectives\r\nwhere child pornography is concerned.  When child pornography is\r\nthe target, government is justified in not only driving it from the\r\nmarketplace through aggressive anti-trafficking laws, but\r\nforbidding the private possession or personal viewing of these\r\nproducts altogether.  See Osborne, 495 U.S. at 110 (approving of\r\nstate's efforts to \"stamp out this vice at all levels in the\r\ndistribution chain\").  In this sense, concerns about how adults may\r\nuse child pornography vis-a-vis children and how children might\r\nbehave after viewing it legitimately inform legislators' collective\r\ndecision to ban this material. \r\nThird, in effecting such a prohibition, a criminal\r\nstatute must cabin government authority by \"adequately defin[ing]\"\r\nthe type of image that is to be forbidden.  The cases require not\r\nonly that the term \"minor\" be defined, but also that the type of\r\ncondemned sexual depiction be carefully described.  \r\nFourth, wherever the constitutional demarcation is to be\r\nproperly drawn, \"greater leeway\" ought to be afforded legislatures\r\nto regulate sexual depictions of children.  Ferber, 458 U.S. at\r\n756.  The Court's instruction to federal courts to permit Congress\r\nslightly more room to operate in this area is bolstered by its view\r\nthat \"[t]he value of permitting . . . photographic reproductions of\r\nchildren engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if\r\nnot de minimis.\"  Id. at 762.  As a result, some discretion has\r\nbeen given legislatures to set out the parameters of anti-\r\npornography restrictions.  For instance, the Court has repeatedly\r\nacknowledged that states have latitude to set the age at which an\r\nimage is of a child rather than an adult.  See, e.g., United Statesv. X-Citement Video, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1994) (upholding\r\nfederal law that employs 18 as age of majority); Ferber, 458 U.S.\r\nat 749 (law set age of majority at 16).  Congress and statehouses\r\nhave some leeway in defining the kind of sexual depiction to be\r\nproscribed as well.  See X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at 78-79\r\n(holding that it is constitutionally permissible to use either\r\nformulation   \"lewd\" or \"lascivious\" display of children's\r\ngenitals). \r\nWith this analytic framework in mind, we turn to the task\r\nof assessing the constitutionality of the CPPA.  The initial step\r\nis to ascertain the general scope of the statutory definition of\r\nchild pornography, a task of pure statutory interpretation. \r\nComparison of the law with prevailing constitutional precepts then\r\nfollows.   \r\n                          IV \r\nWe first evaluate the district court's conclusion that\r\nthe CPPA is unconstitutionally overbroad.  Overbroad statutes by\r\ntheir nature present a host of difficulties for our system of\r\nordered liberty, not the least of which is a chilling effect on the\r\ncommunication of lawful ideas.  But a statute will not be\r\ninvalidated as overbroad unless its overbreadth is \"real, but\r\nsubstantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly\r\nlegitimate sweep.\"  Osborne, 495 U.S. at 112 (citation omitted). \r\nAs the Court has admonished, the overbreadth doctrine is \"strong\r\nmedicine\" that should be utilized \"only as a last resort.\"  Ferber,\r\n458 U.S. at 769 (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613\r\n(1973)).  \r\nJudicial disinclination to employ the overbreadth\r\ndoctrine is rooted in several important considerations.  The first\r\nis an appreciation for the \"wide-reaching effects of striking down\r\na statute on its face.\"  Id.  Another related reason is that it may\r\nbe inefficient to do so: facial invalidation is unwarranted if the\r\nlikely number of lawful applications of the challenged statute far\r\noutstrips the few arguably problematic prosecutions under the law. \r\nIt makes little sense to strike down an entire statute in response\r\nto a facial attack when potential difficulties can be remedied in\r\nfuture cases through fact-specific as-applied challenges.  A third\r\nreason to hesitate before invoking the overbreadth doctrine is that\r\ndoing so may be unwise.  Deciding constitutional questions in the\r\nabstract is a recipe for making bad law.  See id. at 781 (Stevens,\r\nJ., concurring) (\"Hypothetical rulings are inherently treacherous\r\nand prone to lead us into unforeseen efforts; they are\r\nqualitatively less reliable than the products of case-by-case\r\nadjudication.\").\r\nThe key question, then, is whether the CPPA poses\r\nsubstantial problems of overbreadth sufficient to justify\r\noverturning the judgment of the lawmaking branches.  We conclude\r\nthat it does not.  We begin with the language of the statute.  To\r\nthe extent the CPPA criminalizes the possession, reproduction or\r\ndistribution of a visual representation of an actual minor engaged\r\nin sexual conduct, it falls easily within the parameters\r\nestablished by Ferber and Osborne.  The government's interests in\r\ndeterring the direct abuse of children and destroying the illicit\r\nchild pornography trade amply justify these steps, and the CPPA's\r\nmethods of eradicating such images are appropriate. \r\nWhether or not the prohibition of material that \"appears\r\nto be\" of a minor comports with the First Amendment is more\r\ntroublesome.  At first blush, potential problems threaten to doom\r\nthe law.  First and foremost, \"appears\" to whom?  The statute\r\nitself is silent as to whether the test is meant to be objective or\r\nsubjective or some combination of the two.  On its face, the\r\nstatute might also reach depictions with political, artistic,\r\nscientific, or educational value.  If so, it is unclear whether\r\nthat would be constitutionally permissible.  And if, as Hilton and\r\namici insist, the phrase \"appears to be a minor\" criminalizes\r\npossession of adult pornography created with models over the age of\r\nmajority who look youthful, this too might pose additional\r\nconstitutional difficulties. \r\nA correct interpretation of the \"appears to be a minor\"\r\nstandard and a full understanding of the interplay between the\r\nlegal protections afforded an individual, we believe, puts the bulk\r\nof these concerns to rest.  As to the breadth of the material\r\ncovered by the statute, Congress's statements provide us with a\r\nprecise and limited understanding of the \"appears to be\" language. \r\nWe are obligated to follow it.  \"Where a statute is susceptible of\r\ntwo constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful\r\nconstitutional questions arise and by the other of which such\r\nquestions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.\" \r\nAlmendarez-Torres v.

Rep. 104-358, at pt. I, IV(B).  The Senate, in\r\nenacting S. 1237, explicitly stated that the \"appears to be\"\r\nlanguage \"applies to the same type of photographic images already\r\nprohibited, but which does not require the use of an actual minor\r\nin its production.\"  Id. at pt. IV(C).  The Senate clearly\r\nindicated that, by employing the phrase \"appears to be,\" it was\r\n\"extend[ing] [the prohibition against child pornography] from\r\nphotographic depictions of actual minors engaging in sexually\r\nexplicit conduct to the identical type of depiction, one which is\r\nvirtually indistinguishable from the banned photographic\r\ndepiction,\" and no further.  Id.  (Emphasis added).\r\nA few observations logically flow from this narrow\r\nconstruct.  The primary one is that Congress meant only to extend\r\nfederal authority in an important but limited fashion to a specific\r\nsubset of visual images   those which are easily mistaken for that\r\nof real children.  \r\nIt follows that drawings, cartoons, sculptures, and\r\npaintings depicting youthful persons in sexually explicit poses\r\nplainly lie beyond the reach of the Act.  By definition, they\r\nwould not be \"virtually indistinguishable\" from an image of an\r\nactual minor.  The CPPA therefore does not pose a threat to the\r\nvast majority of every day artistic expression, even to speech\r\ninvolving sexual themes.  \r\nHilton (and assorted amici) nevertheless insist that the\r\nFirst Amendment allows regulation of sexually explicit material\r\nonly where actual children are abused in its creation.  They also\r\ncontend that the statute is impermissibly expansive because it is\r\nvery difficult to determine whether a person looks 17 or 18; they\r\nbelieve that the statute is bound to criminalize possession of\r\nprotected adult pornography. \r\nTheir first argument amounts to an effort to draw a\r\nbright line in an area of law in which courts have resisted\r\ncreating clear-cut categories.  Relying on Ferber's discussion of\r\nthe importance of protecting children from sexual exploitation,\r\nthey argue that the Supreme Court has strictly limited regulation\r\nof child pornography to images manufactured with the use of live\r\nchildren.  But we find no firm basis for this overly restrictive\r\nreading of precedent.  We do not read the cases to say that\r\nCongress has power to remedy only the abuse of children during the\r\nprocess used to produce traditional forms of child pornography. \r\nWhile the Court certainly has been concerned with the \"surpassing\r\nimportance\" of protecting the actual abuse of children who appear\r\nin pornographic material, it has not limited the government's\r\nauthority to achieving that objective, and that objective alone. \r\nFerber, 458 U.S. at 757.  Rather, it has mandated that government\r\nbe permitted a certain degree of flexibility in how it chooses to\r\ngrapple with new problems presented by the evolving nature of the\r\nchild pornography industry.  See Osborne, 495 U.S. at 110.  The\r\ncases do suggest, however, that an appropriate set of governmental\r\ngoals (and the government's methods of fulfilling those goals)\r\nshould be reasonably related to the primary aim of \"safeguarding\r\nthe physical and psychological well-being\" of children, and, by\r\nextension, crippling the clandestine child pornography trade.  Id.at 109 (citation omitted). \r\nThe laws in force when the Court decided Ferber and\r\nOsborne uniformly defined child pornography by focusing on material\r\ninvolving the use of actual children.  The Court in those cases\r\nused, for purposes of its constitutional discussion, the statutory\r\ndefinition of child pornography then before it.  The legal issues\r\npresented in this case, including Congress's justifications offered\r\nfor extending child pornography statutes to stem the flow of\r\nvirtual child pornography, have not been analyzed by this, or any\r\nother, court of appeals.  \r\nWe think that it is a logical and permissible extension\r\nof the rationales in Ferber and Osborne to allow the regulation of\r\nsexual materials that appear to be of children but did not, in\r\nfact, involve the use of live children in their production.  Like\r\nsexually explicit material produced with actual children, there is\r\nlittle, if any, social value in this type of expression.  In\r\nconstitutional terms, sexually explicit material produced without\r\nthe benefit of a live child model but giving the appearance as if\r\nhad been is more akin to traditionally unprotected child\r\npornography than adult pornography.  The same is true of material\r\ncreated by having a youthful-looking adult pose as a minor that is\r\nsold or presented as though it contained a pornographic image of an\r\nactual minor.  Such depictions can be readily used so as to further\r\nthe child pornography trade or to facilitate the abuse of children.\r\nThe government's interest in safeguarding the welfare of\r\nchildren is compelling in these situations.  Computer-created or\r\nenhanced material can be bought, sold, or traded like any other\r\nform of child pornography, adding further fuel to the underground\r\nchild pornography industry.  It can be used just as effectively as\r\npictures of actual children to entice or blackmail children into\r\ncooperating with would-be abusers.  Moreover, the material may have\r\nbeen created through the abuse of an actual minor but altered so\r\nthat it may be impossible to show that a real child was ever\r\ninvolved in its creation.  As technology improves and access to\r\ntechnology increases, efforts to eradicate the child pornography\r\nindustry could be effectively frustrated if Congress were prevented\r\nfrom targeting sexually explicit material that \"appears to be\" of\r\nreal children.  The government's interest in addressing these forms\r\nof child pornography is no less powerful than in instances where an\r\nactual child is actually used and abused during the production\r\nprocess.  We will not second-guess Congress's decision to address\r\nthe social ills posed by the various types of virtual child\r\npornography.  \r\nHilton's and amici's next objection also misses the mark. \r\nThey maintain that the inherent difficulty of determining whether\r\na depicted person \"appears to be\" 17 or 18 renders the definition\r\noverly broad.  They fear that persons will be convicted of\r\npossessing sexually explicit material of adults who look or dress\r\nin a youthful manner.  We think this danger is overstated.  The\r\nmain flaw in the argument is its inordinate focus on the arguably\r\nfuzzy line between age 17 and 18, a line which, as with many laws,\r\nmust be drawn somewhere.  More importantly, we are satisfied that\r\nthe vast majority of prosecutions under the \"appears to be a minor\"\r\nprovision would involve images of pre-pubescent children or persons\r\nwho otherwise clearly appear to be under the age of 18.  Congress,\r\nrelying on the opinion of experts, has determined that purveyors of\r\nchild pornography usually cater to pedophiles, who by definition\r\nhave a predilection for pre-pubertal children.  See S. Rep. 104-\r\n358, at  2, pts. IV(A), (C).  The apparent age of a pre-pubescent\r\nchild can easily be established through objective proof.  While it\r\nis theoretically possible that there may be prosecutions of\r\nindividuals selling or possessing images of youthful-looking\r\nadults, it is unlikely that they would comprise a substantial\r\nproportion of the prosecutions under the statute.  \r\nThe existence of a few possibly impermissible\r\napplications of the Act does not warrant its condemnation.  As the\r\nCourt has repeatedly made plain, even if a statute at its margins\r\ninfringes on protected activity, the solution is not invalidation\r\nof the entire scheme.  See Frisby v. Schultz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112134\"><a href=\"/opinion/112134/frisby-v-schultz/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488\r\n(1988) (declining to evaluate all \"hypothetical applications\" of\r\nordinance in resolving facial challenge).  Whatever overbreadth may\r\nexist at the edges are more appropriately cured through a more\r\nprecise case-by-case evaluation of the facts in a given case.  SeeNew York State Club Assoc., Inc. v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112114\"><a href=\"/opinion/112114/new-york-state-club-assn-inc-v-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n14 (1988).\r\nWe recognize that the Court has said that adult models\r\nmay be employed under certain circumstances to simulate minors\r\nposing in a sexually provocative manner for serious artistic,\r\neducational, or scientific purposes.  Indeed, in Ferber, the Court\r\nobserved that \"if it were necessary for literary or artistic value,\r\na person over the statutory age who perhaps looked younger could be\r\nutilized.\"  458 U.S. at 763; see also X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. at\r\n72 (\"[N]on-obscene, sexually explicit materials involving persons\r\nover the age of 17 are protected by the First Amendment.\").  \r\nTake, for example, a film version of Nabokov's Lolita. \r\nA director might legitimately wish to employ a youthful-looking\r\nadult to portray, in a non-obscene manner, a sexual encounter\r\nbetween Lolita and Humbert.  Similarly, use of an adult model to\r\nsimulate the sexual behavior of a child might be necessary for\r\nscientific research.  The social value of these works obviously\r\ncould not be shrugged off as de minimis.  They would be far from\r\nthe \"hardest core of child pornography.\"  Ferber, 458 U.S. at 761. \r\nThe First Amendment interest in permitting dissemination of such\r\nmaterial would be sufficiently strong to warrant its protection.  \r\nAt the same time, the government's countervailing interest in\r\nprotecting children \"is likely to be far less compelling\" when \"the\r\ndepiction is a serious contribution to art or science.\"  Id. at 776\r\n(Brennan, J., concurring).  Should the government decide to\r\nprosecute someone for distributing or possessing such material, we\r\nbelieve there would be an affirmative First Amendment defense\r\navailable to the accused, although we need not define now its\r\nprecise dimensions.  Recognizing such a defense is consistent with\r\nCongress's general view that the law generally \"does not, and is\r\nnot intended to, apply to a depiction produced using adults\r\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct, even where a depicted\r\nindividual may appear to be a minor.\"  S. Rep. 104-358, at pt.\r\nIV(C).  It is also consonant with the Court's teachings in Ferber,\r\nwhere the Court assumed that even if in some rare instance the\r\ndepiction of children performing sexual acts might be necessary for\r\nliterary or artistic reasons, \"a person over the statutory age who\r\nperhaps looked younger could be utilized.\"  458 U.S. at 763. \r\nWe need not fully explore the details of this exception\r\ntoday.  Suffice it to say that the existence of a tiny fraction of\r\nmaterial that could conceivably qualify for heightened protection\r\nbut might nevertheless fall within the purview of the Act (i.e.,\r\nwhere youthful adults pose as children for sexually provocative\r\nimages with redeeming social value) does not render the statute as\r\na whole substantially overbroad.  The appropriate remedy is\r\nreversal of an unconstitutional conviction should the circumstance\r\narise, not invalidation of the statute in toto at this stage. \r\nOnce the phrase \"appears to be a minor\" is properly\r\nunderstood, the constitutional barriers fall away.  The fear of a\r\nchilling effect on protected speech subsides.  We conclude,\r\ntherefore, that the CPPA is not unconstitutionally overbroad.\r\n                           V\r\nWe next consider whether the district court erred in\r\nholding the CPPA unconstitutionally vague.  The touchstone of our\r\nsystem of justice is the right to fair warning of criminal charges. \r\nAn ambiguous law fails to provide the requisite notice and\r\nundermines public confidence that the laws are equally enforced.\r\nThe standard for overturning a law on vagueness grounds\r\nis a stringent one.  A statute will not be held void for vagueness\r\nunless it fails to \"define the criminal offense with sufficient\r\ndefiniteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is\r\nprohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary or\r\ndiscriminatory enforcement.\"  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357; see alsoUnited States v. Bohai Trading Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195872\"><a href=\"/opinion/195872/united-states-v-bohai/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (1st Cir.\r\n1995) (proper inquiry is whether statute \"provide[s] a\r\nconstitutionally adequate warning to those whose activities are\r\ngoverned\") (citation omitted).  When a law directly impinges on\r\nfreedom of expression, as the CPPA does here, we must scrutinize\r\nthe law with an even more skeptical eye.  We are obliged do so\r\nbecause the threat of severe criminal sanctions and the full force\r\nof social stigma, coupled with uncertain notice of criminal\r\nliability offered by a poorly-worded statute, \"may well cause\r\nspeakers to remain silent rather than communicate even arguably\r\nunlawful words, ideas, and images.\"  Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. at   ,\r\n117 S. Ct. at 2345.\r\nThe district court found the CPPA unduly vague because it\r\nbelieved the \"appears to be a minor\" standard to be purely\r\nsubjective in nature.  To the contrary, we hold that the standard\r\nis an objective one.  A jury must decide, based on the totality of\r\nthe circumstances, whether a reasonable unsuspecting viewer would\r\nconsider the depiction to be of an actual individual less than 18\r\nengaged in sexual activity.  See S. Rep. 104-358, at pt. IV(C).\r\nWithout limiting a priori the type of evidence that would\r\nbe admissible on this question in a given case, the following proof\r\ncould be offered to establish the apparent age of the person shown:\r\nthe physical characteristics of the person; expert testimony as to\r\nthe physical development of the depicted person; how the disk,\r\nfile, or video was labeled or marked by the creator or the\r\ndistributor of the image, or the defendant himself, see, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197816\"><a href=\"/opinion/197816/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 652 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(photographs labeled by names, dates taken, and ages of boys\r\ndepicted); and the manner in which the image was described,\r\ndisplayed, or advertised.  While this list is hardly exhaustive, it\r\ngives a flavor of the ways in which a depicted person's apparent\r\nage might be objectively proven.\r\nThe element of scienter also must be satisfied by the\r\nprosecution before a valid conviction may be obtained   for\r\ninstance, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nan individual \"knowingly\" possessed the child pornography.  See 18\r\nU.S.C.  2252A(a)(5)(B).  This statutory requirement serves as an\r\nadditional safeguard, for the government must show not only that\r\nthe individual purposefully acquired or distributed the material,\r\nbut that he did so believing that the material was sexually\r\nexplicit in nature and that it depicted a person who appeared to\r\nhim to be (or that he anticipated would be) under 18 years old. \r\nSee X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. at 78 (holding that scienter\r\nrequirement in related anti-child pornography statute \"extends to\r\nboth the sexually explicit nature of the material and to the age of\r\nthe performers\"). \r\nThe CPPA offers an added measure of protection.  It\r\nprovides an affirmative defense if the person depicted actually was\r\nan adult at the time the image was created.  When the defense is\r\nappropriate, the fact that the person depicted was a live model at\r\nleast 18 years of age typically will lead to dismissal of the\r\ncharge.  Although Congress did not make the affirmative defense\r\navailable to someone accused of unlawful possession (as opposed to\r\nany of the other offenses such as distribution), what an individual\r\nactually believed to be the age of the depicted person still goes\r\nto his state of mind in possessing the material.  Thus, a defendant\r\nwho honestly believes that the individual depicted in the image\r\nappears to be 18 years old or older (and is believed by a jury), or\r\nwho can show that he knew the images were created by having\r\nyouthful-looking adults pose for them, must be acquitted, so long\r\nas the image was not presented or marketed as if it contained a\r\nreal minor.  \r\nWe believe, in short, that the statute's provisions\r\n\"suitably limit\" the reach of the Act so that a person of ordinary\r\nintelligence can easily discern likely unlawful conduct and conform\r\nhis or her conduct appropriately.  The statute carefully defines\r\nthe term \"minor.\"  The scope of its prohibition, like the law\r\nevaluated in Ferber, is restricted to visual images.  The statute\r\ndescribes, in painstaking detail, the types of sexually explicit\r\ndepictions of children that are forbidden.  As the Court said in\r\nOsborne, such limiting language \"avoid[s] penalizing persons for\r\nviewing or possessing innocuous photographs of naked children.\" \r\n495 U.S. at 114.  \r\nWe disagree with the district court's assumption that the\r\nuse of a legal standard requiring an evaluation of the appearance\r\nof an image renders the test arbitrary or overly susceptible to\r\nmanipulation.  Reasonable objective assessments of the impression\r\nconveyed by a person's actions or how an image \"appears\" are\r\nroutinely made by judges and juries.  See, e.g., Liteky v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553 n.2 (1994) (noting that recusal motions\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  455(a) are governed by \"objective appearance of\r\npartiality\" test); Ferber, 458 U.S. at 751 (approved definition of\r\nchild pornography banned \"simulated\" sexual conduct, which in\r\nordinary usage means \"to have or take on the appearance of\");\r\nMiller, 413 U.S. at 24 (obscenity depends in part on whether\r\nmaterial appeals to prurient interest of average person).\r\nYet Hilton returns to a familiar refrain: that it is\r\nterribly difficult to distinguish between an apparent 17 year old\r\nand an apparent 18 year old.  This problem, he argues, renders the\r\nstatute unduly vague (as well as overbroad).  We think not.  As\r\ndiscussed earlier, any number of objective signs should be enough\r\nto warn an ordinary viewer of sexually explicit material of the\r\napparent age of the person depicted, including his or her physical\r\ncharacteristics and how the image is labeled or marketed.  And\r\nthose involved in the production of lawful sexually explicit\r\nmaterial can easily protect themselves by verifying the ages of the\r\nmodels they employ or by taking steps to visually demonstrate that\r\na computer-generated image is meant to portray an adult. \r\nThere is another reason why Hilton's vagueness challenge\r\nfails: there are few equally efficacious alternatives.  At oral\r\nargument, defense counsel suggested that a better approach would be\r\nto prohibit images of persons who are or appear to be \"physically\r\nsexually immature.\"  Such a test, had Congress selected it, might\r\nvery well have been more precise than the one Congress chose to\r\nadopt, which turns on the age or apparent age of the person\r\ndepicted.  It is often said that because we are \"[c]ondemned to the\r\nuse of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our\r\nlanguage.\"  Grayned v. City of Rockford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108598\"><a href=\"/opinion/108598/grayned-v-city-of-rockford/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (1972). \r\nThat lesson applies here. \r\nBut even if the proffered standard were more exact, there\r\nwould still be a more fundamental problem   it would fail to reach\r\na whole category of persons Congress intended to protect, namely,\r\nthose youngsters who appear \"physically sexually mature\" but are\r\nunder the age of consent.  We reject the suggestion that Congress\r\nmust be confined to addressing pornographic images of some\r\nchildren, but not others.  Firmly satisfied that it is well within\r\nCongress's power to regulate virtual pornography of minors of all\r\nages (infancy through age of majority as set by the legislature),\r\nwe are aware of few other linguistic approaches that would achieve\r\nthe same goals.  Defendant's proposal does not fit the bill.  The\r\n\"appears to be a minor\" test, by comparison, is sufficiently\r\nprecise to pass constitutional muster and yet flexible enough to\r\nmeet the challenges posed by computerized child pornography. \r\nWe see no reason to strike down the CPPA as\r\nunconstitutionally vague.  The language of the statute affords an\r\nordinary consumer of sexually explicit material adequate notice of\r\nthe kinds of images to avoid.  The interaction between the\r\napplicable legal standards, moreover, offers the average person\r\nadditional protection.  These safeguards, working in concert,\r\nminimize the danger that this law might be enforced in an arbitrary\r\nor discriminatory fashion by overzealous police officers or\r\nprosecutors.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is reversed.\n</pre>",
