Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                          Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                       Campbell, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Magill,* Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michael A. Tucker, on brief for appellant.\n     Peter E. Papps, First Assistant U.S. Attorney, with Thomas P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for the United States.\n\n\n\n                             March 27, 2002\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the     Eighth    Circuit   Court   of   Appeals,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           PER CURIAM.    Michael Sordillo was indicted by a federal\n\ngrand jury on one count of trafficking in motor vehicle parts in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2321 (1994), and one count of operating a\n\n\"chop shop\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2322 (1994), and thereafter\n\nfound guilty by a jury on both counts.            The district court\n\nincreased Sordillo's base offense level from 12 to 14 based on the\n\nexistence of an \"organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle\n\nparts\" pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2B6.1(b)(3) (1998).        The district\n\ncourt also imposed a special probation condition, which requires\n\nSordillo to \"refrain from engaging in the business of owning or\noperating any type of motor vehicle repair shop during the term of\n\nhis supervision.\"   Sordillo appeals the district court's increase\nin his base offense level and the imposition of the special\nprobation condition.     Because no objection was made at the time of\n\nsentencing to either issue raised on appeal, our review is for\nplain error.   United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 262 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n           With respect to his first argument, Sordillo contends\nthat the district court's imposition of the special probation\ncondition conflicts with 18 U.S.C. § 2322(a)(2), which provides\n\nthat the \"Attorney General shall, as appropriate, in the case of\nany person who violates paragraph (1) [operation of a chop shop],\ncommence a civil action for permanent or temporary injunction to\n\nrestrain such violation.\"     Sordillo essentially argues that this\nprovision grants the Attorney General the exclusive power to enjoin\n\nfuture   business   activities   related   to   motor   vehicles,   and\n\n                                  -2-\n\ftherefore, the district court's special probation condition is an\n\nimpermissible exercise of judicial authority.\n\n          While Sordillo's argument is novel, he points to no\nauthority to support his assumption that the court's authority to\n\nimpose a special condition of supervised release is limited merely\n\nbecause it tracks an available civil remedy.             Moreover, we are\nunable to read into § 2322(a)(2) a provision that suggests that a\n\ncivil injunction is the exclusive means of preventing a defendant\n\nfrom engaging in the same business that provided the means for the\n\ncommission of the offenses of conviction.\n\n          \"A   sentencing   judge    has   broad   discretion    to   impose\n\nspecial conditions of release that are 'reasonably related' to (1)\n\nthe defendant's offense, history and characteristics; (2) the need\nfor adequate deterrence; and (3) the need to protect the public\n\nfrom further crimes of the defendant.\"          Phaneuf, 91 F.3d at 263.\n\nWe find the special probation condition imposed by the district\ncourt to be directly related to the means by which Sordillo\n\ncommitted the offenses.      Sordillo was convicted of operating a\n\n\"chop shop\"; a shop he operated through his motorcycle repair and\n\nparts sale business.    Thus, Sordillo's offense and past employment\n\nhistory are completely intertwined.             In addition, prohibiting\n\nSordillo from engaging in the business of owning or operating a\n\nmotor vehicle repair shop serves the purposes of deterrence and\n\nprotection   of   the   public   because   it    was   through   Sordillo's\n\noperation of such a business that he was able to engage in the\n\nprohibited offenses and cause injury to the public.          Thus, we find\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fno   error   in   the   district    court's    imposition   of    the   special\n\nprobation     condition     limiting        Sordillo's   post-incarceration\n\nemployment.\n             With respect to Sordillo's second argument, we conclude\n\nthat   the   district    court     appropriately    complied     with   section\n\n2B6.1(b)(3) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which\nprovides: \"If the offense involved an organized scheme to steal\n\nvehicles or vehicle parts, or to receive stolen vehicles or vehicle\n\nparts, and the offense level as determined above is less than level\n\n14, increase to level 14.\"         Application Note (1) to section 2B6.1\n\nfurther provides:\n\n             Subsection (b)(3), referring to an \"organized\n             scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts, or\n             to receive stolen vehicles or vehicle parts,\"\n             provides an alternative minimum measure of\n             loss in the case of an ongoing, sophisticated\n             operation such as an auto theft ring or \"chop\n             shop.\" (emphasis added).\n\nBecause Sordillo was convicted of operating a \"chop shop,\" a base\noffense level of 14 was proper.\n\n             Accordingly, the judgment and sentence of the district\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
