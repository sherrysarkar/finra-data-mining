DeNovellis  v. Shalala, 124  F.3d 298,\r                                                         \r\n\n305 (1st Cir. 1997).   \r\n\n          On  September  21,  1994, as  part  of  a workforce\r\n\nreduction  program,  American  offered  certain  reservation,\r\n\nticket, and cargo agents in the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nthe   opportunity  to  participate   in  a   Voluntary  Early\r\n\nRetirement  Program  (\"VERP\").   The  VERP  provided  for the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\naddition  of five  years to  each  employee's actual  age for\r\n\npurposes of  calculating  retirements  benefits,  five  years\r\n\nadditional credited service, cash bridge payments of $400 per\r\n\nmonth until the employee became eligible to receive benefits,\r\n\nimmediate retirement  medical benefits  and travel  benefits.\r\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the VERP an  employee had to\r\n\nbe at the  maximum pay scale in their  job classification and\r\n\nat least forty-five years of age.\r\n\n          American informed  the employees  of the  program's\r\n\ndetails by  providing  various VERP-related  documents.   The\r\n\nintroduction to the \"Terms and Conditions\" booklet describing\r\n\nthe  program warned  the  employees  to  read  the  materials\r\n\ncarefully, and  provided a participation deadline of November\r\n\n11,  1994,  with  a  seven  day  rescission  period after  an\r\n\nelection  to  participate.    In  order  to  participate,  an\r\n\nemployee was required  to sign a \"Voluntary  Early Retirement\r\n\nElection  Form\" attesting that  the decision  was \"completely\r\n\nvoluntary, final and  irrevocable,\" that he  or she had  been\r\n\ngiven  forty-five days  to make  the  election, and  that all\r\n\nrights to reemployment with American were being relinquished.\r\n\nThe election form also stated that, on an employee's last day\r\n\nof work, he  or she  would be  required to  sign a  \"Complete\r\n\nRelease of All Claims,\" absolving American of all employment-\r\n\nrelated    liability     including,    specifically,     \"age\r\n\ndiscrimination claims.\"\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The VERP  election form  required each  employee to\r\n\nattest  to  having read  the  entire  release form  prior  to\r\n\nelecting to retire early.   By the terms of the release,  the\r\n\nemployee agreed  not to  bring any  legal proceeding  against\r\n\nAmerican  in any  court, administrative agency,  or tribunal,\r\n\nthat the employee would forfeit the extra retirement benefits\r\n\nif  the employee breached  a material release  term, and also\r\n\nprovided the  party successfully enforcing the  release costs\r\n\nand  attorney's  fees.   The  release  contained  a provision\r\n\nstating:  \"I  have  had reasonable  and  sufficient  time and\r\n\nopportunity   to   consult   with   an   independent    legal\r\n\nrepresentative   of  my  own  choosing  before  signing  this\r\n\nComplete  Release  of   All  Claims.\"    Although   the  VERP\r\n\ndocumentation  advised the  employee to  discuss the  program\r\n\nwith their  families and  to \"consult  a financial  advisor,\"\r\n\nneither  the  release  nor  any  of  the  VERP  documentation\r\n\nexplicitly advised the employees to consult an attorney prior\r\n\nto executing  the release  or electing to  retire.   The only\r\n\nmention  of independent  legal advice  was  contained in  the\r\n\nrelease, which was not to be signed until the employee's last\r\n\nday of work.  Each employee signed  the release on his or her\r\n\nlast day of work. \r\n\n          The appellants elected to participate  in the early\r\n\nretirement  program on various  dates throughout the election\r\n\nperiod.  The earliest election occurred on  October 11, 1994,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe latest on December 13, 1994.  The VERP also provided that\r\n\nthe  employees'  termination   dates  would  depend  on   the\r\n\nrestructuring process; therefore,  after their election,  the\r\n\nemployees  continued to  work.   Over  the  next ten  months,\r\n\nAmerican  began to terminate them individually.  The earliest\r\n\ntermination occurred on  December 30, 1994, while  the latest\r\n\ndid  not  occur  until  September  29,  1995.     After  each\r\n\ntermination,  American paid  the  VERP's enhanced  retirement\r\n\nbenefits.  For several months (the  precise period is unclear\r\n\nfrom  the  record),  each  of  the  appellants  accepted  and\r\n\nretained these benefits. \r\n\n          On   October  27,  1995,  over  a  year  after  the\r\n\nappellants elected to participate in  the VERP, they began to\r\n\nfile administrative  age discrimination claims with  both the\r\n\nPuerto Rico  Anti-Discrimination Unit  (\"ADU\") and  the Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") variously claiming\r\n\nthat   their  election  to   participate  in  the   VERP  was\r\n\ninvoluntary and that American had discriminated against  them\r\n\non the basis of age.  In general, the complaints alleged that\r\n\ncertain  management employees  had  led  older  employees  to\r\n\nbelieve that  American planned to move the  operations in the\r\n\nreservation  and cargo  departments  to  another location  or\r\n\nsubcontract  to an  outside company,  placing  their jobs  in\r\n\njeopardy.   However, once  the employees  elected to  retire,\r\n\nAmerican asked  them to  train new,  younger replacements  to\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nfill their  jobs.   The claimed threatened  job losses  never\r\n\nmaterialized.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                      Prior Proceedings\r                                  Prior Proceedings\r                                                   \r\n\n          On  April 18, 1996,  American Airlines responded to\r\n\nthe  appellants'  ADU  filings  by  initiating  the   instant\r\n\ndeclaratory judgment action.   See 28 U.S.C.   2201.   In its\r                                              \r\n\npleadings,  American asked  the district  court  to issue  an\r\n\norder declaring the rights and obligations of  the parties in\r\n\nconnection with the VERP under the Employee Retirement Income\r\n\nSecurity Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.   1132(a)(3).1  Subsequently,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n 1.  Although  neither party has  addressed the issue,  it is\r\n our  duty  to inquire  sua  sponte into  our  subject matter\r\n jurisdiction.   In re  Recticel Foam  Corp., 859  F.2d 1000,\r                                                        \r\n 1002 (1st  Cir. 1988).   American  brought this  declaratory\r\n judgment  action under  ERISA, which  provides  for a  civil\r\n action: \r\n\n          by a .  . . fiduciary  (A) to enjoin  any\r\n          act or practice which violates the  terms\r\n          of  the  plan,  or (B)  to  obtain  other\r\n          appropriate  equitable   relief  (i)   to\r\n          redress  such   violations  or   (ii)  to\r\n          enforce any provisions . . . of the terms\r\n          of the plan. \r\n\n 29 U.S.C.   1132(a)(3).  American seeks a declaration of the\r\n parties' obligations under the plan in light of the release.\r\n We need  not confront the  question of whether    1132(a)(3)\r\n directly authorizes a declaratory  judgment in this context.\r\n Compare Winstead v. J.C. Penny Co., Inc., 933 F.2d 576, 578-\r                                                     \r\n 79  (7th Cir.  1991)  (  1132(a)(3)  allows  a fiduciary  to\r\n obtain  a declaration  regarding its  obligations  under the\r\n terms  of a plan),  with Gulf Life  Ins.

R. Civ. P.  67 to have  the court\r\n\napprove  the deposit  of future  payments  of the  employees'\r\n\nretirement benefits into a court-designated bank account (the\r\n\n\"court registry\").  The court granted that motion, and, since\r\n\nMay 1996,  American has paid  the monthly payments  due under\r\n\nthe VERP into an interest-bearing account.\r\n\n          The employees  counterclaimed against  American for\r\n\nage discrimination under the ADEA, the Older Workers Benefits\r\n\nProtection Act (\"OWBPA\"), 29 U.S.C.   626(f), and 29 L.P.R.A.\r\n\n   146 et seq., known  colloquially as Puerto Rico \"Law 100.\"\r                         \r\n\nEvidently,  once  the  district  court  allowed  American  to\r\n\ndeposit the  employees' retirement  benefits  into the  court\r\n\nregistry, a  number of the original employee counterclaimants\r\n\nabandoned  their claims.   Of  the  twenty-one employees  who\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          declaratory judgment defendant  brought a\r\n          coercive  action to  enforce its  rights,\r\n          that  suit  would necessarily  present  a\r\n          federal question. \r\n\n Id. at 19; see also  id. at 19 n.19 (discussing jurisdiction\r                                     \r\n in   declaratory    judgment   actions    involving   patent\r\n infringement);  cf.

Here, the underlying controversy,\r\n whether characterized as  the employees' right to  sue under\r\n American's retirement plan,  see 29 U.S.C.    1132(a)(1)(B),\r                                             \r\n or as a claim under the ADEA and  OWBPA, clearly  presents a\r\n wholly  federal question.

American  also moved for\r\n\nsummary judgment  on  the  employees'  counterclaim  arguing,\r\n\ninter  alia,  that the  employees administrative  filings had\r                       \r\n\nbeen untimely.   The court granted American's motion,  and on\r\n\nJanuary 27, 1997, issued a declaratory judgment that:\r\n\n          (1) Defendants have  ratified the release\r\n          agreements  entered   into  by   them  in\r\n          connection with their acceptance of early\r\n          retirement benefits from American; \r\n\n          (2)  the   release  agreements   preclude\r\n          defendants   from   raising   any  claims\r\n          against   American   relating   to  their\r\n          employment or  retirement, including  the\r\n          claims for  age discrimination  under the\r\n          [ADEA, OWBPA, and Puerto Rico Law], \r\n\n          (3)  Defendants  failed   to  file  their\r\n          claims  of  age discrimination  with  the\r\n          EEOC    and    Puerto     Rico's    Anti-\r\n          Discrimination Unit within the applicable\r\n          limitations period. \r\n\nIn  light of  this declaration,  the  district court  granted\r\n\nAmerican's motion for summary judgment on the employees' ADEA\r\n\nand Law 100 counterclaims.

Second,  if the  release does  not bar\r\n\ntheir claims, are the employees' claims nonetheless barred as\r\n\na  matter of  law?    We answer  the  first  question in  the\r\n\nnegative, disagreeing with the district court's determination\r\n\nthat  the employees' release  bars their  ADEA counterclaims.\r\n\nWe agree, however,  that the statute of  limitations bars the\r\n\nemployees' counterclaim.\r\n\n1.  Is the Release Enforceable?\r                                           \r\n\n          American  presents two  alternative arguments  that\r\n\nthe  release the  employees signed  is  enforceable: (1)  the\r\n\nrelease complied with  the OWBPA, 29 U.S.C.    626(f) or, (2)\r\n\nif the  release is  invalid under the  OWBPA, by  refusing to\r\n\nreturn the  enhanced retirement benefits  they received under\r\n\nthe VERP, the  employees ratified the release.   We disagree.\r\n\nWe find that the employees'  release of their ADEA claims did\r\n\nnot comply with the OWBPA and that the ratification  doctrine\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndoes not apply  to invalid ADEA waivers.2   We consider their\r                                                    2\r\n\narguments in turn. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We emphasize that  our holding is limited to  releases of\r\nADEA  claims that  are invalid  under the OWBPA.   We  do not\r\ndecide  or express  any  opinion  on  whether  the  employees\r\nvalidly released their non-ADEA claims. See infra part IV.2. \r                                                             \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          a. Compliance with the OWBPA\r                                                  \r\n\n          Although  the  district court  did  not  reach this\r\n\nissue,  American  contends  that we  can  affirm  the court's\r\n\ndeclaration  because the  releases  the employees  signed are\r\n\nvalid under the OWBPA.  We disagree.\r\n\n          For  an  employee's  waiver of  ADEA  rights  to be\r\n\nenforceable, it must be \"knowing and voluntary.\"   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nLong v.

Prior to  the enactment of  the OWBPA,  courts split\r\n\nover how to determine whether  a waiver of rights was knowing\r\n\nand  voluntary.     Some  courts   used  \"ordinary   contract\r\n\nprinciples\" such as fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or lack of\r\n\nconsideration,  see O'Shea  v.

See\r                                                                         \r\n\n29  U.S.C.       626(f)(1)(E).3     Although  each   employee\r\n\nacknowledged  on the  VERP  election  form  having  read  the\r\n\nrelease before making his or her election, the only reference\r\n\nto  consulting legal counsel  appears in the  release itself,\r\n\nwhich was not to be executed until the employee actually left\r\n\nwork a number of months later.  When the employees elected to\r\n\nretire, however, they promised to  sign the release on  their\r\n\ntermination date as a  condition of receiving benefits.   The\r\n\nrelease  states only: \"I  have had reasonable  and sufficient\r\n\ntime and  opportunity to  consult with  an independent  legal\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

This statutory requirement  could not\r                      \r\n\nbe more clear, nor its  purpose more central to the statutory\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.      It also  advised  divorced  employees to  consult  an\r                                              \r\nattorney regarding the effects of certain payment options.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nscheme  at issue, especially  in light of  Congress's concern\r\n\nwith  discrimination in  the suspect  context  of group  exit\r\n\nprograms.5\r\n\n          American argues that the waiver form complied  with\r\n\nthe OWBPA because there is no dispute that the employees were\r\n\nfully  aware that only  persons in their  classifications who\r\n\nwere  over the age  of 45 and  at the highest  pay rates were\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The legislative history of the OWBPA states: \r\n\n    In  the  context   of  ADEA  waivers,  the   Committee\r\n    recognizes    a   fundamental    distinction   between\r\n    individually   tailored   separation  agreements   and\r\n    employer programs targeted at groups of employees.\r\n                             . . .\r\n    During  the  past  decade,  in  particular,  employers\r\n    faced with  the  need to  reduce  workforce size  have\r\n    resorted   to   standardized  programs   designed   to\r\n    effectuate  quick  and  wholesale  reductions.     The\r\n    trademark  of involuntary  termination  programs is  a\r\n    standardized formula  or package of employee  benefits\r\n    that  is available  to more  than one  employee.   The\r\n    trademark  of  voluntary   reduction  programs   is  a\r\n    standardized formula  or package of benefits  designed\r\n    to   induce  employees   voluntarily  to  sever  their\r\n    employment.  In  both cases, the terms of the programs\r\n    generally  are not subject  to negotiation between the\r\n    parties.   In  addition, employees  affected by  those\r\n    programs  have  little or  no  basis  to suspect  that\r\n    action  is  being  taken  based  on  their  individual\r\n    characteristics.    Indeed,  the   employer  generally\r\n    advises them  that the termination  is not  a function\r\n    of   their    individual   status.      Under    these\r                                                                      \r\n    circumstances,  the need  for adequate information and\r                                                                      \r\n    access  to   advice  before  waivers  are   signed  is\r                                                                      \r\n    especially acute. \r                                 \r\n\nS.

We disagree.  The fact that the\r\n\nemployees may have known they were waiving rights in exchange\r\n\nfor enhanced  retirement benefits  does  not satisfy  section\r\n\n626(f)(1)(E).   We read section  626(f)(1)(E) to mean what it\r\n\nsays: employers must  advise employees in writing  to consult\r\n\nan attorney prior to executing  a release of ADEA claims. The\r\n\nfailure to advise the employees to  consult with counsel goes\r\n\nto the  heart of  the statute's purpose.6   Because  American\r\n\nfailed to directly advise their employees to consult a lawyer\r\n\nbefore making the election, we rule, as a matter of law, that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In  light of the OWBPA's imprecise terms, some violations\r\nmay be  so technical as  to be de  minimis, and thus  may not\r\ninvalidate an  otherwise valid  release of  ADEA claims.  See\r                                                                         \r\nRaczak,  103 F.2d at  1260. American's failure  adequately to\r                  \r\nadvise  the employees  to  obtain  counsel is  in  no way  de\r\nminimis.     \r                         \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nAmerican failed to meet its burden under the OWBPA.7  See  29\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.   626(f)(1).\r\n\n          b. Ratification of the Employees' ADEA Waiver\r                                                                   \r\n\n          As we have said, the  district court did not decide\r\n\nwhether the  release complied with  OWBPA.   Rather, it  held\r\n\nthat  the  employees'   acceptance  of  enhanced   retirement\r\n\nbenefits, as well as their opposition to the court's order to\r\n\ndeposit  the  disputed  retirement  funds  into  the  court's\r\n\nregistry pending the outcome of  this litigation, constituted\r\n\na  ratification  of  the  original  release  agreement.    We\r\n\ndisagree.\r\n\n          In the  past,  we  have  applied  the  ratification\r\n\ndoctrine  to  enforce  an otherwise  invalid  release  on the\r\n\nground that \"'[a] contract or release, the execution of which\r\n\nis induced by  duress, is voidable, not void,  and the person\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.   As the employees point out, the waiver is also deficient\r\nin  another manner.   The waiver broadly  prohibits employees\r\nfrom  maintaining   \"any  legal  proceedings  of  any  nature\r\nwhatsoever  against American  et  al.  before  any  court  or\r                                                \r\nadministrative  agency\" and  requires  them  to \"direct  that\r\nagency or court  to withdraw from or dismiss  the matter with\r\nprejudice\"  if  the  agency  assumes  jurisdiction  on  their\r\nbehalf.  Section  626(f)(4), however, states: \"No  waiver may\r\nbe used to justify interfering with the protected right of an\r\nemployee to file a charge or participate  in an investigation\r\nor proceeding conducted by the Commission.\"  Cf.

American asserts that the employees' retention of the\r\n\nenhanced benefits received from the VERP ratified the invalid\r\n\nwaiver.  The retention of benefits is relevant, however, only\r\n\nif  the  ratification  and  tender-back  doctrines  apply  to\r\n\nwaivers of ADEA claims after the adoption of the OWBPA.\r\n\n          The circuits are split on whether the acceptance of\r\n\nbenefits  ratifies  an  otherwise   invalid  waiver  of  ADEA\r\n\nclaims.8    A   majority,  both  before  and   after  OWBPA's\r\n\nenactment,  have held that  neither ratification  nor tender-\r\n\nback is  appropriate when  employees have  signed an  invalid\r\n\nADEA waiver.

The    arguments    for    and    against\r\n\nincorporating the ratification and tender-back doctrines into\r\n\nthe ADEA have been thoroughly reviewed in these cases, and we\r\n\nwill not repeat their analysis fully.  \r\n\n          The decisions  in favor  of ratification  primarily\r\n\nargue  that, because Congress  used \"the terms  'knowing' and\r\n\n'voluntary,' which parallel the common-law concepts of fraud,\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nduress,  and  mistake,  it  is  apparent  that  Congress  was\r\n\ndefining only those  circumstances in which a  contract would\r\n\nbe voidable, not when it  would be void.\"  Blistein, 74  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  1466.  A voidable contract can, of course, be ratified by\r\n\nsubsequent conduct.  See id.   Accordingly, in the absence of\r                                        \r\n\nany language  in the  statute indicating  that a waiver  that\r\n\ncontravenes the OWBPA cannot be ratified, the common-law rule\r\n\nstill operates. See Wamsley  v. Champlin Ref. &amp; Chems.  Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n11 F.3d 534, 539-40 (5th Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          The  majority view rests  on two primary arguments:\r\n\n(1) the plain  language of OWBPA and  its legislative history\r\n\nindicate that Congress  did not intend ratification  to apply\r\n\nto releases that are invalid  under OWBPA, see Long, 105 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  1537; and (2) the OWBPA  displaced the common-law tender-\r\n\nback doctrine under  Hogue v. Southern Ry. Co.,  390 U.S. 516\r                                                          \r\n\n(1968).   We reject the view adopted by the  Fourth and Fifth\r\n\nCircuits and adopt  the majority position.  At  common law, a\r\n\nwaiver of rights was  simply a contract, subject  to defenses\r\n\nlike duress  or mistake.   When Congress  enacted the  OWBPA,\r\n\nhowever,  it specifically  rejected  using ordinary  contract\r\n\nprinciples to govern the validity of ADEA waivers.

Section\r\n\n626(f)(1) states a clear rule: an individual  \"may not waive\"\r\n\nan ADEA claim unless  the waiver is \"knowing and  voluntary.\"\r\n\nAnd a waiver is not knowing and voluntary unless the employer\r\n\ncomplies with the eight OWBPA requirements.

To allow the simple retention of\r\n\nbenefits  to validate a  noncomplying waiver would  mean that\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nOWBPA applied to the first contract, but not to the fictional\r\n\nsecond contract.

If  the  ratification   doctrine  is\r\n\nincorporated  into  this  scheme,  an employer  could  obtain\r\n\nwaivers  without advising the employee to consult an attorney\r\n\nand then put  the employee to the difficult  choice of giving\r\n\nup essential benefits in order  to protect his or her rights.\r\n\nThe very  problem that Congress  enacted the OWBPA  to remedy\r\n\ncould  thus   resurface,  albeit   through  the   back  door.\r\n\nTherefore, incorporating the  ratification doctrine into  the\r\n\nOWBPA could act to undermine the incentives  for employers to\r\n\nfollow  OWBPA's  procedures  and  deter  the  prosecution  of\r\n\nmeritorious claims.  Cf. Hogue  v. Southern Ry.

American relies on Deren v. Digital Equip.

Such  reliance is misplaced.  In  Deren, the court\r                                                              \r\nheld  that an employee's waiver of  ERISA claims was ratified\r\nby  his retention of  benefits for three  and one-half years.\r\nUnlike the  ADEA waivers  here, however,  the validity of  an\r\nERISA  waiver is governed  by federal  common-law principles,\r\nsee Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability  Plan, 70 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          The  conflict between  common-law ratification  and\r\n\nthe statutory scheme at issue here is particularly stark when\r\n\nan  employer  seeks to  induce  an employee  to  accept early\r\n\nretirement.  Here, the employees voluntarily agreed to retire\r\n\nin exchange  for enhanced  benefits  without which,  American\r\n\nassures us, they would have remained on the job at American's\r\n\nhighest pay scale.  Courts applying the ratification doctrine\r\n\nto  ADEA claims  have  stated  that  the  employees  must  be\r\n\nrequired  to restore  the status  quo  by tendering-back  the\r\n\nbenefits  they  received  for  waiving  their  claims.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nBlakeney,  65  F.3d  at  485.    This  position  is  arguably\r                    \r\n\nplausible in the context of a unilateral termination when  an\r\n\nemployee receives  severance benefits  an employer would  not\r\n\nhave paid but for the  release.  See, e.g., Wamsley, 11  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 72.   In  the context of  a voluntary  retirement program,\r\n\nhowever,  tendering  back  the  benefits  received  does  not\r\n\nrestore the status quo.\r\n\n          For instance,  American does not  contend that  the\r\n\nemployees  should, as a  precondition to suing,  refuse their\r\n\nretirement benefits  and seek  reinstatement.  American  does\r\n\nnot,  in  other  words, contemplate  the  restoration  of the\r\n\nstatus quo.   Rather, American wants to  use the ratification\r\n\ndoctrine to  retain the  economic benefit  of the  employees'\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n173,  178 (1st  Cir. 1995),  rather  than a  detailed set  of\r\nstatutory  procedures.  Therefore, Deren does not require the\r                                                    \r\nincorporation of the ratification doctrine into the OWBPA.\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\ndecisions  to retire early -- a decision obtained by American\r\n\nin  violation of the OWBPA.  As  the Forbus court noted, this\r                                                       \r\n\nresult could  \"encourage egregious  behavior on  the part  of\r\n\nemployers in forcing certain employees into early  retirement\r\n\nfor the economic benefit of the company.\"  958 F.2d at 1041.\r\n\n          We therefore join the majority of courts which have\r\n\nconsidered  the   issue  and  conclude  that   an  employee's\r\n\nretention of benefits does not act to ratify a waiver of ADEA\r\n\nclaims  that fails  to comply  with  the OWBPA.10   Thus,  we\r\n\nreverse the  district  court's declaration  that the  release\r\n\nprecludes defendants  from raising age  discrimination claims\r\n\nunder the ADEA.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.   Our holding  is limited  only to  waivers that  violate\r\nOWBPA's requirements.  Whether the  ratification and  tender-\r\nback doctrines apply to a waiver that complies with the OWBPA\r\nbut is not  \"knowing and voluntary\"  for a different  reason,\r\nsee Reid v.  IBM Corp., 1997 WL 357969, at *4 (S.D.N.Y 1997),\r                                  \r\nis a separate question, one we need not reach today. \r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n2.

The district court opinion is unclear as to whether the\r\n\nrelease,  despite  the  employees'  invalid  waiver  of  ADEA\r\n\nclaims,  nonetheless  would  bar their  Puerto  Rico  Law 100\r\n\nclaims,  as  well  as  any  other  claims  relating  to their\r\n\nemployment.  In reaching a conclusion that it does, the court\r\n\nmerely  stated: \"The  result  is the  same under  Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw.\"  \r\n\n          In  Long,  the  Third  Circuit,   facing  the  same\r                              \r\n\nproblem, explained:  \r\n\n          [T]he district court rested  its grant of\r\n          summary judgment as to  all claims on its\r\n          finding that the  release as a  whole was\r\n          voidable and had been ratified . . . . \r\n          Our holding,  confined as  it is to  ADEA\r\n          releases  invalid under  OWBPA, does  not\r\n          automatically dispose of the remainder of\r\n          [the employee's]  claims as might  be the\r\n          case if we had rested our decision on the\r\n          void/voidable distinction.\r\n\n105  F.3d at  1544-45.   To ensure  that  the parties  had an\r\n\nadequate opportunity to  litigate this issue, the  Long court\r                                                                   \r\n\nvacated the district court's entry of summary judgment on the\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nnon-ADEA  claims and remanded for further consideration.

While we  express no opinion on  the issue, we vacate\r\n\nthe district court's  declaration that the release  bars non-\r\n\nADEA claims and  remand that issue for  further consideration\r\n\nconsistent with  our opinion.11  Cf.

As already  noted, we affirm  the court's dismissal  of\r\nADEA  and Law  100  claims  because they  are  barred by  the\r\nstatute  of  limitations.    See  infra.     The  statute  of\r                                                   \r\nlimitations does not,  however, provide an independent  basis\r\nfor affirming the district court's declaratory judgment.  The\r\ndistrict  court s declaratory judgment  had three  parts: (1)\r\nthat the release was ratified, (2) that the release precludes\r\nall employment   related claims (including ADEA  claims), and\r               \r\n(3) that the  employees  age discrimination claims  are time-\r\nbarred.   On appeal, we  must determine if the  trial court's\r\ndeclaratory judgment, a final ruling  that is res judicata in\r\nany  future litigation concerning this release, is correct in\r\nall respects.   See  10A Charles A.  Wright, et  al., Federal\r                                                                         \r\nPractice  and  Procedure,        2771  (1983)(\"A  declaratory\r                                    \r\njudgment is  binding on the  parties before the court  and is\r\nres  judicata in  subsequent proceedings  as  to the  matters\r\ndeclared. . . .\").   The statute of limitations  is  relevant\r\nonly to the  third part of the district   court s declaratory\r\njudgment.   Therefore, we  must reach the  ratification issue\r\ndespite the fact  that the employees  counterclaim  is barred\r\nby the limitations period.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\npendency  of this action, these funds have been accumulating.\r\n\nThe question  remains as  to their  proper disposition.   The\r\n\nrecord  reflects that  American choose  not  to address  this\r\n\nissue  on summary  judgment and  neither party  raises it  on\r\n\nappeal.   Therefore, we do  not reach  this issue.   We note,\r\n\nhowever, that  these funds  are due  to the employees  unless\r\n\nthere exists  a basis for their retention.  We leave this for\r\n\nthe  district court  to  determine  on  remand  in  a  manner\r\n\nconsistent with this opinion. \r\n\n                             VI.\r                                         VI.\r                                            \r\n\n                   Statutes of Limitations\r                               Statutes of Limitations\r                                                      \r\n\n          The   district  court   granted  American   summary\r\n\njudgment  on  the  ground  that  the  applicable  limitations\r\n\nperiods  barred  all  of the  employees'  counterclaims.   We\r\n\naffirm as  to the  federal claims,  although we clarify  that\r\n\nfour of the employees' Law 100  claims were not barred by the\r\n\nstatute of limitations. \r\n\n1.

To  determine   the  timeliness   of  the\r\n\nemployee's complaint, we must specifically  identify when the\r\n\nunlawful  practice that the employees claim violated the ADEA\r\n\noccurred.  See Lorance v. A.T. &amp; T. Techs., 490 U.S. 900, 904\r                                                      \r\n\n(1989).   The gravamen of  the employees'  complaint is  that\r\n\nAmerican misled them into believing that they were faced with\r\n\nan impossible choice:  retire with enhanced benefits  or face\r\n\ntermination  when   American   eliminated   the   cargo   and\r\n\nreservations  operations  in  San Juan.

[A]\r\n          plaintiff who has  accepted an employer's\r\n          offer  to retire can be said to have been\r\n          constructively discharged when  the offer\r\n          presented was, at  rock bottom, a  choice\r\n          between early retirement with benefits or\r\n          discharge without benefits . . . . \r\n\nId. at 480  (citations and internal quotations  omitted).  If\r               \r\n\nthe VERP was  a charade, then American  discriminated against\r\n\nthe employees by providing them  no choice but to participate\r\n\nin   an  early  retirement  program  offered  only  to  older\r\n\nemployees.     As  the   alleged  discriminatory   act,  this\r\n\nconstructive discharge triggered the limitations period.

It follows  that,  at  the latest,  the  applicable\r\n\nstatutes  began to run when each  employee accepted the VERP.\r\n\nAll the employees accepted the  VERP more than 300 days prior\r\n\nto  filing  their  administrative  claims.12  Therefore,  the\r\n\nemployees claims are time-barred.\r\n\n          The  employees'  arguments  to   the  contrary  are\r\n\nflawed.  The  employees first argue that the  statute did not\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

This argument is meritless.   In\r\n\nDelaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980) the\r                                           \r\n\nSupreme Court held that a plaintiff's Title VII claim accrued\r\n\nwhen  the employee  was  denied tenure  due  to alleged  race\r\n\ndiscrimination,  not  when  his  actual  employment  contract\r\n\nexpired one year later.   Because the allegedly unlawful  act\r\n\nwas  the denial  of tenure,  the termination date  itself was\r\n\nmerely the \"inevitable  consequence\" of prior  discrimination\r\n\nand thus did  not trigger the statute of limitations.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n257-58.  Here,  the employees' job termination  was similarly\r\n\nthe inevitable result of their decision to participate in the\r\n\nVERP.\r\n\n          The  employees' contend  that their  discrimination\r\n\nclaims did not accrue until younger workers actually replaced\r\n\nthem.    This  argument  fails  because  a  prima  facie  age\r\n\ndiscrimination claim does not necessarily require replacement\r\n\nby a younger worker.  See Sanchez  v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 712, 719  n.7 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing  cases).  Instead,\r\n\nwhen  an  employer  implements  a  reduction-in-force,   \"the\r\n\n[employee] may demonstrate  either that the employer  did not\r\n\ntreat age neutrally or that  younger persons were retained in\r\n\nthe  same position.\"    Hildalgo  v.

And the plaintiff need  not know\r\n          all the  facts that support his  claim in\r\n          order for countdown to commence.\"  \r\n\nMorris, 27 F.3d  at 750. When the employees  signed the VERP,\r                  \r\n\nthey knew that the program was offered only to employees over\r\n\nforty-five  years of  age.   And it  was then,  the employees\r\n\nallege, that American presented them with a \"take it or leave\r\n\nit\"  choice between early  retirement and losing  their jobs.\r\n\nAs a  result,  by  the  time  the  employees  were  allegedly\r\n\npressured   into  accepting   early   retirement,  they   had\r\n\nsufficient information to  bring their discrimination  claim.\r\n\nSee id.\r                   \r\n\n          In this case, the limitations period commenced when\r\n\nthe  employees elected  to participate  in the  VERP.   Thus,\r\n\nunless there exists a basis for equitable modification of the\r\n\nlimitations period, all the employees' ADEA claims are barred\r\n\nas a matter of law.\r\n\n2. Equitable Estoppel and Tolling\r                                             \r\n\n          The  employees   contend  that  the   doctrines  of\r\n\nequitable estoppel  and equitable  tolling should  save their\r\n\nclaims.13  We reject the application of these doctrines here.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The   ADEA  filing  period  is  akin  to  a  statute  of\r\nlimitations and thus, subject to equitable modification.  See\r                                                                         \r\nMercado-Garcia v.

Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, 861 F.2d 746,\r                                                          \r\n\n752 (1st  Cir. 1988).   The employees  have failed  to allege\r\n\nsuch conduct  here.   Rather, they  have simply parroted  the\r\n\nsame  events that gave  rise to their  underlying claim: that\r\n\nAmerican misled them as to the reason for the VERP.  There is\r\n\nno  evidence  that  American caused  the  employees  to delay\r\n\nbringing their lawsuit, or otherwise \"lulled the plaintiff[s]\r\n\ninto  believing  that it  was  not  necessary for  [them]  to\r\n\ncommence  litigation.\"  Dillman v. Combustion Eng., Inc., 784\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 57, 60 (2d  Cir. 1986).  Thus, equitable estoppel is not\r\n\nwarranted.  \r\n\n          Equitable tolling is appropriate when the plaintiff\r\n\ndemonstrates \"excusable  ignorance\" of his  statutory rights.\r\n\nKale, 861  F.2d at  752.  Equitable  tolling does  not apply,\r                \r\n\nhowever, if an  employee is actually or  constructively aware\r\n\nof his or  her ADEA  rights.  Id.  at 753.   An employee  has\r                                             \r\n\nactual knowledge of  his rights if  he \"learns or is  told of\r\n\nhis ADEA rights,  even if he becomes only  generally aware of\r\n\nthe  fact there is  a statute outlawing  age discrimination.\"\r\n\nId.\r               \r\n\n          In  this  case,  each  employee  signed   the  VERP\r\n\nelection  form, which contained a paragraph attesting that he\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nor  she had read  the release.   The release stated  that the\r\n\nemployees were releasing American from any age discrimination\r\n\nclaims he or she may have had.   Therefore, the employees had\r\n\nactual  knowledge of  their ADEA  rights.   In addition,  the\r\n\nemployees have alleged here that, shortly after inducing them\r\n\nto sign the  VERP, American went on a  \"recruitment frenzy of\r\n\nnew  reservation   agents\"  and  announced  that   the  cargo\r\n\ndepartment  would remain  in Puerto  Rico despite  American's\r\n\nearlier  claims.   In  light of  these facts,  the employees'\r\n\nclaim  that their \"excusable\"  ignorance caused them  to wait\r\n\nfar  longer  than   300  days  to  pursue   their  claims  is\r\n\nuntenable.14   See Cada v. Baxter Healthcare  Corp., 920 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n446, 452 (7th Cir. 1990)  (holding that equitable tolling was\r\n\nnot warranted when the employee discovered, three weeks after\r\n\nreceiving  notice of his termination, that a younger employee\r\n\nwould replace him). \r\n\n3.

In pertinent part,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.    The employees  allude  to  the  theory  of  continuing\r\nviolations, which applies when a plaintiff alleges repetitive\r\ninstances of discrimination perpetuated over time. See Havens\r                                                                         \r\nRealty Corp. v.

Like\r\n\nADEA claims, a cause of action under Law  100 accrues when an\r\n\nemployee becomes  aware of  his injury  through receipt of  a\r\n\ntermination  notice.15  See Rodriguez, P.R. Offic.

American  contests  this reading,\r\nasserting that the  case dealt with a hostile  and persistent\r\nsexual harassment  work  atmosphere,  was  issued  without  a\r\nformal  opinion, and  thus, has  no precedential  value.

Therefore,  in   the  context  of   a\r\n\nconstructive  discharge,  the  date  the  employee  elects to\r\n\nretire triggers  the Law 100  limitation period.

We therefore  reverse that portion  of the  district\r\n\ncourt's judgment  declaring that the  employees' retention of\r\n\nbenefits  ratified  the release  of  their ADEA  claims.   We\r\n\nvacate and remand  to the district court  to further consider\r\n\nthe issue  of whether the  release bars non-ADEA claims.

The  VERP  provided  for the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\naddition  of five  years to  each  employee's actual  age for\r\n\npurposes of  calculating  retirements  benefits,  five  years\r\n\nadditional credited service, cash bridge payments of $400 per\r\n\nmonth until the employee became eligible to receive benefits,\r\n\nimmediate retirement  medical benefits  and travel  benefits.\r\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the VERP an  employee had to\r\n\nbe at the  maximum pay scale in their  job classification and\r\n\nat least forty-five years of age.\r\n\n          American informed  the employees  of the  program's\r\n\ndetails by  providing  various VERP-related  documents.   The\r\n\nintroduction to the \"Terms and Conditions\" booklet describing\r\n\nthe  program warned  the  employees  to  read  the  materials\r\n\ncarefully, and  provided a participation deadline of November\r\n\n11,  1994,  with  a  seven  day  rescission  period after  an\r\n\nelection  to  participate.    In  order  to  participate,  an\r\n\nemployee was required  to sign a \"Voluntary  Early Retirement\r\n\nElection  Form\" attesting that  the decision  was \"completely\r\n\nvoluntary, final and  irrevocable,\" that he  or she had  been\r\n\ngiven  forty-five days  to make  the  election, and  that all\r\n\nrights to reemployment with American were being relinquished.\r\n\nThe election form also stated that, on an employee's last day\r\n\nof work, he  or she  would be  required to  sign a  \"Complete\r\n\nRelease of All Claims,\" absolving American of all employment-\r\n\nrelated    liability     including,    specifically,     \"age\r\n\ndiscrimination claims.\"\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The VERP  election form  required each  employee to\r\n\nattest  to  having read  the  entire  release form  prior  to\r\n\nelecting to retire early.   By the terms of the release,  the\r\n\nemployee agreed  not to  bring any  legal proceeding  against\r\n\nAmerican  in any  court, administrative agency,  or tribunal,\r\n\nthat the employee would forfeit the extra retirement benefits\r\n\nif  the employee breached  a material release  term, and also\r\n\nprovided the  party successfully enforcing the  release costs\r\n\nand  attorney's  fees.   The  release  contained  a provision\r\n\nstating:  \"I  have  had reasonable  and  sufficient  time and\r\n\nopportunity   to   consult   with   an   independent    legal\r\n\nrepresentative   of  my  own  choosing  before  signing  this\r\n\nComplete  Release  of   All  Claims.\"    Although   the  VERP\r\n\ndocumentation  advised the  employee to  discuss the  program\r\n\nwith their  families and  to \"consult  a financial  advisor,\"\r\n\nneither  the  release  nor  any  of  the  VERP  documentation\r\n\nexplicitly advised the employees to consult an attorney prior\r\n\nto executing  the release  or electing to  retire.   The only\r\n\nmention  of independent  legal advice  was  contained in  the\r\n\nrelease, which was not to be signed until the employee's last\r\n\nday of work.  Each employee signed  the release on his or her\r\n\nlast day of work. \r\n\n          The appellants elected to participate  in the early\r\n\nretirement  program on various  dates throughout the election\r\n\nperiod.  The earliest election occurred on  October 11, 1994,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe latest on December 13, 1994.  The VERP also provided that\r\n\nthe  employees'  termination   dates  would  depend  on   the\r\n\nrestructuring process; therefore,  after their election,  the\r\n\nemployees  continued to  work.   Over  the  next ten  months,\r\n\nAmerican  began to terminate them individually.  The earliest\r\n\ntermination occurred on  December 30, 1994, while  the latest\r\n\ndid  not  occur  until  September  29,  1995.     After  each\r\n\ntermination,  American paid  the  VERP's enhanced  retirement\r\n\nbenefits.  For several months (the  precise period is unclear\r\n\nfrom  the  record),  each  of  the  appellants  accepted  and\r\n\nretained these benefits. \r\n\n          On   October  27,  1995,  over  a  year  after  the\r\n\nappellants elected to participate in  the VERP, they began to\r\n\nfile administrative  age discrimination claims with  both the\r\n\nPuerto Rico  Anti-Discrimination Unit  (\"ADU\") and  the Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") variously claiming\r\n\nthat   their  election  to   participate  in  the   VERP  was\r\n\ninvoluntary and that American had discriminated against  them\r\n\non the basis of age.  In general, the complaints alleged that\r\n\ncertain  management employees  had  led  older  employees  to\r\n\nbelieve that  American planned to move the  operations in the\r\n\nreservation  and cargo  departments  to  another location  or\r\n\nsubcontract  to an  outside company,  placing  their jobs  in\r\n\njeopardy.   However, once  the employees  elected to  retire,\r\n\nAmerican asked  them to  train new,  younger replacements  to\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nfill their  jobs.

See 28 U.S.C.   2201.   In its\r                                              \r\n\npleadings,  American asked  the district  court  to issue  an\r\n\norder declaring the rights and obligations of  the parties in\r\n\nconnection with the VERP under the Employee Retirement Income\r\n\nSecurity Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.   1132(a)(3).1  Subsequently,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n 1.

American  also moved for\r\n\nsummary judgment  on  the  employees'  counterclaim  arguing,\r\n\ninter  alia,  that the  employees administrative  filings had\r                       \r\n\nbeen untimely.   The court granted American's motion,  and on\r\n\nJanuary 27, 1997, issued a declaratory judgment that:\r\n\n          (1) Defendants have  ratified the release\r\n          agreements  entered   into  by   them  in\r\n          connection with their acceptance of early\r\n          retirement benefits from American; \r\n\n          (2)  the   release  agreements   preclude\r\n          defendants   from   raising   any  claims\r\n          against   American   relating   to  their\r\n          employment or  retirement, including  the\r\n          claims for  age discrimination  under the\r\n          [ADEA, OWBPA, and Puerto Rico Law], \r\n\n          (3)  Defendants  failed   to  file  their\r\n          claims  of  age discrimination  with  the\r\n          EEOC    and    Puerto     Rico's    Anti-\r\n          Discrimination Unit within the applicable\r\n          limitations period. \r\n\nIn  light of  this declaration,  the  district court  granted\r\n\nAmerican's motion for summary judgment on the employees' ADEA\r\n\nand Law 100 counterclaims.

Second,  if the  release does  not bar\r\n\ntheir claims, are the employees' claims nonetheless barred as\r\n\na  matter of  law?    We answer  the  first  question in  the\r\n\nnegative, disagreeing with the district court's determination\r\n\nthat  the employees' release  bars their  ADEA counterclaims.\r\n\nWe agree, however,  that the statute of  limitations bars the\r\n\nemployees' counterclaim.\r\n\n1.  Is the Release Enforceable?\r                                           \r\n\n          American  presents two  alternative arguments  that\r\n\nthe  release the  employees signed  is  enforceable: (1)  the\r\n\nrelease complied with  the OWBPA, 29 U.S.C.    626(f) or, (2)\r\n\nif the  release is  invalid under the  OWBPA, by  refusing to\r\n\nreturn the  enhanced retirement benefits  they received under\r\n\nthe VERP, the  employees ratified the release.   We disagree.\r\n\nWe find that the employees'  release of their ADEA claims did\r\n\nnot comply with the OWBPA and that the ratification  doctrine\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndoes not apply  to invalid ADEA waivers.2   We consider their\r                                                    2\r\n\narguments in turn. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We emphasize that  our holding is limited to  releases of\r\nADEA  claims that  are invalid  under the OWBPA.   We  do not\r\ndecide  or express  any  opinion  on  whether  the  employees\r\nvalidly released their non-ADEA claims. See infra part IV.2. \r                                                             \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          a. Compliance with the OWBPA\r                                                  \r\n\n          Although  the  district court  did  not  reach this\r\n\nissue,  American  contends  that we  can  affirm  the court's\r\n\ndeclaration  because the  releases  the employees  signed are\r\n\nvalid under the OWBPA.  We disagree.\r\n\n          For  an  employee's  waiver of  ADEA  rights  to be\r\n\nenforceable, it must be \"knowing and voluntary.\"   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nLong v.

See\r                                                                         \r\n\n29  U.S.C.       626(f)(1)(E).3     Although  each   employee\r\n\nacknowledged  on the  VERP  election  form  having  read  the\r\n\nrelease before making his or her election, the only reference\r\n\nto  consulting legal counsel  appears in the  release itself,\r\n\nwhich was not to be executed until the employee actually left\r\n\nwork a number of months later.  When the employees elected to\r\n\nretire, however, they promised to  sign the release on  their\r\n\ntermination date as a  condition of receiving benefits.   The\r\n\nrelease  states only: \"I  have had reasonable  and sufficient\r\n\ntime and  opportunity to  consult with  an independent  legal\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   On  appeal, American argues  that the  VERP informed the\r\nemployees that: \r\n\n   [E]ach employee should obtain  whatever advice he or she\r\n   required including consultation with  personal attorneys\r\n   or advisors  and should make  an informed  and voluntary\r\n   choice whether to participate in the plan. \r\n\nAlthough American  cites to  documentation to  support   this\r\ncontention,  nowhere except  in  the release  does the  cited\r\nmaterial mention private legal counsel. \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nrepresentative  of  my  own   choosing  before  signing  this\r\n\nComplete Release of All Claims.\"   The VERP Agreement itself,\r\n\nalthough  it advised employees  to consult financial  and tax\r\n\nadvisors,    to   seek    advice    from   local    personnel\r\n\nrepresentatives,  and to  attend  retirement seminars,4  said\r\n\nnothing  about seeking  independent  legal  advice  prior  to\r\n\nmaking  the election to  retire and  agreeing to  execute the\r\n\nrelease as the statute dictates.\r\n\n          Given  the  burden  OWBPA  places on  employers  to\r\n\ndemonstrate   their    agreements   contain    the   required\r\n\ninformation,  the  reference  contained  in  the  release  is\r\n\ninsufficient to satisfy    626(f)(1)(E).   \"Congress's intent\r\n\nin enacting   626  was to compel employers to provide data so\r\n\nthat  an  employee  considering  waiving  ADEA  rights  could\r\n\nassess,  with the assistance of  counsel, the viability of an\r                                                    \r\n\nADEA claim.\"  Raczak, 103  F.3d at 1259 (emphasis  supplied).\r                                \r\n\nFor this purpose, section 626(f)(1)(E) provides that a waiver\r\n\nis  not knowing  and  voluntary  unless  \"the  individual  is\r\n\nadvised in  writing  to consult  with  an attorney  prior  to\r\n\nexecuting the agreement.\"  To advise is to \"caution,\" \"warn,\"\r\n\nor  \"recommend.\"  See Webster's Third New World International\r                                                                         \r\n\nDictionary 32 (1986).   This statutory requirement  could not\r                      \r\n\nbe more clear, nor its  purpose more central to the statutory\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.

The legislative history of the OWBPA states: \r\n\n    In  the  context   of  ADEA  waivers,  the   Committee\r\n    recognizes    a   fundamental    distinction   between\r\n    individually   tailored   separation  agreements   and\r\n    employer programs targeted at groups of employees.\r\n                             . . .\r\n    During  the  past  decade,  in  particular,  employers\r\n    faced with  the  need to  reduce  workforce size  have\r\n    resorted   to   standardized  programs   designed   to\r\n    effectuate  quick  and  wholesale  reductions.     The\r\n    trademark  of involuntary  termination  programs is  a\r\n    standardized formula  or package of employee  benefits\r\n    that  is available  to more  than one  employee.   The\r\n    trademark  of  voluntary   reduction  programs   is  a\r\n    standardized formula  or package of benefits  designed\r\n    to   induce  employees   voluntarily  to  sever  their\r\n    employment.  In  both cases, the terms of the programs\r\n    generally  are not subject  to negotiation between the\r\n    parties.   In  addition, employees  affected by  those\r\n    programs  have  little or  no  basis  to suspect  that\r\n    action  is  being  taken  based  on  their  individual\r\n    characteristics.    Indeed,  the   employer  generally\r\n    advises them  that the termination  is not  a function\r\n    of   their    individual   status.      Under    these\r                                                                      \r\n    circumstances,  the need  for adequate information and\r                                                                      \r\n    access  to   advice  before  waivers  are   signed  is\r                                                                      \r\n    especially acute. \r                                 \r\n\nS.

We disagree.  The fact that the\r\n\nemployees may have known they were waiving rights in exchange\r\n\nfor enhanced  retirement benefits  does  not satisfy  section\r\n\n626(f)(1)(E).   We read section  626(f)(1)(E) to mean what it\r\n\nsays: employers must  advise employees in writing  to consult\r\n\nan attorney prior to executing  a release of ADEA claims. The\r\n\nfailure to advise the employees to  consult with counsel goes\r\n\nto the  heart of  the statute's purpose.6   Because  American\r\n\nfailed to directly advise their employees to consult a lawyer\r\n\nbefore making the election, we rule, as a matter of law, that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In  light of the OWBPA's imprecise terms, some violations\r\nmay be  so technical as  to be de  minimis, and thus  may not\r\ninvalidate an  otherwise valid  release of  ADEA claims.  See\r                                                                         \r\nRaczak,  103 F.2d at  1260. American's failure  adequately to\r                  \r\nadvise  the employees  to  obtain  counsel is  in  no way  de\r\nminimis.     \r                         \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nAmerican failed to meet its burden under the OWBPA.7  See  29\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.   626(f)(1).\r\n\n          b.

Rather, it  held\r\n\nthat  the  employees'   acceptance  of  enhanced   retirement\r\n\nbenefits, as well as their opposition to the court's order to\r\n\ndeposit  the  disputed  retirement  funds  into  the  court's\r\n\nregistry pending the outcome of  this litigation, constituted\r\n\na  ratification  of  the  original  release  agreement.    We\r\n\ndisagree.\r\n\n          In the  past,  we  have  applied  the  ratification\r\n\ndoctrine  to  enforce  an otherwise  invalid  release  on the\r\n\nground that \"'[a] contract or release, the execution of which\r\n\nis induced by  duress, is voidable, not void,  and the person\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.   As the employees point out, the waiver is also deficient\r\nin  another manner.   The waiver broadly  prohibits employees\r\nfrom  maintaining   \"any  legal  proceedings  of  any  nature\r\nwhatsoever  against American  et  al.  before  any  court  or\r                                                \r\nadministrative  agency\" and  requires  them  to \"direct  that\r\nagency or court  to withdraw from or dismiss  the matter with\r\nprejudice\"  if  the  agency  assumes  jurisdiction  on  their\r\nbehalf.  Section  626(f)(4), however, states: \"No  waiver may\r\nbe used to justify interfering with the protected right of an\r\nemployee to file a charge or participate  in an investigation\r\nor proceeding conducted by the Commission.\"  Cf.

The    arguments    for    and    against\r\n\nincorporating the ratification and tender-back doctrines into\r\n\nthe ADEA have been thoroughly reviewed in these cases, and we\r\n\nwill not repeat their analysis fully.  \r\n\n          The decisions  in favor  of ratification  primarily\r\n\nargue  that, because Congress  used \"the terms  'knowing' and\r\n\n'voluntary,' which parallel the common-law concepts of fraud,\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nduress,  and  mistake,  it  is  apparent  that  Congress  was\r\n\ndefining only those  circumstances in which a  contract would\r\n\nbe voidable, not when it  would be void.\"  Blistein, 74  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  1466.

Section\r\n\n626(f)(1) states a clear rule: an individual  \"may not waive\"\r\n\nan ADEA claim unless  the waiver is \"knowing and  voluntary.\"\r\n\nAnd a waiver is not knowing and voluntary unless the employer\r\n\ncomplies with the eight OWBPA requirements.

If  the  ratification   doctrine  is\r\n\nincorporated  into  this  scheme,  an employer  could  obtain\r\n\nwaivers  without advising the employee to consult an attorney\r\n\nand then put  the employee to the difficult  choice of giving\r\n\nup essential benefits in order  to protect his or her rights.\r\n\nThe very  problem that Congress  enacted the OWBPA  to remedy\r\n\ncould  thus   resurface,  albeit   through  the   back  door.\r\n\nTherefore, incorporating the  ratification doctrine into  the\r\n\nOWBPA could act to undermine the incentives  for employers to\r\n\nfollow  OWBPA's  procedures  and  deter  the  prosecution  of\r\n\nmeritorious claims.

Gillette Co. Long-Term Disability  Plan, 70 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n          The  conflict between  common-law ratification  and\r\n\nthe statutory scheme at issue here is particularly stark when\r\n\nan  employer  seeks to  induce  an employee  to  accept early\r\n\nretirement.  Here, the employees voluntarily agreed to retire\r\n\nin exchange  for enhanced  benefits  without which,  American\r\n\nassures us, they would have remained on the job at American's\r\n\nhighest pay scale.  Courts applying the ratification doctrine\r\n\nto  ADEA claims  have  stated  that  the  employees  must  be\r\n\nrequired  to restore  the status  quo  by tendering-back  the\r\n\nbenefits  they  received  for  waiving  their  claims.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nBlakeney,  65  F.3d  at  485.    This  position  is  arguably\r                    \r\n\nplausible in the context of a unilateral termination when  an\r\n\nemployee receives  severance benefits  an employer would  not\r\n\nhave paid but for the  release.  See, e.g., Wamsley, 11  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 72.   In  the context of  a voluntary  retirement program,\r\n\nhowever,  tendering  back  the  benefits  received  does  not\r\n\nrestore the status quo.\r\n\n          For instance,  American does not  contend that  the\r\n\nemployees  should, as a  precondition to suing,  refuse their\r\n\nretirement benefits  and seek  reinstatement.  American  does\r\n\nnot,  in  other  words, contemplate  the  restoration  of the\r\n\nstatus quo.

The district court opinion is unclear as to whether the\r\n\nrelease,  despite  the  employees'  invalid  waiver  of  ADEA\r\n\nclaims,  nonetheless  would  bar their  Puerto  Rico  Law 100\r\n\nclaims,  as  well  as  any  other  claims  relating  to their\r\n\nemployment.  In reaching a conclusion that it does, the court\r\n\nmerely  stated: \"The  result  is the  same under  Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw.\"  \r\n\n          In  Long,  the  Third  Circuit,   facing  the  same\r                              \r\n\nproblem, explained:  \r\n\n          [T]he district court rested  its grant of\r\n          summary judgment as to  all claims on its\r\n          finding that the  release as a  whole was\r\n          voidable and had been ratified . . . . \r\n          Our holding,  confined as  it is to  ADEA\r\n          releases  invalid under  OWBPA, does  not\r\n          automatically dispose of the remainder of\r\n          [the employee's]  claims as might  be the\r\n          case if we had rested our decision on the\r\n          void/voidable distinction.\r\n\n105  F.3d at  1544-45.

As already  noted, we affirm  the court's dismissal  of\r\nADEA  and Law  100  claims  because they  are  barred by  the\r\nstatute  of  limitations.    See  infra.     The  statute  of\r                                                   \r\nlimitations does not,  however, provide an independent  basis\r\nfor affirming the district court's declaratory judgment.  The\r\ndistrict  court s declaratory judgment  had three  parts: (1)\r\nthat the release was ratified, (2) that the release precludes\r\nall employment   related claims (including ADEA  claims), and\r               \r\n(3) that the  employees  age discrimination claims  are time-\r\nbarred.   On appeal, we  must determine if the  trial court's\r\ndeclaratory judgment, a final ruling  that is res judicata in\r\nany  future litigation concerning this release, is correct in\r\nall respects.   See  10A Charles A.  Wright, et  al., Federal\r                                                                         \r\nPractice  and  Procedure,        2771  (1983)(\"A  declaratory\r                                    \r\njudgment is  binding on the  parties before the court  and is\r\nres  judicata in  subsequent proceedings  as  to the  matters\r\ndeclared. . . .\").   The statute of limitations  is  relevant\r\nonly to the  third part of the district   court s declaratory\r\njudgment.   Therefore, we  must reach the  ratification issue\r\ndespite the fact  that the employees  counterclaim  is barred\r\nby the limitations period.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\npendency  of this action, these funds have been accumulating.\r\n\nThe question  remains as  to their  proper disposition.   The\r\n\nrecord  reflects that  American choose  not  to address  this\r\n\nissue  on summary  judgment and  neither party  raises it  on\r\n\nappeal.   Therefore, we do  not reach  this issue.   We note,\r\n\nhowever, that  these funds  are due  to the employees  unless\r\n\nthere exists  a basis for their retention.

We\r\n\naffirm as  to the  federal claims,  although we clarify  that\r\n\nfour of the employees' Law 100  claims were not barred by the\r\n\nstatute of limitations. \r\n\n1.

When the employees  signed the VERP,\r                  \r\n\nthey knew that the program was offered only to employees over\r\n\nforty-five  years of  age.   And it  was then,  the employees\r\n\nallege, that American presented them with a \"take it or leave\r\n\nit\"  choice between early  retirement and losing  their jobs.\r\n\nAs a  result,  by  the  time  the  employees  were  allegedly\r\n\npressured   into  accepting   early   retirement,  they   had\r\n\nsufficient information to  bring their discrimination  claim.\r\n\nSee id.\r                   \r\n\n          In this case, the limitations period commenced when\r\n\nthe  employees elected  to participate  in the  VERP.

Thus, equitable estoppel is not\r\n\nwarranted.  \r\n\n          Equitable tolling is appropriate when the plaintiff\r\n\ndemonstrates \"excusable  ignorance\" of his  statutory rights.\r\n\nKale, 861  F.2d at  752.

The release stated  that the\r\n\nemployees were releasing American from any age discrimination\r\n\nclaims he or she may have had.   Therefore, the employees had\r\n\nactual  knowledge of  their ADEA  rights.   In addition,  the\r\n\nemployees have alleged here that, shortly after inducing them\r\n\nto sign the  VERP, American went on a  \"recruitment frenzy of\r\n\nnew  reservation   agents\"  and  announced  that   the  cargo\r\n\ndepartment  would remain  in Puerto  Rico despite  American's\r\n\nearlier  claims.   In  light of  these facts,  the employees'\r\n\nclaim  that their \"excusable\"  ignorance caused them  to wait\r\n\nfar  longer  than   300  days  to  pursue   their  claims  is\r\n\nuntenable.14   See Cada v.

Like\r\n\nADEA claims, a cause of action under Law  100 accrues when an\r\n\nemployee becomes  aware of  his injury  through receipt of  a\r\n\ntermination  notice.15  See Rodriguez, P.R. Offic.

American  contests  this reading,\r\nasserting that the  case dealt with a hostile  and persistent\r\nsexual harassment  work  atmosphere,  was  issued  without  a\r\nformal  opinion, and  thus, has  no precedential  value.
