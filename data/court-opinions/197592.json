In  this case, the  defendants, a\r\n\nBoston  law  firm  and  its  constituent   partners  (hereinafter\r\n\ncollectively  Goodwin,   Procter),  counselled   their  erstwhile\r\n\nclients that  when  acquiring real  estate  in Aruba  there  were\r\n\nmaterial risks associated with doing so in the Aruban style.

Costly problems surfaced  after the deal\r\n\nwas done.\r\n\n          Unwilling  to absorb the  loss in silence,  the clients\r\n\nsued for malpractice.

TROUBLE IN PARADISE\r          I.  TROUBLE IN PARADISE\r\n\n          Inasmuch as the  appellants profess not to  contest the\r\n\nfacts as  found  by the  lower court,  we lean  heavily upon  the\r\n\nopinion  below in recounting the relevant events.  See id. at    \r                                                                    \r\n\n[slip op. at 2-18].\r\n\n          In 1991, plaintiffs-appellants  Sierra Fria Corporation\r\n\nand Rodrigo Rocha   (hereinafter collectively Rocha)  acquired an\r\n\noption to  purchase two Aruban  resort hotels, the Divi  Divi and\r\n\nthe   Divi  Tamarijn,  from   Grape  Holding  N.V.   (Grape)  for\r\n\napproximately $35,000,000.    Rocha engaged  Goodwin, Procter  as\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nlead counsel,  with overall responsibility for coordinating legal\r\n\ndue diligence involved in the transaction.  The law firm assigned\r\n\na partner, Michael  Glazer, and an associate, Minta  Kay, to work\r\n\non  the acquisition.   Both attorneys specialized  in real estate\r\n\nlaw, but neither previously had handled an Aruban transaction.\r\n\n          Kay received a  draft title memorandum based  on Aruban\r\n\nland records  from Ingrid  Bleeker, an  attorney affiliated  with\r\n\nSmeets, Thesseling  &amp; Von Borkhorst  (a firm that one  of Rocha's\r\n\njoint  venturers had  hired for its  familiarity with  Aruban and\r\n\nDutch law).  Kay, who had  hoped to obtain either title insurance\r\n\nor  an  as-built  survey  or  both,  expressed  concern that  the\r\n\nmemorandum lacked solid  title assurances.  Bleeker  informed her\r\n\nthat  title insurance was  unavailable in  Aruba and  that Aruban\r\n\nreal estate  transactions customarily proceeded  without as-built\r\n\nsurveys.  The prevailing practice, she said, was to requisition a\r\n\ntitle opinion  from a  local notary.   Bleeker also  informed Kay\r\n\nthat, if an as-built  survey could be  obtained at all, it  would\r\n\nnecessitate  an  extremely  costly  and  time-consuming  process.\r\n\nFrank Zeven, a more senior member of the  Smeets firm, spoke with\r\n\nGlazer  and confirmed Bleeker's  depiction of Aruban  real estate\r\n\npractices.\r\n\n          Based on these conversations, Glazer and Kay understood\r\n\nthat if Rocha purchased the hotels according to Aruban custom, he\r\n\nrisked not knowing  exactly what assets he was  acquiring.  Their\r\n\nconcern heightened when  they realized that a  time-share complex\r\n\n(Dutch Village) adjoined the Divi  Tamarijn Beach Resort and that\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nno clearly visible dividing line separated the properties.  Thus,\r\n\nKay spoke to Christopher DeChiario, Rocha's long-time aide.   She\r\n\nexplained  the  hazards  of  proceeding  without  a  survey,  and\r\n\nDeChiario promised  to  discuss the  matter with  Rocha.   Glazer\r\n\nlater spoke  directly to Rocha  about the risks attendant  to the\r\n\nabsence  of  a   survey.    Rocha  indicated  that   he  was  not\r\n\nparticularly concerned.   Consequently, Goodwin, Procter  did not\r\n\ncommission a  survey and  Kay continued to  work with  Bleeker to\r\n\ndetermine  precisely  what  assets were  located  on  the hotels'\r\n\nproperties.\r\n\n          Bleeker   eventually  mailed   several   maps  of   the\r\n\nproperties to Goodwin,  Procter.  Kay informed DeChiario that the\r\n\nmaps  did not answer  the boundary questions  and again explained\r\n\nthat,  without  a  survey, Rocha  lacked  assurance  that  he was\r\n\npurchasing all the improvements.   DeChiario told Kay to press on\r\n\nwith the transaction notwithstanding the absence of a survey, and\r\n\nto focus her efforts on securing a cross-use agreement with Dutch\r\n\nVillage  that  would permit  Divi  Tamarijn guests  to  use Dutch\r\n\nVillage's facilities, and vice-versa.\r\n\n          When Glazer  and Kay met  with Rocha  and DeChiario  to\r\n\niron out some  wrinkles in the proposed cross-use agreement, they\r\n\nonce again explained that, absent a survey, a purchaser could not\r\n\nknow  whether  the  envisioned property  encompassed  all  of the\r\n\nhotels' facilities.   Rocha stated that he was  not interested in\r\n\nobtaining  a survey  and that  he was  willing to  consummate the\r\n\nseemingly lucrative transaction without one.   Kay then drafted a\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nmemorandum detailing  her concerns and  sent copies to  Rocha and\r\n\nDeChiario.\r\n\n          During  a subsequent  conference  call  with Rocha  and\r\n\nother investors, Kay again voiced her worries  about the location\r\n\nof various  facilities.  Rocha  grew impatient and made  it clear\r\n\nthat speed was  his highest priority.  He  expressed eagerness to\r\n\ntake control  of the  hotels during the  height of  the 1991-1992\r\n\ntourist season,  and he  indicated a willingness  to rely  on the\r\n\ncross-use agreement and the customary Aruban title assurances for\r\n\nprotection.\r\n\n          Goodwin,  Procter  received  a  standard  Aruban  title\r\n\nopinion from Maria  Eman, an Aruban notary, firmed  up the cross-\r\n\nuse  agreement, and  thereafter  consummated the  transaction  on\r\n\nFebruary  11,  1992.     The  closing  did  not  bring   closure:\r\n\napproximately one year later, Rocha learned that assets having an\r\n\nappraised  value in excess of $4,000,000   tennis courts, parking\r\n\nspaces,  and  an  administrative  building  housing  the  hotels'\r\n\nlaundry facilities   lay on land belonging to Dutch Village.\r\n\n          After  unsuccessfully attempting to  gain title  to the\r\n\nassets, Rocha  invoked diversity  jurisdiction, see  28 U.S.C.   \r                                                             \r\n\n1332(a) (1994), and  brought suit against  Goodwin, Procter.   In\r\n\nhis complaint,  Rocha accused  the defendants  of negligence  and\r\n\nbreach  of a  contractual obligation  to  perform legal  services\r\n\nskillfully, prudently,  and accurately.  Goodwin,  Procter denied\r\n\nRocha's charges.\r\n\n          The  United States District  Court for the  District of\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nMassachusetts,  Morris  E.  Lasker, District  Judge,  conducted a\r\n\nfive-day  bench trial.   The  judge then  authored an  opinion in\r\n\nwhich he  identified the  controlling issue  as whether  Goodwin,\r\n\nProcter  \"informed Rocha of  th[e] risk [of  proceeding without a\r\n\nsurvey]  with  sufficient  emphasis  and  particularity  to  make\r\n\ncertain that his decision  on whether to consummate  the purchase\r\n\nwas  intelligent and knowing.\"  Sierra Fria,      F. Supp. at    \r                                                     \r\n\n[slip op.  at  3].   He resolved  this issue  in the  defendants'\r\n\nfavor, basing  his decision  primarily  on an  assessment of  the\r\n\nrelative credibility of  Glazer, Kay, and Rocha.   In particular,\r\n\nJudge  Lasker  credited   the  attorneys'  testimony  that   they\r\n\nrepeatedly  had warned  Rocha  about  the  dangers  attendant  to\r\n\npurchasing  the  hotels  without a  survey  and  found incredible\r\n\nRocha's denial that they had uttered such warnings.1  See  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n    [slip op. at 16].\r\n\nII.  THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\r          II.  THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\r\n\n          Goodwin, Procter  is a  Boston-based firm,  retained in\r\n\nMassachusetts.  Although the firm devoted its labors to  property\r\n\nlocated abroad,  neither  party disputes  that Massachusetts  law\r\n\nsupplies  the substantive rule of decision.   We therefore survey\r\n\nMassachusetts legal malpractice law to determine whether Goodwin,\r\n\nProcter's conduct falls safely within its boundaries.  See Borden\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Paul Revere  Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370, 375 (1st Cir. 1991);\r                                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The court  also ruled against  Rocha on a variety  of other\r\nclaims.  See Sierra Fria,      F. Supp. at    ,     [slip  op. at\r                                  \r\n23-24,  28].   None  of  those  rulings  has been  appealed  and,\r\ntherefore, we take no view of them.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nMoores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 n.2 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                             \r\n\n          In  general, Massachusetts law  requires a client  in a\r\n\nlegal malpractice case  to show that  the attorney had a  duty to\r\n\nthe  client, that  he  breached  the duty,  and  that his  breach\r\n\nproximately caused  the plaintiff's harm.  See Fishman v. Brooks,\r                                                                          \r\n\n487  N.E.2d 1377,  1379-80 (Mass.  1986).   The first  element is\r\n\nindigenous to the attorney-client relationship; in Massachusetts,\r\n\nas elsewhere,  an  attorney owes  his  or her  client a  duty  to\r\n\nexercise a reasonable degree of care and skill in the performance\r\n\nof legal  tasks.  See Wagenmann v. Adams,  829 F.2d 196, 218 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1987);  Pongonis v.  Saab, 486 N.E.2d  28, 29  (Mass. 1985).\r                                        \r\n\nThe second element is of critical importance here.  Under it, the\r\n\nplaintiff  \"must demonstrate that the attorney failed to exercise\r\n\nreasonable care  and skill in  handling the matter for  which the\r\n\nattorney  was retained.\"   Colucci  v.  Rosen, Goldberg,  Slavet,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLevenson &amp; Wekstein,  515 N.E.2d 891, 894 (Mass.  App. Ct. 1987).\r                             \r\n\nThe third element  is standard fare in tort  actions and requires\r\n\nno  discussion in  connection  with  Rocha's  central  theory  of\r\n\nliability;  if,  on   these  facts,  closing  without   a  survey\r\n\nconstituted malpractice, then the harm to Rocha is manifest.\r\n\n          Of course, generalized concepts of duty and breach must\r\n\nbe adapted to fit particular contexts.  Thus, when a client seeks\r\n\nadvice from  an attorney, the attorney owes the client \"a duty of\r\n\nfull  and  fair  disclosure of  facts  material  to the  client's\r\n\ninterests.\"  Williams  v. Ely, 668 N.E.2d 799,  806 (Mass. 1996).\r                                       \r\n\nThis  means that  the  attorney  must advise  the  client of  any\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nsignificant legal risks involved  in a contemplated  transaction,\r\n\nand must do  so in terms sufficiently plain to  permit the client\r\n\nto  assess both  the  risks  and their  potential  impact on  his\r\n\nsituation.   Consequently,  in a  legal  malpractice action  that\r\n\nimplicates an attorney's performance of his  counseling function,\r\n\nthe trier of  fact must determine  whether the attorney's  advice\r\n\npermitted the client adequately to  weigh the risks involved in a\r\n\ngiven course of action.  See id.\r                                          \r\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\r          III.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Although Rocha  presents a  multifaceted asseverational\r\n\narray, his appeal boils down to two interlocking claims of error.\r\n\nWe examine them sequentially.\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  appellant posits that the district court's opinion\r\n\nviolates Fed. R.  Civ. P. 52(a)  and thereby precludes  effective\r\n\nappellate review.  This proposition is unfounded.\r\n\n          In terms, Rule  52(a) dictates that, in  a bench trial,\r\n\nthe court \"shall  find the facts  specially and state  separately\r\n\nits conclusions of law.\"   This directive \"impose[s] on the trial\r\n\ncourt an  obligation to  ensure that its  ratio decidendi  is set\r                                                                   \r\n\nforth with enough clarity to enable a reviewing court reliably to\r\n\nperform its function.\"  Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc., 43\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  754, 759  (1st  Cir.  1995).   But  this imperative  has  a\r\n\npractical,  commonsense cast.   Rule 52(a) requires  trial judges\r\n\nneither  to pen exhaustive dissertations nor to make findings and\r\n\nconclusions that are  exquisitely precise.  As long  as the trial\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncourt  clearly  relates  the  findings of  fact  upon  which  its\r\n\ndecision rests and  articulates in a readily  intelligible manner\r\n\nthe conclusions that it draws  by applying the controlling law to\r\n\nthe  facts  as  found,  no  more is  exigible.    See  Peckham v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nContinental Cas.  Ins. Co.,  895 F.2d 830,  842 (1st  Cir. 1990).\r                                    \r\n\nJudge  Lasker's twenty-eight page opinion clears this hurdle with\r\n\nroom to spare.\r\n\n          We  need not tarry.  The judge's rescript recapitulates\r\n\nthe  trial testimony  of the  key  witnesses, limns  a series  of\r\n\ncredibility calls, delineates reasons for crediting the testimony\r\n\nof some witnesses and discounting  that of others, and traces the\r\n\ninferences that flow  from the credited  testimony.  The  judge's\r\n\nthorough  exposition of  his factual  findings  stands in  marked\r\n\ncontrast to the  unsupported generalizations that  have triggered\r\n\nRule 52(a) concerns in the cases  upon which Rocha relies.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Touch, 43  F.3d at 758-59; Pearson  v.

Regardless of the  battery of factual findings, he\r\n\nsays, the judge made  only a single conclusion of  law and, thus,\r\n\ndid  not comply  with  Rule  52(a).   This  is  little more  than\r\n\nwhistling  past   the  graveyard.     Rule   52(a)  announces   a\r\n\nqualitative,  not a quantitative,  standard   and  here, Goodwin,\r\n\nProcter  either  was or  was  not  guilty  of negligence  in  its\r\n\nrepresentation of Rocha.  Since the judge made the solitary legal\r\n\nconclusion  necessary for resolution  of the action,  our inquiry\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nfocuses on the clarity of that conclusion.\r\n\n          Judge Lasker  framed the  applicable legal  standard in\r\n\nterms of whether the law firm informed its client of the risks of\r\n\nproceeding  without  a  survey  \"with   sufficient  emphasis  and\r\n\nparticularity  to make  certain that  his decision on  whether to\r\n\nconsummate the  purchase was  intelligent and  knowing.\"   Sierra\r                                                                           \r\n\nFria,      F. Supp. at     [slip op. at  3].  This formulation is\r              \r\n\nentirely consistent with  Massachusetts law.  See  supra Part II.\r                                                                  \r\n\nThe  judge then applied the standard to the discerned facts.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSierra Fria,      F. Supp. at      [slip  op. at 17-18].

His new lawyer  says that he is  contesting only\r\n\nthe court's legal conclusion, not its factfinding.  Therefore, he\r\n\nargues,  we  must  undertake  de  novo  review of  the  decision.\r\n\nGoodwin,  Procter not only  defends Judge Lasker's  decision, but\r\n\nalso disparages Rocha's  attempt to import a de  novo standard of\r\n\nreview  into  the  case.    We  address  this  standard-of-review\r\n\nimbroglio before  turning to the  various facets of  Rocha's main\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n                                1.\r                                          1.\r\n\n          We  have made it pellucid  that \"appeals in the federal\r\n\ncourt  system  are usually  arrayed  along  a degree-of-deference\r\n\ncontinuum, stretching from plenary  review at one pole to  highly\r\n\ndeferential modes of review .  . . at the opposite pole.\"   In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nExtradition  of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327  (1st Cir. 1993).

See id.\r                                             \r\n\n          There  is, however, a  middle ground which  consists of\r\n\nthe trial  court's answers to mixed  questions of law and  fact  \r\n\nand that middle  ground is not amenable to  a single standard-of-\r\n\nreview rubric.  Rather, the applicable  standard of review varies\r\n\ndepending upon the  nature of the mixed question;  the more fact-\r\n\ndominated  it is, the  more likely that  deferential, clear-error\r\n\nreview will  obtain, and the  more law-dominated it is,  the more\r\n\nlikely that non-deferential, de novo review will obtain.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 1328.\r\n\n          Putting  the issue  that Rocha  seeks to  raise  in its\r\n\nproper  place along  the  law/fact  continuum  ends  the  instant\r\n\nstandard-of-review controversy.  Though  Rocha casts his argument\r\n\nartfully, it is perfectly plain that determining whether Goodwin,\r\n\nProcter exercised  due  care in  representing  Rocha is  a  fact-\r\n\nintensive exercise, see  Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888  F.2d 189, 193\r                                                       \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1989), and the  district court, sitting without a jury,\r\n\nappropriately treated  it as such.

Here, the  district\r\n\njudge accepted the facts surrounding the transaction very much as\r\n\nstated by Glazer and Kay, rejecting Rocha's contrary account.  We\r\n\ndo  not find the judge's decision to disbelieve Rocha's testimony\r\n\nclearly erroneous.  Ample  evidence controverted Rocha's  protest\r\n\nthat  he was unaware of the dangers inherent in closing without a\r\n\nsurvey, including the lawyers'  testimony and various documentary\r\n\nevidence (notes, memos, and letters).  Credibility determinations\r\n\nfall squarely within  the trier's preserve, see, e.g., Anthony v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st  Cir. 1991), and for good reason:\r                 \r\n\nwhere a judge presides at  a bench trial, observes the witnesses'\r\n\ndemeanor, and hears  their words as they  are uttered, he  is far\r\n\nbetter equipped  to gauge  their veracity (or  lack of  veracity)\r\n\nthan is an appellate panel consigned to sift a paper record after\r\n\nthe fact.  Hence, we decline the appellant's implicit  invitation\r\n\nto disturb the judge's credibility-based findings.\r\n\n          This determination  does not end  our work.   We  still\r\n\nmust evaluate the  judge's conclusion, based on his acceptance of\r\n\nthe  attorneys'   testimony,  that   Goodwin,  Procter  was   not\r\n\nnegligent.  Having performed this evaluation, we find no error.\r\n\n          The losing party always faces an  arduous climb when he\r\n\nattempts to  impugn a factbound finding (such  as a finding of no\r\n\nnegligence)  that results  from a  bench trial.   Here,  however,\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nRocha's difficulties  are twice compounded.   For one  thing, the\r\n\nascent becomes steeper  when the loser bears the  burden of proof\r\n\non the issue.  For another thing, the grade increases  still more\r\n\nwhen the  trier  rests the  challenged finding  on a  credibility\r\n\njudgment.   Recognizing the  inhospitable nature of  the terrain,\r\n\nRocha argues that, even accepting Glazer's and Kay's narrative of\r\n\nwhat   transpired,   Goodwin,   Procter's  unfocused   advice    \r\n\nparticularly  the firm's inadequate  explanation of the  cost and\r\n\ntime requirements of an Aruban  survey and its failure to suggest\r\n\na post-closing arrangement as an alternative protective mechanism\r\n\n  did not allow Rocha to weigh his options realistically.\r\n\n          In  assembling  this  argument,  Rocha  overstates  the\r\n\nrelevant  standard  of  care.    Massachusetts  law  requires  an\r\n\nattorney performing a counseling function to advise the client in\r\n\na  manner  that permits  the latter  intelligently to  assess the\r\n\nrisks of taking (or declining to take)  a particular action.  But\r\n\nlawyers     even   high-priced  lawyers     ordinarily   are  not\r\n\nguarantors of favorable results.  It is neither fair,  practical,\r\n\nnor  legally appropriate  to  benchmark  an  attorney  against  a\r\n\nstandard of prescience.  Thus,  lawyers are not obliged to relate\r\n\nin  exquisite  detail  every  fact  or  circumstance  that  might\r\n\nconceivably have a bearing on  the client's business decision  or\r\n\nto anticipate remote risks.  See Williams, 668 N.E.2d at 806.  By\r                                                   \r\n\nthe same token, lawyers are not  expected to persist relentlessly\r\n\nwhen  clients      especially  clients   who  are   sophisticated\r\n\nbusinessmen   choose to go  forward after being suitably informed\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nof looming risks.

And given the facts as found, the expert testimony adduced\r\n\nat trial does  not support the claim of  negligence, but, rather,\r\n\nconfirms that Goodwin, Procter adhered to the applicable standard\r\n\nof care when it advised Rocha of the risks inherent in proceeding\r\n\nwithout a survey.\r\n\n          The parties each  offered one expert witness  who dealt\r\n\nsubstantively with the  standard of care applicable  to attorneys\r\n\npracticing  in Massachusetts.3   Rocha's expert,  Stoddard Platt,\r\n\ntestified  that  Goodwin,  Procter had  two  viable  options when\r\n\naddressing  the survey problem:   to locate and commission Dutch-\r\n\nspeaking surveyors to fly to Aruba and map the  properties, or to\r\n\nwarn  Rocha about  the perils  of  closing without  a survey  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3While  Rocha   presented  an   additional  expert   witness\r\n(Professor  Richard Perlmutter), he  served only to  confirm that\r\nthe  substantive testimony of Rocha's principal expert (which had\r\nbeen  cast in  terms of  the New  York standard of  care) applied\r\nequally in Massachusetts.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\npermit him to make an informed decision about whether to proceed.\r\n\nFor the  purpose of his  testimony, Platt  assumed that  Goodwin,\r\n\nProcter  never warned  Rocha  about  these  hazards  and  thereby\r\n\ntransgressed  the standard of  care.  Goodwin,  Procter's expert,\r\n\nPhillip Nexon, started from a  different premise.  He assumed the\r\n\ntruth  of Glazer's  and  Kay's  testimony  that  they  repeatedly\r\n\ncautioned Rocha and  concluded that these warnings  satisfied the\r\n\nstandard of care.\r\n\n          Once the judge resolved the assumptions underlying each\r\n\nexpert's testimony  in Goodwin, Procter's favor,  any substantive\r\n\ndissonance vanished.   Rocha's expert  admitted as  much when  he\r\n\nacknowledged that if \"the client was brought in, . . . the issues\r\n\nwere discussed with the client  and the client decided to proceed\r\n\nwithout  a   survey,\"  then   Goodwin,   Procter  fulfilled   its\r\n\nobligations  to  Rocha.    That,  of course,  is  precisely  what\r\n\nhappened here    or so the trier supportably  found.  In light of\r\n\nthis testimonial harmony, we have  no warrant to set aside, under\r\n\nprinciples of clear-error review, the district court's conclusion\r\n\nthat Goodwin, Procter did not negligently advise Rocha.\r\n\n                                3.\r                                          3.\r\n\n          On appeal, Rocha  attempts to blunt  the force of  this\r\n\nreasoning by insisting that  Goodwin, Procter negligently  failed\r\n\nto explore the possibility of  offsetting the absence of a survey\r\n\nby  constructing some  type of  post-closing  arrangement.   This\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nargument founders on evidentiary shoals.4\r\n\n          First,  Platt   Rocha's expert    testified that he had\r\n\nnever consummated a real estate transaction that included a post-\r\n\nclosing survey component.  This jibed with the testimony of Nexon\r\n\n  Goodwin, Procter's expert   who classified post-closing surveys\r\n\nas  \"not  customary.\"   Further, Rocha  adduced no  evidence that\r\n\nanother  type of post-closing arrangement could have remedied the\r\n\nboundary  problems,   much  less  that   customary  Massachusetts\r\n\npractice suggested some such arrangement.\r\n\n          Second,  and  perhaps  more fundamentally,  the  record\r\n\ncontains no expert  testimony that the Massachusetts  standard of\r\n\ncare required  Goodwin,  Procter to  recommend  any  post-closing\r\n\narrangement to Rocha.  We reiterate that Rocha's expert testified\r\n\nthat the lawyers could conform to the standard of care  either by\r\n\ncommissioning  a survey  or  by  warning Rocha  of  the risks  of\r\n\nproceeding  without one.   To  avoid  this evidentiary  obstacle,\r\n\nRocha  appears to  argue  that  even after  he  made an  informed\r\n\ndecision to  proceed without a survey, Goodwin,  Procter had some\r\n\nresidual duty to suggest a prophylactic post-closing arrangement.\r\n\nYet,  Rocha points  to  no expert  testimony  that supports  this\r\n\nformulation of the standard of  care.  While \"expert testimony is\r\n\nnot essential where the claimed  legal malpractice is so gross or\r\n\nobvious  that laymen  can  rely  on  their  common  knowledge  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4In   point  of  fact,  Goodwin,  Procter  did  discuss  and\r\nimplement  a post-closing arrangement   the cross-use agreement  \r\nin an effort  to ameliorate the risks inherent  in purchasing the\r\nhotels without an as-built survey.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nrecognize or infer negligence,\" Pongonis,  486 N.E.2d at 29, this\r                                                  \r\n\nnarrow exception  to the  expert testimony  requirement does  not\r\n\nencompass Rocha's sophisticated theory of negligence.\r\n\n          We summarize succinctly.  Given the evidence of record,\r\n\nit is  readily apparent that  the district court's  conclusion is\r\n\nnot poisoned by  Goodwin, Procter's  failure to  suggest a  post-\r\n\nclosing arrangement as an antidote to the absence of a survey.\r\n\n                                4.\r                                          4.\r\n\n          Rocha's  last  asseveration  is a  variation  on  these\r\n\nthemes.  He maintains that he  agreed to proceed without a survey\r\n\nonly on the  condition that he receive the  same title assurances\r\n\nas the prospective  first mortgagee, Bank  of Nova Scotia  (BNS).\r\n\nTo the extent  that Rocha couches this contention in  terms of an\r\n\nimplied  contract, he  failed  to raise  it  below and  therefore\r\n\ncannot raise it  for the  first time  on appeal.   See Correa  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 116 S.

Ct. 515 (1995).\r                                      \r\n\n          Even if Rocha had not  waived this contention, it would\r\n\nfail on  the merits.   Glazer testified that  when he told  Rocha\r\n\nthat he would  receive the same assurances as BNS,  he meant that\r\n\nRocha would  receive the same  title report prepared by  the same\r\n\nAruban   notary.    Glazer  further  testified  that  Rocha  \"got\r\n\nfundamentally the same  [assurances], or lack of  assurances,\" as\r\n\nBNS.   The  trial  judge  reasonably  credited  all  of  Glazer's\r\n\ntestimony.  Under these circumstances, the appellant's attempt to\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\ntransmogrify this  factual issue  into an  issue of  law fizzles.\r\n\nSee Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 577.\r                            \r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The  district court warrantably\r\n\nfound that Goodwin, Procter warned Rocha time and again about the\r\n\nrisks  inherent in completing  the transaction without  a survey,\r\n\nthat Rocha failed to heed those warnings, and that Rocha paid the\r\n\nprice for  his hubris,  both literally  and figuratively.   Since\r\n\nthose warnings  fully complied  with  the standard  of care  that\r\n\nMassachusetts law requires of practicing attorneys, we are not at\r\n\nliberty  to reverse  the  entry of  judgment  in the  defendants'\r\n\nfavor.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                19\r\r\n",

TROUBLE IN PARADISE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as the appellants profess not to contest the facts as found by the lower court, we lean heavily upon the opinion below in recounting the relevant events.  See id. at 28-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, plaintiffs-appellants Sierra Fria Corporation and Rodrigo Rocha (hereinafter collectively Rocha) acquired an option to purchase two Aruban resort hotels, the Divi Divi and the Divi Tamarijn, from Grape Holding N.V.  (Grape) for approximately $35,000,000.  Rocha engaged Goodwin, Procter as lead counsel, with overall responsibility for coordinating legal due diligence involved in the transaction.  The law firm assigned a partner, Michael Glazer, and an associate, Minta Kay, to work on the acquisition.  Both attorneys specialized in real estate law, but neither previously had handled an Aruban transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kay received a draft title memorandum based on Aruban land records from Ingrid Bleeker, an attorney affiliated with Smeets, Thesseling &amp; Von Borkhorst (a firm that one of Rocha's joint venturers had hired for its familiarity with Aruban and Dutch law).  Kay, who had hoped to obtain either title insurance or an as-built survey or both, expressed concern that the memorandum lacked solid title assurances.  Bleeker informed her that title insurance was unavailable in Aruba and that Aruban real estate transactions customarily proceeded without as-built surveys.  The prevailing practice, she said, was to requisition a title opinion from a local notary.  Bleeker also informed Kay that, if an as-built survey could be obtained at all, it would necessitate an extremely costly and time-consuming process.  Frank Zeven, a more senior member of the Smeets firm, spoke with Glazer and confirmed Bleeker's depiction of Aruban real estate practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these conversations, Glazer and Kay understood that if Rocha purchased the hotels according to Aruban custom, he risked not knowing exactly what assets he was acquiring.  Their concern heightened when they realized that a time-share complex (Dutch Village) adjoined the Divi Tamarijn Beach Resort and that no clearly visible dividing line separated the properties.  Thus, Kay spoke to Christopher DeChiario, Rocha's long-time aide.  She explained the hazards of proceeding without a survey, and DeChiario promised to discuss the matter with Rocha.  Glazer later spoke directly to Rocha about the risks attendant to the absence of a survey.  Rocha indicated that he was not particularly concerned.  Consequently, Goodwin, Procter did not commission a survey and Kay continued to work with Bleeker to determine precisely what assets were located on the hotels' properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bleeker eventually mailed several maps of the properties to Goodwin, Procter.  Kay informed DeChiario that the maps did not answer the boundary questions and again explained that, without a survey, Rocha lacked assurance that he was purchasing all the improvements.  DeChiario told Kay to press on with the transaction notwithstanding the absence of a survey, and to focus her efforts on securing a cross-use agreement with Dutch Village that would permit Divi Tamarijn guests to use Dutch Village's facilities, and vice-versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Glazer and Kay met with Rocha and DeChiario to iron out some wrinkles in the proposed cross-use agreement, they once again explained that, absent a survey, a purchaser could not know whether the envisioned property encompassed all of the hotels' facilities.  Rocha stated that he was not interested in obtaining a survey and that he was willing to consummate the seemingly lucrative transaction without one.  Kay then drafted a memorandum detailing her concerns and sent copies to Rocha and DeChiario.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a subsequent conference call with Rocha and other investors, Kay again voiced her worries about the location of various facilities.  Rocha grew impatient and made it clear that speed was his highest priority.  He expressed eagerness to take control of the hotels during the height of the 1991-1992 tourist season, and he indicated a willingness to rely on the cross-use agreement and the customary Aruban title assurances for protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodwin, Procter received a standard Aruban title opinion from Maria Eman, an Aruban notary, firmed up the cross-use agreement, and thereafter consummated the transaction on February 11, 1992.  The closing did not bring closure:  approximately one year later, Rocha learned that assets having an appraised value in excess of $4,000,000--tennis courts, parking spaces, and an administrative building housing the hotels' laundry facilities--lay on land belonging to Dutch Village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessfully attempting to gain title to the assets, Rocha invoked diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a) (1994), and brought suit against Goodwin, Procter.  In his complaint, Rocha accused the defendants of negligence and breach of a contractual obligation to perform legal services skillfully, prudently, and accurately.  Goodwin, Procter denied Rocha's charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Morris E. Lasker, District Judge, conducted a five-day bench trial.  The judge then authored an opinion in which he identified the controlling issue as whether Goodwin, Procter \"informed Rocha of th[e] risk [of proceeding without a survey] with sufficient emphasis and particularity to make certain that his decision on whether to consummate the purchase was intelligent and knowing.\"  Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 30.  He resolved this issue in the defendants' favor, basing his decision primarily on an assessment of the relative credibility of Glazer, Kay, and Rocha.  In particular, Judge Lasker credited the attorneys' testimony that they repeatedly had warned Rocha about the dangers attendant to purchasing the hotels without a survey and found incredible Rocha's denial that they had uttered such warnings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See id. at 34-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodwin, Procter is a Boston-based firm, retained in Massachusetts.  Although the firm devoted its labors to property located abroad, neither party disputes that Massachusetts law supplies the substantive rule of decision.  We therefore survey Massachusetts legal malpractice law to determine whether Goodwin, Procter's conduct falls safely within its boundaries.  See Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370, 375 (1st Cir.1991);  Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 n. 2 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, Massachusetts law requires a client in a legal malpractice case to show that the attorney had a duty to the client, that he breached the duty, and that his breach proximately caused the plaintiff's harm.  See Fishman v. Brooks, 396 Mass. 643, 487 N.E.2d 1377, 1379-80 (1986).  The first element is indigenous to the attorney-client relationship;  in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, an attorney owes his or her client a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care and skill in the performance of legal tasks.  See Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 218 (1st Cir.1987);  Pongonis v. Saab, 396 Mass. 1005, 486 N.E.2d 28, 29 (1985).  The second element is of critical importance here.  Under it, the plaintiff \"must demonstrate that the attorney failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in handling the matter for which the attorney was retained.\"  Colucci v. Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, 25 Mass.App.Ct. 107, 515 N.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).  The third element is standard fare in tort actions and requires no discussion in connection with Rocha's central theory of liability;  if, on these facts, closing without a survey constituted malpractice, then the harm to Rocha is manifest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, generalized concepts of duty and breach must be adapted to fit particular contexts.  Thus, when a client seeks advice from an attorney, the attorney owes the client \"a duty of full and fair disclosure of facts material to the client's interests.\"  Williams v. Ely, 423 Mass. 467, 668 N.E.2d 799, 806 (1996).  This means that the attorney must advise the client of any significant legal risks involved in a contemplated transaction, and must do so in terms sufficiently plain to permit the client to assess both the risks and their potential impact on his situation.  Consequently, in a legal malpractice action that implicates an attorney's performance of his counseling function, the trier of fact must determine whether the attorney's advice permitted the client adequately to weigh the risks involved in a given course of action.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rocha presents a multifaceted asseverational array, his appeal boils down to two interlocking claims of error.  We examine them sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant posits that the district court's opinion violates Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and thereby precludes effective appellate review.  This proposition is unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms, Rule 52(a) dictates that, in a bench trial, the court \"shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law.\"   This directive \"impose[s] on the trial court an obligation to ensure that its ratio decidendi is set forth with enough clarity to enable a reviewing court reliably to perform its function.\"  Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc., 43 F.3d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1995).  But this imperative has a practical, commonsense cast.  Rule 52(a) requires trial judges neither to pen exhaustive dissertations nor to make findings and conclusions that are exquisitely precise.  As long as the trial court clearly relates the findings of fact upon which its decision rests and articulates in a readily intelligible manner the conclusions that it draws by applying the controlling law to the facts as found, no more is exigible.  See Peckham v. Continental Cas. Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 842 (1st Cir.1990).  Judge Lasker's twenty-eight page opinion clears this hurdle with room to spare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.  The judge's rescript recapitulates the trial testimony of the key witnesses, limns a series of credibility calls, delineates reasons for crediting the testimony of some witnesses and discounting that of others, and traces the inferences that flow from the credited testimony.  The judge's thorough exposition of his factual findings stands in marked contrast to the unsupported generalizations that have triggered Rule 52(a) concerns in the cases upon which Rocha relies.  See, e.g., Touch, 43 F.3d at 758-59;  Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163, 166 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rocha tries to minimize the district court's thoroughness.  Regardless of the battery of factual findings, he says, the judge made only a single conclusion of law and, thus, did not comply with Rule 52(a).  This is little more than whistling past the graveyard.  Rule 52(a) announces a qualitative, not a quantitative, standard--and here, Goodwin, Procter either was or was not guilty of negligence in its representation of Rocha.  Since the judge made the solitary legal conclusion necessary for resolution of the action, our inquiry focuses on the clarity of that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Lasker framed the applicable legal standard in terms of whether the law firm informed its client of the risks of proceeding without a survey \"with sufficient emphasis and particularity to make certain that his decision on whether to consummate the purchase was intelligent and knowing.\"  Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 30.  This formulation is entirely consistent with Massachusetts law.  See supra Part II.  The judge then applied the standard to the discerned facts.  See Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 35.   In so doing, he provided a clearly marked roadmap that shows how he reached a decision in this case.  The jurisprudence of Rule 52(a) does not require more exegetic treatment.  See, e.g., Fasolino Foods Co. v. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, 961 F.2d 1052, 1058 (2d Cir.1992);  Westside Property Owners v. Schlesinger, 597 F.2d 1214, 1216 n. 3 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Rocha (who is represented by fresh counsel on appeal) mounts a direct challenge to the lower court's decision on the merits.  His new lawyer says that he is contesting only the court's legal conclusion, not its factfinding.  Therefore, he argues, we must undertake de novo review of the decision. Goodwin, Procter not only defends Judge Lasker's decision, but also disparages Rocha's attempt to import a de novo standard of review into the case.  We address this standard-of-review imbroglio before turning to the various facets of Rocha's main claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have made it pellucid that \"appeals in the federal court system are usually arrayed along a degree-of-deference continuum, stretching from plenary review at one pole to highly deferential modes of review ... at the opposite pole.\"  In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327 (1st Cir.1993).  In the ordinary case, this paradigm requires the court of appeals to scrutinize the trial court's answers to purely legal questions de novo and to assess the trial court's answers to straight factual questions for clear error.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, a middle ground which consists of the trial court's answers to mixed questions of law and fact--and that middle ground is not amenable to a single standard-of-review rubric.  Rather, the applicable standard of review varies depending upon the nature of the mixed question;  the more fact-dominated it is, the more likely that deferential, clear-error review will obtain, and the more law-dominated it is, the more likely that non-deferential, de novo review will obtain.  See id. at 1328.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting the issue that Rocha seeks to raise in its proper place along the law/fact continuum ends the instant standard-of-review controversy.  Though Rocha casts his argument artfully, it is perfectly plain that determining whether Goodwin, Procter exercised due care in representing Rocha is a fact-intensive exercise, see Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888 F.2d 189, 193 (1st Cir.1989), and the district court, sitting without a jury, appropriately treated it as such.  The proof of the pudding is precedential;  we consistently have reviewed adjudications of negligence arising in the course of bench trials by reference to the clearly erroneous test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., La Esperanza De P.R., Inc. v. Perez Y Cia.  De P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.1997);  Clement v. United States, 980 F.2d 48, 53 (1st Cir.1992);  Deguio v. United States, 920 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir.1990);  Obolensky v. Saldana Schmier, 409 F.2d 52, 54 (1st Cir.1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this format, we may reverse the district judge's conclusion that Goodwin, Procter did not act negligently only if, \"after careful evaluation of the evidence, we are left with an abiding conviction that those determinations and findings are simply wrong.\"  State Police Ass'n v. Commissioner, 125 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1997);  accord Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).  Moreover, to the extent that Rocha seeks to evade the application of this standard by the heavy-handed expedient of creative labelling, he is painting with an empty palette.  See Reliance Steel Prods.  Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 577 (1st Cir.1989) (declaring that this court \"will not permit parties to profit by dressing factual disputes in 'legal' costumery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits need not detain us.  Here, the district judge accepted the facts surrounding the transaction very much as stated by Glazer and Kay, rejecting Rocha's contrary account.  We do not find the judge's decision to disbelieve Rocha's testimony clearly erroneous.  Ample evidence controverted Rocha's protest that he was unaware of the dangers inherent in closing without a survey, including the lawyers' testimony and various documentary evidence (notes, memos, and letters).  Credibility determinations fall squarely within the trier's preserve, see, e.g., Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.1991), and for good reason:  where a judge presides at a bench trial, observes the witnesses' demeanor, and hears their words as they are uttered, he is far better equipped to gauge their veracity (or lack of veracity) than is an appellate panel consigned to sift a paper record after the fact.  Hence, we decline the appellant's implicit invitation to disturb the judge's credibility-based findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This determination does not end our work.  We still must evaluate the judge's conclusion, based on his acceptance of the attorneys' testimony, that Goodwin, Procter was not negligent.  Having performed this evaluation, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The losing party always faces an arduous climb when he attempts to impugn a factbound finding (such as a finding of no negligence) that results from a bench trial.  Here, however, Rocha's difficulties are twice compounded.  For one thing, the ascent becomes steeper when the loser bears the burden of proof on the issue.  For another thing, the grade increases still more when the trier rests the challenged finding on a credibility judgment.  Recognizing the inhospitable nature of the terrain, Rocha argues that, even accepting Glazer's and Kay's narrative of what transpired, Goodwin, Procter's unfocused advice--particularly the firm's inadequate explanation of the cost and time requirements of an Aruban survey and its failure to suggest a post-closing arrangement as an alternative protective mechanism--did not allow Rocha to weigh his options realistically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assembling this argument, Rocha overstates the relevant standard of care.  Massachusetts law requires an attorney performing a counseling function to advise the client in a manner that permits the latter intelligently to assess the risks of taking (or declining to take) a particular action.  But lawyers--even high-priced lawyers--ordinarily are not guarantors of favorable results.  It is neither fair, practical, nor legally appropriate to benchmark an attorney against a standard of prescience.  Thus, lawyers are not obliged to relate in exquisite detail every fact or circumstance that might conceivably have a bearing on the client's business decision or to anticipate remote risks.  See Williams, 668 N.E.2d at 806.   By the same token, lawyers are not expected to persist relentlessly when clients--especially clients who are sophisticated businessmen--choose to go forward after being suitably informed of looming risks.  See Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, 145 N.J. 395, 678 A.2d 1060, 1069 (1996) (stating that \"an attorney has no obligation 'to lie down in front of a speeding train' to prevent a bad deal\");  Horn v. Moberg, 68 Wash.App. 551, 844 P.2d 452, 455 (1993) (similar);  Gill v. DiFatta, 364 So.2d 1352, 1354-56 (La.Ct.App.1978) (similar);  see generally Ronald E. Mallen &amp; Jeffrey M. Smith, 2 Legal Malpractice &#167; 20.2 (4th ed.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, expert testimony almost always is required to establish the standard of care in a legal malpractice action.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 218-19;  Pongonis, 486 N.E.2d at 29.   This case falls comfortably within the sweep of that abecedarian rule.  And given the facts as found, the expert testimony adduced at trial does not support the claim of negligence, but, rather, confirms that Goodwin, Procter adhered to the applicable standard of care when it advised Rocha of the risks inherent in proceeding without a survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties each offered one expert witness who dealt substantively with the standard of care applicable to attorneys practicing in Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Rocha's expert, Stoddard Platt, testified that Goodwin, Procter had two viable options when addressing the survey problem:  to locate and commission Dutch-speaking surveyors to fly to Aruba and map the properties, or to warn Rocha about the perils of closing without a survey and permit him to make an informed decision about whether to proceed.  For the purpose of his testimony, Platt assumed that Goodwin, Procter never warned Rocha about these hazards and thereby transgressed the standard of care.  Goodwin, Procter's expert, Phillip Nexon, started from a different premise.  He assumed the truth of Glazer's and Kay's testimony that they repeatedly cautioned Rocha and concluded that these warnings satisfied the standard of care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the judge resolved the assumptions underlying each expert's testimony in Goodwin, Procter's favor, any substantive dissonance vanished.  Rocha's expert admitted as much when he acknowledged that if \"the client was brought in, ... the issues were discussed with the client and the client decided to proceed without a survey,\" then Goodwin, Procter fulfilled its obligations to Rocha.  That, of course, is precisely what happened here--or so the trier supportably found.  In light of this testimonial harmony, we have no warrant to set aside, under principles of clear-error review, the district court's conclusion that Goodwin, Procter did not negligently advise Rocha.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rocha attempts to blunt the force of this reasoning by insisting that Goodwin, Procter negligently failed to explore the possibility of offsetting the absence of a survey by constructing some type of post-closing arrangement.  This argument founders on evidentiary shoals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Platt--Rocha's expert--testified that he had never consummated a real estate transaction that included a post-closing survey component.  This jibed with the testimony of Nexon--Goodwin, Procter's expert--who classified post-closing surveys as \"not customary.\"   Further, Rocha adduced no evidence that another type of post-closing arrangement could have remedied the boundary problems, much less that customary Massachusetts practice suggested some such arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, the record contains no expert testimony that the Massachusetts standard of care required Goodwin, Procter to recommend any post-closing arrangement to Rocha.  We reiterate that Rocha's expert testified that the lawyers could conform to the standard of care either by commissioning a survey or by warning Rocha of the risks of proceeding without one.  To avoid this evidentiary obstacle, Rocha appears to argue that even after he made an informed decision to proceed without a survey, Goodwin, Procter had some residual duty to suggest a prophylactic post-closing arrangement.  Yet, Rocha points to no expert testimony that supports this formulation of the standard of care.  While \"expert testimony is not essential where the claimed legal malpractice is so gross or obvious that laymen can rely on their common knowledge to recognize or infer negligence,\" Pongonis, 486 N.E.2d at 29, this narrow exception to the expert testimony requirement does not encompass Rocha's sophisticated theory of negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly.  Given the evidence of record, it is readily apparent that the district court's conclusion is not poisoned by Goodwin, Procter's failure to suggest a post-closing arrangement as an antidote to the absence of a survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rocha's last asseveration is a variation on these themes.  He maintains that he agreed to proceed without a survey only on the condition that he receive the same title assurances as the prospective first mortgagee, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS).  To the extent that Rocha couches this contention in terms of an implied contract, he failed to raise it below and therefore cannot raise it for the first time on appeal.  See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1423, 134 L.Ed.2d 547 (1996);  Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 987 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 515, 133 L.Ed.2d 423 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Rocha had not waived this contention, it would fail on the merits.  Glazer testified that when he told Rocha that he would receive the same assurances as BNS, he meant that Rocha would receive the same title report prepared by the same Aruban notary.  Glazer further testified that Rocha \"got fundamentally the same [assurances], or lack of assurances,\" as BNS. The trial judge reasonably credited all of Glazer's testimony.  Under these circumstances, the appellant's attempt to transmogrify this factual issue into an issue of law fizzles.  See Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The district court warrantably found that Goodwin, Procter warned Rocha time and again about the risks inherent in completing the transaction without a survey, that Rocha failed to heed those warnings, and that Rocha paid the price for his hubris, both literally and figuratively.  Since those warnings fully complied with the standard of care that Massachusetts law requires of practicing attorneys, we are not at liberty to reverse the entry of judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court also ruled against Rocha on a variety of other claims.  See Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 37-38, 39.   None of those rulings has been appealed and, therefore, we take no view of them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This does not mean that clear-error review applies up and down the line.  For example, a judge's determination whether a plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to create a question of fact on the issue of negligence is itself a question of law, subject to de novo review.

TROUBLE IN PARADISE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as the appellants profess not to contest the facts as found by the lower court, we lean heavily upon the opinion below in recounting the relevant events.  See id. at 28-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, plaintiffs-appellants Sierra Fria Corporation and Rodrigo Rocha (hereinafter collectively Rocha) acquired an option to purchase two Aruban resort hotels, the Divi Divi and the Divi Tamarijn, from Grape Holding N.V.  (Grape) for approximately $35,000,000.  Rocha engaged Goodwin, Procter as lead counsel, with overall responsibility for coordinating legal due diligence involved in the transaction.  The law firm assigned a partner, Michael Glazer, and an associate, Minta Kay, to work on the acquisition.  Both attorneys specialized in real estate law, but neither previously had handled an Aruban transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kay received a draft title memorandum based on Aruban land records from Ingrid Bleeker, an attorney affiliated with Smeets, Thesseling &amp; Von Borkhorst (a firm that one of Rocha's joint venturers had hired for its familiarity with Aruban and Dutch law).  Kay, who had hoped to obtain either title insurance or an as-built survey or both, expressed concern that the memorandum lacked solid title assurances.  Bleeker informed her that title insurance was unavailable in Aruba and that Aruban real estate transactions customarily proceeded without as-built surveys.  The prevailing practice, she said, was to requisition a title opinion from a local notary.  Bleeker also informed Kay that, if an as-built survey could be obtained at all, it would necessitate an extremely costly and time-consuming process.  Frank Zeven, a more senior member of the Smeets firm, spoke with Glazer and confirmed Bleeker's depiction of Aruban real estate practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these conversations, Glazer and Kay understood that if Rocha purchased the hotels according to Aruban custom, he risked not knowing exactly what assets he was acquiring.  Their concern heightened when they realized that a time-share complex (Dutch Village) adjoined the Divi Tamarijn Beach Resort and that no clearly visible dividing line separated the properties.  Thus, Kay spoke to Christopher DeChiario, Rocha's long-time aide.  She explained the hazards of proceeding without a survey, and DeChiario promised to discuss the matter with Rocha.  Glazer later spoke directly to Rocha about the risks attendant to the absence of a survey.  Rocha indicated that he was not particularly concerned.  Consequently, Goodwin, Procter did not commission a survey and Kay continued to work with Bleeker to determine precisely what assets were located on the hotels' properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bleeker eventually mailed several maps of the properties to Goodwin, Procter.  Kay informed DeChiario that the maps did not answer the boundary questions and again explained that, without a survey, Rocha lacked assurance that he was purchasing all the improvements.  DeChiario told Kay to press on with the transaction notwithstanding the absence of a survey, and to focus her efforts on securing a cross-use agreement with Dutch Village that would permit Divi Tamarijn guests to use Dutch Village's facilities, and vice-versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Glazer and Kay met with Rocha and DeChiario to iron out some wrinkles in the proposed cross-use agreement, they once again explained that, absent a survey, a purchaser could not know whether the envisioned property encompassed all of the hotels' facilities.  Rocha stated that he was not interested in obtaining a survey and that he was willing to consummate the seemingly lucrative transaction without one.  Kay then drafted a memorandum detailing her concerns and sent copies to Rocha and DeChiario.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a subsequent conference call with Rocha and other investors, Kay again voiced her worries about the location of various facilities.  Rocha grew impatient and made it clear that speed was his highest priority.  He expressed eagerness to take control of the hotels during the height of the 1991-1992 tourist season, and he indicated a willingness to rely on the cross-use agreement and the customary Aruban title assurances for protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodwin, Procter received a standard Aruban title opinion from Maria Eman, an Aruban notary, firmed up the cross-use agreement, and thereafter consummated the transaction on February 11, 1992.  The closing did not bring closure:  approximately one year later, Rocha learned that assets having an appraised value in excess of $4,000,000--tennis courts, parking spaces, and an administrative building housing the hotels' laundry facilities--lay on land belonging to Dutch Village.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessfully attempting to gain title to the assets, Rocha invoked diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a) (1994), and brought suit against Goodwin, Procter.  In his complaint, Rocha accused the defendants of negligence and breach of a contractual obligation to perform legal services skillfully, prudently, and accurately.  Goodwin, Procter denied Rocha's charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Morris E. Lasker, District Judge, conducted a five-day bench trial.  The judge then authored an opinion in which he identified the controlling issue as whether Goodwin, Procter \"informed Rocha of th[e] risk [of proceeding without a survey] with sufficient emphasis and particularity to make certain that his decision on whether to consummate the purchase was intelligent and knowing.\"  Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 30.  He resolved this issue in the defendants' favor, basing his decision primarily on an assessment of the relative credibility of Glazer, Kay, and Rocha.  In particular, Judge Lasker credited the attorneys' testimony that they repeatedly had warned Rocha about the dangers attendant to purchasing the hotels without a survey and found incredible Rocha's denial that they had uttered such warnings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See id. at 34-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodwin, Procter is a Boston-based firm, retained in Massachusetts.  Although the firm devoted its labors to property located abroad, neither party disputes that Massachusetts law supplies the substantive rule of decision.  We therefore survey Massachusetts legal malpractice law to determine whether Goodwin, Procter's conduct falls safely within its boundaries.  See Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562609\"><a href=\"/opinion/562609/ronald-borden-v-the-paul-revere-life-insurance-company-ronald-borden-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 375 (1st Cir.1991);  Moores v. Greenberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498384\"><a href=\"/opinion/498384/ralph-w-moores-jr-v-nathan-greenberg-ralph-w-moores-jr-v-nathan/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span>, 1107 n. 2 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, Massachusetts law requires a client in a legal malpractice case to show that the attorney had a duty to the client, that he breached the duty, and that his breach proximately caused the plaintiff's harm.  See Fishman v. Brooks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017465\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017465/fishman-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2017465\"><a href=\"/opinion/2017465/fishman-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1377</span></a></span>, 1379-80 (1986).  The first element is indigenous to the attorney-client relationship;  in Massachusetts, as elsewhere, an attorney owes his or her client a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care and skill in the performance of legal tasks.  See Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.1987);  Pongonis v. Saab, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span>, 29 (1985).  The second element is of critical importance here.  Under it, the plaintiff \"must demonstrate that the attorney failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in handling the matter for which the attorney was retained.\"  Colucci v. Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, 25 Mass.App.Ct. 107, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985538\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985538/colucci-v-rosen-goldberg-slavet-levenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span>, 894 (1987).  The third element is standard fare in tort actions and requires no discussion in connection with Rocha's central theory of liability;  if, on these facts, closing without a survey constituted malpractice, then the harm to Rocha is manifest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, generalized concepts of duty and breach must be adapted to fit particular contexts.  Thus, when a client seeks advice from an attorney, the attorney owes the client \"a duty of full and fair disclosure of facts material to the client's interests.\"  Williams v. Ely, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></span>, 806 (1996).  This means that the attorney must advise the client of any significant legal risks involved in a contemplated transaction, and must do so in terms sufficiently plain to permit the client to assess both the risks and their potential impact on his situation.  Consequently, in a legal malpractice action that implicates an attorney's performance of his counseling function, the trier of fact must determine whether the attorney's advice permitted the client adequately to weigh the risks involved in a given course of action.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rocha presents a multifaceted asseverational array, his appeal boils down to two interlocking claims of error.  We examine them sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant posits that the district court's opinion violates Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and thereby precludes effective appellate review.  This proposition is unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms, Rule 52(a) dictates that, in a bench trial, the court \"shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law.\"   This directive \"impose[s] on the trial court an obligation to ensure that its ratio decidendi is set forth with enough clarity to enable a reviewing court reliably to perform its function.\"  Touch v. Master Unit Die Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195825\"><a href=\"/opinion/195825/touch-v-master-unit-die/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1995).  But this imperative has a practical, commonsense cast.  Rule 52(a) requires trial judges neither to pen exhaustive dissertations nor to make findings and conclusions that are exquisitely precise.  As long as the trial court clearly relates the findings of fact upon which its decision rests and articulates in a readily intelligible manner the conclusions that it draws by applying the controlling law to the facts as found, no more is exigible.  See Peckham v. Continental Cas. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536169\"><a href=\"/opinion/536169/scott-peckham-v-continental-casualty-insurance-co-scott-peckham-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span>, 842 (1st Cir.1990).  Judge Lasker's twenty-eight page opinion clears this hurdle with room to spare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.  The judge's rescript recapitulates the trial testimony of the key witnesses, limns a series of credibility calls, delineates reasons for crediting the testimony of some witnesses and discounting that of others, and traces the inferences that flow from the credited testimony.  The judge's thorough exposition of his factual findings stands in marked contrast to the unsupported generalizations that have triggered Rule 52(a) concerns in the cases upon which Rocha relies.  See, e.g., Touch, 43 F.3d at 758-59;  Pearson v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480983\"><a href=\"/opinion/480983/donald-pearson-v-michael-fair-donald-pearson-v-michael-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 166 (1st Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rocha tries to minimize the district court's thoroughness.  Regardless of the battery of factual findings, he says, the judge made only a single conclusion of law and, thus, did not comply with Rule 52(a).  This is little more than whistling past the graveyard.  Rule 52(a) announces a qualitative, not a quantitative, standard--and here, Goodwin, Procter either was or was not guilty of negligence in its representation of Rocha.  Since the judge made the solitary legal conclusion necessary for resolution of the action, our inquiry focuses on the clarity of that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Lasker framed the applicable legal standard in terms of whether the law firm informed its client of the risks of proceeding without a survey \"with sufficient emphasis and particularity to make certain that his decision on whether to consummate the purchase was intelligent and knowing.\"  Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 30.  This formulation is entirely consistent with Massachusetts law.  See supra Part II.  The judge then applied the standard to the discerned facts.  See Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 35.   In so doing, he provided a clearly marked roadmap that shows how he reached a decision in this case.  The jurisprudence of Rule 52(a) does not require more exegetic treatment.  See, e.g., Fasolino Foods Co. v. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581524\"><a href=\"/opinion/581524/fasolino-foods-co-inc-v-banca-nazionale-del-lavoro-banca-nazionale-del/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1052</span></a></span>, 1058 (2d Cir.1992);  Westside Property Owners v. Schlesinger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365924\"><a href=\"/opinion/365924/westside-property-owners-an-unincorporated-association-consisting-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1214</span></a></span>, 1216 n. 3 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Rocha (who is represented by fresh counsel on appeal) mounts a direct challenge to the lower court's decision on the merits.  His new lawyer says that he is contesting only the court's legal conclusion, not its factfinding.  Therefore, he argues, we must undertake de novo review of the decision. Goodwin, Procter not only defends Judge Lasker's decision, but also disparages Rocha's attempt to import a de novo standard of review into the case.  We address this standard-of-review imbroglio before turning to the various facets of Rocha's main claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have made it pellucid that \"appeals in the federal court system are usually arrayed along a degree-of-deference continuum, stretching from plenary review at one pole to highly deferential modes of review ... at the opposite pole.\"  In re Extradition of Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1327 (1st Cir.1993).  In the ordinary case, this paradigm requires the court of appeals to scrutinize the trial court's answers to purely legal questions de novo and to assess the trial court's answers to straight factual questions for clear error.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, a middle ground which consists of the trial court's answers to mixed questions of law and fact--and that middle ground is not amenable to a single standard-of-review rubric.  Rather, the applicable standard of review varies depending upon the nature of the mixed question;  the more fact-dominated it is, the more likely that deferential, clear-error review will obtain, and the more law-dominated it is, the more likely that non-deferential, de novo review will obtain.  See id. at 1328.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting the issue that Rocha seeks to raise in its proper place along the law/fact continuum ends the instant standard-of-review controversy.  Though Rocha casts his argument artfully, it is perfectly plain that determining whether Goodwin, Procter exercised due care in representing Rocha is a fact-intensive exercise, see Brennan v. Hendrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531204\"><a href=\"/opinion/531204/robert-brennan-v-roderick-hendrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, 193 (1st Cir.1989), and the district court, sitting without a jury, appropriately treated it as such.  The proof of the pudding is precedential;  we consistently have reviewed adjudications of negligence arising in the course of bench trials by reference to the clearly erroneous test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., La Esperanza De P.R., Inc. v.

Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746421\"><a href=\"/opinion/746421/state-police-association-of-massachusetts-v-commissioner-of-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1997);  accord Cumpiano v.

Moreover, to the extent that Rocha seeks to evade the application of this standard by the heavy-handed expedient of creative labelling, he is painting with an empty palette.  See Reliance Steel Prods.  Co. v. National Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526735\"><a href=\"/opinion/526735/reliance-steel-products-company-v-national-fire-insurance-company-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 577 (1st Cir.1989) (declaring that this court \"will not permit parties to profit by dressing factual disputes in 'legal' costumery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits need not detain us.  Here, the district judge accepted the facts surrounding the transaction very much as stated by Glazer and Kay, rejecting Rocha's contrary account.  We do not find the judge's decision to disbelieve Rocha's testimony clearly erroneous.  Ample evidence controverted Rocha's protest that he was unaware of the dangers inherent in closing without a survey, including the lawyers' testimony and various documentary evidence (notes, memos, and letters).  Credibility determinations fall squarely within the trier's preserve, see, e.g., Anthony v. Sundlun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574884\"><a href=\"/opinion/574884/jane-anthony-v-bruce-g-sundlun/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1991), and for good reason:  where a judge presides at a bench trial, observes the witnesses' demeanor, and hears their words as they are uttered, he is far better equipped to gauge their veracity (or lack of veracity) than is an appellate panel consigned to sift a paper record after the fact.  Hence, we decline the appellant's implicit invitation to disturb the judge's credibility-based findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This determination does not end our work.  We still must evaluate the judge's conclusion, based on his acceptance of the attorneys' testimony, that Goodwin, Procter was not negligent.  Having performed this evaluation, we find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The losing party always faces an arduous climb when he attempts to impugn a factbound finding (such as a finding of no negligence) that results from a bench trial.  Here, however, Rocha's difficulties are twice compounded.  For one thing, the ascent becomes steeper when the loser bears the burden of proof on the issue.  For another thing, the grade increases still more when the trier rests the challenged finding on a credibility judgment.  Recognizing the inhospitable nature of the terrain, Rocha argues that, even accepting Glazer's and Kay's narrative of what transpired, Goodwin, Procter's unfocused advice--particularly the firm's inadequate explanation of the cost and time requirements of an Aruban survey and its failure to suggest a post-closing arrangement as an alternative protective mechanism--did not allow Rocha to weigh his options realistically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assembling this argument, Rocha overstates the relevant standard of care.  Massachusetts law requires an attorney performing a counseling function to advise the client in a manner that permits the latter intelligently to assess the risks of taking (or declining to take) a particular action.  But lawyers--even high-priced lawyers--ordinarily are not guarantors of favorable results.  It is neither fair, practical, nor legally appropriate to benchmark an attorney against a standard of prescience.  Thus, lawyers are not obliged to relate in exquisite detail every fact or circumstance that might conceivably have a bearing on the client's business decision or to anticipate remote risks.  See Williams, 668 N.E.2d at 806.   By the same token, lawyers are not expected to persist relentlessly when clients--especially clients who are sophisticated businessmen--choose to go forward after being suitably informed of looming risks.  See Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1927630\"><a href=\"/opinion/1927630/conklin-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1927630\"><a href=\"/opinion/1927630/conklin-v-weisman/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>, 1069 (1996) (stating that \"an attorney has no obligation 'to lie down in front of a speeding train' to prevent a bad deal\");  Horn v.

Mallen &amp; Jeffrey M. Smith, 2 Legal Malpractice &#167; 20.2 (4th ed.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, expert testimony almost always is required to establish the standard of care in a legal malpractice action.  See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 218-19;  Pongonis, 486 N.E.2d at 29.   This case falls comfortably within the sweep of that abecedarian rule.  And given the facts as found, the expert testimony adduced at trial does not support the claim of negligence, but, rather, confirms that Goodwin, Procter adhered to the applicable standard of care when it advised Rocha of the risks inherent in proceeding without a survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties each offered one expert witness who dealt substantively with the standard of care applicable to attorneys practicing in Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Rocha's expert, Stoddard Platt, testified that Goodwin, Procter had two viable options when addressing the survey problem:  to locate and commission Dutch-speaking surveyors to fly to Aruba and map the properties, or to warn Rocha about the perils of closing without a survey and permit him to make an informed decision about whether to proceed.  For the purpose of his testimony, Platt assumed that Goodwin, Procter never warned Rocha about these hazards and thereby transgressed the standard of care.  Goodwin, Procter's expert, Phillip Nexon, started from a different premise.  He assumed the truth of Glazer's and Kay's testimony that they repeatedly cautioned Rocha and concluded that these warnings satisfied the standard of care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the judge resolved the assumptions underlying each expert's testimony in Goodwin, Procter's favor, any substantive dissonance vanished.  Rocha's expert admitted as much when he acknowledged that if \"the client was brought in, ... the issues were discussed with the client and the client decided to proceed without a survey,\" then Goodwin, Procter fulfilled its obligations to Rocha.  That, of course, is precisely what happened here--or so the trier supportably found.  In light of this testimonial harmony, we have no warrant to set aside, under principles of clear-error review, the district court's conclusion that Goodwin, Procter did not negligently advise Rocha.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rocha attempts to blunt the force of this reasoning by insisting that Goodwin, Procter negligently failed to explore the possibility of offsetting the absence of a survey by constructing some type of post-closing arrangement.  This argument founders on evidentiary shoals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Platt--Rocha's expert--testified that he had never consummated a real estate transaction that included a post-closing survey component.  This jibed with the testimony of Nexon--Goodwin, Procter's expert--who classified post-closing surveys as \"not customary.\"   Further, Rocha adduced no evidence that another type of post-closing arrangement could have remedied the boundary problems, much less that customary Massachusetts practice suggested some such arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, the record contains no expert testimony that the Massachusetts standard of care required Goodwin, Procter to recommend any post-closing arrangement to Rocha.  We reiterate that Rocha's expert testified that the lawyers could conform to the standard of care either by commissioning a survey or by warning Rocha of the risks of proceeding without one.  To avoid this evidentiary obstacle, Rocha appears to argue that even after he made an informed decision to proceed without a survey, Goodwin, Procter had some residual duty to suggest a prophylactic post-closing arrangement.  Yet, Rocha points to no expert testimony that supports this formulation of the standard of care.  While \"expert testimony is not essential where the claimed legal malpractice is so gross or obvious that laymen can rely on their common knowledge to recognize or infer negligence,\" Pongonis, 486 N.E.2d at 29, this narrow exception to the expert testimony requirement does not encompass Rocha's sophisticated theory of negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly.  Given the evidence of record, it is readily apparent that the district court's conclusion is not poisoned by Goodwin, Procter's failure to suggest a post-closing arrangement as an antidote to the absence of a survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rocha's last asseveration is a variation on these themes.  He maintains that he agreed to proceed without a survey only on the condition that he receive the same title assurances as the prospective first mortgagee, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS).  To the extent that Rocha couches this contention in terms of an implied contract, he failed to raise it below and therefore cannot raise it for the first time on appeal.  See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Glazer testified that when he told Rocha that he would receive the same assurances as BNS, he meant that Rocha would receive the same title report prepared by the same Aruban notary.  Glazer further testified that Rocha \"got fundamentally the same [assurances], or lack of assurances,\" as BNS. The trial judge reasonably credited all of Glazer's testimony.  Under these circumstances, the appellant's attempt to transmogrify this factual issue into an issue of law fizzles.  See Reliance Steel, 880 F.2d at 577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The district court warrantably found that Goodwin, Procter warned Rocha time and again about the risks inherent in completing the transaction without a survey, that Rocha failed to heed those warnings, and that Rocha paid the price for his hubris, both literally and figuratively.  Since those warnings fully complied with the standard of care that Massachusetts law requires of practicing attorneys, we are not at liberty to reverse the entry of judgment in the defendants' favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court also ruled against Rocha on a variety of other claims.  See Sierra Fria, 978 F.Supp. at 37-38, 39.   None of those rulings has been appealed and, therefore, we take no view of them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This does not mean that clear-error review applies up and down the line.  For example, a judge's determination whether a plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to create a question of fact on the issue of negligence is itself a question of law, subject to de novo review.
