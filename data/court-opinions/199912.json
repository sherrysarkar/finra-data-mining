The district court dismissed\n\nappellants’ case after concluding that they and their counsel\n\nflouted a court order and then misled the court in attempting to\n\njustify their disobedience.           Appellants claim that their actions\n\nwere not so unreasonable as to justify dismissal of the case.                We\n\nreject their contention and hold that the dismissal was not an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n     On September 29, 1999, appellants Top Entertainment Inc.,\n\nAngelo    Medina     d/b/a     Producciones      Angelo    Medina,   and   Star\n\nEntertainment, Inc. filed a three-page complaint against Maria\n\nOrtega, d/b/a Servitel.           The complaint cursorily alleged that\n\nOrtega falsely purported to be appellants’ promoter for a series of\n\nRicky Martin concerts in Peru and Colombia.                Later in the case,\n\nwhen the district court ordered appellants to more fully explain\n\nthe allegations, they made an about-face.                 Appellants now claim\n\nthat the parties entered into an agreement that Ortega later\n\nbreached by failing to promote the concerts within its terms.\n\n     On   May   24,   2000,     the   district    court    filed   its   Initial\n\nScheduling Conference Call, setting out the details for pre-trial\n\nproceedings.    On    August    8,    the    parties   attended    the   initial\n\nscheduling conference.          The district court entered an order on\n\nAugust 30, reflecting the issues discussed during that meeting.\n\nBased on the vagueness of the complaint, the August 30 Order\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\frequired appellants to, inter alia, \"submit an informative motion\n\non or before August 31, 2000 detailing the terms of the contractual\n\nrelationship     between    the     parties      hereto       and   how    those    were\n\nbreached.\" The Civil Notice Log Report (the official record of all\n\norders sent by the docket clerk) reflected that appellants’ counsel\n\nreceived the order by facsimile transmission at 1:30 p.m. on August\n\n31, 2000.\n\n      Appellants failed to respond to the order and never sought an\n\nextension of time to respond.               On November 8, 2000, the court\n\nopined that appellants’ failure to answer was \"both perplexing and\n\ndisturbing\" and issued another order instructing plaintiffs to show\n\ncause on or before November 15 as to why the case should not be\n\ndismissed for failure to comply with the earlier order.                               On\n\nNovember 14, appellants responded, claiming that they did not\n\ncomply because (1) counsel received the order in September, after\n\nthe   August   31    deadline;      and    (2)    counsel      could      not   contact\n\nappellants to flesh out the factual allegations because they were\n\non an extended world tour.            The November 14 response contained\n\napproximately       one   and   a   half        pages    of    additional       factual\n\nallegations.\n\n      On May 3, 2001, the district court dismissed the action based\n\non appellants’ failure to respond timely to the August 30 order.\n\nThe   district      court   concluded       that        appellants’       failure    was\n\nespecially     prejudicial        because        the     absence     of     meaningful\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fallegations    in   the   complaint    precluded     both   appellee    from\n\nadequately    defending   herself     and   the   court   from   effectively\n\nmanaging its docket.      This timely appeal followed.\n\n                             II.    Discussion\n\nA.   The District Court’s Dismissal\n\n     A district court’s dismissal of a case for failure to comply\n\nwith a court order is reversible only if it was a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    See Damiani v. Rhode Island Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1983) (noting that similar claims have \"not received a\n\nsympathetic ear from us\"); see also Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d\n\n1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Mindful that case management is a fact-\n\nspecific matter within the ken of the district court, reviewing\n\ncourts have reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.\").            We\n\nfind no such clear abuse of discretion here.\n\n     We begin with appellants’ first contention as to why their\n\nfailure to respond was justified, namely, that counsel did not\n\nreceive the order until September.            At oral argument, counsel\n\nconceded that the August 30 order was \"served\" on August 31 (i.e.,\n\nhis office was in possession of the faxed document), but asserted\n\nthat he did not \"receive\" it until sometime after that date.\n\nCounsel’s misleading of the district court as to this distinction\n\nis unjustifiable.      The fact that counsel’s office received the\n\nfaxed order in August would be enough to show that this argument\n\nwas meritless.      However, appellants went beyond the bounds of\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcredulity and attempted to excuse their conduct by arguing, in\n\nessence, that their failure to respond timely excused them from\n\nresponding at all.         We would be inclined to uphold the district\n\ncourt’s decision to sanction appellants even if it were based\n\nsolely on the absurdity of this argument.\n\n       Appellants, however, proffered another faulty justification:\n\nthat    counsel    could    not   contact      them   to    discuss    the   factual\n\nallegations because they were on an extended world tour.                          This\n\nexplanation is in reality a confession of deficiency in pleading.\n\nRule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure forbids parties and\n\ntheir    counsel    from     alleging     factual      contentions       that     lack\n\nevidentiary support.         Given appellants’ about-face regarding the\n\nvery basis on which the complaint was filed, it is apparent that\n\nthe    complaint    violated      Rule   11.     At   oral     argument,     counsel\n\nsubmitted    that     the     false      allegations        were   a     result     of\n\nmiscommunications          between       he     and        appellants.            Such\n\nmiscommunications do not excuse the misconduct.                    Had appellants\n\nfollowed the strictures of Rule 11, counsel would not have needed\n\nto contact appellants during their travels to flesh out the factual\n\nallegations upon which the case was based.\n\n       Additionally, counsel had ethical obligations to remain in\n\ncontact with appellants while they were traveling.                     Canon 19 of\n\nPuerto Rico’s Canons of Professional Ethics provides that\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          The lawyer should always keep his client informed about\n          every important issue which arises in the development of\n          the case which has been entrusted to him.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 4, App. IX, Canon 19; see also Spiller v.\n\nU.S.V. Labs., Inc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"The\n\ndefendant should not be made to suffer because the plaintiff has\n\nfailed to establish an effective means of communication with his\n\nattorney.\").   Counsel’s inability to contact his clients thus is\n\nnot a supportable justification.     Especially in this electronic\n\nage, where cell phones, email, and pagers have become the norm, it\n\nis simply incredible that counsel could not contact his clients for\n\nmore than two months.   Even if communication had been impossible,\n\ncounsel should have explained the circumstances to the court.\n\nMoreover, to the extent that counsel submitted that he had to meet\n\npersonally with appellants to obtain the information, the leanness\n\nof the November 14 response plainly shows that the sought-after\n\ninformation was hardly voluminous, and easily could have been\n\nascertained during a short telephone call.   The district court was\n\nthus justified in sanctioning appellants based on their deliberate\n\nnon-responsiveness.\n\n     Appellants alternatively claim that even if the court was\n\njustified in sanctioning them, dismissal was too harsh, and a\n\nlesser sanction would have been appropriate.   A single instance of\n\nprohibited conduct cannot be a basis for dismissal if the conduct\n\nwas not \"particularly egregious or extreme.\" Benjamin v. Aroostook\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fMed. Ctr., Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).                   We have given\n\nas   examples    of    such   conduct      \"extremely       protracted     inaction\n\n(measured in years), disobedience of court orders, ignorance of\n\nwarnings,     contumacious      conduct,       or    some    other     aggravating\n\ncircumstance.\"        Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).       Here,    after   concluding      that   the    allegations     in    the\n\ncomplaint were vague, the court gave appellants the opportunity to\n\ncorrect those deficiencies.             Not only did appellants fail to\n\nrespond, but when they finally did, they misrepresented to the\n\ncourt that they did not timely receive the order, and essentially\n\ndeclared that appellants’ travel schedule was more important than\n\nthe court’s order.         All of these actions gave the district court\n\nample reason to dismiss the case.1\n\n        Furthermore, as we have concluded in the past, \"it is well\n\nsettled that the question on review is not whether we would have\n\nimposed a more lenient penalty had we been sitting in the trial\n\njudge's place, but whether the trial judge abused his discretion in\n\nimposing the penalty he did.\"           Spiller, 842 F.2d at 537; see also\n\nFigueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(finding that district court need not consider lesser sanctions\n\nwhere    a   party    is   \"guilty   not   only      of   simple   delay    but   of\n\n\n     1\n        We do not factor into our analysis appellee’s catalogue of\nappellants’ other alleged transgressions.      The district court\nrelied only on the circumstances surrounding the August 30 order,\nwhich, as discussed above, provided sufficient authority to dismiss\nthe case.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdisobedience of a court order as well\"); Farm Constr. Servs., Inc.\n\nv. Fudge, 831 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that a court\n\nneed not \"attempt less severe sanctions before turning to the\n\nsanction of dismissal\").          Likewise, we reject the argument that\n\nappellants    should   not   be   punished    for   the   misdeeds    of   their\n\ncounsel.2    See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 633-34 (1962)\n\n(\"There is certainly no merit to the contention that dismissal\n\n[because of] counsel’s unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty\n\non the client.     Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his\n\nrepresentative    in   the   action,    and    he   cannot   now     avoid   the\n\nconsequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected\n\nagent.      Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our\n\nsystem of representative litigation. . . .\"); see also Farm Constr.\n\nServs., 831 F.2d at 18 (\"This Circuit, following Link, has turned\n\na ‘deaf ear’ to the plea that the sins of the attorney should not\n\nbe visited upon the client.\") (collecting cases).\n\nB.   Appellee’s Motion for Appellate Sanctions\n\n     Finally, we turn to appellee’s motion for appellate sanctions,\n\nbased on the frivolity of this appeal.              Rule 38 of the Federal\n\nRules of Appellate Procedure permits us to levy sanctions against\n\na party that brings a frivolous appeal.              The purpose of such a\n\n\n     2\n        Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., 920 F.2d 1072\n(1st Cir. 1990), the only case cited by appellants in support of\nthis argument, is not on point. Rather, that case stands only for\nthe unremarkable proposition that dismissal is an improper sanction\nfor inadvertent, as opposed to willful, failures.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fpenalty is to \"discourage litigants from wasting the time and\n\nmonetary    resources   of    both   their     opponents    and    the   nation's\n\njudicial    system    with     legal      arguments   that     do    not    merit\n\nconsideration.\"      E.H. Ashley & Co. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Serv., 907\n\nF.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir. 1990).             Appellants chose not to file a\n\nsubstantive response, instead relying on their appellate briefs.\n\n      We have already concluded that appellants willfully disobeyed\n\nthe   district   court,      and   then      compounded    their    problems   by\n\nmisleading the court as to when the order was received.                  This was\n\ntherefore not a dismissal based on isolated or inadvertent conduct.\n\nMoreover, throughout this appeal, appellants have in one breath\n\ncharacterized their actions as \"unintentional,\" and in the next,\n\nexplained that they deliberately waited until the conclusion of the\n\nworld tour to obtain the information.             Mere characterizations of\n\nactions as unintentional cannot carry the day.                Given the clear\n\nevidence that appellants’ actions were deliberate, even a cursory\n\nreading of the caselaw would have led to the conclusion that the\n\ndistrict court could not have abused its discretion in dismissing\n\nthe case.   See, e.g., Morgan v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 901 F.2d 186, 195\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e cannot find that the district court abused\n\nits discretion where, as here, the appellant willfully violated\n\nprocedural rules and orders of the district court.\"). Because both\n\nthe record and the relevant caselaw are plain, it is obvious that\n\nappellants had no realistic chance of success in this appeal.                  See\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fTransnational Corp. v. Rodio & Ursillo, Ltd., 920 F.2d 1066, 1072\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (finding that an appeal is \"frivolous when the\n\nappellant     should    have   realized       the    weakness   of    his   legal\n\nposition\").\n\n        We also conclude that counsel played a significant role in\n\nunnecessarily prolonging this case.             As discussed above, counsel\n\nadmitted that the allegations in the complaint were false (and thus\n\nviolated    Rule   11   of   the    Federal    Rules   of   Civil    Procedure).\n\nFurthermore, until oral argument, counsel continued to assert that\n\nhe did not timely receive the Order.                 Therefore, we find that\n\ncounsel and appellants should be held jointly and severally liable\n\nfor sanctions.     See Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 635 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)    (assessing     sanctions    against    an   attorney   for    frivolous\n\nappeal); see also Bartel Dental Books Co. v. Schultz, 786 F.2d 486,\n\n491 (2d Cir. 1986) (\"Attorneys can be held jointly and severally\n\nliable with their clients under Rule 38 for bringing frivolous\n\nappeals.\").    As our opinion indicates, the basis for the district\n\ncourt’s action and for the awarding of sanctions is fully revealed\n\nin the briefs of the parties.           The facts are few and the law is\n\nclear.    But appellee not only delayed the filing of her motion for\n\nsanctions until shortly before oral argument, but favored us with\n\nthirty pages of briefing.            The irritation produced by lengthy\n\nfrustration does not justify adding overextended argumentation to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\four workload.   Accordingly, we award double costs and attorneys’\n\nfees in the amount of $2000.\n\n     The district court judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Hallenbeck,</i> 81 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Mindful that case management is a fact-specific matter within the ken of the district court, reviewing courts have reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.\"). We find no such clear abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with appellants' first contention as to why their failure to respond was justified, namely, that counsel did not receive the order until September. At oral argument, counsel conceded that the August 30 order was \"served\" on August 31 (i.e., his office was in possession of the faxed document), but asserted that he did not \"receive\" it until sometime after that date. Counsel's misleading of the district court as to this distinction is unjustifiable. The fact that counsel's office received the faxed order in August would be enough to show that this argument was meritless. However, appellants went beyond the bounds of credulity and attempted to excuse their conduct by arguing, in essence, that their failure to respond timely excused them from responding at all. We would be inclined to uphold the district court's decision to sanction appellants even if it were based solely on the absurdity of this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, however, proffered another faulty justification: that counsel could not contact them to discuss the factual allegations because they were on an extended world tour. This explanation is in reality a confession of deficiency in pleading. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure forbids parties and their counsel from alleging factual contentions that lack evidentiary support. Given appellants' about-face regarding the very basis on which the complaint was filed, it is apparent that the complaint violated Rule 11. At oral argument, counsel submitted that the false allegations were a result of miscommunications between he and appellants. Such miscommunications do not excuse the misconduct. Had appellants followed the strictures of Rule 11, counsel would not have needed to contact appellants during their travels to flesh out the factual allegations upon which the case was based.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, counsel had ethical obligations to remain in contact with appellants while they were traveling. Canon 19 of Puerto Rico's Canons of Professional Ethics provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lawyer should always keep his client informed about every important issue which arises in the development of the case which has been entrusted to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 4, App. IX, Canon 19; <i>see also Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs., Inc.,</i> 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir.1988) (\"The defendant should not be made to suffer because the plaintiff has failed to establish an effective means of communication with his attorney.\"). Counsel's inability to contact his clients thus is not a supportable justification. Especially in this electronic age, where cell phones, email, and pagers have become the norm, it is simply incredible that counsel could not contact his clients for more than two months. Even if communication had been impossible, counsel should have explained the circumstances to the court. Moreover, to the extent that counsel submitted that he had to meet personally with appellants to obtain the information, the leanness of the November 14 response plainly shows that the sought-after information was hardly voluminous, and easily could have been ascertained during a short telephone call. The district court was thus justified in sanctioning appellants based on their deliberate non-responsiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants alternatively claim that even if the court was justified in sanctioning them, dismissal was too harsh, and a lesser sanction would have been appropriate. A single instance of prohibited conduct cannot be a basis for dismissal if the conduct was not \"particularly egregious or extreme.\" <i>Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> 57 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir.1995). We have given as examples of such conduct \"extremely protracted inaction (measured in years), disobedience of court orders, ignorance of warnings, contumacious conduct, or some other aggravating circumstance.\" <i>Cosme Nieves v. Deshler,</i> 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1987). Here, after concluding that the allegations in the complaint were vague, the court gave appellants the opportunity to correct those deficiencies. Not only did appellants fail to respond, but when they finally did, they misrepresented to the court that they did not timely receive the order, and essentially declared that appellants' travel schedule was more important than the court's order. All of these actions gave the district court ample reason to dismiss the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, as we have concluded in the past, \"it is well settled that the question on review is not whether we would have imposed a more lenient penalty had we been sitting in the trial judge's place, but whether the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing the penalty he did.\" <i>Spiller,</i> 842 F.2d at 537; <i>see also Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria,</i> 896 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir.1990) (finding that district court need not consider lesser sanctions where a party is \"guilty not only of simple delay but of disobedience of a court order as well\"); <i>Farm Constr. Servs., Inc. v. Fudge,</i> 831 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that a court need not \"attempt less severe sanctions before turning to the sanction of dismissal\"). Likewise, we reject the argument that appellants should not be punished for the misdeeds of their counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co.,</i> 370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (\"There is certainly no merit to the contention that dismissal [because of] counsel's unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client. Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation....\"); <i>see also Farm Constr. Servs.,</i> 831 F.2d at 18 (\"This Circuit, following <i>Link,</i> has turned a `deaf ear' to the plea that the sins of the attorney should not be visited upon the client.\") (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Appellee's Motion for Appellate Sanctions</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn to appellee's motion for appellate sanctions, based on the frivolity of this appeal. Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure permits us to levy sanctions against a party that brings a frivolous appeal. The purpose of such a penalty is to \"discourage litigants from wasting the time and monetary resources of both their opponents and the nation's judicial system with legal arguments that do not merit consideration.\" <i>E.H. Ashley &amp; Co. v. Wells Fargo Alarm Serv.,</i> 907 F.2d 1274, 1280 (1st Cir.1990). Appellants chose not to file a substantive response, instead relying on their appellate briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already concluded that appellants willfully disobeyed the district court, and then compounded their problems by misleading the court as to when the order was received. This was therefore not a dismissal based on isolated or inadvertent conduct. Moreover, throughout this appeal, appellants have in one breath characterized their actions as \"unintentional,\" and in the next, explained that they deliberately waited until the conclusion of the world tour to obtain the information. Mere characterizations of actions as unintentional cannot carry the day. Given the clear evidence that appellants' actions were deliberate, even a cursory reading of the caselaw would have led to the conclusion that the district court could not have abused its discretion in dismissing the case. <i>See, e.g., Morgan v. Mass. Gen.</i> <i>Hosp.,</i> 901 F.2d 186, 195 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[W]e cannot find that the district court abused its discretion where, as here, the appellant willfully violated procedural rules and orders of the district court.\"). Because both the record and the relevant caselaw are plain, it is obvious that appellants had no realistic chance of success in this appeal. <i>See Transnational Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd.,</i> 920 F.2d 1066, 1072 (1st Cir.1990) (finding that an appeal is \"frivolous when the appellant should have realized the weakness of his legal position\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that counsel played a significant role in unnecessarily prolonging this case. As discussed above, counsel admitted that the allegations in the complaint were false (and thus violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Furthermore, until oral argument, counsel continued to assert that he did not timely receive the Order. Therefore, we find that counsel and appellants should be held jointly and severally liable for sanctions. <i>See Cruz v. Savage,</i> 896 F.2d 626, 635 (1st Cir.1990) (assessing sanctions against an attorney for frivolous appeal); <i>see also Bartel Dental Books Co. v. Schultz,</i> 786 F.2d 486, 491 (2d Cir.1986) (\"Attorneys can be held jointly and severally liable with their clients under Rule 38 for bringing frivolous appeals.\"). As our opinion indicates, the basis for the district court's action and for the awarding of sanctions is fully revealed in the briefs of the parties. The facts are few and the law is clear. But appellee not only delayed the filing of her motion for sanctions until shortly before oral argument, but favored us with thirty pages of briefing. The irritation produced by lengthy frustration does not justify adding overextended argumentation to our workload. Accordingly, we award double costs and attorneys' fees in the amount of $2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The district court judgment is affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do not factor into our analysis appellee's catalogue of appellants' other alleged transgressions.

Appellants claim that their actions were not so unreasonable as to justify dismissal of the case. We reject their contention and hold that the dismissal was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 29, 1999, appellants Top Entertainment Inc., Angelo Medina d/b/a Producciones Angelo Medina, and Star Entertainment, Inc. filed a three-page complaint against Maria Ortega, d/b/a Servitel. The complaint cursorily alleged that Ortega falsely purported to be appellants' promoter for a series of Ricky Martin concerts in Peru and Colombia. Later in the case, when the district court ordered appellants to more fully explain the allegations, they made an about-face. Appellants now claim that the parties entered into an agreement that Ortega later breached by failing to promote the concerts within its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 24, 2000, the district court filed its Initial Scheduling Conference Call, setting out the details for pre-trial proceedings. On August 8, the parties attended the initial scheduling conference. The district court entered an order on August 30, reflecting the issues discussed during that meeting. Based on the vagueness of the complaint, the August 30 Order required appellants to, <i>inter alia,</i> \"submit an informative motion on or before August 31, 2000 detailing the terms of the contractual relationship between the parties hereto and how those were breached.\" The Civil Notice Log Report (the official record of all orders sent by the docket clerk) reflected that appellants' counsel received the order by facsimile transmission at 1:30 p.m. on August 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants failed to respond to the order and never sought an extension of time to respond. On November 8, 2000, the court opined that appellants' failure to answer was \"both perplexing and disturbing\" and issued another order instructing plaintiffs to show cause on or before November 15 as to why the case should not be dismissed for failure to comply with the earlier order. On November 14, appellants responded, claiming that they did not comply because (1) counsel received the order in September, after the August 31 deadline; and (2) counsel could not contact appellants to flesh out the factual allegations because they were on an extended world tour. The November 14 response contained approximately one and a half pages of additional factual allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 3, 2001, the district court dismissed the action based on appellants' failure to respond timely to the August 30 order. The district court concluded that appellants' failure was especially prejudicial because the absence of meaningful allegations in the complaint precluded both appellee from adequately defending herself and the court from effectively managing its docket. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The District Court's Dismissal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's dismissal of a case for failure to comply with a court order is reversible only if it was a clear abuse of discretion. <i>See Damiani v.

Mere characterizations of actions as unintentional cannot carry the day. Given the clear evidence that appellants' actions were deliberate, even a cursory reading of the caselaw would have led to the conclusion that the district court could not have abused its discretion in dismissing the case. <i>See, e.g., Morgan v. Mass. Gen.</i> <i>Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540006\"><a href=\"/opinion/540006/john-e-morgan-v-massachusetts-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[W]e cannot find that the district court abused its discretion where, as here, the appellant willfully violated procedural rules and orders of the district court.\"). Because both the record and the relevant caselaw are plain, it is obvious that appellants had no realistic chance of success in this appeal. <i>See Transnational Corp. v. Rodio &amp; Ursillo, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552772\"><a href=\"/opinion/552772/transnational-corp-v-rodio-ursillo-ltd-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span>, 1072 (1st Cir.1990) (finding that an appeal is \"frivolous when the appellant should have realized the weakness of his legal position\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that counsel played a significant role in unnecessarily prolonging this case. As discussed above, counsel admitted that the allegations in the complaint were false (and thus violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Furthermore, until oral argument, counsel continued to assert that he did not timely receive the Order. Therefore, we find that counsel and appellants should be held jointly and severally liable for sanctions. <i>See Cruz v. Savage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536974\"><a href=\"/opinion/536974/juan-e-cruz-v-robert-savage-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 635 (1st Cir.1990) (assessing sanctions against an attorney for frivolous appeal); <i>see also Bartel Dental Books Co. v. Schultz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466444\"><a href=\"/opinion/466444/bartel-dental-books-co-inc-and-mapleton-house-books-inc-v-peter-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span>, 491 (2d Cir.1986) (\"Attorneys can be held jointly and severally liable with their clients under Rule 38 for bringing frivolous appeals.\"). As our opinion indicates, the basis for the district court's action and for the awarding of sanctions is fully revealed in the briefs of the parties. The facts are few and the law is clear. But appellee not only delayed the filing of her motion for sanctions until shortly before oral argument, but favored us with thirty pages of briefing. The irritation produced by lengthy frustration does not justify adding overextended argumentation to our workload. Accordingly, we award double costs and attorneys' fees in the amount of $2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The district court judgment is affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do not factor into our analysis appellee's catalogue of appellants' other alleged transgressions.

Rather, that case stands only for the unremarkable proposition that dismissal is an improper sanction for inadvertent, as opposed to willful, failures.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
