Porter and Carol A. Porter on brief pro se.\r\n    Philip X. Murray on brief for appellees.\r\n\nAugust 30, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We have considered the parties' briefs\r\nand the record on appeal.  We review the grant of summary\r\njudgment de novo, using the same standard as required of the\r\ndistrict court.  Catex Vitol Gas, Inc. v. Wolfe, 178 F.3d 572,\r\n576 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\n          The defendants are not liable under 42 U.S.C.  1983\r\nbecause the state statute authorizing the attachment has not\r\nbeen found unconstitutional.  See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,\r\n457 U.S. 922 (1982) (holding that private parties who attached\r\na debtor's assets pursuant to a state attachment statute were\r\nsubject to  1983 liability if the statute was constitutionally\r\ninfirm); Digital Equipment Corp. v. Currie Enterprises, 142\r\nF.R.D. 16, 26 (D. Mass. 1992) (finding the state attachment\r\nstatute constitutional).  The lack of viability of the only\r\nfederally-based claim supports the dismissal of the remaining\r\nstate-based claims.  Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888 F.2d 189, 196\r\n(1st Cir. 1989).\r\n          Further, the appellants have not persuaded us that\r\nthere was either error or abuse of discretion in the district\r\ncourt's refusal to amend the order dismissing the defendant\r\nBeatrice from the case.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
