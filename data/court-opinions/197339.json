On August  9,  1995,  Maria\r\n\nMulinelli-Navas \r                         (\"Mulinel\r                                 li\") was charged with conspiracy to commit\r\n\nbank  fraud,  in violation  of  18  U.S.C. S  371,  making  false\r\n\nstatements  to a  federally  insured  financial  institution,  in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. S 1014, and bank fraud, in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1344.   On December 21, 1995,  a jury returned a  guilty\r\n\nverdict on  all counts and she  was subsequently sentenced to  27\r\n\nmonths for each count, to be served concurrently, and three years\r\n\nsupervised  release.   Mulinelli  appeals only  her  convictions,\r\n\nclaiming that: (1) the district court's limitation on her  cross-\r\n\nexamination \r                     of her accomplices deprived her of her Sixth Amendment\r\n\nright  to  confrontation;  (2)  the  district  court  abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion  by not  allowing  Mulinelli  to  introduce  extrinsic\r\n\nevidence to impeach an accomplice; (3) the district court  abused\r\n\nits  discretion  by   admitting  into   evidence  an   improperly\r\n\nauthenticated summary  chart;  and  (4) the  district  court,  by\r\n\noverruling certain  objections, deprived  her of  the ability  to\r\n\npresent \r                 her \r                     defense \r                            to \r                               the jury.  For the reasons stated herein, we\r\n\nvacate Mulinelli's conviction and sentence on Counts V and VI and\r\n\naffirm as to all other issues.\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The \r                       jury \r                            could \r                                 have \r                                      found the following facts.  Mulinelli\r\n\nwas \r             Senior \r                    Vice President of First Federal Savings Bank, in charge\r\n\nof \r            car \r                loans.  Between 1985 and 1988, First Federal approved loans\r\n\nto two dealers who, in fact, neither bought nor sold the cars for\r\n\nwhich the  loans were made.   Furthermore,  these loans  involved\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nirregular financing, with low monthly payments and large  balloon\r\n\npayments at the end of one year.\r\n\n          The indictment  charged  Mulinelli with  conspiring  to\r\n\napprove \r                 fraudulent loans of $25,000 in 1985 and $273,000 from 1987\r\n\nto 1988 to Lopez, and $130,000 in June 1988 to Exposito.\r\n\n          At trial, the two  auto dealers testified.  One of  the\r\n\nauto \r              dealers, Luis Lopez-Mendoza (\"Lopez\"), President and owner of\r\n\nCordillera \r                    Auto, \r                         testified that he was approached by Mulinelli with\r\n\na request that he loan her  money.  In response to his  statement\r\n\nthat he  was not  in  the business  of lending  money,  Mulinelli\r\n\nsuggested \r                   a \r                     financing scheme by which Lopez would apply for a loan\r\n\non a  non-existent car.    According to  the loan  documents  and\r\n\ndisbursement  check,  the loan  was  taken  out in  the  name  of\r\n\nMulinelli's daughter  for a Volvo  station wagon  that was  never\r\n\nactually purchased.   They carried out the scheme she  described:\r\n\nupon receiving the loan check, he deposited the amount, then gave\r\n\nMulinelli a  $25,000 loan  from  cash on  hand at  his  business.\r\n\nMulinelli's daughter testified that she signed for a $25,000 loan\r\n\nto \r            purchase \r                     a family car that Mulinelli put in the daughter's name\r\n\nbecause \r                 of \r                    credit problems.  She testified that the handwriting on\r\n\nthe sales contract \"looked like my mother's.\"\r\n\n          In 1985,  Lopez  approached Mulinelli  about  obtaining\r\n\nfinancing of a type not available from First Federal.   Mulinelli\r\n\nsuggested a  similar scheme,  whereby Lopez  would execute  blank\r\n\ncontracts, stamped  with the seal  of Cordillera  Auto and  would\r\n\ndeliver the blank documents to Mulinelli for her approval.  Lopez\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nused these loans to  finance cars he was purchasing for  eventual\r\n\nresale.  A similar strategy was used to provide loans to  another\r\n\ndealer, \r                 Lazaro Exposito Cordoves (\"Exposito\"), President of Caguas\r\n\nAuto \r              Wholesale. \r                          \r                         Both \r                              Lopez and Exposito testified that they signed\r\n\nand  sealed blank  forms  for  car sales  contracts,  which  they\r\n\ndelivered to the bank for completion.\r\n\n          During his testimony, Lopez recanted statements made in\r\n\nan earlier  affidavit,  in which  he  denied that  Mulinelli  had\r\n\nknowledge of the  fraud.  He testified  that he lied because  the\r\n\nattorney to whom he made the affidavit told him, before  starting\r\n\nthe tape recorder,  that the attorney's purpose was to  \"protect\"\r\n\nMulinelli.  The defense sought to introduce the testimony of  the\r\n\nattorney regarding whether he actually stated that the purpose of\r\n\nhis \r             meeting \r                     with \r                         Lopez \r                               was to protect Mulinelli.  After hearing the\r\n\nattorney's \r                    proposed testimony out of the presence of the jury, the\r\n\ntrial court upheld the prosecution's objection that his testimony\r\n\nwas  extrinsic evidence  on a  \"collateral matter\"  and thus  was\r\n\ninadmissible.\r\n\n          Exposito \r                            testified \r                                     about \r                                           two loans made in 1988 to Caguas\r\n\nAuto Wholesale,  purportedly to  finance purchases  for a  rental\r\n\nbusiness  (\"Zoom\") that  Exposito  never established.    Exposito\r\n\napproached Mulinelli and informed her that he needed money.   She\r\n\ntold \r              him \r                  to \r                     bring her contracts and bills of sale for cars that he\r\n\nwould \r               sell \r                    from his dealership to this sham car rental business so\r\n\nthat she could approve loans  for their purchase.  For the  first\r\n\nloan, \r               Mulinelli requested that Exposito provide her with a bill of\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nsale and a loan application  reflecting the sale of cars that  he\r\n\nnever purchased.  Two  hours after he delivered the documents  to\r\n\nMulinelli, the loan was approved  and he received a check in  the\r\n\namount \r                of \r                   $60,000.  Exposito used the funds to buy other cars that\r\n\nwere not pledged as collateral for the loan.  He also signed  and\r\n\nsealed blank  sales  contracts  and delivered  them  directly  to\r\n\nMulinelli.   Exposito  testified  that Mulinelli  knew  the  cars\r\n\nreferred \r                  to \r                     in \r                       the \r                           two \r                               loan applications were not in Puerto Rico at\r\n\nthe time the  loans were  made and that  he had  no intention  of\r\n\nselling the cars to Zoom but  rather that he intended to use  the\r\n\nmoney \r               to \r                  buy \r                      other cars.  Moreover, Mulinelli determined the terms\r\n\nof \r            these \r                  loans, \r                        which \r                              included large balloon payments at the end of\r\n\nthe year.  In return for her assistance with the loans, he made a\r\n\npersonal \r                  loan to Mulinelli for $5,000 and did some personal favors\r\n\nfor her and her family.\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.        The district court's  limitation of Mulinelli's  cross-\r\n          examination of Lopez and Exposito\r\n\n          At  trial,  Mulinelli's  counsel  cross-examined  Lopez\r\n\nregarding the  benefits  and conditions  of his  plea  agreement.\r\n\nMulinelli \r                   entered into evidence the information by which Lopez was\r\n\ncharged and  the plea  agreement under  which he  pled guilty  to\r\n\nconspiracy \r                    to \r                      commit \r                             bank fraud.  Mulinelli elicited testimony from\r\n\nLopez \r               that \r                    he was not and would not be charged with bank fraud, in\r\n\naddition to his conspiracy charge, as Mulinelli had been charged.\r\n\nLopez also testified that, as part of his plea bargain agreement,\r\n\nthe  United States  Attorney would  make a  recommendation for  a\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nreduction in his sentence.  The district court, however, cut  off\r\n\nMulinelli's counsel when on several occasions he tried to  elicit\r\n\ntestimony \r                   from \r                       Lopez \r                             regarding the possible sentence he faced.  The\r\n\ndistrict court noted that matters of sentencing were in the sound\r\n\ndiscretion of  the  district court  judge  who was  scheduled  to\r\n\nsentence Lopez.\r\n\n          Mulinelli  elicited  similar  testimony  from  Exposito\r\n\nregarding the substance of the plea agreement -- that he expected\r\n\nthe United  States  Attorney to  make  a recommendation  for  the\r\n\ndistrict court's consideration in his sentencing, that he was not\r\n\ncharged with  bank fraud, but only  with conspiracy and making  a\r\n\nfalse statement to a financial institution, and that he would not\r\n\nbe \r            charged \r                    with \r                        any \r                            other crimes.  Again, the district court barred\r\n\nMulinelli from  eliciting testimony regarding  the nature of  the\r\n\nsentence Exposito expected to receive.\r\n\n          Mulinelli argues on  appeal that  the district  court's\r\n\nlimitation  on  her  cross-examination  regarding  the  potential\r\n\nsentence \r                  that \r                      both \r                           accomplices faced before and after entering into\r\n\nthe plea agreements so interfered with her ability to effectively\r\n\ncross-examine the witnesses that it violated her Sixth  Amendment\r\n\nright to confrontation.\r\n\n          The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \"[i]n all  criminal\r\n\nprosecutions,  the accused  shall enjoy  the right  . .  . to  be\r\n\nconfronted \r                    with \r                        the \r                            witnesses against him.\"  U.S. Const. amend. VI.\r\n\n\"[T]he right of a defendant  in a criminal case to establish  the\r\n\nbias of  witnesses against  him through  cross-examination is  an\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nimportant \r                   component \r                            of \r                               the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\"\r\n\nUnited \r                States \r                      v. \r                         Jarabek\r                                ,\r                                  726 F.2d 889, 902 (1st Cir. 1984) (citing\r\n\nDavis\r               \r               v. \r                  Alaska\r                       , \r                         415 \r                             U.S. 308, 315-16 (1974)).  A defendant has the\r\n\nright to cross-examine an accomplice regarding the nature of  and\r\n\nbenefits, including unprosecuted crimes, afforded under the  plea\r\n\nagreement.  United States v. Barrett, 766 F.2d 609, 614 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1985).  Although this right  is extensive, it is not absolute  or\r\n\nunlimited. \r                     \r                     Once \r                         the \r                             defendant has been afforded the constitutional\r\n\nminimum of an  opportunity for  effective cross-examination,  the\r\n\ntrial \r               court \r                    \"retain[s] \r                               wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on\r\n\nsuch \r              cross-examination \r                               based on concerns about, among other things,\r\n\nharassment,  prejudice, confusion  of the  issues, the  witness's\r\n\nsafety, or  interrogation that is  repetitive or only  marginally\r\n\nrelevant.\" \r                     \r                     Delaware\r                             \r                             v. \r                                V\r                                 an Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986).  \"An\r\n\nabuse of discretion has occurred only if the jury is left without\r\n\n'sufficient  information concerning  formative events  to make  a\r\n\n\"discriminating  appraisal\" of  a witness's  motives and  bias.'\"\r\n\nUnited States  v. Twomey,  806 F.2d  1136, 1140  (1st Cir.  1986)\r\n\n(quoting United  States v. Campbell, 426  F.2d 547, 550 (2d  Cir.\r\n\n1970)).\r\n\n          We find no such  abuse here.  During direct and  cross-\r\n\nexamination \r                     of both Lopez and Exposito, the jury was apprised that\r\n\nthey \r              were \r                   not \r                      charged \r                              with bank fraud, one of the charges Mulinelli\r\n\nfaced.    On cross-examination,  Mulinelli  was  able  to  elicit\r\n\ninformation regarding their  plea agreements, including that  the\r\n\naccomplices  expected  the   government  to  make  a   beneficial\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nrecommendatio\r                      n to the sentencing judge based on their cooperation,\r\n\nand \r             that \r                  they were granted immunity from prosecution for any other\r\n\ncrimes related to their testimony.  The jury could infer from the\r\n\ncircumstances that the accomplices had avoided being charged with\r\n\noffenses  carrying  greater   sentences  by  testifying  in   the\r\n\ngovernment's  case.   Mulinelli  was  able,  through  her  cross-\r\n\nexamination,  to  expose  the  biases  and  motivations  of   the\r\n\naccomplices to favor the government and, once this threshold  was\r\n\nmet, \r              the \r                  district court's limitation was not improper.  As we find\r\n\nthat \r              the \r                  jury \r                      had \r                          before \r                                 it sufficient information on which to make\r\n\na \r           discriminating appraisal of the accomplices' motives and biases,\r\n\nwe find no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          Additionally,  Mulinelli's  counsel  sought  to  elicit\r\n\nsentencing \r                    information regarding the charges the accomplices faced\r\n\nand  avoided by  pleading guilty  to conspiracy.   Had  Mulinelli\r\n\nsuccessfully elicited this information, the potential  punishment\r\n\nshe \r             faced, \r                    should the jury find her guilty, would have been before\r\n\nthe \r             jury. \r                    \r                    The actions taken by the district court to prevent this\r\n\ninformation, \r                      which could confuse the issues presented to the jury,\r\n\nfrom  reaching the jury  were thus entirely  proper.  See  United\r\n\nStates v. Alvarez, 987 F.2d  77, 82 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding  the\r\n\ndistrict  court did  not abuse  its discretion  when it  excluded\r\n\nevidence of the  penalty to be imposed  on an accomplice as  such\r\n\ninformation \r                     might \r                          mislead or confuse the jury, \"particularly where,\r\n\nas \r            here, \r                  the \r                      witness sought to testify to the same penalties faced\r\n\nby the defendants\").\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nII.       District court's decision not to allow Jerome Murray to\r\n          testify\r\n\n          During his  cross-examination,  Lopez  referred  to  an\r\n\ninterview he had  prior to the prosecution  of this case with  an\r\n\nattorney named Jerome Murray (\"Murray\").  Lopez' trial  testimony\r\n\nregarding  his interactions  with  Mulinelli  differed  from  the\r\n\nresponses he had given  during his interview with Murray, and  he\r\n\nstated that he lied during that interview because Murray told him\r\n\nthat the  purpose of the  interview was  to \"protect\"  Mulinelli.\r\n\nDefense counsel stated that  he wished to have Murray testify  to\r\n\nimpeach \r                 Lopez' testimony that Murray told Lopez that the interview\r\n\nwas intended to \"protect\" Mulinelli.  The trial court refused  to\r\n\nallow Murray to testify.\r\n\n          Murray's  testimony would  have  gone to  the  question\r\n\nwhether  Lopez was lying  about what Murray  had said before  the\r\n\ninterview, \r                    and \r                       therefore \r                                 related to Lopez' credibility.  On appeal,\r\n\nMulinelli \r                   contends that the district court usurped the jury's role\r\n\nin  making credibility  determinations  and  thereby  abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion. \r                      \r                     Although \r                              the use of contradictory testimony is a valid\r\n\nmeans of impeachment,  it is limited  in several important  ways.\r\n\nUnited \r                States v. Payne, 102 F.3d 289, 294 (7th Cir. 1996).  One of\r\n\nthese \r               limitations is the collateral issue rule, which bars a party\r\n\nfrom \r              impeaching \r                        a \r                          witness on a collateral matter through the use of\r\n\nextrinsic \r                   evidence. \r                             \r                             Unit\r                                 ed States v.

United States v.\r\n\nKozinski, 16 F.3d 795, 806 (7th Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          In light of the  collateral issue rule, in order to  be\r\n\nadmissible, Murray's offered testimony must not only contradict a\r\n\nstatement \r                   of \r                      Lopez', \r                             but \r                                 must also be material to Mulinelli's guilt\r\n\nor  innocence.    Mulinelli  fails,  however,  to  indicate   any\r\n\nindependent \r                     and \r                        material \r                                 ground for admitting Murray's testimony as\r\n\nto \r            what \r                 he \r                    told \r                        Lopez \r                              at \r                                 the time of the interview.

Evidentiary rulings\r\n\n          A. Admission of the summary chart\r\n\n          The government's  first witness  was Fernando  Iglesias\r\n\nIglesias  (\"Iglesias\"),  an  auditor  for  First  Federal,  whose\r\n\ninvestigation\r                       of First Federal's unusual car loan transactions led\r\n\nto  Mulinelli's  indictment.    During  direct  examination,  the\r\n\ngovernment moved  to  admit a  summary  chart that  Iglesias  had\r\n\nprepared during  the  course  of his  investigation,  based  upon\r\n\ninformation \r                     he gleaned from bank loan records.  Mulinelli objected\r\n\nto the admission of the summary chart, arguing that the chart was\r\n\nnot \r             an \r                original. \r                          \r                          On \r                             appeal, she changes her position, arguing that\r\n\nthe summary chart  was not properly qualified under the  business\r\n\nrecord \r                hearsay exception.  See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).  When a party\r\n\nraises \r                on \r                   appeal an argument she failed to present to the district\r\n\ncourt, she  has forfeited  the  argument and  can only  obtain  a\r\n\nfavorable \r                   ruling upon a showing of plain error.  See United States\r\n\nv. \r            Smith\r                 , \r                   101 F.3d 202 (1st Cir. 1996) (explaining that failure to\r\n\nargue, at time of objection, grounds offered on appeal results in\r\n\nplain error review), cert. denied,     S. Ct.    , 1997 WL 106695\r\n\n(Mar. 31, 1997).  Mulinelli must show that the error \"resulted in\r\n\na miscarriage  of  justice or  seriously affected  the  fairness,\r\n\n                              -11-\r\r\n\nintegrity  or public  reputation  of the  judicial  proceedings.\"\r\n\nCoastal \r                 Fuels \r                       of \r                         Puerto \r                                Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79\r\n\nF.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), cert. denied,\r\n\n117 S. Ct. 294 (1996).  The plain error standard affords reversal\r\n\n\"only in  'exceptional cases or  under peculiar circumstances  to\r\n\nprevent a  clear  miscarriage of  justice.'\"   United  States  v.\r\n\nGriffin, 818 F.2d  97, 100 (1st Cir.  1987).  Mulinelli fails  to\r\n\nindicate  any error in  the admission of  this summary chart  \"so\r\n\nshocking that [it] seriously affect[ed] the fundamental  fairness\r\n\nand \r             basic \r                   integrity of the proceedings below.\"  Id.  Moreover, the\r\n\nsummary \r                 chart \r                      probably \r                               have been admissible as a business record as\r\n\nthe \r             district \r                      court would likely find Iglesias a \"qualified person\"\r\n\nwithin \r                the \r                    meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6).  We find no\r\n\nplain error.\r\n\n          B.   Admission of copy of a check\r\n\n          During  the  testimony  of  Iglesias,  the   government\r\n\nintroduced into evidence  a microform copy of a check  disbursing\r\n\nloan \r              funds \r                    to Mulinelli's daughter.  Mulinelli objected \"only [to]\r\n\nthe \r             issue \r                  of \r                     authenticity,\" Trial Transcript, Dec. 18, 1995, at 81,\r\n\nof the copy of the check.   On appeal, Mulinelli argues that  the\r\n\nadmission \r                   of \r                      the microform copy was an abuse of discretion because\r\n\nthe \r             government should have introduced the original and because the\r\n\ncheck was not properly authenticated.\r\n\n          Regarding \r                             the \r                                admission \r                                          of the duplicate, rather than the\r\n\noriginal, the  district court acted  well within its  discretion.\r\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 1003, \"[a] duplicate is admissible\r\n\n                              -12-\r\r\n\nto \r            the \r                same \r                     extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is\r\n\nraised  as to  the authenticity  of the  original or  (2) in  the\r\n\ncircumstances\r                       it would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of\r\n\nthe original.\"  A duplicate is\r\n\n          a counterpart produced by the same impression\r\n          as the original, or from the same matrix,  or\r\n          by   means    of    photography,    including\r\n          enlargements and miniatures, or by mechanical\r\n          or electronic  re-recording, or  by  chemical\r\n          reproduction,   or   by   other    equivalent\r\n          techniques which  accurately  reproduces  the\r\n          original.\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 1001(4).  The microform copy introduced here was  a\r\n\n\"duplicate\" \r                     of \r                       the \r                           original check and was admissible subject to the\r\n\nlimitations of Federal Rule of Evidence 1003.  Although Mulinelli\r\n\nobjected  below to  the  document's \"authenticity\"  and  elicited\r\n\ntestimony that the microform was not the original, she failed  to\r\n\nelicit  any testimony  or make  any proffer  suggesting that  the\r\n\noriginal \r                  had \r                      been tampered with or altered in any way and that the\r\n\ncopy was  not what  it purported  to be.   See  United States  v.\r\n\nBalzano,  687 F.2d 6,  8 (1st Cir.  1982) (declining to  question\r\n\nauthenticity  of duplicate  where  appellant  failed  to  proffer\r\n\ntestimony, \r                    beyond statement that evidence was not the original, of\r\n\nalteration  or  tampering).   The  duplicate  complied  with  the\r\n\nrequirements \r                      of \r                        Federal \r                                Rule of Evidence 1003 and was admissible to\r\n\nthe \r             same \r                  extent as the original.  The district court did not abuse\r\n\nits discretion in admitting the microform copy.\r\n\n          Mulinelli's challenge below as to the \"authenticity\" of\r\n\nthe copy does not clearly identify the argument that the copy was\r\n\nimproperly authenticated.    Nevertheless, giving  Mulinelli  the\r\n\n                              -13-\r\r\n\nbenefit of the doubt as to  the scope of her objection below,  we\r\n\nr                              1\r\n\nstates: \r                  \r                  \"The requirement of authentication or identification as a\r\n\ncondition  precedent to  admissibility is  satisfied by  evidence\r\n\nsufficient \r                    to \r                       support \r                              a \r                                finding that the matter in question is what\r\n\nits proponent claims.\"   Such authentication can be provided  by,\r\n\namong \r               other \r                     things, testimony of a custodian or percipient witness\r\n\n   through  \"the document's  '[a]ppearance, contents,  substance\r           eview \r                the \r                   copy's \r                          authentication.

Leading questions\r\n\n          During the government's direct examination of Exposito,\r\n\nMulinelli's counsel repeatedly objected to the leading nature  of\r\n\nthe government's questions.  Mulinelli restates the objection  on\r\n\nappeal, claiming that Exposito was not adverse or hostile to  the\r\n\nprosecution  so as  to warrant  leading questions,  and that  the\r\n\ncourt's overruling this objection limited her ability to properly\r\n\ncross-examine  Exposito  because  the  prosecution,  rather  than\r\n\nExposito, was testifying.\r\n\n          Federal Rule of Evidence 611(c) provides:\r\n\n          Leading questions should  not be used on  the\r\n          direct examination of a witness except as may\r\n          be   necessary  to   develop   the   witness'\r\n          testimony.    Ordinarily  leading   questions\r\n          should  be  permitted  on  cross-examination.\r\n          When  a party  calls  a hostile  witness,  an\r\n          adverse \r                           party, or a witness identified with an\r\n          adverse \r                           party, interrogation may be by leading\r\n          questions.\r\n\n\"[T]he use of leading questions '. . . must be left to  the sound\r\n\ndiscretion of  the trial  judge  who sees  the witness  and  can,\r\n\ntherefore, determine in the interest of truth and justice whether\r\n\nthe circumstances justify leading questions to be propounded to a\r\n\nwitness \r                 by \r                    the \r                       party \r                             producing.'\"  United States v. Brown, 603 F.2d\r\n\n1022, 1025 (1st Cir. 1979).  Our review of the transcript reveals\r\n\na witness  who was, at  times, unresponsive or  showed a lack  of\r\n\nunderstanding.   The prosecutor's  use of  leading questions  was\r\n\nlimited to questions intended to  lay a foundation for a line  of\r\n\n                              -15-\r\r\n\nquestioning \r                     or \r                        to \r                          assist \r                                 in developing coherent testimony.  We find\r\n\nthat \r              such \r                   questions were not improper and the district court acted\r\n\nwithin its discretion when it allowed this manner of questioning.\r\n\nSee id. at 1025-26.\r\n\n          Mulinelli  also  suggests   that  the  district   court\r\n\nimproperly questioned  Exposito during  his testimony.   The  few\r\n\noccasions  that Mulinelli points  to do not  suggest an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion. \r                      \r                      See United States v. Olmstead, 832 F.2d 642, 648 (1st\r\n\nCir.  1987).  The questions posed by  the judge \"served to . .  .\r\n\nclarify lines of inquiry  or develop the witness's answer.   Such\r\n\nconduct is well within the court's discretion.\"  Id.\r\n\n          D.   Limiting cross-examination as irrelevant\r\n\n          In  her  attack on  the  prosecutor's  use  of  leading\r\n\nquestions, Mulinelli juxtaposes the leeway granted the prosecutor\r\n\nwith \r              the \r                  district court's curtailment of a line of questioning she\r\n\nsought  to pursue.   Mulinelli argues that  her defense was  that\r\n\nExposito was brought to the bank by one of the bank officers, who\r\n\nvouched for Exposito as  creditworthy, and that, thus,  Mulinelli\r\n\nrelied on the bank officer's support of Exposito.  Because of her\r\n\nreliance,  Mulinelli  argues,  she was  duped  by  the  two  into\r\n\nunknowingly \r                     providing \r                              fraudulent bank loans to Exposito.  Mulinelli\r\n\nargues \r                on \r                   appeal that she presented this theory to the jury in her\r\n\nopening statement, but  was unable, due  to the district  court's\r\n\nlimitation  on her  cross-examination  of Exposito,  to  properly\r\n\npresent \r                 the \r                     theory during the course of the trial.  The references\r\n\n                              -16-\r\r\n\nto this  defense during her  opening statement  consisted of  the\r\n\nfollowing, separated by several pages of transcript.\r\n\n          The evidence will  show that Lazaro  Exposito\r\n          was brought to the bank by one of the highest\r\n          officers of the bank.  He did not come in  by\r\n          the regular channels.  And the documents that\r\n          were presented  to  the car  department  were\r\n          brought by this highest officer of the  bank.\r\n          The \r                       evidence \r                                will show that he was recommended\r\n          by this highest officer  of the bank, and  he\r\n          started to buy repossessed automobiles, which\r\n          was a department, an office under [Mulinelli]\r\n          in \r                      the \r                          department of car loan that was managed\r\n          or \r                      directed \r                               by a man named Otero.   Of course,\r\n          all   under  the   general   supervision   of\r\n          Mulinelli.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n          And finally, I think that the evidence,  when\r\n          you hear  it  in its  totality, you  will  be\r\n          convinced that there  is a conspiracy of  two\r\n          crooks against Maria Mulinelli.\r\n\nTrial Transcript, Dec. 18, 1995, at 26-27, 30.\r\n\n          During Mulinelli's  cross-examination of Exposito,  the\r\n\nfollowing interchange took place:\r\n\n            Q.  Now, sir, you were not brought to First\r\n          Federal in the  usual way other dealers  were\r\n          brought in.\r\n\n            MS.

(Mr. Abreu) Sir,  how did  you get  to\r\n          First Federal Savings to the loan  department\r\n          as a dealer?\r\n\n            A.  It was through Mr. Alcocer.\r\n\n            Q.   Mr.  Alcocer was  one of  the  highest\r\n          officers of the bank at that time, wasn't he?\r\n\n            MS.

ABREU:   May I make  a proffer as to  a\r\n          line?\r\n\n            THE  COURT:    Well,  perhaps  you   should\r\n          approach the bench and make a proffer.\r\n\n                       (Bench conference.)\r\n\n            MR. ABREU:  Your Honor, the proffer is  the\r\n          following:   The  regular practice  in  First\r\n          Federal was sending  young people to  recruit\r\n          dealers. \r                             \r                             In \r                                this particular case he came from\r\n          one \r                       of \r                          the \r                              highest officer[s] of the bank, who\r\n          collected   his    information   about    the\r\n          corporation to  the  department.   He  highly\r\n          recommended  [Exposito],   said  he  had   an\r\n          excellent credit, and  that's how  he got  --\r\n          that's how they trusted him.\r\n\n            THE COURT:   It is total[ly] irrelevant  to\r\n          the  issues of  this case.   This  is a  very\r\n          discreet, \r                             unique, well-defined conduct that is\r\n          the object of these charges.  Has nothing  to\r\n          do with Mr. Alcocer.\r\n\nTrial Transcript, Dec. 19, 1995, at 177-78.\r\n\n          As we noted above, a defendant has a right to effective\r\n\ncross-examination.  Delaware  v. Van Arsdall,  475 U.S. 673,  679\r\n\n(1986). \r                  \r                  Once \r                      that \r                           constitutional threshold has been met, the trial\r\n\ncourt \r               \"retain[s] wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on such\r\n\ncross-examination based on  concerns about,  among other  things,\r\n\nharassment,  prejudice, confusion  of the  issues, the  witness's\r\n\n                              -18-\r\r\n\nsafety, or  interrogation that is  repetitive or only  marginally\r\n\nrelevant.\"  Id.  The  question before us is whether the  district\r\n\ncourt  judge \"exceeded  his powers  to limit  cross-examination.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Malik, 928 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1991).  In this\r\n\ncase, we find that the district court exceeded the boundaries  of\r\n\nits power  and deprived Mulinelli of  her ability to present  her\r\n\ntheory of defense to the jury.\r\n\n          The information presented  by Mulinelli in her  opening\r\n\nstatement and  her proffer adequately  indicated to the  district\r\n\ncourt \r               the \r                   theory \r                         of \r                            defense she wanted to pursue.  She mentioned in\r\n\nher  opening statement  that \"[t]he  evidence will  show that  he\r\n\n(Exposito) was recommended by this highest officer of the  bank,\"\r\n\nwhich \r               suggests that the person with whom Exposito might have acted\r\n\nto defraud the  bank was not Mulinelli,  but Alcocer, and at  the\r\n\nleast that  Mulinelli  was influenced  by the  recommendation  of\r\n\nAlcocer.  Such a  theory of defense might suggest that,  although\r\n\nMulinelli  may  have  been  negligent  in  relying  on  Alcocer's\r\n\nrecommendation and not  questioning Exposito's loan  applications\r\n\nmore  closely than she  did, she had  no knowledge of  Exposito's\r\n\nfraudulent \r                    transactions. \r                                  The information presented to the district\r\n\ncourt adequately  apprised  the court  of  the relevance  of  the\r\n\nchannels \r                  through \r                         which \r                               Exposito's loans were brought to Mulinelli's\r\n\nattention, and the court, by foreclosing the introduction of  any\r\n\ntestimony  to support  Mulinelli's  theory of  defense,  violated\r\n\nMulinelli's \r                     Sixth \r                          Amendment right to confrontation.  We next review\r\n\nthis error for harmlessness.\r\n\n                              -19-\r\r\n\n          On direct appeal, we apply the harmless error  standard\r\n\nset \r             forth \r                   in \r                      Chapman v. California, which requires that we reverse\r\n\nthe  conviction  unless  the   government  can  prove  that   the\r\n\nconstitutional  error  complained  of  was  \"harmless  beyond   a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt.\"  Chapman,  386 U.S. 18,  24 (1967); see  also\r\n\nUnited States  v. Maguire,  918  F.2d 254,  266 (1st  Cir.  1990)\r\n\n(ordering  a   new  trial   where  government   failed  to   show\r\n\nconstitutional errors were  harmless beyond a reasonable  doubt).\r\n\nUnder this standard,  we may not  declare a constitutional  error\r\n\nharmless if there  is a \"reasonable  possibility\" that the  error\r\n\ninfluenced \r                    the \r                        verdict. \r                                 \r                                 See United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d\r\n\n1002, 1015 n.15  (1st Cir. 1995)  (holding that district  court's\r\n\nfailure \r                 to \r                    hold \r                        an \r                           evidentiary hearing into validity of defendant's\r\n\nproposed defense  \"was not 'harmless  beyond a reasonable  doubt'\r\n\nbecause there is a 'reasonable possibility' that exclusion of the\r\n\nproffered alibi evidence influenced the jury's verdict\").\r\n\n          On  the particular  counts that  involved the  Exposito\r\n\ntransactions, the  government's  proof of  Mulinelli's  knowledge\r\n\nrelied solely on  the testimony of  Exposito.  While  documentary\r\n\nevidence was presented to support Exposito's acquisition of these\r\n\nloans, \r                that \r                     evidence did not necessarily corroborate his testimony\r\n\nthat Mulinelli encouraged him to apply for the loans or that  she\r\n\nset the terms of the loans.  The alternative version of events --\r\n\nthat Exposito was brought to the bank by the officer and that the\r\n\nofficer \r                 vouched for him -- would not necessarily have contradicted\r\n\nExposito's \r                    testimony on direct examination but would have provided\r\n\n                              -20-\r\r\n\nMulinelli \r                   with \r                       the \r                           opportunity to develop her own theory of defense\r\n\nagainst these two counts.\r\n\n          The \r                       Sixth \r                             Amendment, and thus the constitutional minimum\r\n\nthat must be allowed a criminal defendant before a trial  court's\r\n\ndiscretion \r                    to \r                      limit \r                            cross-examination adheres, includes the ability\r\n\nto develop and present a defense.  See United States v. Muhammad,\r\n\n928 F.2d  1461, 1467  (7th Cir.  1991) (holding  that only  after\r\n\nsatisfying the constitutional minimum of allowing a defendant  to\r\n\npresent sufficient evidence for the jury to assess her theory  of\r\n\ndefense and witness bias does the district court's discretion  to\r\n\nlimit cross-examination inure); see also Washington v. Texas, 388\r\n\nU.S. 14, 18 (1967) (\"'A person's right to reasonable notice of  a\r\n\ncharge against him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense\r\n\n-- a  right to his  day in court  -- are basic  in our system  of\r\n\njurisprudence; and these rights include, as a minimum, a right to\r\n\nexamine the witnesses against him, to offer testimony, and to  be\r\n\nrepresented \r                     by counsel.'\" (quoting In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273\r\n\n(1948)).  The district court's ruling worked a severe restriction\r\n\non \r            Mulinelli's \r                       ability \r                               to elicit evidence relating to her theory of\r\n\ndefense. \r                   \r                   Had the jury been presented with the theory, it may well\r\n\nhave accepted it  and believed that Exposito's testimony was  not\r\n\ncredible.   As Exposito's  testimony was  the prosecution's  only\r\n\nevidence regarding Mulinelli's knowledge, the error of  excluding\r\n\nher theory of defense could not have been harmless, and  warrants\r\n\nreversal with regard to the loan transactions with Exposito.   We\r\n\n                              -21-\r\r\n\ntherefore \r                   vacate Mulinelli's conviction and sentences4\r\n\n                           CONCLUSION\r\n\n                                        affirm in part and vacate\r\n\nand remand in part.\r\n\n4\r                                                                on Counts 5\r          and 6 and remand to the district court for further proceedings in\r          conformity with this decision.\r                    For the foregoing reasons, we \r             We note, however, that this outcome will not ultimately change\r\nMulinelli's sentence.   Her original base offense level was  six,\r\nincreased \r                   eight levels under U.S.S.G. 2F1.1(b)(1) because the loss\r\nwas \r             determined \r                        to \r                          be \r                             $349,000.  The level was further increased two\r\nlevels in  accordance  with U.S.S.G.  S 2F1.1(b)(2)  because  the\r\noffense involved  more than minimal  planning and  two levels  in\r\naccordance with  U.S.S.G.  S  3B1.3 because  Mulinelli  abused  a\r\nposition \r                  of \r                     trust.  Her sentence, based on these calculations, was\r\n27 months  for all six  counts, to be  served concurrently.   The\r\ncalculations \r                      remain \r                            the \r                                same, even after the loss from Counts 5 and\r\n6 ($130,000) is excluded, because the district court enhanced for\r\nan amount of loss over $200,000 under U.S.S.G.

On August  9,  1995,  Maria\r\n\nMulinelli-Navas \r                         (\"Mulinel\r                                 li\") was charged with conspiracy to commit\r\n\nbank  fraud,  in violation  of  18  U.S.C. S  371,  making  false\r\n\nstatements  to a  federally  insured  financial  institution,  in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. S 1014, and bank fraud, in violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1344.   On December 21, 1995,  a jury returned a  guilty\r\n\nverdict on  all counts and she  was subsequently sentenced to  27\r\n\nmonths for each count, to be served concurrently, and three years\r\n\nsupervised  release.   Mulinelli  appeals only  her  convictions,\r\n\nclaiming that: (1) the district court's limitation on her  cross-\r\n\nexamination \r                     of her accomplices deprived her of her Sixth Amendment\r\n\nright  to  confrontation;  (2)  the  district  court  abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion  by not  allowing  Mulinelli  to  introduce  extrinsic\r\n\nevidence to impeach an accomplice; (3) the district court  abused\r\n\nits  discretion  by   admitting  into   evidence  an   improperly\r\n\nauthenticated summary  chart;  and  (4) the  district  court,  by\r\n\noverruling certain  objections, deprived  her of  the ability  to\r\n\npresent \r                 her \r                     defense \r                            to \r                               the jury.  For the reasons stated herein, we\r\n\nvacate Mulinelli's conviction and sentence on Counts V and VI and\r\n\naffirm as to all other issues.\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The \r                       jury \r                            could \r                                 have \r                                      found the following facts.  Mulinelli\r\n\nwas \r             Senior \r                    Vice President of First Federal Savings Bank, in charge\r\n\nof \r            car \r                loans.  Between 1985 and 1988, First Federal approved loans\r\n\nto two dealers who, in fact, neither bought nor sold the cars for\r\n\nwhich the  loans were made.   Furthermore,  these loans  involved\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nirregular financing, with low monthly payments and large  balloon\r\n\npayments at the end of one year.\r\n\n          The indictment  charged  Mulinelli with  conspiring  to\r\n\napprove \r                 fraudulent loans of $25,000 in 1985 and $273,000 from 1987\r\n\nto 1988 to Lopez, and $130,000 in June 1988 to Exposito.\r\n\n          At trial, the two  auto dealers testified.  One of  the\r\n\nauto \r              dealers, Luis Lopez-Mendoza (\"Lopez\"), President and owner of\r\n\nCordillera \r                    Auto, \r                         testified that he was approached by Mulinelli with\r\n\na request that he loan her  money.  In response to his  statement\r\n\nthat he  was not  in  the business  of lending  money,  Mulinelli\r\n\nsuggested \r                   a \r                     financing scheme by which Lopez would apply for a loan\r\n\non a  non-existent car.    According to  the loan  documents  and\r\n\ndisbursement  check,  the loan  was  taken  out in  the  name  of\r\n\nMulinelli's daughter  for a Volvo  station wagon  that was  never\r\n\nactually purchased.   They carried out the scheme she  described:\r\n\nupon receiving the loan check, he deposited the amount, then gave\r\n\nMulinelli a  $25,000 loan  from  cash on  hand at  his  business.\r\n\nMulinelli's daughter testified that she signed for a $25,000 loan\r\n\nto \r            purchase \r                     a family car that Mulinelli put in the daughter's name\r\n\nbecause \r                 of \r                    credit problems.  She testified that the handwriting on\r\n\nthe sales contract \"looked like my mother's.\"\r\n\n          In 1985,  Lopez  approached Mulinelli  about  obtaining\r\n\nfinancing of a type not available from First Federal.   Mulinelli\r\n\nsuggested a  similar scheme,  whereby Lopez  would execute  blank\r\n\ncontracts, stamped  with the seal  of Cordillera  Auto and  would\r\n\ndeliver the blank documents to Mulinelli for her approval.  Lopez\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nused these loans to  finance cars he was purchasing for  eventual\r\n\nresale.  A similar strategy was used to provide loans to  another\r\n\ndealer, \r                 Lazaro Exposito Cordoves (\"Exposito\"), President of Caguas\r\n\nAuto \r              Wholesale. \r                          \r                         Both \r                              Lopez and Exposito testified that they signed\r\n\nand  sealed blank  forms  for  car sales  contracts,  which  they\r\n\ndelivered to the bank for completion.\r\n\n          During his testimony, Lopez recanted statements made in\r\n\nan earlier  affidavit,  in which  he  denied that  Mulinelli  had\r\n\nknowledge of the  fraud.  He testified  that he lied because  the\r\n\nattorney to whom he made the affidavit told him, before  starting\r\n\nthe tape recorder,  that the attorney's purpose was to  \"protect\"\r\n\nMulinelli.  The defense sought to introduce the testimony of  the\r\n\nattorney regarding whether he actually stated that the purpose of\r\n\nhis \r             meeting \r                     with \r                         Lopez \r                               was to protect Mulinelli.  After hearing the\r\n\nattorney's \r                    proposed testimony out of the presence of the jury, the\r\n\ntrial court upheld the prosecution's objection that his testimony\r\n\nwas  extrinsic evidence  on a  \"collateral matter\"  and thus  was\r\n\ninadmissible.\r\n\n          Exposito \r                            testified \r                                     about \r                                           two loans made in 1988 to Caguas\r\n\nAuto Wholesale,  purportedly to  finance purchases  for a  rental\r\n\nbusiness  (\"Zoom\") that  Exposito  never established.    Exposito\r\n\napproached Mulinelli and informed her that he needed money.   She\r\n\ntold \r              him \r                  to \r                     bring her contracts and bills of sale for cars that he\r\n\nwould \r               sell \r                    from his dealership to this sham car rental business so\r\n\nthat she could approve loans  for their purchase.  For the  first\r\n\nloan, \r               Mulinelli requested that Exposito provide her with a bill of\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nsale and a loan application  reflecting the sale of cars that  he\r\n\nnever purchased.  Two  hours after he delivered the documents  to\r\n\nMulinelli, the loan was approved  and he received a check in  the\r\n\namount \r                of \r                   $60,000.  Exposito used the funds to buy other cars that\r\n\nwere not pledged as collateral for the loan.  He also signed  and\r\n\nsealed blank  sales  contracts  and delivered  them  directly  to\r\n\nMulinelli.   Exposito  testified  that Mulinelli  knew  the  cars\r\n\nreferred \r                  to \r                     in \r                       the \r                           two \r                               loan applications were not in Puerto Rico at\r\n\nthe time the  loans were  made and that  he had  no intention  of\r\n\nselling the cars to Zoom but  rather that he intended to use  the\r\n\nmoney \r               to \r                  buy \r                      other cars.  Moreover, Mulinelli determined the terms\r\n\nof \r            these \r                  loans, \r                        which \r                              included large balloon payments at the end of\r\n\nthe year.  In return for her assistance with the loans, he made a\r\n\npersonal \r                  loan to Mulinelli for $5,000 and did some personal favors\r\n\nfor her and her family.\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION\r\n\nI.        The district court's  limitation of Mulinelli's  cross-\r\n          examination of Lopez and Exposito\r\n\n          At  trial,  Mulinelli's  counsel  cross-examined  Lopez\r\n\nregarding the  benefits  and conditions  of his  plea  agreement.\r\n\nMulinelli \r                   entered into evidence the information by which Lopez was\r\n\ncharged and  the plea  agreement under  which he  pled guilty  to\r\n\nconspiracy \r                    to \r                      commit \r                             bank fraud.  Mulinelli elicited testimony from\r\n\nLopez \r               that \r                    he was not and would not be charged with bank fraud, in\r\n\naddition to his conspiracy charge, as Mulinelli had been charged.\r\n\nLopez also testified that, as part of his plea bargain agreement,\r\n\nthe  United States  Attorney would  make a  recommendation for  a\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nreduction in his sentence.  The district court, however, cut  off\r\n\nMulinelli's counsel when on several occasions he tried to  elicit\r\n\ntestimony \r                   from \r                       Lopez \r                             regarding the possible sentence he faced.  The\r\n\ndistrict court noted that matters of sentencing were in the sound\r\n\ndiscretion of  the  district court  judge  who was  scheduled  to\r\n\nsentence Lopez.\r\n\n          Mulinelli  elicited  similar  testimony  from  Exposito\r\n\nregarding the substance of the plea agreement -- that he expected\r\n\nthe United  States  Attorney to  make  a recommendation  for  the\r\n\ndistrict court's consideration in his sentencing, that he was not\r\n\ncharged with  bank fraud, but only  with conspiracy and making  a\r\n\nfalse statement to a financial institution, and that he would not\r\n\nbe \r            charged \r                    with \r                        any \r                            other crimes.  Again, the district court barred\r\n\nMulinelli from  eliciting testimony regarding  the nature of  the\r\n\nsentence Exposito expected to receive.\r\n\n          Mulinelli argues on  appeal that  the district  court's\r\n\nlimitation  on  her  cross-examination  regarding  the  potential\r\n\nsentence \r                  that \r                      both \r                           accomplices faced before and after entering into\r\n\nthe plea agreements so interfered with her ability to effectively\r\n\ncross-examine the witnesses that it violated her Sixth  Amendment\r\n\nright to confrontation.\r\n\n          The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \"[i]n all  criminal\r\n\nprosecutions,  the accused  shall enjoy  the right  . .  . to  be\r\n\nconfronted \r                    with \r                        the \r                            witnesses against him.\"  U.S. Const. amend.

The jury could infer from the\r\n\ncircumstances that the accomplices had avoided being charged with\r\n\noffenses  carrying  greater   sentences  by  testifying  in   the\r\n\ngovernment's  case.   Mulinelli  was  able,  through  her  cross-\r\n\nexamination,  to  expose  the  biases  and  motivations  of   the\r\n\naccomplices to favor the government and, once this threshold  was\r\n\nmet, \r              the \r                  district court's limitation was not improper.  As we find\r\n\nthat \r              the \r                  jury \r                      had \r                          before \r                                 it sufficient information on which to make\r\n\na \r           discriminating appraisal of the accomplices' motives and biases,\r\n\nwe find no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          Additionally,  Mulinelli's  counsel  sought  to  elicit\r\n\nsentencing \r                    information regarding the charges the accomplices faced\r\n\nand  avoided by  pleading guilty  to conspiracy.   Had  Mulinelli\r\n\nsuccessfully elicited this information, the potential  punishment\r\n\nshe \r             faced, \r                    should the jury find her guilty, would have been before\r\n\nthe \r             jury. \r                    \r                    The actions taken by the district court to prevent this\r\n\ninformation, \r                      which could confuse the issues presented to the jury,\r\n\nfrom  reaching the jury  were thus entirely  proper.

Leading questions\r\n\n          During the government's direct examination of Exposito,\r\n\nMulinelli's counsel repeatedly objected to the leading nature  of\r\n\nthe government's questions.  Mulinelli restates the objection  on\r\n\nappeal, claiming that Exposito was not adverse or hostile to  the\r\n\nprosecution  so as  to warrant  leading questions,  and that  the\r\n\ncourt's overruling this objection limited her ability to properly\r\n\ncross-examine  Exposito  because  the  prosecution,  rather  than\r\n\nExposito, was testifying.\r\n\n          Federal Rule of Evidence 611(c) provides:\r\n\n          Leading questions should  not be used on  the\r\n          direct examination of a witness except as may\r\n          be   necessary  to   develop   the   witness'\r\n          testimony.

Our review of the transcript reveals\r\n\na witness  who was, at  times, unresponsive or  showed a lack  of\r\n\nunderstanding.   The prosecutor's  use of  leading questions  was\r\n\nlimited to questions intended to  lay a foundation for a line  of\r\n\n                              -15-\r\r\n\nquestioning \r                     or \r                        to \r                          assist \r                                 in developing coherent testimony.  We find\r\n\nthat \r              such \r                   questions were not improper and the district court acted\r\n\nwithin its discretion when it allowed this manner of questioning.\r\n\nSee id. at 1025-26.\r\n\n          Mulinelli  also  suggests   that  the  district   court\r\n\nimproperly questioned  Exposito during  his testimony.   The  few\r\n\noccasions  that Mulinelli points  to do not  suggest an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion. \r                      \r                      See United States v.

The questions posed by  the judge \"served to . .  .\r\n\nclarify lines of inquiry  or develop the witness's answer.   Such\r\n\nconduct is well within the court's discretion.\"  Id.\r\n\n          D.   Limiting cross-examination as irrelevant\r\n\n          In  her  attack on  the  prosecutor's  use  of  leading\r\n\nquestions, Mulinelli juxtaposes the leeway granted the prosecutor\r\n\nwith \r              the \r                  district court's curtailment of a line of questioning she\r\n\nsought  to pursue.   Mulinelli argues that  her defense was  that\r\n\nExposito was brought to the bank by one of the bank officers, who\r\n\nvouched for Exposito as  creditworthy, and that, thus,  Mulinelli\r\n\nrelied on the bank officer's support of Exposito.  Because of her\r\n\nreliance,  Mulinelli  argues,  she was  duped  by  the  two  into\r\n\nunknowingly \r                     providing \r                              fraudulent bank loans to Exposito.  Mulinelli\r\n\nargues \r                on \r                   appeal that she presented this theory to the jury in her\r\n\nopening statement, but  was unable, due  to the district  court's\r\n\nlimitation  on her  cross-examination  of Exposito,  to  properly\r\n\npresent \r                 the \r                     theory during the course of the trial.  The references\r\n\n                              -16-\r\r\n\nto this  defense during her  opening statement  consisted of  the\r\n\nfollowing, separated by several pages of transcript.\r\n\n          The evidence will  show that Lazaro  Exposito\r\n          was brought to the bank by one of the highest\r\n          officers of the bank.  He did not come in  by\r\n          the regular channels.  And the documents that\r\n          were presented  to  the car  department  were\r\n          brought by this highest officer of the  bank.\r\n          The \r                       evidence \r                                will show that he was recommended\r\n          by this highest officer  of the bank, and  he\r\n          started to buy repossessed automobiles, which\r\n          was a department, an office under [Mulinelli]\r\n          in \r                      the \r                          department of car loan that was managed\r\n          or \r                      directed \r                               by a man named Otero.   Of course,\r\n          all   under  the   general   supervision   of\r\n          Mulinelli.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n          And finally, I think that the evidence,  when\r\n          you hear  it  in its  totality, you  will  be\r\n          convinced that there  is a conspiracy of  two\r\n          crooks against Maria Mulinelli.\r\n\nTrial Transcript, Dec. 18, 1995, at 26-27, 30.\r\n\n          During Mulinelli's  cross-examination of Exposito,  the\r\n\nfollowing interchange took place:\r\n\n            Q.

He  highly\r\n          recommended  [Exposito],   said  he  had   an\r\n          excellent credit, and  that's how  he got  --\r\n          that's how they trusted him.\r\n\n            THE COURT:   It is total[ly] irrelevant  to\r\n          the  issues of  this case.   This  is a  very\r\n          discreet, \r                             unique, well-defined conduct that is\r\n          the object of these charges.

In this\r\n\ncase, we find that the district court exceeded the boundaries  of\r\n\nits power  and deprived Mulinelli of  her ability to present  her\r\n\ntheory of defense to the jury.\r\n\n          The information presented  by Mulinelli in her  opening\r\n\nstatement and  her proffer adequately  indicated to the  district\r\n\ncourt \r               the \r                   theory \r                         of \r                            defense she wanted to pursue.  She mentioned in\r\n\nher  opening statement  that \"[t]he  evidence will  show that  he\r\n\n(Exposito) was recommended by this highest officer of the  bank,\"\r\n\nwhich \r               suggests that the person with whom Exposito might have acted\r\n\nto defraud the  bank was not Mulinelli,  but Alcocer, and at  the\r\n\nleast that  Mulinelli  was influenced  by the  recommendation  of\r\n\nAlcocer.  Such a  theory of defense might suggest that,  although\r\n\nMulinelli  may  have  been  negligent  in  relying  on  Alcocer's\r\n\nrecommendation and not  questioning Exposito's loan  applications\r\n\nmore  closely than she  did, she had  no knowledge of  Exposito's\r\n\nfraudulent \r                    transactions. \r                                  The information presented to the district\r\n\ncourt adequately  apprised  the court  of  the relevance  of  the\r\n\nchannels \r                  through \r                         which \r                               Exposito's loans were brought to Mulinelli's\r\n\nattention, and the court, by foreclosing the introduction of  any\r\n\ntestimony  to support  Mulinelli's  theory of  defense,  violated\r\n\nMulinelli's \r                     Sixth \r                          Amendment right to confrontation.

Her original base offense level was  six,\r\nincreased \r                   eight levels under U.S.S.G. 2F1.1(b)(1) because the loss\r\nwas \r             determined \r                        to \r                          be \r                             $349,000.  The level was further increased two\r\nlevels in  accordance  with U.S.S.G.  S 2F1.1(b)(2)  because  the\r\noffense involved  more than minimal  planning and  two levels  in\r\naccordance with  U.S.S.G.  S  3B1.3 because  Mulinelli  abused  a\r\nposition \r                  of \r                     trust.  Her sentence, based on these calculations, was\r\n27 months  for all six  counts, to be  served concurrently.
