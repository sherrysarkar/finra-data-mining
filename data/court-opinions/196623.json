The  district court  denied\r\n\nEcker's  motion to  dismiss the  indictment.   Ecker appeals.\r\n\nBecause neither the relevant statutes nor caselaw require the\r\n\ndismissal of the indictment, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          In   November  1989,  Ecker  was  indicted  in  the\r\n\nDistrict of  Massachusetts for possession  of a firearm  by a\r\n\nfelon in violation  of 18 U.S.C.   922(g).   Ecker has  prior\r\n\nconvictions for  assault with  a weapon, arson,  breaking and\r\n\nentering, and burglary, and is therefore subject to the Armed\r\n\nCareer  Criminal Act,  18 U.S.C.    924(e); if  convicted, he\r\n\nfaces  a  mandatory minimum  prison  term  of fifteen  years.\r\n\nAfter federal authorities  found that Ecker's  mental illness\r\n\nrendered him incompetent to stand trial  and dangerous to the\r\n\npublic, he  was  committed to  the  custody of  the  Attorney\r\n\nGeneral  for hospitalization  under 18  U.S.C.    4246.   Now\r\n\nEcker seeks to dismiss the indictment charging him as a felon\r\n\nin possession.\r\n\nA.  Ecker's History in Federal Psychiatric Facilities\r                                                                 \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Ecker's history in  federal psychiatric  facilities\r\n\nis  long and twisted;  full detail is  unnecessary to resolve\r\n\nthe  issue before  us, so  we summarize.   From  January 1990\r\n\nthrough March  1993,  federal  authorities,  pursuant  to  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   4241(d), conducted  seven competency evaluations  of\r\n\nEcker.  After five of these, Ecker was found incompetent, and\r\n\non  two occasions he was found competent.  Authorities at one\r\n\npoint reported that  Ecker \"displayed excellent knowledge  of\r\n\nthe federal mental health statutes,\" and concerns were raised\r\n\nthat  his  mental  health  problems were  of  a  questionable\r\n\nnature.     In  March  1993,  federal  authorities  concluded\r\n\n\"finally\"  that Ecker was not competent for trial and that it\r\n\nwas unlikely  that he  would  regain competency  in the  near\r\n\nfuture.\r\n\n          The United States  District Court for the  District\r\n\nof Massachusetts, where the  indictment was (and is) pending,\r\n\ndetermined that there was no likelihood of  trial and ordered\r\n\nthe Federal  Medical Center  in  Rochester, Minnesota  (\"FMC-\r\n\nRochester\"),  to  determine  if   Ecker  was  dangerous   and\r\n\ntherefore subject to indefinite  commitment under 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n4246.     The  director  of  FMC-Rochester   did  find  Ecker\r\n\ndangerous, and the United States Attorney for the District of\r\n\nMinnesota  accordingly  instituted commitment  proceedings in\r\n\nthe  United  States  District   Court  for  the  District  of\r\n\nMinnesota.   In  October 1993,  the Minnesota  district court\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nordered  Ecker  committed  to  the custody  of  the  Attorney\r\n\nGeneral  under section 4246, and the Court of Appeals for the\r\n\nEighth Circuit  affirmed.   United States  v. Ecker,  30 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n966, 971 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 679 (1994).\r                                             \r\n\n          In October  1994, the staff at  the Federal Medical\r\n\nCenter  in  Springfield, Missouri  (\"FMC-Springfield\"), where\r\n\nEcker  is currently  in custody,  filed an  annual  report of\r\n\nEcker's mental condition as required by 18  U.S.C.   4247(e).\r\n\nThe report  stated that Ecker  was \"generally able  to answer\r\n\nthe  panel's  questions in  a  logical,  coherent, and  goal-\r\n\ndirected manner.\"  It went on, however, to conclude that \"Mr.\r\n\nEcker  is  currently a  substantial  risk  to others  or  the\r\n\nproperty  of  others  due  to  mental  illness.\"    The civil\r\n\ncommitment  statute,  18  U.S.C.     4246,  requires  Federal\r\n\nauthorities   to   place  Ecker   in  an   appropriate  state\r\n\ninstitution  in his home  state, Massachusetts,  if possible.\r\n\nOfficials  at  FMC-Springfield,   however,  determined   that\r\n\nMassachusetts would  not accept Ecker in  a state institution\r\n\nbecause of the  pendency of  the federal  indictment.   Thus,\r\n\nEcker remains hospitalized at FMC-Springfield.\r\n\nB.  The District Court Order on Ecker's Motion to Dismiss\r                                                                     \r\n\n          In the district  court, Ecker advanced two  grounds\r\n\nfor dismissal  of the indictment.   First, he  contended that\r\n\nthe statute under which  he was committed, 18 U.S.C.    4246,\r\n\nrequires,  upon commitment, dismissal of pending charges upon\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncommitment.  Second,  he asserted  that the  pendency of  the\r\n\nindictment interfered  with his purported right  to be placed\r\n\nin a state institution, depriving Ecker of his constitutional\r\n\nright to due process.  \r\n\n          The district court denied Ecker's motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe indictment,  holding that the commitment  statute did not\r\n\nrequire dismissal  of the indictment, finding  no support for\r\n\nEcker's  statutory  argument in  the statute's  language, its\r\n\nlegislative history,  or in caselaw.  The court also rejected\r\n\nEcker's due  process argument, concluding  that \"the  statute\r\n\ncannot be fairly read to confer a liberty interest, protected\r\n\nby  the  Due Process  Clause of  the  Fifth Amendment  of the\r\n\nUnited  States Constitution,  in being  committed to  a state\r\n\ninstitution rather  than a `suitable facility'  chosen by the\r\n\nAttorney General.\"\r\n\nC.  Ecker's Appeal\r                              \r\n\n          Ecker  appeals the  district court's  order denying\r\n\nhis  motion to  dismiss  the indictment,  advancing only  the\r\n\nstatutory argument that  18 U.S.C.     4241 and 4246  require\r\n\ndismissal.   Ecker has  abandoned the argument  he made below\r\n\nthat the pendency of the  indictment violates his due process\r\n\nrights.   See United States v.  Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,  17 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.)

Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          Ecker, at  the outset, concedes that  \"[n]either 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   42411 nor  18 U.S.C.   42462 addresses  what happens\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section  4241  provides  procedures for  evaluation  of a\r\ndefendant's competency  to stand trial.   If the  court finds\r\nthe  defendant incompetent  after an  psychiatric examination\r\nand a hearing, the court commits the defendant to the custody\r\nof  the   Attorney  General.    The   Attorney  General  then\r\nhospitalizes  the  defendant  for   up  to  four  months  \"to\r\ndetermine whether there is  a substantial probability that in\r\nthe foreseeable future he will attain the  capacity to permit\r\nthe  trial  to  proceed.\"    The  Attorney  General  may also\r\nhospitalize the defendant for an \"additional reasonable time\"\r\nbeyond  four   months  if  the  court   finds  a  substantial\r\nprobability  that  competency  will  be  regained.    If  the\r\ndefendant  remains  incompetent  at  the end  of  those  time\r\nperiods,  the  defendant   is  subject   to  commitment   for\r\ndangerousness  under  18 U.S.C.     4246.   If  not committed\r\nthereunder, the defendant is released.  \r\n          Section 4241 makes no  reference to the pendency or\r\ndismissal of the indictment.\r\n\n2.  Section   4246   provides   for   the    commitment   and\r\nhospitalization  of  a dangerous  person  \"whose  sentence is\r\nabout to expire,  or who has been committed to the custody of\r\nthe Attorney  General pursuant to section  4241(d) [i.e., due\r\nto incompetency to stand trial], or against whom all criminal\r\ncharges have been dismissed solely for reasons related to the\r\nmental  condition  of the  person.\"    Upon certification  of\r\ndangerousness by  the director of the  hospital facility, the\r\ncourt  conducts a hearing, and shall commit to the custody of\r\nthe Attorney General a  person \"suffering from mental disease\r\nor  defect as a  result of which  his release  would create a\r\nsubstantial  risk  of  bodily  injury to  another  person  or\r\nserious damage to  property of another.\"  Such  commitment is\r\nof indefinite  duration, but  the Attorney General  must make\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nto a pending indictment when a  defendant is determined under\r\n\nsection  4241 to be incompetent to stand trial and is subject\r\n\nto indefinite  civil commitment  under section 4246.\"3   That\r\n\nconcession  is  virtually dispositive  of  Ecker's appeal  --\r\n\nthere  is nothing  in  the statute's  language that  requires\r\n\ndismissal of a pending indictment.  The statutory  silence is\r\n\nnot surprising.   Congress, we have little doubt, intended to\r\n\nleave the  decision about the disposition  of pending charges\r\n\nto the case-by-case discretion of the prosecutors.\r\n\nA.  Ecker's Arguments\r                                 \r\n\n          Although  conceding  that  the  statute  is silent,\r\n\nEcker  argues that  the structure  of the  relevant statutes,\r\n\ntheir  legislative  history,  and   the  caselaw  compel  the\r\n\nconclusion that  Congress intended to require  dismissal of a\r\n\npending indictment upon commitment.  We disagree, and address\r\n\neach of  Ecker's arguments  in turn,  explaining why we  find\r\n\nthem unpersuasive.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nreasonable  efforts place the person in  the custody and care\r\nof the state in which the person is domiciled.\r\n          Although  section  4246  recognizes  that  criminal\r\ncharges  may  be  dismissed  because  of  a  person's  mental\r\nillness, there  is  nothing in  the language  of the  statute\r\nrequiring such dismissal.\r\n\n3.  Nor do the statutes address the  pendency or dismissal of\r\nan  indictment of  a  defendant  found long-term  incompetent\r\nunder  section 4241,  but not  found dangerous  under section\r\n4246.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          First, Ecker asserts that section 4246 applies only\r                      \r\n\nto individuals \"who no longer realistically can be considered\r\n\nto be awaiting  trial because there is  little possibility of\r\n\ntheir  regaining  competency,\"   quoting  United  States   v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nCharters, 829 F.2d  479, 485 (4th Cir.  1987) (not addressing\r                    \r\n\ndismissal  of  indictment), reh'g,  863  F.2d  302 (4th  Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1988),  cert.  denied, 494  U.S.  1016  (1990).    From  that\r                                 \r\n\npremise, Ecker concludes that \"Congress plainly intended that\r\n\nthe liberty of such a person would be  restricted only by the\r\n\nrequirements  of  section  4246,  not  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\ncontinued pendency of an indictment.\"\r\n\n          That argument  is unconvincing.  Ecker's liberty is\r\n\nnot restricted by the pendency of the indictment, but  rather\r\n\nby section 4246 (which  authorizes his hospitalization).  The\r\n\nonly  effect  that  the  pending indictment  has  on  Ecker's\r\n\n\"liberty\"  results  from  a  Massachusetts  state policy4  of\r\n\nrefusing  to accept  mentally ill  federal detainees  who are\r\n\nsubject to a pending federal indictment.  We fail to see  how\r\n\nthat  state policy, or its effect on Ecker, can indicate that\r\n\nCongress intended  section 4246  to require dismissal  of any\r\n\npending indictment.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The  record  and  the  parties' briefs  do  not  indicate\r\nwhether this \"policy\" is based on statute, regulation, or the\r\ndiscretion  of state  officials.   The  district judge  below\r\nassumed, without so finding,  that state officials refused to\r\naccept Ecker, but the court based that assumption \"on hearsay\r\nand not on competent evidence.\"\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Ecker's  second  argument  is  that   there  is  no\r\n\nstatutory mechanism to revisit the issue of competency once a\r\n\ndefendant  is  committed  as  dangerous  under  section 4246.\r\n\nWhile recognizing that  section 4247 requires  annual reports\r\n\non the \"mental condition\" of a person committed under section\r\n\n4246, he asserts that  such reports address dangerousness and\r                                                                     \r\n\nnot  competency to  stand trial.   That  argument  finds some\r                           \r\n\nsupport  in the October  1994 annual  report on  Ecker, which\r\n\nconcluded that he was  still dangerous without addressing his\r\n\ncompetency for trial on the pending indictment.  Ecker argues\r\n\nthat nothing in this  statutory scheme suggests that Congress\r\n\nenvisioned further competency determinations once a defendant\r\n\nis indefinitely  committed as  dangerous under  section 4246.\r\n\nThis \"unexplained gap,\" he  contends, indicates that Congress\r\n\nmust  have  intended  that  a  pending  indictment  would  be\r\n\ndismissed  once   a   defendant  has   been   committed   for\r\n\ndangerousness.\r\n\n          We  agree  that  the  statute  does  not  expressly\r\n\naddress the  reevaluation of trial competency  of a defendant\r\n\ncommitted as dangerous under section 4246.  The statute does,\r\n\nhowever, provide for annual  reports by the facility director\r\n\n\"concerning the mental condition of the person and containing\r\n\nrecommendations    for   the    need   for    his   continued\r\n\nhospitalization.\"   18  U.S.C.    4247(e)(1)(B).   This broad\r\n\nrequirement of a report on \"mental condition\" would seemingly\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nallow the facility  director to  report to the  court that  a\r\n\ndefendant has regained competency.   Moreover, a defendant or\r\n\nhis  counsel may bring any relevant change in condition, or a\r\n\nrequest  for  release, to  the  court's  attention through  a\r\n\nmotion for a hearing under section 4247(h).\r\n\n          In  any  event,  it is  far  too  great  a leap  to\r\n\nconclude  from this  asserted  shortcoming  in the  statutory\r\n\nscheme that Congress intended to  require the dismissal of  a\r\n\npending indictment  once a  defendant has been  committed for\r\n\ndangerousness.  Congress could plausibly have expected that a\r\n\nprosecutor bent  on trying  a committed person  would file  a\r\n\nmotion   under  section   4241  for   a  new   evaluation  of\r\n\ncompetency.5   On the other hand, the asserted \"gap\" might be\r\n\nthe result of simple oversight  or poor draftsmanship, due in\r\n\npart,  perhaps,  to  an  expectation  that  prosecutors  will\r\n\nusually  exercise their  discretion  to  dismiss  indictments\r\n\nagainst persons committed under section 4246.  An appropriate\r\n\njudicial response  to this statutory shortcoming  would be to\r\n\norder further competency reevaluations if requested by either\r\n\nthe  government  or  a  defendant,  rather  than  a  judicial\r\n\nrewriting  of   the  statute  to  require   dismissal  of  an\r\n\nindictment that the prosecutor seeks to preserve.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Section  4241 provides  in  relevant part:  \"At any  time\r\nafter the commencement  of a prosecution  for an offense  and\r\nprior to  the sentencing of  the defendant, the  defendant or\r\nthe  attorney  for the  Government may  file  a motion  for a\r\nhearing to determine the mental competency of the defendant.\"\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          The  third  argument  advanced  by  Ecker  is  more\r\n\ndifficult to  decipher than  the preceding two.   He  asserts\r\n\nthat section  4246 was \"clearly  designed\" to deal  only with\r\n\npersons  about  to  be  released from  the  federal  criminal\r\n\njustice  system, and  therefore Congress  must  have intended\r\n\nthat  charges be dropped when a  defendant is committed under\r\n\nsection  4246.   Ecker  demonstrates this  \"clear design\"  by\r\n\npointing out  that  two of  the three  categories of  persons\r\n\ncovered  by section  4246 (those  whose sentence is  about to\r\n\nexpire and those against whom all charges have been dismissed\r\n\nbecause  of   mental  illness)  are  no   longer  subject  to\r\n\npunishment and  would be released  but for the  provisions of\r\n\nsection 4246.  Then  Ecker states that \"it would  be strange,\r\n\nindeed, to  include in the same  statute, without explanation\r\n\nor separate  procedures, a group  of people still  subject to\r\n\nindictment and trial.\"  It is more plausible, he argues, that\r\n\nthose defendants  subject to  section 4246 after  being found\r\n\nincompetent  under section  4241  \"would also  be subject  to\r\n\nrelease due to the dismissal of the charges.\"  \r\n\n          While  it is  perhaps  odd that  the statute  lacks\r\n\nexpress  procedures  for  reevaluating the  competency  of  a\r\n\nperson  committed under  section 4246, it  would be  far more\r\n\n\"strange\"   for  Congress  to   have  intended   a  statutory\r\n\nrequirement that an indictment be dismissed automatically  on\r\n\ncommitment,   yet  never  mention  that  requirement  in  the\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nstatute.   Again, all that  Ecker has done  is point  to some\r\n\nambiguities  in certain procedural  aspects of  section 4246,\r\n\nand  then  attempt to  bootstrap  those  ambiguities into  an\r\n\nimplied   requirement  that  a  pending  indictment  must  be\r\n\ndismissedwhenever thatstatute isinvoked. We arenot persuaded.\r\n\n          As further support for  his third argument (that it\r\n\nwould  be  \"strange\" if  the  statute  did  not  require  the\r\n\ndismissal  of  an  indictment),   Ecker  directs  us  to  the\r\n\nstatute's legislative history.  We are reluctant to take that\r\n\ndirection,  because a  court  \"should resort  to  legislative\r\n\nhistory . . . [only] when the words of a statute give rise to\r\n\nambiguity   or    when   they   lead   to   an   unreasonable\r\n\ninterpretation.\"   United States v. O'Neil, 11  F.3d 292, 297\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1993).  The words of the statutes at issue here do\r\n\nneither.   In  an  abundance  of caution,  however,  we  have\r\n\nreviewed  the legislative history cited  by Ecker and find it\r\n\nto  contain  nothing  that  would lead  us  to  conclude that\r\n\nCongress intended  the statute to require,  sub silentio, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ndismissal of pending charges.

As the Supreme Court remarked in construing the federal\r\n\ncivil commitment statute  that preceded  the current  section\r\n\n4246,  \"this is a case for applying the canon of construction\r\n\nof  the  wag  who  said,  when  the  legislative  history  is\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndoubtful, go to  the statute.\"   Greenwood v. United  States,\r                                                                        \r\n\n350 U.S. 366, 374 (1956).\r\n\n          As a fourth argument, and  as support for the first\r\n\nthree,  Ecker  quotes the  Eighth  Circuit's  opinion in  his\r\n\nearlier  appeal  of his  commitment.    In rejecting  Ecker's\r\n\nargument that it was unreasonable to hold him for nearly four\r\n\nyears before  committing him  under section 4246,  the Eighth\r\n\nCircuit stated that: \"At all times, Ecker remained subject to\r\n\ncriminal process calling for  a mandatory minimum sentence of\r\n\nfifteen years imprisonment.   He remained subject to possible\r                                                                         \r\n\ntrial  until the final judicial determination of incompetency\r                                                                         \r\n\non April 16, 1993.\"  Ecker, 30 F.3d at  969 (emphasis added).\r                                      \r\n\nThe  Eighth  Circuit, however,  was  not  concerned with  the\r\n\ndismissal or validity of the indictment after Ecker's section\r\n\n4246  commitment; the  issue  it faced  was  the duration  of\r\n\nEcker's  detention  for  determination  of  competency  under\r\n\nsection 4241, and whether that lengthy confinement  was a due\r\n\nprocess  violation.   The  Eighth Circuit  had  no reason  to\r\n\nconsider whether  the indictment  remained valid after  Ecker\r\n\nwas  committed under  section 4246;  if the  quoted statement\r\n\naddresses that question at all, it is mere dictum.\r\n\n          Finally Ecker points out that  the executive branch\r\n\nof the federal government is in a \"peculiar position\" because\r\n\nsection  4246  requires the  Attorney  General  to \"make  all\r\n\nreasonable efforts\"  to place  Ecker in a  state institution,\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nbut the United States Attorney in Massachusetts is preventing\r\n\nthat  placement by not  dropping the indictment.   Ecker adds\r\n\nthat  \"the continued  validity  of the  indictment interferes\r\n\nwith defendant's  statutory right to state  placement.\"  This\r\n\nargument invites a number of  obvious rejoinders.  First, the\r\n\ngovernment  has  the  discretion  to  solve  the  dilemma  by\r\n\ndismissing the charges.  Second, the Attorney General is only\r\n\nrequired to make \"reasonable efforts\" to place Ecker in state\r\n\ncare.  The Massachusetts  policy denying placement of persons\r\n\nunder federal  indictment prevents Ecker's  placement, and we\r\n\nwould  not  conclude  (nor  does  Ecker  argue)  that  it  is\r\n\n\"unreasonable\" not to drop the charges in order to facilitate\r\n\nplacement.   Third, while the  statute imposes a  duty on the\r\n\nAttorney General to attempt to place Ecker with the state, we\r\n\ndo not conclude that it endows Ecker with a \"right\"  to state\r\n\nplacement.\r\n\n          None of  Ecker's  statutory arguments  persuade  us\r\n\nthat Congress  intended sections 4241 and 4246 to require sub\r                                                                         \r\n\nsilentio the dismissal of a pending indictment.\r                    \r\n\nB.  Caselaw\r                       \r\n\n          Our conclusion  is not  altered by our  analysis of\r\n\nthe few  relevant cases.  The district  court's order denying\r\n\nEcker's motion  to dismiss the indictment  is consistent with\r\n\nthe Supreme  Court's decision in Greenwood  v. United States,\r                                                                        \r\n\n350 U.S. 366 (1956).  The Court in Greenwood stated that \"the\r                                                        \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\npending  indictment  persists\" even  after the  defendant has\r\n\nbeen  found  unlikely  to  recover competency  and  has  been\r\n\ncommitted as dangerous.  Id. at 375.\r                                        \r\n\n          Although   Greenwood  was  not  decided  under  the\r                                          \r\n\ncurrent  statutory scheme,  we  believe that  the holding  is\r\n\nequally  valid under the new scheme.  The prior statutes were\r\n\nstrikingly  similar  to  the   current  ones.    The  primary\r\n\ndifference  relevant to this  appeal is  that the  old scheme\r\n\nauthorized detention  of an incompetent  indefinitely, \"until\r\n\nthe accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial.\"  Law\r\n\nof  Sept. 7,  1949,  ch. 535,    4246,  63  Stat. 686  (1949)\r\n\n(current version at 18  U.S.C.   4246).  The  present statute\r\n\nauthorizes  detention of  an incompetent  defendant only  for\r\n\nfour months,  and then for  an additional reasonable  time if\r\n\nthere  is  a  substantial  possibility that  he  will  regain\r\n\ncompetency.  This limitation  on the detention of incompetent\r\n\ndefendants was dictated by Jackson v. Indiana,  406 U.S. 715,\r                                                         \r\n\n738 (1972), which  struck down Indiana's  statute authorizing\r\n\nindefinite commitment  of incompetent defendants who were not\r\n\ndangerous as violative of due process.  See S. Rep. 225, 98th\r                                                       \r\n\nCong., 2d Sess.

Thus, under the new scheme,  an incompetent defendant\r\n\nmust be released  after four months if  recovery is unlikely,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   4241(d), or else committed indefinitely  if found\r\n\ndangerous,  18 U.S.C.     4246.   We  see nothing  about  the\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nstatutory changes  required by Jackson v.

Nor does the pendency\r\n\nof the  indictment beyond Ecker's commitment offend Jackson's\r                                                                       \r\n\nmandate  that a  permanently  incompetent  defendant must  be\r\n\nreleased or else civilly committed.

The Court stated in  Jackson v.

The Jackson Court\r                                                                   \r\ndid  not reach  the issue  of dismissal of  charges, however.\r\nId.    Ecker has  not advanced  either  of these  grounds for\r               \r\ndismissal of his  indictment.  Moreover,  we will not,  based\r\nsolely on the quoted dictum in Jackson, attribute to Congress\r                                                  \r\nan  unspoken intent to  require that a  pending indictment be\r\ndismissed.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nsection 4246,  rendering the  indictment irrelevant.   But in\r\n\nSahhar, the indictment was dismissed before the appellant was\r                                                       \r\n\ncommitted; the  issue was whether it  was unconstitutional to\r\n\ncommit a person  under section 4246  after detaining him  for\r\n\nlonger than  the maximum term  of imprisonment for  the crime\r\n\ncharged.  Id.  at 1028.   The  Ninth Circuit  held that  such\r                         \r\n\ncommitment was  constitutional given the federal  interest in\r\n\n\"control  and  treatment  of  dangerous  persons  within  the\r\n\nfederal criminal justice system\"; the fact that an indictment\r\n\nwas no longer  in place  was \"irrelevant\"  to that  interest.\r\n\nId. at  1029.   The district  court had  erred in  \"tying the\r               \r\n\ncontinuing validity of  appellant's non-punitive section 4246\r\n\ncommitment  to  the  punitive   objectives  of  the  original\r\n\ncriminal charge.\"  Id.   In other words, once  the indictment\r                                  \r\n\nwas  dismissed,  the only  remaining government  interest was\r\n\npublic safety, not the punishment of the offender.

Because neither the relevant statutes nor caselaw require the dismissal of the indictment, we affirm.I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, Ecker was indicted in the District of Massachusetts for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g).   Ecker has prior convictions for assault with a weapon, arson, breaking and entering, and burglary, and is therefore subject to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e);  if convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum prison term of fifteen years.   After federal authorities found that Ecker's mental illness rendered him incompetent to stand trial and dangerous to the public, he was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for hospitalization under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   Now Ecker seeks to dismiss the indictment charging him as a felon in possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>A. Ecker's History in Federal Psychiatric Facilities</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker's history in federal psychiatric facilities is long and twisted;  full detail is unnecessary to resolve the issue before us, so we summarize.   From January 1990 through March 1993, federal authorities, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241(d), conducted seven competency evaluations of Ecker.   After five of these, Ecker was found incompetent, and on two occasions he was found competent.   Authorities at one point reported that Ecker \"displayed excellent knowledge of the federal mental health statutes,\" and concerns were raised that his mental health problems were of a questionable nature.   In March 1993, federal authorities concluded \"finally\" that Ecker was not competent for trial and that it was unlikely that he would regain competency in the near future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where the indictment was (and is) pending, determined that there was no likelihood of trial and ordered the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota (\"FMC-Rochester\"), to determine if Ecker was dangerous and therefore subject to indefinite commitment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   The director of FMC-Rochester did find Ecker dangerous, and the United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota accordingly instituted commitment proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.   In October 1993, the Minnesota district court ordered Ecker committed to the custody of the Attorney General under section 4246, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  United States v. Ecker, 30 F.3d 966, 971 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 679, 130 L.Ed.2d 611 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1994, the staff at the Federal Medical Center in Springfield, Missouri (\"FMC-Springfield\"), where Ecker is currently in custody, filed an annual report of Ecker's mental condition as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4247(e).   The report stated that Ecker was \"generally able to answer the panel's questions in a logical, coherent, and goal-directed manner.\"   It went on, however, to conclude that \"Mr. Ecker is currently a substantial risk to others or the property of others due to mental illness.\"   The civil commitment statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246, requires Federal authorities to place Ecker in an appropriate state institution in his home state, Massachusetts, if possible.   Officials at FMC-Springfield, however, determined that Massachusetts would not accept Ecker in a state institution because of the pendency of the federal indictment.   Thus, Ecker remains hospitalized at FMC-Springfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>B. The District Court Order on Ecker's Motion to Dismiss</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, Ecker advanced two grounds for dismissal of the indictment.   First, he contended that the statute under which he was committed, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246, requires, upon commitment, dismissal of pending charges upon commitment.   Second, he asserted that the pendency of the indictment interfered with his purported right to be placed in a state institution, depriving Ecker of his constitutional right to due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Ecker's motion to dismiss the indictment, holding that the commitment statute did not require dismissal of the indictment, finding no support for Ecker's statutory argument in the statute's language, its legislative history, or in caselaw.   The court also rejected Ecker's due process argument, concluding that \"the statute cannot be fairly read to confer a liberty interest, protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in being committed to a state institution rather than a 'suitable facility' chosen by the Attorney General.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Ecker's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker appeals the district court's order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, advancing only the statutory argument that 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4241 and 4246 require dismissal.   Ecker has abandoned the argument he made below that the pendency of the indictment violates his due process rights.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (arguments not raised squarely are waived), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's resolution of a question of statutory interpretation engenders de novo review in the court of appeals.  Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker, at the outset, concedes that \"[n]either 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> nor 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> addresses what happens to a pending indictment when a defendant is determined under section 4241 to be incompetent to stand trial and is subject to indefinite civil commitment under section 4246.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  That concession is virtually dispositive of Ecker's appeal--there is nothing in the statute's language that requires dismissal of a pending indictment.   The statutory silence is not surprising.   Congress, we have little doubt, intended to leave the decision about the disposition of pending charges to the case-by-case discretion of the prosecutors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Ecker's Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although conceding that the statute is silent, Ecker argues that the structure of the relevant statutes, their legislative history, and the caselaw compel the conclusion that Congress intended to require dismissal of a pending indictment upon commitment.   We disagree, and address each of Ecker's arguments in turn, explaining why we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ecker asserts that section 4246 applies only to individuals \"who no longer realistically can be considered to be awaiting trial because there is little possibility of their regaining competency,\" quoting United States v. Charters, 829 F.2d 479, 485 (4th Cir.1987) (not addressing dismissal of indictment), reh'g, 863 F.2d 302 (4th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1016, 110 S.Ct. 1317, 108 L.Ed.2d 493 (1990).   From that premise, Ecker concludes that \"Congress plainly intended that the liberty of such a person would be restricted only by the requirements of section 4246, not as a result of the continued pendency of an indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument is unconvincing.   Ecker's liberty is not restricted by the pendency of the indictment, but rather by section 4246 (which authorizes his hospitalization).   The only effect that the pending indictment has on Ecker's \"liberty\" results from a Massachusetts state policy<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> of refusing to accept mentally ill federal detainees who are subject to a pending federal indictment.   We fail to see how that state policy, or its effect on Ecker, can indicate that Congress intended section 4246 to require dismissal of any pending indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker's second argument is that there is no statutory mechanism to revisit the issue of competency once a defendant is committed as dangerous under section 4246.   While recognizing that section 4247 requires annual reports on the \"mental condition\" of a person committed under section 4246, he asserts that such reports address dangerousness and not competency to stand trial.   That argument finds some support in the October 1994 annual report on Ecker, which concluded that he was still dangerous without addressing his competency for trial on the pending indictment.   Ecker argues that nothing in this statutory scheme suggests that Congress envisioned further competency determinations once a defendant is indefinitely committed as dangerous under section 4246.   This \"unexplained gap,\" he contends, indicates that Congress must have intended that a pending indictment would be dismissed once a defendant has been committed for dangerousness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the statute does not expressly address the reevaluation of trial competency of a defendant committed as dangerous under section 4246.   The statute does, however, provide for annual reports by the facility director \"concerning the mental condition of the person and containing recommendations for the need for his continued hospitalization.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 4247(e)(1)(B).   This broad requirement of a report on \"mental condition\" would seemingly allow the facility director to report to the court that a defendant has regained competency.   Moreover, a defendant or his counsel may bring any relevant change in condition, or a request for release, to the court's attention through a motion for a hearing under section 4247(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, it is far too great a leap to conclude from this asserted shortcoming in the statutory scheme that Congress intended to require the dismissal of a pending indictment once a defendant has been committed for dangerousness.   Congress could plausibly have expected that a prosecutor bent on trying a committed person would file a motion under section 4241 for a new evaluation of competency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On the other hand, the asserted \"gap\" might be the result of simple oversight or poor draftsmanship, due in part, perhaps, to an expectation that prosecutors will usually exercise their discretion to dismiss indictments against persons committed under section 4246.   An appropriate judicial response to this statutory shortcoming would be to order further competency reevaluations if requested by either the government or a defendant, rather than a judicial rewriting of the statute to require dismissal of an indictment that the prosecutor seeks to preserve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third argument advanced by Ecker is more difficult to decipher than the preceding two.   He asserts that section 4246 was \"clearly designed\" to deal only with persons about to be released from the federal criminal justice system, and therefore Congress must have intended that charges be dropped when a defendant is committed under section 4246.   Ecker demonstrates this \"clear design\" by pointing out that two of the three categories of persons covered by section 4246 (those whose sentence is about to expire and those against whom all charges have been dismissed because of mental illness) are no longer subject to punishment and would be released but for the provisions of section 4246.   Then Ecker states that \"it would be strange, indeed, to include in the same statute, without explanation or separate procedures, a group of people still subject to indictment and trial.\"   It is more plausible, he argues, that those defendants subject to section 4246 after being found incompetent under section 4241 \"would also be subject to release due to the dismissal of the charges.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is perhaps odd that the statute lacks express procedures for reevaluating the competency of a person committed under section 4246, it would be far more \"strange\" for Congress to have intended a statutory requirement that an indictment be dismissed automatically on commitment, yet never mention that requirement in the statute.   Again, all that Ecker has done is point to some ambiguities in certain procedural aspects of section 4246, and then attempt to bootstrap those ambiguities into an implied requirement that a pending indictment must be dismissed whenever that statute is invoked.   We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As further support for his third argument (that it would be \"strange\" if the statute did not require the dismissal of an indictment), Ecker directs us to the statute's legislative history.   We are reluctant to take that direction, because a court \"should resort to legislative history ... [only] when the words of a statute give rise to ambiguity or when they lead to an unreasonable interpretation.\"  United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 297 (1st Cir.1993).   The words of the statutes at issue here do neither.   In an abundance of caution, however, we have reviewed the legislative history cited by Ecker and find it to contain nothing that would lead us to conclude that Congress intended the statute to require, sub silentio, the dismissal of pending charges.   See S.Rep. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3404-36.   As the Supreme Court remarked in construing the federal civil commitment statute that preceded the current section 4246, \"this is a case for applying the canon of construction of the wag who said, when the legislative history is doubtful, go to the statute.\"  Greenwood v. United States, 350 U.S. 366, 374, 76 S.Ct. 410, 415, 100 L.Ed. 412 (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fourth argument, and as support for the first three, Ecker quotes the Eighth Circuit's opinion in his earlier appeal of his commitment.   In rejecting Ecker's argument that it was unreasonable to hold him for nearly four years before committing him under section 4246, the Eighth Circuit stated that:  \"At all times, Ecker remained subject to criminal process calling for a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.   He remained subject to possible trial until the final judicial determination of incompetency on April 16, 1993.\"  Ecker, 30 F.3d at 969 (emphasis added).   The Eighth Circuit, however, was not concerned with the dismissal or validity of the indictment after Ecker's section 4246 commitment;  the issue it faced was the duration of Ecker's detention for determination of competency under section 4241, and whether that lengthy confinement was a due process violation.   The Eighth Circuit had no reason to consider whether the indictment remained valid after Ecker was committed under section 4246;  if the quoted statement addresses that question at all, it is mere dictum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally Ecker points out that the executive branch of the federal government is in a \"peculiar position\" because section 4246 requires the Attorney General to \"make all reasonable efforts\" to place Ecker in a state institution, but the United States Attorney in Massachusetts is preventing that placement by not dropping the indictment.   Ecker adds that \"the continued validity of the indictment interferes with defendant's statutory right to state placement.\"   This argument invites a number of obvious rejoinders.   First, the government has the discretion to solve the dilemma by dismissing the charges.   Second, the Attorney General is only required to make \"reasonable efforts\" to place Ecker in state care.   The Massachusetts policy denying placement of persons under federal indictment prevents Ecker's placement, and we would not conclude (nor does Ecker argue) that it is \"unreasonable\" not to drop the charges in order to facilitate placement.   Third, while the statute imposes a duty on the Attorney General to attempt to place Ecker with the state, we do not conclude that it endows Ecker with a \"right\" to state placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of Ecker's statutory arguments persuade us that Congress intended sections 4241 and 4246 to require sub silentio the dismissal of a pending indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Caselaw</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is not altered by our analysis of the few relevant cases.   The district court's order denying Ecker's motion to dismiss the indictment is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Greenwood v. United States, 350 U.S. 366, 76 S.Ct. 410, 100 L.Ed. 412 (1956).   The Court in Greenwood stated that \"the pending indictment persists\" even after the defendant has been found unlikely to recover competency and has been committed as dangerous.  Id. at 375, 76 S.Ct. at 415.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Greenwood was not decided under the current statutory scheme, we believe that the holding is equally valid under the new scheme.   The prior statutes were strikingly similar to the current ones.   The primary difference relevant to this appeal is that the old scheme authorized detention of an incompetent indefinitely, \"until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial.\"   Law of Sept. 7, 1949, ch. 535, &#167; 4246, 63 Stat. 686 (1949) (current version at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246).   The present statute authorizes detention of an incompetent defendant only for four months, and then for an additional reasonable time if there is a substantial possibility that he will regain competency.   This limitation on the detention of incompetent defendants was dictated by Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1858, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972), which struck down Indiana's statute authorizing indefinite commitment of incompetent defendants who were not dangerous as violative of due process.   See S.Rep. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3418.   Thus, under the new scheme, an incompetent defendant must be released after four months if recovery is unlikely, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241(d), or else committed indefinitely if found dangerous, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   We see nothing about the statutory changes required by Jackson v. Indiana,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> 406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858, nor any other change in the statutory scheme, that casts doubt on Greenwood 's holding that the indictment survives commitment, 350 U.S. at 375, 76 S.Ct. at 415.   Nor does the pendency of the indictment beyond Ecker's commitment offend Jackson 's mandate that a permanently incompetent defendant must be released or else civilly committed.   See Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker attempts to advance his cause by misleadingly quoting a recent Ninth Circuit case:  \"The fact that an indictment is no longer in place is irrelevant to the governmental interests at stake:  'the control and treatment of dangerous persons within the federal criminal justice system who are incompetent to stand trial.' \"  United States v. Sahhar, 56 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 400, 133 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995).   Ecker argues that the governmental interests in his case, as in Sahhar, are fully vindicated by section 4246, rendering the indictment irrelevant.   But in Sahhar, the indictment was dismissed before the appellant was committed;  the issue was whether it was unconstitutional to commit a person under section 4246 after detaining him for longer than the maximum term of imprisonment for the crime charged.  Id. at 1028.   The Ninth Circuit held that such commitment was constitutional given the federal interest in \"control and treatment of dangerous persons within the federal criminal justice system\";  the fact that an indictment was no longer in place was \"irrelevant\" to that interest.  Id. at 1029.   The district court had erred in \"tying the continuing validity of appellant's non-punitive section 4246 commitment to the punitive objectives of the original criminal charge.\"  Id.  In other words, once the indictment was dismissed, the only remaining government interest was public safety, not the punishment of the offender.

Ecker has prior convictions for assault with a weapon, arson, breaking and entering, and burglary, and is therefore subject to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e);  if convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum prison term of fifteen years.   After federal authorities found that Ecker's mental illness rendered him incompetent to stand trial and dangerous to the public, he was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for hospitalization under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   Now Ecker seeks to dismiss the indictment charging him as a felon in possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>A. Ecker's History in Federal Psychiatric Facilities</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker's history in federal psychiatric facilities is long and twisted;  full detail is unnecessary to resolve the issue before us, so we summarize.   From January 1990 through March 1993, federal authorities, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241(d), conducted seven competency evaluations of Ecker.   After five of these, Ecker was found incompetent, and on two occasions he was found competent.   Authorities at one point reported that Ecker \"displayed excellent knowledge of the federal mental health statutes,\" and concerns were raised that his mental health problems were of a questionable nature.   In March 1993, federal authorities concluded \"finally\" that Ecker was not competent for trial and that it was unlikely that he would regain competency in the near future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where the indictment was (and is) pending, determined that there was no likelihood of trial and ordered the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota (\"FMC-Rochester\"), to determine if Ecker was dangerous and therefore subject to indefinite commitment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   The director of FMC-Rochester did find Ecker dangerous, and the United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota accordingly instituted commitment proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.   In October 1993, the Minnesota district court ordered Ecker committed to the custody of the Attorney General under section 4246, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.

The report stated that Ecker was \"generally able to answer the panel's questions in a logical, coherent, and goal-directed manner.\"   It went on, however, to conclude that \"Mr. Ecker is currently a substantial risk to others or the property of others due to mental illness.\"   The civil commitment statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246, requires Federal authorities to place Ecker in an appropriate state institution in his home state, Massachusetts, if possible.   Officials at FMC-Springfield, however, determined that Massachusetts would not accept Ecker in a state institution because of the pendency of the federal indictment.   Thus, Ecker remains hospitalized at FMC-Springfield.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>B.

First, he contended that the statute under which he was committed, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246, requires, upon commitment, dismissal of pending charges upon commitment.   Second, he asserted that the pendency of the indictment interfered with his purported right to be placed in a state institution, depriving Ecker of his constitutional right to due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Ecker's motion to dismiss the indictment, holding that the commitment statute did not require dismissal of the indictment, finding no support for Ecker's statutory argument in the statute's language, its legislative history, or in caselaw.   The court also rejected Ecker's due process argument, concluding that \"the statute cannot be fairly read to confer a liberty interest, protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in being committed to a state institution rather than a 'suitable facility' chosen by the Attorney General.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Ecker's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker appeals the district court's order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment, advancing only the statutory argument that 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4241 and 4246 require dismissal.   Ecker has abandoned the argument he made below that the pendency of the indictment violates his due process rights.   See United States v.

The statutory silence is not surprising.   Congress, we have little doubt, intended to leave the decision about the disposition of pending charges to the case-by-case discretion of the prosecutors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Ecker's Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although conceding that the statute is silent, Ecker argues that the structure of the relevant statutes, their legislative history, and the caselaw compel the conclusion that Congress intended to require dismissal of a pending indictment upon commitment.   We disagree, and address each of Ecker's arguments in turn, explaining why we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ecker asserts that section 4246 applies only to individuals \"who no longer realistically can be considered to be awaiting trial because there is little possibility of their regaining competency,\" quoting United States v. Charters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494623\"><a href=\"/opinion/494623/united-states-v-michael-francis-charters-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 485 (4th Cir.1987) (not addressing dismissal of indictment), reh'g, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515741\"><a href=\"/opinion/515741/united-states-v-michael-francis-charters-jr-american-psychological/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1988), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></span> (1990).   From that premise, Ecker concludes that \"Congress plainly intended that the liberty of such a person would be restricted only by the requirements of section 4246, not as a result of the continued pendency of an indictment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument is unconvincing.   Ecker's liberty is not restricted by the pendency of the indictment, but rather by section 4246 (which authorizes his hospitalization).   The only effect that the pending indictment has on Ecker's \"liberty\" results from a Massachusetts state policy<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> of refusing to accept mentally ill federal detainees who are subject to a pending federal indictment.   We fail to see how that state policy, or its effect on Ecker, can indicate that Congress intended section 4246 to require dismissal of any pending indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker's second argument is that there is no statutory mechanism to revisit the issue of competency once a defendant is committed as dangerous under section 4246.   While recognizing that section 4247 requires annual reports on the \"mental condition\" of a person committed under section 4246, he asserts that such reports address dangerousness and not competency to stand trial.   That argument finds some support in the October 1994 annual report on Ecker, which concluded that he was still dangerous without addressing his competency for trial on the pending indictment.   Ecker argues that nothing in this statutory scheme suggests that Congress envisioned further competency determinations once a defendant is indefinitely committed as dangerous under section 4246.   This \"unexplained gap,\" he contends, indicates that Congress must have intended that a pending indictment would be dismissed once a defendant has been committed for dangerousness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that the statute does not expressly address the reevaluation of trial competency of a defendant committed as dangerous under section 4246.   The statute does, however, provide for annual reports by the facility director \"concerning the mental condition of the person and containing recommendations for the need for his continued hospitalization.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 4247(e)(1)(B).   This broad requirement of a report on \"mental condition\" would seemingly allow the facility director to report to the court that a defendant has regained competency.   Moreover, a defendant or his counsel may bring any relevant change in condition, or a request for release, to the court's attention through a motion for a hearing under section 4247(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, it is far too great a leap to conclude from this asserted shortcoming in the statutory scheme that Congress intended to require the dismissal of a pending indictment once a defendant has been committed for dangerousness.   Congress could plausibly have expected that a prosecutor bent on trying a committed person would file a motion under section 4241 for a new evaluation of competency.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On the other hand, the asserted \"gap\" might be the result of simple oversight or poor draftsmanship, due in part, perhaps, to an expectation that prosecutors will usually exercise their discretion to dismiss indictments against persons committed under section 4246.   An appropriate judicial response to this statutory shortcoming would be to order further competency reevaluations if requested by either the government or a defendant, rather than a judicial rewriting of the statute to require dismissal of an indictment that the prosecutor seeks to preserve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third argument advanced by Ecker is more difficult to decipher than the preceding two.   He asserts that section 4246 was \"clearly designed\" to deal only with persons about to be released from the federal criminal justice system, and therefore Congress must have intended that charges be dropped when a defendant is committed under section 4246.   Ecker demonstrates this \"clear design\" by pointing out that two of the three categories of persons covered by section 4246 (those whose sentence is about to expire and those against whom all charges have been dismissed because of mental illness) are no longer subject to punishment and would be released but for the provisions of section 4246.   Then Ecker states that \"it would be strange, indeed, to include in the same statute, without explanation or separate procedures, a group of people still subject to indictment and trial.\"   It is more plausible, he argues, that those defendants subject to section 4246 after being found incompetent under section 4241 \"would also be subject to release due to the dismissal of the charges.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is perhaps odd that the statute lacks express procedures for reevaluating the competency of a person committed under section 4246, it would be far more \"strange\" for Congress to have intended a statutory requirement that an indictment be dismissed automatically on commitment, yet never mention that requirement in the statute.   Again, all that Ecker has done is point to some ambiguities in certain procedural aspects of section 4246, and then attempt to bootstrap those ambiguities into an implied requirement that a pending indictment must be dismissed whenever that statute is invoked.   We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As further support for his third argument (that it would be \"strange\" if the statute did not require the dismissal of an indictment), Ecker directs us to the statute's legislative history.   We are reluctant to take that direction, because a court \"should resort to legislative history ... [only] when the words of a statute give rise to ambiguity or when they lead to an unreasonable interpretation.\"  United States v. O'Neil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658542\"><a href=\"/opinion/658542/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 297 (1st Cir.1993).   The words of the statutes at issue here do neither.   In an abundance of caution, however, we have reviewed the legislative history cited by Ecker and find it to contain nothing that would lead us to conclude that Congress intended the statute to require, sub silentio, the dismissal of pending charges.   See S.Rep. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3404-36.   As the Supreme Court remarked in construing the federal civil commitment statute that preceded the current section 4246, \"this is a case for applying the canon of construction of the wag who said, when the legislative history is doubtful, go to the statute.\"  Greenwood v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105356\"><a href=\"/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, 374, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105356\"><a href=\"/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></span> (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fourth argument, and as support for the first three, Ecker quotes the Eighth Circuit's opinion in his earlier appeal of his commitment.   In rejecting Ecker's argument that it was unreasonable to hold him for nearly four years before committing him under section 4246, the Eighth Circuit stated that:  \"At all times, Ecker remained subject to criminal process calling for a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.   He remained subject to possible trial until the final judicial determination of incompetency on April 16, 1993.\"  Ecker, 30 F.3d at 969 (emphasis added).   The Eighth Circuit, however, was not concerned with the dismissal or validity of the indictment after Ecker's section 4246 commitment;  the issue it faced was the duration of Ecker's detention for determination of competency under section 4241, and whether that lengthy confinement was a due process violation.   The Eighth Circuit had no reason to consider whether the indictment remained valid after Ecker was committed under section 4246;  if the quoted statement addresses that question at all, it is mere dictum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally Ecker points out that the executive branch of the federal government is in a \"peculiar position\" because section 4246 requires the Attorney General to \"make all reasonable efforts\" to place Ecker in a state institution, but the United States Attorney in Massachusetts is preventing that placement by not dropping the indictment.   Ecker adds that \"the continued validity of the indictment interferes with defendant's statutory right to state placement.\"   This argument invites a number of obvious rejoinders.   First, the government has the discretion to solve the dilemma by dismissing the charges.   Second, the Attorney General is only required to make \"reasonable efforts\" to place Ecker in state care.   The Massachusetts policy denying placement of persons under federal indictment prevents Ecker's placement, and we would not conclude (nor does Ecker argue) that it is \"unreasonable\" not to drop the charges in order to facilitate placement.   Third, while the statute imposes a duty on the Attorney General to attempt to place Ecker with the state, we do not conclude that it endows Ecker with a \"right\" to state placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of Ecker's statutory arguments persuade us that Congress intended sections 4241 and 4246 to require sub silentio the dismissal of a pending indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Caselaw</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is not altered by our analysis of the few relevant cases.   The district court's order denying Ecker's motion to dismiss the indictment is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Greenwood v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105356\"><a href=\"/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105356\"><a href=\"/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></span> (1956).   The Court in Greenwood stated that \"the pending indictment persists\" even after the defendant has been found unlikely to recover competency and has been committed as dangerous.  Id. at 375, 76 S.Ct. at 415.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Greenwood was not decided under the current statutory scheme, we believe that the holding is equally valid under the new scheme.   The prior statutes were strikingly similar to the current ones.   The primary difference relevant to this appeal is that the old scheme authorized detention of an incompetent indefinitely, \"until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial.\"   Law of Sept. 7, 1949, ch. 535, &#167; 4246, 63 Stat. 686 (1949) (current version at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246).   The present statute authorizes detention of an incompetent defendant only for four months, and then for an additional reasonable time if there is a substantial possibility that he will regain competency.   This limitation on the detention of incompetent defendants was dictated by Jackson v. Indiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108556\"><a href=\"/opinion/108556/jackson-v-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 738, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108556\"><a href=\"/opinion/108556/jackson-v-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1845</span></a></span>, 1858, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108556\"><a href=\"/opinion/108556/jackson-v-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (1972), which struck down Indiana's statute authorizing indefinite commitment of incompetent defendants who were not dangerous as violative of due process.   See S.Rep. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3418.   Thus, under the new scheme, an incompetent defendant must be released after four months if recovery is unlikely, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4241(d), or else committed indefinitely if found dangerous, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   We see nothing about the statutory changes required by Jackson v. Indiana,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> 406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858, nor any other change in the statutory scheme, that casts doubt on Greenwood 's holding that the indictment survives commitment, 350 U.S. at 375, 76 S.Ct. at 415.   Nor does the pendency of the indictment beyond Ecker's commitment offend Jackson 's mandate that a permanently incompetent defendant must be released or else civilly committed.   See Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ecker attempts to advance his cause by misleadingly quoting a recent Ninth Circuit case:  \"The fact that an indictment is no longer in place is irrelevant to the governmental interests at stake:  'the control and treatment of dangerous persons within the federal criminal justice system who are incompetent to stand trial.' \"  United States v. Sahhar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697342\"><a href=\"/opinion/697342/united-states-v-john-george-sahhar/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1029 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></span> (1995).   Ecker argues that the governmental interests in his case, as in Sahhar, are fully vindicated by section 4246, rendering the indictment irrelevant.   But in Sahhar, the indictment was dismissed before the appellant was committed;  the issue was whether it was unconstitutional to commit a person under section 4246 after detaining him for longer than the maximum term of imprisonment for the crime charged.  Id. at 1028.   The Ninth Circuit held that such commitment was constitutional given the federal interest in \"control and treatment of dangerous persons within the federal criminal justice system\";  the fact that an indictment was no longer in place was \"irrelevant\" to that interest.  Id. at 1029.   The district court had erred in \"tying the continuing validity of appellant's non-punitive section 4246 commitment to the punitive objectives of the original criminal charge.\"  Id.  In other words, once the indictment was dismissed, the only remaining government interest was public safety, not the punishment of the offender.   In no way did Sahhar involve the question whether an indictment must be dismissed when a person is committed under section 4246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the prosecutor wishes to keep Ecker's indictment pending, the government has a continuing punitive interest in Ecker.   That interest is not addressed by section 4246 commitment, which terminates if Ecker's condition improves.   Ecker's out-of-context quotation of Sahhar is disingenuous and does not enlighten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant statutes are silent as to dismissal of a pending indictment upon commitment for dangerousness.   None of Ecker's arguments persuade us that Congress intended that upon commitment under section 4246 any pending indictment must be dismissed.   The district court's order denying Ecker's motion to dismiss the indictment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 4241 provides procedures for evaluation of a defendant's competency to stand trial.   If the court finds the defendant incompetent after an psychiatric examination and a hearing, the court commits the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General.   The Attorney General then hospitalizes the defendant for up to four months \"to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the trial to proceed.\"   The Attorney General may also hospitalize the defendant for an \"additional reasonable time\" beyond four months if the court finds a substantial probability that competency will be regained.   If the defendant remains incompetent at the end of those time periods, the defendant is subject to commitment for dangerousness under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4246.   If not committed thereunder, the defendant is released</p>\n        <p>Section 4241 makes no reference to the pendency or dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Section 4246 provides for the commitment and hospitalization of a dangerous person \"whose sentence is about to expire, or who has been committed to the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to section 4241(d) [i.e., due to incompetency to stand trial], or against whom all criminal charges have been dismissed solely for reasons related to the mental condition of the person.\"   Upon certification of dangerousness by the director of the hospital facility, the court conducts a hearing, and shall commit to the custody of the Attorney General a person \"suffering from mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.\"   Such commitment is of indefinite duration, but the Attorney General must make reasonable efforts place the person in the custody and care of the state in which the person is domiciled</p>\n        <p>Although section 4246 recognizes that criminal charges may be dismissed because of a person's mental illness, there is nothing in the language of the statute requiring such dismissal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Nor do the statutes address the pendency or dismissal of an indictment of a defendant found long-term incompetent under section 4241, but not found dangerous under section 4246</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The record and the parties' briefs do not indicate whether this \"policy\" is based on statute, regulation, or the discretion of state officials.   The district judge below assumed, without so finding, that state officials refused to accept Ecker, but the court based that assumption \"on hearsay and not on competent evidence.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Section 4241 provides in relevant part:  \"At any time after the commencement of a prosecution for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the defendant, the defendant or the attorney for the Government may file a motion for a hearing to determine the mental competency of the defendant.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Court stated in Jackson v. Indiana that \"[d]ismissal of charges against an incompetent accused has usually been thought to be justified on grounds not squarely presented here:  particularly, the Sixth-Fourteenth Amendment right to a speedy trial, or the denial of due process inherent in holding pending criminal charges indefinitely over the head of one who will never have a chance to prove his innocence.\"  406 U.S. at 740, 92 S.Ct. at 1859 (citing as support only one state decision and two federal district court decisions).   The Jackson Court did not reach the issue of dismissal of charges, however.  Id.  Ecker has not advanced either of these grounds for dismissal of his indictment.   Moreover, we will not, based solely on the quoted dictum in Jackson, attribute to Congress an unspoken intent to require that a pending indictment be dismissed</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
