George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n              Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges,\r\n\n            and Shadur,* Senior District Judge.\r\n\n   Joel P. Suttenberg for appellant.\r\n   Joseph W. Ambash, with whom Gerald M. Slater and Day, Berry &amp;\r\nHoward LLP were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nMarch 19, 1999\r\n\n          \r\n*Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.  SELYA, Circuit Judge.  This case involves the discharge\r\nof a tenured public school teacher for unbecoming conduct (which\r\nthe superintendent of schools reasonably classified as sexual\r\nharassment).  The ousted docent, plaintiff-appellant Thomas\r\nConward, sued the Cambridge School Committee and the\r\nsuperintendent, Mary Lou McGrath, asseverating, inter alia, that\r\nthey had meted out discriminatorily harsh discipline because of his\r\nrace (Conward is an African American), and had violated both the\r\nFirst Amendment and the Due Process Clause.  The district court\r\ngranted summary judgment in the defendants' favor.  See Conward v. \r\nCambridge Sch. Comm., No. 96-11087-GAO, 1998 WL 151248 (D. Mass.\r\nMar. 24, 1998).  We affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nApplying conventional summary judgment jurisprudence,\r\nsee, e.g., National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d\r\n731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995), we sketch the events surrounding\r\nConward's ouster in the light most flattering to his cause,\r\nconsistent with record support.\r\nThe School Committee employed the appellant as a high-\r\nschool teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (CRLS),\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, for twenty-two years.  In that time, he\r\nachieved tenure as a \"professional teacher.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n71,  41.  On September 22, 1994, while supervising a study hall,\r\nthe appellant handed a female student a document entitled\r\n\"Application for a Piece of Ass\" (the Application).  He says that,\r\nhaving read only the title, he tendered the paper as an example of\r\nimproper language because, moments earlier, the student had spelled\r\nout an expletive.  The appellant concedes that, had he perused the\r\ndocument fully, he would have found it indecent   the body of the\r\nApplication comprised a series of lewd questions written in a style\r\nemulating a standard employment application   and would not have\r\ngiven it to a teenage girl.\r\nTwo days after this incident, the appellant received a\r\nletter from McGrath suspending him temporarily, albeit with pay. \r\nThe letter did not describe the reason for his suspension.  On\r\nSeptember 28, McGrath wrote another letter requesting the appellant\r\nto meet with her on September 30 \"for purposes of an investigation\r\nconcerning your conduct as a teacher.\"  She advised the appellant\r\nthat he could invite a lawyer and/or a union representative to\r\naccompany him.\r\nThe appellant belonged to the Cambridge Teachers\r\nAssociation (CTA), the union that represented the relevant\r\nbargaining unit.  He attended the September 30 session accompanied\r\nby Joseph Sullivan, an attorney who doubled in brass as president\r\nof the CTA.  Immediately prior thereto, Sullivan learned from\r\nMcGrath's secretary that both the meeting and the earlier\r\nsuspension stemmed from the Application incident.\r\nWhen the session began, McGrath informed the appellant\r\nthat he would be charged with conduct unbecoming a teacher for\r\nhaving passed the Application to a female student.  McGrath then\r\nshowed the appellant statements made by several students describing\r\nthe episode.  Both McGrath and the School Committee's attorney\r\ninterrogated the appellant about the incident.  He readily admitted\r\nthat he handed the Application to the pupil and explained that he\r\nhad read no more than the title at that time.  The audience ended\r\non an ominous note:  McGrath stated that she would suspend the\r\nappellant without pay and in all likelihood would discharge him.\r\nTrue to her word, McGrath again wrote to the appellant on\r\nOctober 5, suspending him without pay for ten days and notifying\r\nhim of her intent to terminate his employment due to the\r\nApplication incident.  This communique specifically referenced the\r\nappellant's admission of what he had done, and explained his\r\nentitlement to a hearing, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71  42, 42D,\r\naccompanied by counsel if he so chose, \"to provide information\r\npertinent to the decision and to [his] status.\"  On October 13, the\r\nappellant, through his attorney, waived his right to such a\r\nhearing.  Seven days later, McGrath forwarded her final epistle,\r\ndischarging the appellant.\r\nThe appellant invoked the collective bargaining\r\nagreement, lodged a grievance, and demanded arbitration.  The\r\narbitrator found that he had been cashiered for just cause and\r\ndiscerned no mitigating circumstances.  The appellant retorted by\r\nfiling a claim of race discrimination with the appropriate\r\nadministrative agencies:  the federal Equal Employment Opportunity\r\nCommission and its state counterpart, the Massachusetts Commission\r\nAgainst Discrimination.  Following the dismissal of his\r\nadministrative claim for lack of evidence and the issuance of a\r\nright-to-sue letter, he commenced a civil action in the federal\r\ndistrict court.\r\nThe appellant's complaint contained a wide-ranging\r\nasseverational array, including claims that the defendants (McGrath\r\nand the School Committee) had discriminated against him on the\r\nbasis of his race, abridged his right to freedom of expression,\r\ndeprived him of procedural due process, and committed acts that\r\ngave rise to multiple state-law causes of action.  In the early\r\ngoing, the district court dismissed the state-law counts, and the\r\nappellant does not question that ruling here.  He concentrates his\r\nfire instead on the district court's later grant of summary\r\njudgment on the federal claims.  It is to that ruling which we now\r\nturn.\r\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\nA district court may grant summary judgment only \"if the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\r\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\r\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).  In practice, this rule acts as a firewall to contain the\r\nblaze of cases that are so lacking in either factual foundation or\r\nlegal merit that trial would be a useless exercise.  See Celotex\r\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 327 (1986); Mesnick v.\r\nGeneral Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nTo facilitate this process, we   like the trial court  \r\naccept the properly documented facts in the light most favorable to\r\nthe nonmovant, resolving all genuine conflicts in his favor, while\r\nat the same time refusing to indulge rank speculation or\r\nunsupportable hyperbole.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822; Medina-\r\nMunoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\nOnce we have culled the essentials of the tale from the record, we\r\nconsider independently whether the movant has achieved the Rule 56\r\nbenchmark.\r\nIII.  DISCUSSION\r\nGenerically, the appellant claims that the existence of\r\ngenuine issues of material fact precluded the use of summary\r\njudgment in this case.  It is against this backdrop that we mull\r\nhis three remaining claims.\r\n                   A.  Race Discrimination.\r\nThe appellant's principal contention is that the lower\r\ncourt too hastily jettisoned his race discrimination claims. \r\nAlthough this contention flies the flags of both 42 U.S.C.  1981\r\nand Title VII (42 U.S.C.  2000e et seq.), the subsidiary claims\r\nhinge upon identical legal standards.  See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol\r\nMyers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. 1996).  Consequently, we\r\ndiscuss them together, without differentiating between the two\r\nstatutes.\r\nUnder the familiar burden-shifting framework applicable\r\nto disparate treatment cases in which no direct evidence of\r\ndiscrimination exists, the first step for any plaintiff is to\r\nadduce a prima facie case.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\r\n411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973); Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.  Doing so\r\nshifts to the defendant the burden of articulating a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  SeeMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-03; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823. \r\nIf the defendant accomplishes this task, the plaintiff then\r\nreclaims the burden of production.  In order to meet this burden,\r\nhe must offer evidence showing that the defendant's proffered\r\nreason is a sham, and that discriminatory animus sparked the\r\ndefendant's actions.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05;\r\nMedina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 9.  Despite these shifting burdens of\r\nproduction, the plaintiff throughout retains the burden of\r\npersuasion.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.\r\nUnder this formula, the appellant's prima facie case\r\nnormally would include a showing that he was a member of a\r\nprotected class and qualified for the employment he held, that his\r\nemployer took an adverse employment action against him, and that\r\nhis position remained open for (or was filled by) a person whose\r\nqualifications were similar to his.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\r\nHicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993); Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d\r\n413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996).  Here, the parties agree (for purposes of\r\nsummary judgment) that the appellant satisfied these general\r\nrequirements.  But the district court took a different tack. \r\nBecause the appellant had based his claim of disparate treatment on\r\nhis assertion that the defendants treated his misconduct\r\ndifferently (i.e., more harshly) than comparable misconduct of\r\nother, similarly situated white teachers, the court followed the\r\nlead of the Eleventh Circuit and construed the prima facie case\r\nrequirement to call for a \"show[ing] that [the plaintiff] is a\r\nmember of a protected class, that he was qualified for the job from\r\nwhich he was fired, and that the misconduct for which he was\r\ndischarged was nearly identical to that engaged in by an employee\r\noutside the protected class whom the employer retained.\"  Conward1998 WL 151248, at *3 (quoting Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall\r\nCommunications, 738 F.2d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir. 1984)).  Because the\r\ncourt found the appellant's comparative evidence wanting, it\r\nrejected the race discrimination claim at the first step of the\r\nburden-shifting pavane.\r\nThe appellant assigns error to this formulation of the\r\nprima facie case requirement.  He argues that, in a disparate\r\ntreatment case, the trial court only should consider comparative\r\nevidence at the third stage of the progression, that is, after the\r\nplaintiff has put forward the standard prima facie case and the\r\ndefendant has responded by articulating a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory explanation for the adverse employment action. \r\nWe agree with the appellant's premise:  the district court's\r\nsequencing determination was in error, for the time to consider\r\ncomparative evidence in a disparate treatment case is at the third\r\nstep of the burden-shifting ritual, when the need arises to test\r\nthe pretextuality vel non of the employer's articulated reason for\r\nhaving acted adversely to the plaintiff's interests.  See, e.g.,\r\nPerkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp., 78 F.3d 747, 749, 751 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Lanear v. Safeway Grocery, 843 F.2d 298, 301-02 (8th Cir.\r\n1988); see also McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804 (noting that\r\ncomparative evidence is \"especially relevant\" for a showing of\r\npretext); Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 824 (citing evidence of\r\n\"differential treatment in the workplace\" as one example of\r\nevidence properly used to show pretext).\r\nWe need not dwell on this error.  In its rescript, the\r\ndistrict court made an alternative holding:  that, even if it\r\ncredited the appellant with having furnished a suitable prima facie\r\ncase, the defendants nonetheless were entitled to brevisdisposition because the other incidents mentioned by the appellant\r\nwere incommensurate, and, thus, his evidence was too weak to show\r\nat the third step of the progression that the defendants' stated\r\nreason for firing him masked a racially discriminatory animus.  SeeConward, 1998 WL 151248, at *5.  We can find no fault with this\r\nalternative rationale, and it fully supports the lower court's\r\nentry of summary judgment on the race discrimination claims. \r\nConsequently, the court's erroneous sequencing determination was\r\nharmless.\r\nThe fatal weakness of the appellant's position is that\r\nhis evidence, at whatever stage it is addressed, does not raise a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact as to the authenticity of the\r\ndefendants' professed reason for dismissing him, nor does it raise\r\nsuch an issue concerning the allegation that racial animus underlay\r\nthe action.  The objective of the burden-shifting framework is to\r\nassist the factfinder in determining whether discrimination has\r\noccurred.  Despite the shifting burdens of production, the\r\nplaintiff always remains responsible for proving such\r\ndiscrimination.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.  Thus, in a\r\ndisparate treatment case, \"so long as the employer's proffered\r\nreason is facially adequate to constitute a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory justification for the employer's actions, the\r\ntrial court's focus in deciding a Rule 56 motion must be on the\r\nultimate question, not on the artificial striations of the burden-\r\nshifting framework.\"  Id. at 825.  In our de novo review of a\r\ndistrict court's summary judgment decision, we, too, must focus on\r\nthe ultimate question.\r\nWhere, as here, the plaintiff in a disparate treatment\r\nrace discrimination case offers comparative evidence in his quest\r\nto raise an inference of racial discrimination, he must provide a\r\nsuitable provenance for the evidence by showing that others\r\nsimilarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated\r\ndifferently by the employer.  See Perkins, 78 F.3d at 751. \r\nReasonableness is the touchstone:  while the plaintiff's case and\r\nthe comparison cases that he advances need not be perfect replicas,\r\nthey must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts\r\nand circumstances.\r\nThe test is whether a prudent person, looking\r\nobjectively at the incidents, would think them\r\nroughly equivalent and the protagonists\r\nsimilarly situated.  Much as in the lawyer's\r\nart of distinguishing cases, the \"relevant\r\naspects\" are those factual elements which\r\ndetermine whether reasoned analogy supports,\r\nor demands, a like result.  Exact correlation\r\nis neither likely nor necessary, but the cases\r\nmust be fair congeners.  In other words,\r\napples should be compared with apples.\r\n\nDartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir.\r\n1989).\r\nTo continue the greengrocer's metaphor, the appellant in\r\nthis instance forswore apples and presented the district court with\r\ntwo persimmons and a pear.  Two proffered comparisons involve\r\nsituations wholly unlike his own and the third bears a passing\r\nresemblance to his case, but its essence is so different that the\r\nsuggested comparison is unreasonable.\r\nIn the first comparison case recounted by the appellant,\r\nA, a white male teacher at CRLS, shoved a male student.  Although\r\nthis conduct seemingly violated a school policy prohibiting the use\r\nof physical force by teachers against students, McGrath gave A only\r\na written warning.  We have no doubt that this conduct was\r\ninappropriate for the scholastic environment   but pushing a\r\nstudent is incomparable to the appellant's behavior in several\r\nrelevant aspects.\r\nThe improper use of physical force, on one hand, and\r\nsexual harassment, on the other hand, are qualitatively different\r\ninfractions.  They also create distinct problems in the school\r\nenvironment and present significantly different possibilities for\r\nremediation.  Here, moreover, it is undisputed that McGrath found\r\nA's act to have been taken without premeditated intent, but\r\nbelieved the uncontradicted evidence that the appellant had acted\r\ndeliberately (indeed, the witnesses agreed that he had laughed as\r\nhe handed the Application to his student).  All things considered,\r\nthe two incidents are not sufficiently alike to support a finding\r\nthat McGrath acted inconsistently in her handling of them.  Seeid.; see also Albert v. Carovano, 851 F.2d 561, 573-74 (2d Cir.\r\n1988) (en banc).\r\nThe appellant's second comparison introduces B, a white\r\nfemale CRLS teacher whom McGrath suspended for five days for\r\nstriking a male student and urging him to strike her in return. \r\nThis scenario is similar to that of A, both in that it involved the\r\nuse of physical force against a student and in that it bears little\r\nresemblance to the incident that the appellant provoked.  Again,\r\nphysical touching rather than words were involved, and there were\r\nno sexual overtones.  Of course, McGrath deemed B's conduct\r\ndeliberate, but this lone similarity is not enough to make the two\r\ncases, in the Dartmouth Review phrase, \"fair congeners.\"\r\n   C, a white male teacher and track coach at CRLS, is the\r\nsubject of the third attempted comparison.  C was accused of\r\nimproper conduct with black members of the boys' track team,\r\nincluding sexual touching and commenting about the size of team\r\nmembers' private parts.  C denied the accusations and other coaches\r\ntold McGrath that the alleged touching (patting young men on the\r\nbuttocks before a race) was common practice in certain competitive\r\nsports.  Faced with conflicting evidence and accounts, McGrath\r\nnegotiated a settlement with the teachers' union that placed C on\r\na one-year unpaid leave of absence from his position as track coach\r\nand required him to attend a seminar on racial sensitivity and\r\nrelated subjects.\r\n   On its facts, this vignette is more like the one that\r\nresulted in the appellant's dismissal   but in the end, the analogy\r\nfalls short.  No valid comparison can be drawn between two\r\nincidents for the purpose of proving disparate treatment if\r\n\"differentiating or mitigating circumstances\" distinguish either\r\nthe employee's conduct or the employer's response to it.  Perkins,\r\n78 F.3d at 751.  C, unlike the appellant, did not admit to the\r\nmisconduct that he was alleged to have committed.  His denials cast\r\na distinct light on his case as one founded on a serious conflict\r\nover background facts.  Because C had not conceded that he engaged\r\nin the charged conduct, McGrath had to worry that C might be found\r\ninnocent and that proceedings against him might result in no\r\ndisciplinary sanction whatever.  With these considerations in mind,\r\nMcGrath (even though she believed that C had engaged in\r\ninappropriate behavior) reasonably could have decided to negotiate\r\nsome discipline, rather than risk his ultimate exoneration by\r\nterminating his employment and precipitating a grievance.  No such\r\npossibilities were in play in the instant case, which involved only\r\na decision on discipline for conduct that admittedly occurred as\r\nreported.  We conclude, therefore, that although C's situation is\r\ncloser to the appellant's than either A's or B's, the circumstances\r\nvary sufficiently to distinguish McGrath's responses to them.\r\n   We summarize succinctly.  It is, of course, true that, in\r\nterms of comparative evidence, similarity, rather than\r\nidenticality, provides the essential requirement for an analogy. \r\nHere, however, the exemplars that the appellant touted to the court\r\nbelow bore too little similarity to the incident in question to\r\nfurnish a basis for suspecting racial discrimination.  It follows\r\nthat the district court did not err in refusing to draw the\r\nexaggerated inferences that the appellant requested.  And since the\r\nappellant pinned his hopes of showing pretext and racial animus\r\nsquarely on this evidence, its inadequacy compelled the district\r\ncourt to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\r\n                   B.  The First Amendment.\r\n   In addition to his discrimination claims, the appellant\r\nchallenged his ouster on the ground that it violated his rights\r\nunder the First Amendment (as incorporated against the states\r\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment).  This claim posited that, in\r\nhanding over the Application, the appellant was exercising his\r\nconstitutional rights to free speech and expression.  Because the\r\ndefendants terminated his employment due to that activity, this\r\nthesis runs, his dismissal amounted to a constitutional infraction. \r\nThe district court rejected this construct.  See Conward, 1998 WL\r\n151248, at *6-*7.  So do we.\r\n   In order to establish a prima facie case of a First\r\nAmendment violation in connection with the loss of public\r\nemployment, the erstwhile employee must show at a bare minimum both\r\nthat he was involved in protected activity and that such activity\r\nconstituted a motivating factor in his employer's decision to\r\ndischarge him.  See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\r\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977); Ward v. Hickey, 996 F.2d 448, 452\r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  Even though we credit for summary judgment\r\npurposes the appellant's assertion that he did not read the\r\ncontents of the Application beyond the title, his claim founders on\r\nthe first prong of this paradigm.\r\n   The appellant's endeavor to show that his activity  \r\nhanding the Application to the student   warranted First Amendment\r\nprotection encounters two obstacles.  The initial problem is that\r\nthe First Amendment protects only speech itself and other\r\nexpressive conduct that is \"inten[ded] to convey a particularized\r\nmessage\" under circumstances in which \"the likelihood [i]s great\r\nthat the message would be understood by those who view[] it.\" \r\nSpence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11 (1974) (per curiam). \r\nEven if the appellant harbored an intent, as he now says, to\r\nsuggest by his transmittal of the Application that swear words were\r\ninapropos for a scholastic environment, it strikes us as highly\r\nunlikely that an adolescent pondering the lascivious questions that\r\nmake up the Application would have understood that message.\r\n   We need not probe this point too deeply for, even if the\r\nact of handing the document to the student were a type of activity\r\nthat could warrant First Amendment protection, the Application's\r\nindecent content permitted its regulation in a high-school setting. \r\nLet us be perfectly clear:  we do not suggest that the Application\r\nis \"obscene\" in the legal sense (and, thus, lawfully subject to\r\ncontent-based regulation under the First Amendment).  After all, to\r\ndetermine obscenity, a court must ask \"whether to the average\r\nperson, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant\r\ntheme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient\r\ninterest.\"  Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 489 (1957). \r\nConsistent with the high degree of protection that our Constitution\r\naffords to freedom of speech and expression, this is a purposely\r\nnarrow definition.  Raw as the Application is, it does not fall\r\nwithin the cramped confines of legal obscenity.\r\n   Yet, the failure of the Application to sink to these\r\ndepths does not end the inquiry.  What a teacher may impart to his\r\npupils in a school environment is not determined by reference to\r\nconventional obscenity standards.  See Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v.\r\nFraser, 478 U.S. 675, 682, 684-86 (1986); Keefe v. Geanakos, 418\r\nF.2d 359, 362 (1st Cir. 1969).  Although those who work and study\r\nin a school environment do not abandon their First Amendment rights\r\nwhen they pass through the portals, see Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\r\nCommunity Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969), school officials do\r\nhave broad discretion to restrict school speech in order to further\r\neducational goals, see Bethel, 478 U.S. at 683-86; Ward, 996 F.2d\r\nat 452.  This discretion includes not only the right to design\r\ncurricula and select textbooks, but also the right to impose\r\nregulations in order to ensure \"that readers or listeners are not\r\nexposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of\r\nmaturity.\"  Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 271\r\n(1988).\r\n   Of course, the relevant legal framework strives to\r\nbalance the need for faculty and students to retain expressive\r\nrights against the need for school officials to maintain an\r\nappropriate educational environment.  Thus, regulations restricting\r\nclassroom speech are constitutional if, and to the extent that,\r\nthey are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns,\r\nprovided, however, that those who may choose to speak are given\r\nappropriate notice of what sorts of expressive conduct are out of\r\nbounds.  See Ward, 996 F.2d at 452.  Keeping scatological documents\r\naway from impressionable youngsters is certainly a reasonable\r\neducational objective.  See Bethel, 478 U.S. at 683-86.\r\n   The record in this case does not indicate whether the\r\nSchool Committee specifically proscribed by rule the in-school use\r\nof indecent language.  However, the Ward standard does not require\r\nschools to \"expressly prohibit every imaginable inappropriate\r\nconduct by teachers;\" the standard requires only that teachers be\r\nable reasonably to predict the types of conduct that are\r\nprohibited.  Ward, 996 F.2d at 454.  We find that the Massachusetts\r\nstatute permitting termination of a professional teacher for\r\n\"conduct unbecoming a teacher,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71,  42,\r\nfurnished sufficient notice under this standard that indecent\r\nspeech directed to students was impermissible.\r\n   That ends this phase of our inquiry.  Because the\r\nappellant's conduct was legitimately subject to regulation under\r\nthe First Amendment, the district court did not err in granting\r\nbrevis disposition on the \"freedom of expression\" claim.\r\n\n                       C.  Due Process.\r\n   In addition to his substantive claims, the appellant\r\nattacks the process accorded to him.  Under state law, a school\r\nboard can terminate the employment of tenured teachers only for\r\ncertain enumerated causes.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71,  42.  Even\r\nso, the School Committee's actions must take into account the\r\nprocedural protections afforded by the Due Process Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,\r\n470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985); Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,\r\n576-78 (1972).\r\n   In the public employment context, the basic requirements\r\nof due process are notice of the charges brought against the job-\r\nholder and an opportunity to respond to them.  See Loudermill, 470\r\nU.S. at 546 (\"The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or\r\nwritten notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the\r\nemployer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the\r\nstory.\").  In this instance, the appellant received all the process\r\nthat was due.  At the September 30 meeting, McGrath and the School\r\nCommittee's lawyer recounted the charges, showed Conward witness\r\nstatements describing the Application incident, and offered him a\r\nchance to tell his version of events.\r\n   The appellant argues that this notice came too late to be\r\nconstitutionally adequate and that, because he had too little time\r\nto prepare, he was unable meaningfully to respond on the day in\r\nquestion.  Whatever force these plaints otherwise might have had\r\nwas dissipated when, before ending his employment, the defendants\r\nextended to him an additional invitation to furnish his version of\r\nrelevant events at a pre-termination hearing, see Mass. Gen. Laws\r\nch. 71,  42D, and the appellant explicitly declined the\r\ninvitation.  Having waived this golden opportunity to exercise his\r\ndue process rights, he cannot now be heard to decry their\r\ndeprivation.  See Cliff v. Board of Sch. Comm'rs, 42 F.3d 403, 413-\r\n14 (7th Cir. 1994).  Because the appellant received the full\r\nprocedural panoply that the law prescribes, the district court\r\nappropriately rejected his due process claim.\r\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r\n   We need go no further.  The sanction that McGrath imposed\r\nadmittedly is harsh.  On this record, however, the appellant is\r\nunable to show, even in the limited way necessary to survive\r\nsummary judgment, that racial discrimination, unconstitutionally\r\nsuppressed expression, or the withholding of due process cost him\r\nhis job.  Consequently, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in\r\nthe defendants' favor.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

This case involves the discharge\r\nof a tenured public school teacher for unbecoming conduct (which\r\nthe superintendent of schools reasonably classified as sexual\r\nharassment).  The ousted docent, plaintiff-appellant Thomas\r\nConward, sued the Cambridge School Committee and the\r\nsuperintendent, Mary Lou McGrath, asseverating, inter alia, that\r\nthey had meted out discriminatorily harsh discipline because of his\r\nrace (Conward is an African American), and had violated both the\r\nFirst Amendment and the Due Process Clause.

Mass.\r\nMar. 24, 1998).  We affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nApplying conventional summary judgment jurisprudence,\r\nsee, e.g., National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195818\"><a href=\"/opinion/195818/national-amusements-v-town-of-dedham/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (1st Cir. 1995), we sketch the events surrounding\r\nConward's ouster in the light most flattering to his cause,\r\nconsistent with record support.\r\nThe School Committee employed the appellant as a high-\r\nschool teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (CRLS),\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, for twenty-two years.  In that time, he\r\nachieved tenure as a \"professional teacher.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n71,  41.  On September 22, 1994, while supervising a study hall,\r\nthe appellant handed a female student a document entitled\r\n\"Application for a Piece of Ass\" (the Application).  He says that,\r\nhaving read only the title, he tendered the paper as an example of\r\nimproper language because, moments earlier, the student had spelled\r\nout an expletive.  The appellant concedes that, had he perused the\r\ndocument fully, he would have found it indecent   the body of the\r\nApplication comprised a series of lewd questions written in a style\r\nemulating a standard employment application   and would not have\r\ngiven it to a teenage girl.\r\nTwo days after this incident, the appellant received a\r\nletter from McGrath suspending him temporarily, albeit with pay. \r\nThe letter did not describe the reason for his suspension.  On\r\nSeptember 28, McGrath wrote another letter requesting the appellant\r\nto meet with her on September 30 \"for purposes of an investigation\r\nconcerning your conduct as a teacher.\"  She advised the appellant\r\nthat he could invite a lawyer and/or a union representative to\r\naccompany him.\r\nThe appellant belonged to the Cambridge Teachers\r\nAssociation (CTA), the union that represented the relevant\r\nbargaining unit.  He attended the September 30 session accompanied\r\nby Joseph Sullivan, an attorney who doubled in brass as president\r\nof the CTA.  Immediately prior thereto, Sullivan learned from\r\nMcGrath's secretary that both the meeting and the earlier\r\nsuspension stemmed from the Application incident.\r\nWhen the session began, McGrath informed the appellant\r\nthat he would be charged with conduct unbecoming a teacher for\r\nhaving passed the Application to a female student.  McGrath then\r\nshowed the appellant statements made by several students describing\r\nthe episode.  Both McGrath and the School Committee's attorney\r\ninterrogated the appellant about the incident.  He readily admitted\r\nthat he handed the Application to the pupil and explained that he\r\nhad read no more than the title at that time.  The audience ended\r\non an ominous note:  McGrath stated that she would suspend the\r\nappellant without pay and in all likelihood would discharge him.\r\nTrue to her word, McGrath again wrote to the appellant on\r\nOctober 5, suspending him without pay for ten days and notifying\r\nhim of her intent to terminate his employment due to the\r\nApplication incident.  This communique specifically referenced the\r\nappellant's admission of what he had done, and explained his\r\nentitlement to a hearing, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71  42, 42D,\r\naccompanied by counsel if he so chose, \"to provide information\r\npertinent to the decision and to [his] status.\"  On October 13, the\r\nappellant, through his attorney, waived his right to such a\r\nhearing.  Seven days later, McGrath forwarded her final epistle,\r\ndischarging the appellant.\r\nThe appellant invoked the collective bargaining\r\nagreement, lodged a grievance, and demanded arbitration.  The\r\narbitrator found that he had been cashiered for just cause and\r\ndiscerned no mitigating circumstances.  The appellant retorted by\r\nfiling a claim of race discrimination with the appropriate\r\nadministrative agencies:  the federal Equal Employment Opportunity\r\nCommission and its state counterpart, the Massachusetts Commission\r\nAgainst Discrimination.  Following the dismissal of his\r\nadministrative claim for lack of evidence and the issuance of a\r\nright-to-sue letter, he commenced a civil action in the federal\r\ndistrict court.\r\nThe appellant's complaint contained a wide-ranging\r\nasseverational array, including claims that the defendants (McGrath\r\nand the School Committee) had discriminated against him on the\r\nbasis of his race, abridged his right to freedom of expression,\r\ndeprived him of procedural due process, and committed acts that\r\ngave rise to multiple state-law causes of action.  In the early\r\ngoing, the district court dismissed the state-law counts, and the\r\nappellant does not question that ruling here.  He concentrates his\r\nfire instead on the district court's later grant of summary\r\njudgment on the federal claims.  It is to that ruling which we now\r\nturn.\r\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\nA district court may grant summary judgment only \"if the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\r\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\r\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).  In practice, this rule acts as a firewall to contain the\r\nblaze of cases that are so lacking in either factual foundation or\r\nlegal merit that trial would be a useless exercise.

Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323-24, 327 (1986); Mesnick v.\r\nGeneral Elec.

See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822; Medina-\r\nMunoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536516\"><a href=\"/opinion/536516/52-fair-emplpraccas-253-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39659-jose-medina-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\nOnce we have culled the essentials of the tale from the record, we\r\nconsider independently whether the movant has achieved the Rule 56\r\nbenchmark.\r\nIII.  DISCUSSION\r\nGenerically, the appellant claims that the existence of\r\ngenuine issues of material fact precluded the use of summary\r\njudgment in this case.  It is against this backdrop that we mull\r\nhis three remaining claims.\r\n                   A.  Race Discrimination.\r\nThe appellant's principal contention is that the lower\r\ncourt too hastily jettisoned his race discrimination claims. \r\nAlthough this contention flies the flags of both 42 U.S.C.  1981\r\nand Title VII (42 U.S.C.  2000e et seq.), the subsidiary claims\r\nhinge upon identical legal standards.  See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol\r\nMyers-Squibb Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726050\"><a href=\"/opinion/726050/71-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1398-35-fedrserv3d-395-miguel-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (1st Cir. 1996).  Consequently, we\r\ndiscuss them together, without differentiating between the two\r\nstatutes.\r\nUnder the familiar burden-shifting framework applicable\r\nto disparate treatment cases in which no direct evidence of\r\ndiscrimination exists, the first step for any plaintiff is to\r\nadduce a prima facie case.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (1973); Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.  Doing so\r\nshifts to the defendant the burden of articulating a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.  SeeMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-03; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823. \r\nIf the defendant accomplishes this task, the plaintiff then\r\nreclaims the burden of production.  In order to meet this burden,\r\nhe must offer evidence showing that the defendant's proffered\r\nreason is a sham, and that discriminatory animus sparked the\r\ndefendant's actions.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05;\r\nMedina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 9.  Despite these shifting burdens of\r\nproduction, the plaintiff throughout retains the burden of\r\npersuasion.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.\r\nUnder this formula, the appellant's prima facie case\r\nnormally would include a showing that he was a member of a\r\nprotected class and qualified for the employment he held, that his\r\nemployer took an adverse employment action against him, and that\r\nhis position remained open for (or was filled by) a person whose\r\nqualifications were similar to his.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\r\nHicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506 (1993); Smith v.

Here, the parties agree (for purposes of\r\nsummary judgment) that the appellant satisfied these general\r\nrequirements.  But the district court took a different tack. \r\nBecause the appellant had based his claim of disparate treatment on\r\nhis assertion that the defendants treated his misconduct\r\ndifferently (i.e., more harshly) than comparable misconduct of\r\nother, similarly situated white teachers, the court followed the\r\nlead of the Eleventh Circuit and construed the prima facie case\r\nrequirement to call for a \"show[ing] that [the plaintiff] is a\r\nmember of a protected class, that he was qualified for the job from\r\nwhich he was fired, and that the misconduct for which he was\r\ndischarged was nearly identical to that engaged in by an employee\r\noutside the protected class whom the employer retained.\"  Conward</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">151248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (quoting Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall\r\nCommunications, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438788\"><a href=\"/opinion/438788/35-fair-emplpraccas-1104-34-empl-prac-dec-p-34575-george-w-nix/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1185 (11th Cir. 1984)).  Because the\r\ncourt found the appellant's comparative evidence wanting, it\r\nrejected the race discrimination claim at the first step of the\r\nburden-shifting pavane.\r\nThe appellant assigns error to this formulation of the\r\nprima facie case requirement.  He argues that, in a disparate\r\ntreatment case, the trial court only should consider comparative\r\nevidence at the third stage of the progression, that is, after the\r\nplaintiff has put forward the standard prima facie case and the\r\ndefendant has responded by articulating a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory explanation for the adverse employment action. \r\nWe agree with the appellant's premise:  the district court's\r\nsequencing determination was in error, for the time to consider\r\ncomparative evidence in a disparate treatment case is at the third\r\nstep of the burden-shifting ritual, when the need arises to test\r\nthe pretextuality vel non of the employer's articulated reason for\r\nhaving acted adversely to the plaintiff's interests.  See, e.g.,\r\nPerkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714796\"><a href=\"/opinion/714796/patrick-perkins-v-brigham-womens-hospital-and-george-h-kaye/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 749, 751 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); Lanear v.

In its rescript, the\r\ndistrict court made an alternative holding:  that, even if it\r\ncredited the appellant with having furnished a suitable prima facie\r\ncase, the defendants nonetheless were entitled to brevisdisposition because the other incidents mentioned by the appellant\r\nwere incommensurate, and, thus, his evidence was too weak to show\r\nat the third step of the progression that the defendants' stated\r\nreason for firing him masked a racially discriminatory animus.  SeeConward, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">151248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.  We can find no fault with this\r\nalternative rationale, and it fully supports the lower court's\r\nentry of summary judgment on the race discrimination claims. \r\nConsequently, the court's erroneous sequencing determination was\r\nharmless.\r\nThe fatal weakness of the appellant's position is that\r\nhis evidence, at whatever stage it is addressed, does not raise a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact as to the authenticity of the\r\ndefendants' professed reason for dismissing him, nor does it raise\r\nsuch an issue concerning the allegation that racial animus underlay\r\nthe action.  The objective of the burden-shifting framework is to\r\nassist the factfinder in determining whether discrimination has\r\noccurred.  Despite the shifting burdens of production, the\r\nplaintiff always remains responsible for proving such\r\ndiscrimination.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.  Thus, in a\r\ndisparate treatment case, \"so long as the employer's proffered\r\nreason is facially adequate to constitute a legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory justification for the employer's actions, the\r\ntrial court's focus in deciding a Rule 56 motion must be on the\r\nultimate question, not on the artificial striations of the burden-\r\nshifting framework.\"  Id. at 825.  In our de novo review of a\r\ndistrict court's summary judgment decision, we, too, must focus on\r\nthe ultimate question.\r\nWhere, as here, the plaintiff in a disparate treatment\r\nrace discrimination case offers comparative evidence in his quest\r\nto raise an inference of racial discrimination, he must provide a\r\nsuitable provenance for the evidence by showing that others\r\nsimilarly situated to him in all relevant respects were treated\r\ndifferently by the employer.  See Perkins, 78 F.3d at 751. \r\nReasonableness is the touchstone:  while the plaintiff's case and\r\nthe comparison cases that he advances need not be perfect replicas,\r\nthey must closely resemble one another in respect to relevant facts\r\nand circumstances.\r\nThe test is whether a prudent person, looking\r\nobjectively at the incidents, would think them\r\nroughly equivalent and the protagonists\r\nsimilarly situated.  Much as in the lawyer's\r\nart of distinguishing cases, the \"relevant\r\naspects\" are those factual elements which\r\ndetermine whether reasoned analogy supports,\r\nor demands, a like result.  Exact correlation\r\nis neither likely nor necessary, but the cases\r\nmust be fair congeners.  In other words,\r\napples should be compared with apples.\r\n\nDartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir.\r\n1989).\r\nTo continue the greengrocer's metaphor, the appellant in\r\nthis instance forswore apples and presented the district court with\r\ntwo persimmons and a pear.  Two proffered comparisons involve\r\nsituations wholly unlike his own and the third bears a passing\r\nresemblance to his case, but its essence is so different that the\r\nsuggested comparison is unreasonable.\r\nIn the first comparison case recounted by the appellant,\r\nA, a white male teacher at CRLS, shoved a male student.  Although\r\nthis conduct seemingly violated a school policy prohibiting the use\r\nof physical force by teachers against students, McGrath gave A only\r\na written warning.  We have no doubt that this conduct was\r\ninappropriate for the scholastic environment   but pushing a\r\nstudent is incomparable to the appellant's behavior in several\r\nrelevant aspects.\r\nThe improper use of physical force, on one hand, and\r\nsexual harassment, on the other hand, are qualitatively different\r\ninfractions.  They also create distinct problems in the school\r\nenvironment and present significantly different possibilities for\r\nremediation.  Here, moreover, it is undisputed that McGrath found\r\nA's act to have been taken without premeditated intent, but\r\nbelieved the uncontradicted evidence that the appellant had acted\r\ndeliberately (indeed, the witnesses agreed that he had laughed as\r\nhe handed the Application to his student).  All things considered,\r\nthe two incidents are not sufficiently alike to support a finding\r\nthat McGrath acted inconsistently in her handling of them.  Seeid.; see also Albert v. Carovano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508726\"><a href=\"/opinion/508726/braden-l-albert-francis-j-callard-julie-l-jones-gur-melamede-molly/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573-74 (2d Cir.\r\n1988) (en banc).\r\nThe appellant's second comparison introduces B, a white\r\nfemale CRLS teacher whom McGrath suspended for five days for\r\nstriking a male student and urging him to strike her in return. \r\nThis scenario is similar to that of A, both in that it involved the\r\nuse of physical force against a student and in that it bears little\r\nresemblance to the incident that the appellant provoked.  Again,\r\nphysical touching rather than words were involved, and there were\r\nno sexual overtones.  Of course, McGrath deemed B's conduct\r\ndeliberate, but this lone similarity is not enough to make the two\r\ncases, in the Dartmouth Review phrase, \"fair congeners.\"\r\n   C, a white male teacher and track coach at CRLS, is the\r\nsubject of the third attempted comparison.  C was accused of\r\nimproper conduct with black members of the boys' track team,\r\nincluding sexual touching and commenting about the size of team\r\nmembers' private parts.  C denied the accusations and other coaches\r\ntold McGrath that the alleged touching (patting young men on the\r\nbuttocks before a race) was common practice in certain competitive\r\nsports.  Faced with conflicting evidence and accounts, McGrath\r\nnegotiated a settlement with the teachers' union that placed C on\r\na one-year unpaid leave of absence from his position as track coach\r\nand required him to attend a seminar on racial sensitivity and\r\nrelated subjects.\r\n   On its facts, this vignette is more like the one that\r\nresulted in the appellant's dismissal   but in the end, the analogy\r\nfalls short.  No valid comparison can be drawn between two\r\nincidents for the purpose of proving disparate treatment if\r\n\"differentiating or mitigating circumstances\" distinguish either\r\nthe employee's conduct or the employer's response to it.  Perkins,\r\n78 F.3d at 751.  C, unlike the appellant, did not admit to the\r\nmisconduct that he was alleged to have committed.  His denials cast\r\na distinct light on his case as one founded on a serious conflict\r\nover background facts.  Because C had not conceded that he engaged\r\nin the charged conduct, McGrath had to worry that C might be found\r\ninnocent and that proceedings against him might result in no\r\ndisciplinary sanction whatever.  With these considerations in mind,\r\nMcGrath (even though she believed that C had engaged in\r\ninappropriate behavior) reasonably could have decided to negotiate\r\nsome discipline, rather than risk his ultimate exoneration by\r\nterminating his employment and precipitating a grievance.  No such\r\npossibilities were in play in the instant case, which involved only\r\na decision on discipline for conduct that admittedly occurred as\r\nreported.  We conclude, therefore, that although C's situation is\r\ncloser to the appellant's than either A's or B's, the circumstances\r\nvary sufficiently to distinguish McGrath's responses to them.\r\n   We summarize succinctly.  It is, of course, true that, in\r\nterms of comparative evidence, similarity, rather than\r\nidenticality, provides the essential requirement for an analogy. \r\nHere, however, the exemplars that the appellant touted to the court\r\nbelow bore too little similarity to the incident in question to\r\nfurnish a basis for suspecting racial discrimination.  It follows\r\nthat the district court did not err in refusing to draw the\r\nexaggerated inferences that the appellant requested.  And since the\r\nappellant pinned his hopes of showing pretext and racial animus\r\nsquarely on this evidence, its inadequacy compelled the district\r\ncourt to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\r\n                   B.  The First Amendment.\r\n   In addition to his discrimination claims, the appellant\r\nchallenged his ouster on the ground that it violated his rights\r\nunder the First Amendment (as incorporated against the states\r\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment).  This claim posited that, in\r\nhanding over the Application, the appellant was exercising his\r\nconstitutional rights to free speech and expression.  Because the\r\ndefendants terminated his employment due to that activity, this\r\nthesis runs, his dismissal amounted to a constitutional infraction. \r\nThe district court rejected this construct.  See Conward, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">151248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6-*7.  So do we.\r\n   In order to establish a prima facie case of a First\r\nAmendment violation in connection with the loss of public\r\nemployment, the erstwhile employee must show at a bare minimum both\r\nthat he was involved in protected activity and that such activity\r\nconstituted a motivating factor in his employer's decision to\r\ndischarge him.

Even though we credit for summary judgment\r\npurposes the appellant's assertion that he did not read the\r\ncontents of the Application beyond the title, his claim founders on\r\nthe first prong of this paradigm.\r\n   The appellant's endeavor to show that his activity  \r\nhanding the Application to the student   warranted First Amendment\r\nprotection encounters two obstacles.  The initial problem is that\r\nthe First Amendment protects only speech itself and other\r\nexpressive conduct that is \"inten[ded] to convey a particularized\r\nmessage\" under circumstances in which \"the likelihood [i]s great\r\nthat the message would be understood by those who view[] it.\" \r\nSpence v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109092\"><a href=\"/opinion/109092/spence-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410-11 (1974) (per curiam). \r\nEven if the appellant harbored an intent, as he now says, to\r\nsuggest by his transmittal of the Application that swear words were\r\ninapropos for a scholastic environment, it strikes us as highly\r\nunlikely that an adolescent pondering the lascivious questions that\r\nmake up the Application would have understood that message.\r\n   We need not probe this point too deeply for, even if the\r\nact of handing the document to the student were a type of activity\r\nthat could warrant First Amendment protection, the Application's\r\nindecent content permitted its regulation in a high-school setting. \r\nLet us be perfectly clear:  we do not suggest that the Application\r\nis \"obscene\" in the legal sense (and, thus, lawfully subject to\r\ncontent-based regulation under the First Amendment).  After all, to\r\ndetermine obscenity, a court must ask \"whether to the average\r\nperson, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant\r\ntheme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient\r\ninterest.\"  Roth v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105547\"><a href=\"/opinion/105547/roth-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 (1957). \r\nConsistent with the high degree of protection that our Constitution\r\naffords to freedom of speech and expression, this is a purposely\r\nnarrow definition.  Raw as the Application is, it does not fall\r\nwithin the cramped confines of legal obscenity.\r\n   Yet, the failure of the Application to sink to these\r\ndepths does not end the inquiry.  What a teacher may impart to his\r\npupils in a school environment is not determined by reference to\r\nconventional obscenity standards.  See Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v.\r\nFraser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111754\"><a href=\"/opinion/111754/bethel-school-dist-no-403-v-fraser/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682, 684-86 (1986); Keefe v.

Although those who work and study\r\nin a school environment do not abandon their First Amendment rights\r\nwhen they pass through the portals, see Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\r\nCommunity Sch.

This discretion includes not only the right to design\r\ncurricula and select textbooks, but also the right to impose\r\nregulations in order to ensure \"that readers or listeners are not\r\nexposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of\r\nmaturity.\"  Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111979\"><a href=\"/opinion/111979/hazelwood-school-dist-v-kuhlmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 271\r\n(1988).\r\n   Of course, the relevant legal framework strives to\r\nbalance the need for faculty and students to retain expressive\r\nrights against the need for school officials to maintain an\r\nappropriate educational environment.  Thus, regulations restricting\r\nclassroom speech are constitutional if, and to the extent that,\r\nthey are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns,\r\nprovided, however, that those who may choose to speak are given\r\nappropriate notice of what sorts of expressive conduct are out of\r\nbounds.  See Ward, 996 F.2d at 452.  Keeping scatological documents\r\naway from impressionable youngsters is certainly a reasonable\r\neducational objective.  See Bethel, 478 U.S. at 683-86.\r\n   The record in this case does not indicate whether the\r\nSchool Committee specifically proscribed by rule the in-school use\r\nof indecent language.  However, the Ward standard does not require\r\nschools to \"expressly prohibit every imaginable inappropriate\r\nconduct by teachers;\" the standard requires only that teachers be\r\nable reasonably to predict the types of conduct that are\r\nprohibited.  Ward, 996 F.2d at 454.  We find that the Massachusetts\r\nstatute permitting termination of a professional teacher for\r\n\"conduct unbecoming a teacher,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71,  42,\r\nfurnished sufficient notice under this standard that indecent\r\nspeech directed to students was impermissible.\r\n   That ends this phase of our inquiry.  Because the\r\nappellant's conduct was legitimately subject to regulation under\r\nthe First Amendment, the district court did not err in granting\r\nbrevis disposition on the \"freedom of expression\" claim.\r\n\n                       C.  Due Process.\r\n   In addition to his substantive claims, the appellant\r\nattacks the process accorded to him.  Under state law, a school\r\nboard can terminate the employment of tenured teachers only for\r\ncertain enumerated causes.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71,  42.  Even\r\nso, the School Committee's actions must take into account the\r\nprocedural protections afforded by the Due Process Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541 (1985); Board of Regents v. Roth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n576-78 (1972).\r\n   In the public employment context, the basic requirements\r\nof due process are notice of the charges brought against the job-\r\nholder and an opportunity to respond to them.  See Loudermill, 470\r\nU.S. at 546 (\"The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or\r\nwritten notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the\r\nemployer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the\r\nstory.\").  In this instance, the appellant received all the process\r\nthat was due.  At the September 30 meeting, McGrath and the School\r\nCommittee's lawyer recounted the charges, showed Conward witness\r\nstatements describing the Application incident, and offered him a\r\nchance to tell his version of events.\r\n   The appellant argues that this notice came too late to be\r\nconstitutionally adequate and that, because he had too little time\r\nto prepare, he was unable meaningfully to respond on the day in\r\nquestion.  Whatever force these plaints otherwise might have had\r\nwas dissipated when, before ending his employment, the defendants\r\nextended to him an additional invitation to furnish his version of\r\nrelevant events at a pre-termination hearing, see Mass. Gen. Laws\r\nch. 71,  42D, and the appellant explicitly declined the\r\ninvitation.  Having waived this golden opportunity to exercise his\r\ndue process rights, he cannot now be heard to decry their\r\ndeprivation.  See Cliff v. Board of Sch. Comm'rs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413-\r\n14 (7th Cir. 1994).  Because the appellant received the full\r\nprocedural panoply that the law prescribes, the district court\r\nappropriately rejected his due process claim.\r\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r\n   We need go no further.  The sanction that McGrath imposed\r\nadmittedly is harsh.  On this record, however, the appellant is\r\nunable to show, even in the limited way necessary to survive\r\nsummary judgment, that racial discrimination, unconstitutionally\r\nsuppressed expression, or the withholding of due process cost him\r\nhis job.  Consequently, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in\r\nthe defendants' favor.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
