(Repco) asserts  a right to retain  a payment made to  it by\r\n\nHealthco International, Inc.  (Healthco) shortly before  Healthco\r\n\ncommenced insolvency proceedings.   The  bankruptcy court  agreed\r\n\nwith  Repco  but  the Bankruptcy  Appellate  Panel  of  the First\r\n\nCircuit  (BAP) did  not.   Repco  appeals.   After ironing  out a\r\n\nprocedural wrinkle, we  uphold the BAP's core  determination that\r\n\nthe disputed payment  was not a transfer \"in  the ordinary course\r\n\nof business\"  within the meaning of 11  U.S.C.   547(c)(2)(1994).\r\n\nNevertheless, because the BAP misgauged  the posture of the case,\r\n\nwe vacate its judgment and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We draw our  account from the stipulated  record, which\r\n\nis  comprised of twenty-five  uncontested statements of  fact and\r\n\nthirteen exhibits (including various depositions and affidavits).\r\n\n          In  better   days,  Healthco  functioned  as   a  major\r\n\ndistributor of  dental equipment and  supplies.  In  August 1992,\r\n\nJames  Mills,  chief  executive  officer   of  Healthco's  parent\r\n\ncompany,  contacted  Fred  Zaegel, Repco's  owner,  to  explore a\r\n\nbusiness   relationship.      Mills,   who   knew   Zaegel   both\r\n\nprofessionally and socially,  proposed that Repco  (headquartered\r\n\nin St. Louis) print Healthco's  product catalog.  Zaegel  agreed.\r\n\nFrom  that  time  forward, Repco  handled  virtually  all  of the\r\n\ndiverse printing needs of Boston-based Healthco.\r\n\n          During  this   interlude,  Repco  extended   credit  to\r\n\nHealthco in accordance with standard printing  industry practice:\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nRepco  would bill contemporaneously  for each service,  and would\r\n\nanticipate  receiving   payment  in   sixty  days,   on  average,\r\n\nnotwithstanding contrary credit terms expressed in its invoices.1\r\n\nFor  its part, Healthco customarily would accumulate invoices and\r\n\nthen pay some (but not all) of  the accumulation by mailing Repco\r\n\na lump-sum company check.  Over the  period from the fall of 1992\r\n\nuntil  early  April of  the  following  year,  Healthco paid  one\r\n\nhundred fourteen  Repco invoices  with sixteen different  checks,\r\n\ntotalling around $400,000.\r\n\n          Whenever  Repco's  cash  flow ebbed,  it  was  Zaegel's\r\n\npractice  to contact customers and solicit payment of outstanding\r\n\ninvoices that were at least sixty days  old.  To this end, Zaegel\r\n\ncalled  Healthco's treasurer,  Arthur  Souza, on  four occasions.\r\n\nEach  time,  Souza  arranged  for  a  check  to  be  cut  shortly\r\n\nthereafter.\r\n\n          Despite  these  periodic   payments,  some  of  Repco's\r\n\nunrequited  invoices were  almost two  hundred days  old by  late\r\n\nMarch.  Zaegel tried to  prompt Souza once again, but experienced\r\n\ndifficulty in reaching him.   Zaegel then called Healthco's chief\r\n\nfinancial officer,  James Moyle.   Zaegel, who  never before  had\r\n\nmade a dunning call to Moyle, politely informed him that Healthco\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Repco's invoices  bore a net  ten days legend.   The record\r\nreflects,  however, that this  credit term was  honored mainly in\r\nthe breach; most  of Repco's customers (and, indeed, the majority\r\nof   firms  purchasing  services   in  the  competitive  printing\r\nindustry) ignored this stricture.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwas  holding numerous  Repco  invoices  that  were  substantially\r\n\noverdue.2   At the  conclusion of this  five-minute conversation,\r\n\nMoyle stated that he would investigate the matter.\r\n\n          Moyle vouchsafed in  his affidavit  that he  considered\r\n\nRepco to  be \"Healthco's  most pivotal  vendor  in the  company's\r\n\neffort to  overcome its financial  problems,\" presumably  because\r\n\nRepco was  about to  undertake the printing  and distribution  of\r\n\nHealthco's quarterly catalog.   He asked Souza  how much Healthco\r\n\nowed Repco and what was \"the fastest way\" to pay the debt.  Souza\r\n\nreplied  that Healthco  had in  hand  $235,558.64 in  outstanding\r\n\nRepco  invoices and  that  wire transfer  would  be the  quickest\r\n\npayment method.   Moyle directed  Souza to wire the  full amount.\r\n\nRepco  received  the funds  on  April  13,  1993.   That  payment\r\n\nsatisfied in  one fell  swoop sixty-eight  invoices ranging  from\r\n\nbrand new to two hundred days old.\r\n\n          Healthco sought the protection  of the bankruptcy court\r\n\non June 9, 1993.  The  firm's ledgers disclosed that it had  made\r\n\nonly two other wire transfers in satisfaction of antecedent debts\r\n\nduring  the  previous ninety  days.    The record  confirms  that\r\n\nHealthco's  trustee  in  bankruptcy,  William  A.  Brandt,   Jr.,\r\n\nsuccessfully  challenged both of  the other payments  as voidable\r\n\npreferences.\r\n\nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r          II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  record indicates that Zaegel was unaware of Healthco's\r\nfinancial  problems at this time;  that he discussed the past-due\r\ninvoices cordially with Moyle; and  that he neither threatened to\r\ncut off printing services nor demanded an immediate payment.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          In  due season,  the  trustee  brought  this  adversary\r\n\nproceeding seeking  to recover  the $235,558.64  payment.   Repco\r\n\ndefended on three grounds:  (1) that Healthco was solvent  at the\r\n\ntime  of the  transfer, (2)  that the  transfer was \"made  in the\r\n\nordinary course  of business\" within  the meaning of 11  U.S.C.  \r\n\n547(c)(2), and (3) that  in all events Repco's  services provided\r\n\n\"subsequent  new  value\"  within  the  meaning  of  11  U.S.C.   \r\n\n547(c)(4).  The  parties stipulated that Repco  had conferred new\r\n\nvalue in  the amount of $31,977.38, reducing  the trustee's claim\r\n\nagainst Repco to  $203,581.26 and removing the  \"new value\" issue\r\n\nfrom  the case.   The  bankruptcy court  then bifurcated  the two\r\n\nremaining  issues,  reserving  the  solvency  question for  later\r\n\nadjudication and proceeding  to tackle the applicability  vel non\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Repco's \"ordinary course of business\" defense.\r\n\n          The parties  cross-moved for  summary judgment on  this\r\n\nissue.   After  the bankruptcy  court  denied both  motions,  the\r\n\nparties  submitted the issue  on the stipulated  record described\r\n\nabove.   On  July 17,  1996, the  bankruptcy court  dismissed the\r\n\ntrustee's complaint.  The court's two-paragraph rescript reads in\r\n\nits entirety:\r\n\n          A  trial was scheduled in this matter for May\r\n          1, 1996.  However, the parties filed a motion\r\n          to submit  the matter on stipulated facts and\r\n          exhibits,  which  was  granted  on April  20,\r\n          1996.\r\n\n          In consideration of said  facts and exhibits,\r\n          the complaint is  dismissed by virtue  of the\r\n          ordinary  course  of  business  defense.    A\r\n          separate order will issue.\r\n\n          The  trustee filed a  timely notice  of appeal  and the\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nparties opted to have the appeal heard by the BAP (in lieu of the\r\n\ndistrict court).3  For reasons that are not readily apparent, the\r\n\nparties mutually invited de novo review of the bankruptcy court's\r\n\ndecision.  The BAP accepted  the invitation, determined that  the\r\n\nwire  transfer  had not  been  made  in  the ordinary  course  of\r\n\nbusiness,  and  ruled  that the  payment  was  \"preferential, and\r\n\nsubject to recovery by the Trustee under Section 547.\"  Brandt v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRepco Printers &amp; Lithographics, Inc. (In re Healthco), No. MW 96-\r                                                              \r\n\n026, slip op. at 12 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1997).  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          Bankruptcy cases differ  from most other federal  cases\r\n\nin  that  the court  of  appeals does  not  afford first-instance\r\n\nappellate review.  Rather, Congress has provided for intermediate\r\n\nreview,  conferring  on district  courts  and federal  bankruptcy\r\n\nappellate  panels the authority  to hear appeals  from bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt decisions, but preserving to the parties a right of further\r\n\nreview in the courts of  appeals.  See 28 U.S.C.    158.  Whether\r                                                \r\n\nsuch  an appeal comes to  us by way of  the district court or the\r\n\nBAP, our regimen is the same:  we focus on the bankruptcy court's\r\n\ndecision,  scrutinize that  court's findings  of  fact for  clear\r\n\nerror, and afford de novo review to  its conclusions of law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMartin v.  Bajgar (In re  Bajgar), 104  F.3d 495,  497 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3In this  circuit, bankruptcy  appellate panels  have had  a\r\nmixed history.   After a short-lived experiment, the  use of such\r\npanels  was discontinued  in  1983.   The First  Circuit Judicial\r\nCouncil  revivified the  BAP structure  on  July 1,  1996, giving\r\ninterested parties  the option of electing intermediate appellate\r\nreview before a  BAP panel rather than before  a federal district\r\ncourt.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n1997); Grella  v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank,  42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1994).   Since  this is  exactly the  same regimen  that the\r\n\nintermediate  appellate   tribunal  must   use,  we   exhibit  no\r\n\nparticular deference to the conclusions  of that tribunal (be  it\r\n\nthe district court or  the BAP).  See Palmacci v.  Umpierrez, 121\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 781, 785 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\n          We  now move  from the  general to  the specific.   The\r\n\ncrucial  issue  in  this  adversary  proceeding  revolves  around\r\n\nRepco's access to the \"ordinary course of business\" defense under\r\n\n11 U.S.C.   547(c)(2).  A bankruptcy court's construction of this\r\n\nstatute presents  a question of  law and  thus engenders  plenary\r\n\nreview.  See  Fidelity Sav. &amp; Inv.  Co. v. New Hope  Baptist, 880\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  1172,  1174  (10th  Cir.  1989).     A  bankruptcy  court's\r\n\nassessment in  connection  with  whether  the  statutory  defense\r\n\nappertains in  a given  case is  a horse  of  different hue;  the\r\n\nfindings  which  collectively  comprise such  an  assessment  are\r\n\nfactbound and thus engender clear-error review.  See Yurika Foods\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp. v. United Parcel Serv. (In re Yurika Foods Corp.), 888 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n42, 45  (6th  Cir. 1989).   Here,  the court's  rendition of  the\r\n\nstatute is unexceptional  and the only justiciable  issue relates\r\n\nto whether the  challenged transfer, as  a factual matter,  comes\r\n\nwithin  the statutory  sweep.    Hence,  the  bankruptcy  court's\r\n\ndecision normally  would be  reviewable for  clear  error.   This\r\n\nmeans,  of course,  that a  reviewing court  \"ought not  to upset\r\n\nfindings  of fact or  conclusions drawn therefrom  unless, on the\r\n\nwhole  of  the record,  [the  appellate  judges] form  a  strong,\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nunyielding belief  that a  mistake has been  made.\"   Cumpiano v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBanco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                              \r\n\n          This familiar  standard is  not diluted  merely because\r\n\nparties proceed on a stipulated record.  We long have held that a\r\n\nbankruptcy court's factual findings are entitled to the deference\r\n\ninherent in clear-error  review even when  they do not  implicate\r\n\nlive  testimony, but, rather, evolve entirely from a paper record\r\n\nthat is equally available to the reviewing court.   See Boroff v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTully  (In re Tully), 818  F.2d 106, 109  (1st Cir. 1987) (citing\r                             \r\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer  City, 470 U.S. 564, 574-75 (1985));\r                                            \r\n\nsee also RCI Northeast Servs. Div. v. Boston Edison Co., 822 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n199, 202  (1st Cir. 1987)  (explaining that \"findings of  fact do\r\n\nnot  forfeit `clearly  erroneous'  deference merely  because they\r\n\nstem from  a paper record\").4  The  soundness of this approach is\r\n\nconfirmed  by  Rule  7052  of  the Federal  Rules  of  Bankruptcy\r\n\nProcedure, which expressly adopts Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules\r\n\nof Civil Procedure.  The  latter rule, in its latest incarnation,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4To be sure, occasional statements of this court, if wrested\r\nfrom  context, might  appear to  suggest de  novo review  in such\r\ncircumstances.  See,  e.g., Brewer v. Madigan, 945  F.2d 449, 452\r                                                       \r\n(1st Cir. 1991).  Context provides a clearer perspective.  In the\r\ncases in which we purposed to  scrutinize a paper record de novo,\r\nthere were  no facts  in dispute.   Although a  stipulated record\r                                          \r\nsometimes will indicate the absence  of factual discord, that  is\r\nfar from universally  true.  See Vetter v.  Frosch, 599 F.2d 630,\r                                                            \r\n632  (5th  Cir.  1979) (\"Many  cases  are  tried  on depositions,\r\ncounter-affidavits,  and stipulated  records,  where the  parties\r\nknow there  are issues of  fact which  must be resolved,  but are\r\ncontent to have them resolved on the basis of written, as opposed\r\nto oral,  testimony  and evidence.\").    Here, the  existence  of\r\ngenuine factual issues is made manifest by the bankruptcy court's\r\nwell-founded denial  of  the parties'  cross-motions for  summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nprovides in pertinent part:   \"Findings of fact, whether based on\r                                                                           \r\n\noral  or documentary  evidence,  shall not  be  set aside  unless\r                                        \r\n\nclearly  erroneous,  and   due  regard  shall  be  given  to  the\r\n\nopportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the\r\n\nwitnesses.\"  (Emphasis supplied).\r\n\n          Notwithstanding  the   obvious  applicability   of  the\r\n\n\"clearly erroneous\" standard to the case at hand, there is a rub.\r\n\nThe parties both  urged the BAP to review  the bankruptcy court's\r\n\ndecision de novo  and to resolve the issue  of whether Healthco's\r\n\ntransfer of funds to Repco escapes classification as a preference\r\n\nwithout affording any  special respect to the  bankruptcy court's\r\n\nfactual determinations.   The  BAP yielded  to this  importuning.\r\n\nSee In  re Healthco,  supra, slip op.  at 5.   What is  more, the\r                                     \r\n\nlitigants  are united  in their  insistence that we,  too, should\r\n\nessay plenary,  nondeferential review  of the bankruptcy  court's\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n          Under these  peculiar  circumstances,  we  are  tempted\r\n\nsimply  to honor  the parties'  request.   Cf.  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nTaylor, 54  F.3d 967,  971 (1st Cir.  1995) (warning  that \"[t]he\r                \r\n\nproblem with  wishes is that  they sometimes come  true\") (citing\r\n\nAesop).    For one  thing,  the  bankruptcy  court's  failure  to\r\n\narticulate   any  particularized   factual   findings  not   only\r\n\ncontradicts the  rules of  practice, see Fed.  R. Bankr.  P. 7052\r                                                  \r\n\n(adopting Fed. R.  Civ.

Declining to do so would risk \"plac[ing] a premium\r\n\non  agreeable acquiescence  to perceivable  error as a  weapon of\r\n\nappellate advocacy.\"  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc.,  972 F.2d  453, 459  (1st Cir.  1992) (quoting  Merchant v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRuhle, 740 F.2d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1984)).\r               \r\n\n          This  is an interesting concatenation of events, but we\r\n\nneed not decide whether we should hold the parties to the invited\r\n\nerror;  in this  instance, all  roads  lead to  Rome because  our\r\n\nchoice between  the two standards  of review will not  affect the\r\n\noutcome on  appeal.

THE MERITS\r          IV.  THE MERITS\r\n\n          In order  to guard  against favoritism  in the  face of\r\n\nlooming  insolvency, the  Bankruptcy  Code provides  that certain\r\n\npayments  made by  the debtor  within ninety  days  preceding the\r\n\ninstitution   of   bankruptcy   proceedings   are   voidable   as\r\n\npreferences.  See 11 U.S.C.   547(b).  This rule is not ironclad.\r                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Of  course,  if   a  reviewing  court  determines   that  a\r\nbankruptcy court's findings are too indistinct, it may decline to\r\nproceed  further and  remand for  more explicit  findings.   This\r\navenue was open to the BAP and it is equally open to us.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nThus, the Code holds harmless transfers made by the debtor during\r\n\nthe  ninety-day   preference  period  if  certain   criteria  are\r\n\nsatisfied.    Specifically, a bankruptcy trustee may  not annul a\r\n\npreference-period transfer to the extent that the transfer was\r\n\n          (A)  in payment  of a  debt  incurred by  the\r\n          debtor in the ordinary course of business . .\r\n          . [between] the debtor and the transferee;\r\n          (B) made in the ordinary course of business .\r\n          . . of the debtor and the transferee; and\r\n          (C)  made  according   to  ordinary  business\r\n          terms[.]\r\n\n11 U.S.C.    547(c)(2).   The rationale behind this  carve-out is\r\n\nclear:   because \"the  general policy  of the  preference section\r\n\n[is] to  discourage unusual  action by either  the debtor  or his\r\n\ncreditors  during  the  debtor's  slide  into   bankruptcy,\"  the\r\n\nordinary    course   exemption    promotes   the    corresponding\r\n\ncongressional  desire  \"to  leave  undisturbed  normal  financial\r\n\nrelations.\"    H.R.  Rep.  No.  595  (1977),  reprinted  in  1978\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6329.\r\n\n          The  statute   itself  is   uninstructive  as   to  the\r\n\ndefinition  of the  term \"ordinary course  of business.\"   Courts\r\n\nabhor  interpretive vacuums,  and  they  have  filled  this  one,\r\n\narticulating  several factors that bear upon whether a particular\r\n\ntransfer  warrants  protection under  section  547(c)(2).   These\r\n\nfactors  include  the  amount  transferred,  the  timing  of  the\r\n\npayment, the historic course  of dealings between the debtor  and\r\n\nthe  transferee, and the  circumstances under which  the transfer\r\n\nwas effected.   See  In re Yurika  Foods, 888  F.2d at  45; First\r                                                                           \r\n\nSoftware Corp. v.  Curtis Mfg. Co. (In re  First Software Corp.),\r                                                                         \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n81 B.R. 211, 212 (Bankr.  D. Mass. 1988).  After  considering the\r\n\nrecord  evidence  in  light  of  these  factors,  we  are  firmly\r\n\nconvinced   that  the  transfer   from  Healthco  to   Repco  was\r\n\nextraordinary  and that  the bankruptcy  court  clearly erred  in\r\n\nfinding otherwise.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          The  amount  of  the  payment  was  uncommonly   large;\r\n\nHealthco never before had  made a lump-sum payment to Repco in an\r\n\namount approaching $235,000.6   Put another way,  the payment was\r\n\nnearly  ten  times  as  large  as the  average  of  the  payments\r\n\npreviously made by the debtor to Repco.  Then, too, the timing of\r\n\nthe payment was highly suspicious.  It lumped old  and new bills,\r\n\nand  in the  process, liquidated  several invoices  that  were by\r\n\naccounting  standards ancient (i.e.,  more than ninety  days old)\r\n\nand several that were  prepubescent (i.e., less than thirty  days\r\n\nold).7     There   were,  moreover,   virtually   no  significant\r\n\nsimilarities between  the challenged  payment and  the antecedent\r\n\ncourse  of  dealings  between  the parties.    For  example,  the\r\n\ndisputed  transfer  marked  the  first   occasion  that  Healthco\r\n\nventured to  pay all  its outstanding  Repco invoices,  the first\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6To  be sure,  as Repco  points  out, the  magnitude of  the\r\npayment is  attributable in some  measure to a single  invoice in\r\nthe sum of $96,689.19.  This circumstance does not contradict the\r\nconclusion that the payment was  abnormal.  The fact remains that\r\nHealthco  remitted over $235,000  in satisfaction  of sixty-eight\r\nseparate Repco invoices, thereby  dwarfing earlier remittances as\r\nto both the number of invoices and the total dollars involved.\r\n\n     7As the  BAP noted, roughly  fifty percent  of the  invoices\r\nsatisfied  by  the wire  transfer  fell  into  one of  these  two\r\ncategories.   See In  re Healthco,  supra, slip  op. at  10.   By\r                                                   \r\ncontrast, very old  and very new invoices comprised  no more than\r\nfifteen percent of any group of invoices previously paid.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ntime that  Healthco wired funds to Repco, and the first time that\r\n\nHealthco's  chief financial  officer interceded  to effectuate  a\r\n\npayment to Repco.   Inasmuch as the hallmark of a  payment in the\r\n\nordinary course is consistency with prior practice, see WJM, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Massachusetts Dep't  of Pub. Welfare, 840 F.2d  996, 1011 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1988), this string of \"firsts\" is telling.\r\n\n          The circumstances surrounding  the wire transfer clinch\r\n\nthe  matter.  Healthco  owed money to hundreds  of creditors.  Of\r\n\nthese,  it  paid  only  Repco,  Kerr  Manufacturing,  and  Clarke\r\n\nIndustries in full by wire transfer during the preference period.\r\n\nAll three of these businesses had detectable links  to Healthco's\r\n\nprincipals:  Thomas  Hicks, chairman and chief  executive officer\r\n\nof  the firm  that owned  Healthco Holding  Co. (which,  in turn,\r\n\nowned Healthco),  was a director  and beneficial owner  of Kerr's\r\n\nparent  corporation; James  Mills, chairman  of  Healthco Holding\r\n\nCo., chaired the  board of Clarke's parent company  and served as\r\n\nits chief executive  officer; and as mentioned  above, Mills also\r\n\nhad a longstanding  relationship with Repco's proprietor.   Apart\r\n\nfrom   these  special  relationships,   there  is  no  reasonable\r\n\nexplanation  for preferment  of  the three  creditors.   This  is\r\n\nespecially true of  Repco; as Zaegel himself testified during his\r\n\ndeposition,  it is general  industry custom  to \"pay  the printer\r\n\nlast.\"\r\n\n          Other  circumstances  associated  with  the  challenged\r\n\ntransfer   highlight   the    importance   of   Repco's   special\r\n\nrelationship.   Souza,  Healthco's treasurer,  testified that  by\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nFebruary 1993  decisions about  which creditors  were to  be paid\r\n\nwhen were being  made by a committee of  Healthco executives; yet\r\n\nMoyle overrode  this mechanism to  effect the Repco payment.   At\r\n\nthe same time, it was clear both from Zaegel's kid-glove approach\r\n\nand  from the  competitive nature  of the printing  industry that\r\n\nRepco's continued service  did not hinge upon  Healthco's payment\r\n\nof all  outstanding  debt as  celeritously  as possible.    Thus,\r\n\nMoyle's claim  that he  directed the payment  to be  made because\r\n\nRepco was \"pivotal\" to Healthco's operations is entitled to  very\r\n\nlittle weight.\r\n\n          We need  go no  further.   The circumstantial  evidence\r\n\nfully  persuades us  that the  debtor deviated  sharply  from its\r\n\ncustomary business practices to favor a select trio of creditors,\r\n\nRepco  included.   This is  precisely  the type  of preferment   \r\n\ntaking  care  of  a  few  well-connected  vendors  while  playing\r\n\nhardball with  the general multitude    that the drafters  of the\r\n\nBankruptcy Code  intended to curtail.   See Lawson v.  Ford Motor\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.

Therefore,  we  affirm  the  BAP's\r\n\ndetermination  that, contrary to the bankruptcy court's view, the\r\n\nchallenged  transfer  was  not  made in  the  ordinary  course of\r\n\nbusiness.\r\n\n          Unlike the BAP, however, we  do not believe that such a\r\n\ndetermination clears the way for judgment on the trustee's claim.\r\n\nThe  bankruptcy court reserved the issue of Healthco's insolvency\r\n\n  an essential element  of the preference claim    and that issue\r\n\nremains open.  Consequently, we must vacate the BAP's judgment to\r\n\nthat extent  and remand to  the BAP with  directions that  it, in\r\n\nturn, remand  the  cause  to the  bankruptcy  court  for  further\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\n          Affirmed in part,  vacated in part,  and remanded.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw our account from the stipulated record, which is comprised of twenty-five uncontested statements of fact and thirteen exhibits (including various depositions and affidavits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In better days, Healthco functioned as a major distributor of dental equipment and supplies.  In August 1992, James Mills, chief executive officer of Healthco's parent company, contacted Fred Zaegel, Repco's owner, to explore a business relationship.  Mills, who knew Zaegel both professionally and socially, proposed that Repco (headquartered in St. Louis) print Healthco's product catalog.  Zaegel agreed.  From that time forward, Repco handled virtually all of the diverse printing needs of Boston-based Healthco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this interlude, Repco extended credit to Healthco in accordance with standard printing industry practice:  Repco would bill contemporaneously for each service, and would anticipate receiving payment in sixty days, on average, notwithstanding contrary credit terms expressed in its invoices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For its part, Healthco customarily would accumulate invoices and then pay some (but not all) of the accumulation by mailing Repco a lump-sum company check.  Over the period from the fall of 1992 until early April of the following year, Healthco paid one hundred fourteen Repco invoices with sixteen different checks, totalling around $400,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever Repco's cash flow ebbed, it was Zaegel's practice to contact customers and solicit payment of outstanding invoices that were at least sixty days old.  To this end, Zaegel called Healthco's treasurer, Arthur Souza, on four occasions.  Each time, Souza arranged for a check to be cut shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these periodic payments, some of Repco's unrequited invoices were almost two hundred days old by late March.  Zaegel tried to prompt Souza once again, but experienced difficulty in reaching him.  Zaegel then called Healthco's chief financial officer, James Moyle.  Zaegel, who never before had made a dunning call to Moyle, politely informed him that Healthco was holding numerous Repco invoices that were substantially overdue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At the conclusion of this five-minute conversation, Moyle stated that he would investigate the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moyle vouchsafed in his affidavit that he considered Repco to be \"Healthco's most pivotal vendor in the company's effort to overcome its financial problems,\" presumably because Repco was about to undertake the printing and distribution of Healthco's quarterly catalog.  He asked Souza how much Healthco owed Repco and what was \"the fastest way\" to pay the debt.  Souza replied that Healthco had in hand $235,558.64 in outstanding Repco invoices and that wire transfer would be the quickest payment method.  Moyle directed Souza to wire the full amount.  Repco received the funds on April 13, 1993.  That payment satisfied in one fell swoop sixty-eight invoices ranging from brand new to two hundred days old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healthco sought the protection of the bankruptcy court on June 9, 1993.  The firm's ledgers disclosed that it had made only two other wire transfers in satisfaction of antecedent debts during the previous ninety days.  The record confirms that Healthco's trustee in bankruptcy, William A. Brandt, Jr., successfully challenged both of the other payments as voidable preferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the trustee brought this adversary proceeding seeking to recover the $235,558.64 payment.  Repco defended on three grounds:  (1) that Healthco was solvent at the time of the transfer, (2) that the transfer was \"made in the ordinary course of business\" within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2), and (3) that in all events Repco's services provided \"subsequent new value\" within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(4).  The parties stipulated that Repco had conferred new value in the amount of $31,977.38, reducing the trustee's claim against Repco to $203,581.26 and removing the \"new value\" issue from the case.  The bankruptcy court then bifurcated the two remaining issues, reserving the solvency question for later adjudication and proceeding to tackle the applicability vel non of Repco's \"ordinary course of business\" defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on this issue.  After the bankruptcy court denied both motions, the parties submitted the issue on the stipulated record described above.  On July 17, 1996, the bankruptcy court dismissed the trustee's complaint.  The court's two-paragraph rescript reads in its entirety:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A trial was scheduled in this matter for May 1, 1996.  However, the parties filed a motion to submit the matter on stipulated facts and exhibits, which was granted on April 20, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In consideration of said facts and exhibits, the complaint is dismissed by virtue of the ordinary course of business defense.  A separate order will issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee filed a timely notice of appeal and the parties opted to have the appeal heard by the BAP (in lieu of the district court).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  For reasons that are not readily apparent, the parties mutually invited de novo review of the bankruptcy court's decision.  The BAP accepted the invitation, determined that the wire transfer had not been made in the ordinary course of business, and ruled that the payment was \"preferential, and subject to recovery by the Trustee under Section 547.\"  Brandt v. Repco Printers &amp; Lithographics, Inc.  (In re Healthco ), No. MW 96-026, slip op. at 12 (1st Cir.  BAP 1997).  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bankruptcy cases differ from most other federal cases in that the court of appeals does not afford first-instance appellate review.  Rather, Congress has provided for intermediate review, conferring on district courts and federal bankruptcy appellate panels the authority to hear appeals from bankruptcy court decisions, but preserving to the parties a right of further review in the courts of appeals.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158.  Whether such an appeal comes to us by way of the district court or the BAP, our regimen is the same:  we focus on the bankruptcy court's decision, scrutinize that court's findings of fact for clear error, and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law.  See Martin v. Bajgar (In re Bajgar ), 104 F.3d 495, 497 (1st Cir.1997);  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1994).  Since this is exactly the same regimen that the intermediate appellate tribunal must use, we exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of that tribunal (be it the district court or the BAP).  See Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 785 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now move from the general to the specific.  The crucial issue in this adversary proceeding revolves around Repco's access to the \"ordinary course of business\" defense under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2).  A bankruptcy court's construction of this statute presents a question of law and thus engenders plenary review.  See Fidelity Sav. &amp; Inv. Co. v. New Hope Baptist, 880 F.2d 1172, 1174 (10th Cir.1989).  A bankruptcy court's assessment in connection with whether the statutory defense appertains in a given case is a horse of different hue;  the findings which collectively comprise such an assessment are factbound and thus engender clear-error review.  See Yurika Foods Corp. v. United Parcel Serv.  (In re Yurika Foods Corp.), 888 F.2d 42, 45 (6th Cir.1989).  Here, the court's rendition of the statute is unexceptional and the only justiciable issue relates to whether the challenged transfer, as a factual matter, comes within the statutory sweep.  Hence, the bankruptcy court's decision normally would be reviewable for clear error.  This means, of course, that a reviewing court \"ought not to upset findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless, on the whole of the record, [the appellate judges] form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This familiar standard is not diluted merely because parties proceed on a stipulated record.  We long have held that a bankruptcy court's factual findings are entitled to the deference inherent in clear-error review even when they do not implicate live testimony, but, rather, evolve entirely from a paper record that is equally available to the reviewing court.  See Boroff v. Tully (In re Tully ), 818 F.2d 106, 109 (1st Cir.1987) (citing Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574-75, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985));  see also RCI Northeast Servs.  Div. v. Boston Edison Co., 822 F.2d 199, 202 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining that \"findings of fact do not forfeit 'clearly erroneous' deference merely because they stem from a paper record\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The soundness of this approach is confirmed by Rule 7052 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which expressly adopts Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The latter rule, in its latest incarnation, provides in pertinent part:  \"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\"  (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the obvious applicability of the \"clearly erroneous\" standard to the case at hand, there is a rub.  The parties both urged the BAP to review the bankruptcy court's decision de novo and to resolve the issue of whether Healthco's transfer of funds to Repco escapes classification as a preference without affording any special respect to the bankruptcy court's factual determinations.  The BAP yielded to this importuning.  See In re Healthco, supra, slip op. at 5. What is more, the litigants are united in their insistence that we, too, should essay plenary, nondeferential review of the bankruptcy court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these peculiar circumstances, we are tempted simply to honor the parties' request.  Cf. United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 971 (1st Cir.1995) (warning that \"[t]he problem with wishes is that they sometimes come true\") (citing Aesop).  For one thing, the bankruptcy court's failure to articulate any particularized factual findings not only contradicts the rules of practice, see Fed.  R. Bankr.P. 7052 (adopting Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)'s requirement that \"the court shall find the facts specially\"), but also makes clear-error review exceptionally difficult.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  For another thing, the parties invited the BAP to indulge in de novo review and, at oral argument in this court, they continued to urge that we follow that course.  Declining to do so would risk \"plac[ing] a premium on agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.\"  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 459 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Merchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86, 92 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an interesting concatenation of events, but we need not decide whether we should hold the parties to the invited error;  in this instance, all roads lead to Rome because our choice between the two standards of review will not affect the outcome on appeal.  In short, this case is sufficiently plain that, whether we bow to the parties' wishes and afford de novo review or bow to convention and employ the more deferential \"clearly erroneous\" rubric, we, like the BAP, would be compelled to set aside the bankruptcy court's contrary determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to guard against favoritism in the face of looming insolvency, the Bankruptcy Code provides that certain payments made by the debtor within ninety days preceding the institution of bankruptcy proceedings are voidable as preferences.  See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b).  This rule is not ironclad.  Thus, the Code holds harmless transfers made by the debtor during the ninety-day preference period if certain criteria are satisfied.  Specifically, a bankruptcy trustee may not annul a preference-period transfer to the extent that the transfer was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(A) in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business ... [between] the debtor and the transferee;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>(B) made in the ordinary course of business ... of the debtor and the transferee;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(C) made according to ordinary business terms[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2).  The rationale behind this carve-out is clear:  because \"the general policy of the preference section [is] to discourage unusual action by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor's slide into bankruptcy,\" the ordinary course exemption promotes the corresponding congressional desire \"to leave undisturbed normal financial relations.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 595 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6329.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute itself is uninstructive as to the definition of the term \"ordinary course of business.\"   Courts abhor interpretive vacuums, and they have filled this one, articulating several factors that bear upon whether a particular transfer warrants protection under section 547(c)(2).  These factors include the amount transferred, the timing of the payment, the historic course of dealings between the debtor and the transferee, and the circumstances under which the transfer was effected.  See In re Yurika Foods, 888 F.2d at 45;  First Software Corp. v. Curtis Mfg. Co.  (In re First Software Corp.), 81 B.R. 211, 212 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988).  After considering the record evidence in light of these factors, we are firmly convinced that the transfer from Healthco to Repco was extraordinary and that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding otherwise.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amount of the payment was uncommonly large;  Healthco never before had made a lump-sum payment to Repco in an amount approaching $235,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Put another way, the payment was nearly ten times as large as the average of the payments previously made by the debtor to Repco.  Then, too, the timing of the payment was highly suspicious.  It lumped old and new bills, and in the process, liquidated several invoices that were by accounting standards ancient (i.e., more than ninety days old) and several that were prepubescent (i.e., less than thirty days old).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  There were, moreover, virtually no significant similarities between the challenged payment and the antecedent course of dealings between the parties.  For example, the disputed transfer marked the first occasion that Healthco ventured to pay all its outstanding Repco invoices, the first time that Healthco wired funds to Repco, and the first time that Healthco's chief financial officer interceded to effectuate a payment to Repco.  Inasmuch as the hallmark of a payment in the ordinary course is consistency with prior practice, see WJM, Inc. v. Massachusetts Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 840 F.2d 996, 1011 (1st Cir.1988), this string of \"firsts\" is telling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances surrounding the wire transfer clinch the matter.  Healthco owed money to hundreds of creditors.  Of these, it paid only Repco, Kerr Manufacturing, and Clarke Industries in full by wire transfer during the preference period.  All three of these businesses had detectable links to Healthco's principals:  Thomas Hicks, chairman and chief executive officer of the firm that owned Healthco Holding Co.  (which, in turn, owned Healthco), was a director and beneficial owner of Kerr's parent corporation;  James Mills, chairman of Healthco Holding Co., chaired the board of Clarke's parent company and served as its chief executive officer;  and as mentioned above, Mills also had a longstanding relationship with Repco's proprietor.  Apart from these special relationships, there is no reasonable explanation for preferment of the three creditors.  This is especially true of Repco;  as Zaegel himself testified during his deposition, it is general industry custom to \"pay the printer last.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circumstances associated with the challenged transfer highlight the importance of Repco's special relationship.  Souza, Healthco's treasurer, testified that by February 1993 decisions about which creditors were to be paid when were being made by a committee of Healthco executives;  yet Moyle overrode this mechanism to effect the Repco payment.  At the same time, it was clear both from Zaegel's kid-glove approach and from the competitive nature of the printing industry that Repco's continued service did not hinge upon Healthco's payment of all outstanding debt as celeritously as possible.  Thus, Moyle's claim that he directed the payment to be made because Repco was \"pivotal\" to Healthco's operations is entitled to very little weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The circumstantial evidence fully persuades us that the debtor deviated sharply from its customary business practices to favor a select trio of creditors, Repco included.  This is precisely the type of preferment--taking care of a few well-connected vendors while playing hardball with the general multitude--that the drafters of the Bankruptcy Code intended to curtail.  See Lawson v. Ford Motor Co.  (In re Roblin Indus.), 78 F.3d 30, 40 (2d Cir.1996) (explaining that \"equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor\" is one goal of the preference provision) (quoting legislative history).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Repco's other arguments are unconvincing and we reject them without elaboration.  It suffices to say that the circumstances surrounding the challenged transfer amply evince its extraordinary nature.  Therefore, we affirm the BAP's determination that, contrary to the bankruptcy court's view, the challenged transfer was not made in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the BAP, however, we do not believe that such a determination clears the way for judgment on the trustee's claim.  The bankruptcy court reserved the issue of Healthco's insolvency--an essential element of the preference claim--and that issue remains open.  Consequently, we must vacate the BAP's judgment to that extent and remand to the BAP with directions that it, in turn, remand the cause to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Repco's invoices bore a net ten days legend.  The record reflects, however, that this credit term was honored mainly in the breach;  most of Repco's customers (and, indeed, the majority of firms purchasing services in the competitive printing industry) ignored this stricture</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record indicates that Zaegel was unaware of Healthco's financial problems at this time;  that he discussed the past-due invoices cordially with Moyle;  and that he neither threatened to cut off printing services nor demanded an immediate payment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In this circuit, bankruptcy appellate panels have had a mixed history.  After a short-lived experiment, the use of such panels was discontinued in 1983.  The First Circuit Judicial Council revivified the BAP structure on July 1, 1996, giving interested parties the option of electing intermediate appellate review before a BAP panel rather than before a federal district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be sure, occasional statements of this court, if wrested from context, might appear to suggest de novo review in such circumstances.  See, e.g., Brewer v. Madigan, 945 F.2d 449, 452 (1st Cir.1991).  Context provides a clearer perspective.  In the cases in which we purposed to scrutinize a paper record de novo, there were no facts in dispute.   Although a stipulated record sometimes will indicate the absence of factual discord, that is far from universally true.  See Vetter v. Frosch, 599 F.2d 630, 632 (5th Cir.1979) (\"Many cases are tried on depositions, counter-affidavits, and stipulated records, where the parties know there are issues of fact which must be resolved, but are content to have them resolved on the basis of written, as opposed to oral, testimony and evidence.\").  Here, the existence of genuine factual issues is made manifest by the bankruptcy court's well-founded denial of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Of course, if a reviewing court determines that a bankruptcy court's findings are too indistinct, it may decline to proceed further and remand for more explicit findings.  This avenue was open to the BAP and it is equally open to us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To be sure, as Repco points out, the magnitude of the payment is attributable in some measure to a single invoice in the sum of $96,689.19.  This circumstance does not contradict the conclusion that the payment was abnormal.  The fact remains that Healthco remitted over $235,000 in satisfaction of sixty-eight separate Repco invoices, thereby dwarfing earlier remittances as to both the number of invoices and the total dollars involved</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> As the BAP noted, roughly fifty percent of the invoices satisfied by the wire transfer fell into one of these two categories.  See In re Healthco, supra, slip op. at 10.   By contrast, very old and very new invoices comprised no more than fifteen percent of any group of invoices previously paid</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The other main goal of the preference provision--precluding the debtor \"from trying to stave off the evil day by giving preferential treatment to his most importunate creditors,\" In re Tolona Pizza Prods.

(Repco) asserts a right to retain a payment made to it by Healthco International, Inc. (Healthco) shortly before Healthco commenced insolvency proceedings.  The bankruptcy court agreed with Repco but the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the First Circuit (BAP) did not.  Repco appeals.  After ironing out a procedural wrinkle, we uphold the BAP's core determination that the disputed payment was not a transfer \"in the ordinary course of business\" within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2)(1994).  Nevertheless, because the BAP misgauged the posture of the case, we vacate its judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw our account from the stipulated record, which is comprised of twenty-five uncontested statements of fact and thirteen exhibits (including various depositions and affidavits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In better days, Healthco functioned as a major distributor of dental equipment and supplies.  In August 1992, James Mills, chief executive officer of Healthco's parent company, contacted Fred Zaegel, Repco's owner, to explore a business relationship.  Mills, who knew Zaegel both professionally and socially, proposed that Repco (headquartered in St. Louis) print Healthco's product catalog.  Zaegel agreed.  From that time forward, Repco handled virtually all of the diverse printing needs of Boston-based Healthco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this interlude, Repco extended credit to Healthco in accordance with standard printing industry practice:  Repco would bill contemporaneously for each service, and would anticipate receiving payment in sixty days, on average, notwithstanding contrary credit terms expressed in its invoices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For its part, Healthco customarily would accumulate invoices and then pay some (but not all) of the accumulation by mailing Repco a lump-sum company check.  Over the period from the fall of 1992 until early April of the following year, Healthco paid one hundred fourteen Repco invoices with sixteen different checks, totalling around $400,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever Repco's cash flow ebbed, it was Zaegel's practice to contact customers and solicit payment of outstanding invoices that were at least sixty days old.  To this end, Zaegel called Healthco's treasurer, Arthur Souza, on four occasions.  Each time, Souza arranged for a check to be cut shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these periodic payments, some of Repco's unrequited invoices were almost two hundred days old by late March.  Zaegel tried to prompt Souza once again, but experienced difficulty in reaching him.  Zaegel then called Healthco's chief financial officer, James Moyle.  Zaegel, who never before had made a dunning call to Moyle, politely informed him that Healthco was holding numerous Repco invoices that were substantially overdue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  At the conclusion of this five-minute conversation, Moyle stated that he would investigate the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moyle vouchsafed in his affidavit that he considered Repco to be \"Healthco's most pivotal vendor in the company's effort to overcome its financial problems,\" presumably because Repco was about to undertake the printing and distribution of Healthco's quarterly catalog.  He asked Souza how much Healthco owed Repco and what was \"the fastest way\" to pay the debt.  Souza replied that Healthco had in hand $235,558.64 in outstanding Repco invoices and that wire transfer would be the quickest payment method.  Moyle directed Souza to wire the full amount.  Repco received the funds on April 13, 1993.  That payment satisfied in one fell swoop sixty-eight invoices ranging from brand new to two hundred days old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healthco sought the protection of the bankruptcy court on June 9, 1993.  The firm's ledgers disclosed that it had made only two other wire transfers in satisfaction of antecedent debts during the previous ninety days.  The record confirms that Healthco's trustee in bankruptcy, William A. Brandt, Jr., successfully challenged both of the other payments as voidable preferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, the trustee brought this adversary proceeding seeking to recover the $235,558.64 payment.  Repco defended on three grounds:  (1) that Healthco was solvent at the time of the transfer, (2) that the transfer was \"made in the ordinary course of business\" within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2), and (3) that in all events Repco's services provided \"subsequent new value\" within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(4).  The parties stipulated that Repco had conferred new value in the amount of $31,977.38, reducing the trustee's claim against Repco to $203,581.26 and removing the \"new value\" issue from the case.  The bankruptcy court then bifurcated the two remaining issues, reserving the solvency question for later adjudication and proceeding to tackle the applicability vel non of Repco's \"ordinary course of business\" defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on this issue.  After the bankruptcy court denied both motions, the parties submitted the issue on the stipulated record described above.  On July 17, 1996, the bankruptcy court dismissed the trustee's complaint.  The court's two-paragraph rescript reads in its entirety:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A trial was scheduled in this matter for May 1, 1996.  However, the parties filed a motion to submit the matter on stipulated facts and exhibits, which was granted on April 20, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In consideration of said facts and exhibits, the complaint is dismissed by virtue of the ordinary course of business defense.  A separate order will issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee filed a timely notice of appeal and the parties opted to have the appeal heard by the BAP (in lieu of the district court).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  For reasons that are not readily apparent, the parties mutually invited de novo review of the bankruptcy court's decision.  The BAP accepted the invitation, determined that the wire transfer had not been made in the ordinary course of business, and ruled that the payment was \"preferential, and subject to recovery by the Trustee under Section 547.\"  Brandt v. Repco Printers &amp; Lithographics, Inc.  (In re Healthco ), No. MW 96-026, slip op. at 12 (1st Cir.  BAP 1997).  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bankruptcy cases differ from most other federal cases in that the court of appeals does not afford first-instance appellate review.  Rather, Congress has provided for intermediate review, conferring on district courts and federal bankruptcy appellate panels the authority to hear appeals from bankruptcy court decisions, but preserving to the parties a right of further review in the courts of appeals.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 158.  Whether such an appeal comes to us by way of the district court or the BAP, our regimen is the same:  we focus on the bankruptcy court's decision, scrutinize that court's findings of fact for clear error, and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law.  See Martin v. Bajgar (In re Bajgar ), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733245\"><a href=\"/opinion/733245/in-re-juraj-j-bajgar-debtor-carol-b-martin-administrator-of-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 497 (1st Cir.1997);  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684074\"><a href=\"/opinion/684074/paul-j-grella-trustee-v-salem-five-cent-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1994).  Since this is exactly the same regimen that the intermediate appellate tribunal must use, we exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of that tribunal (be it the district court or the BAP).  See Palmacci v. Umpierrez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></span>, 785 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now move from the general to the specific.  The crucial issue in this adversary proceeding revolves around Repco's access to the \"ordinary course of business\" defense under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2).  A bankruptcy court's construction of this statute presents a question of law and thus engenders plenary review.  See Fidelity Sav. &amp; Inv. Co. v. New Hope Baptist, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526816\"><a href=\"/opinion/526816/fidelity-savings-investment-co-v-new-hope-baptist-robert-stone-jeffrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></a></span>, 1174 (10th Cir.1989).  A bankruptcy court's assessment in connection with whether the statutory defense appertains in a given case is a horse of different hue;  the findings which collectively comprise such an assessment are factbound and thus engender clear-error review.  See Yurika Foods Corp. v. United Parcel Serv.  (In re Yurika Foods Corp.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531070\"><a href=\"/opinion/531070/in-re-yurika-foods-corp-debtor-and-debtor-in-possession-yurika-foods/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 (6th Cir.1989).  Here, the court's rendition of the statute is unexceptional and the only justiciable issue relates to whether the challenged transfer, as a factual matter, comes within the statutory sweep.  Hence, the bankruptcy court's decision normally would be reviewable for clear error.  This means, of course, that a reviewing court \"ought not to upset findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless, on the whole of the record, [the appellate judges] form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This familiar standard is not diluted merely because parties proceed on a stipulated record.  We long have held that a bankruptcy court's factual findings are entitled to the deference inherent in clear-error review even when they do not implicate live testimony, but, rather, evolve entirely from a paper record that is equally available to the reviewing court.  See Boroff v. Tully (In re Tully ), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488021\"><a href=\"/opinion/488021/bankr-l-rep-p-71787-in-re-john-e-tully-debtor-henry-j-boroff/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir.1987) (citing Anderson v.

The latter rule, in its latest incarnation, provides in pertinent part:  \"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\"  (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the obvious applicability of the \"clearly erroneous\" standard to the case at hand, there is a rub.  The parties both urged the BAP to review the bankruptcy court's decision de novo and to resolve the issue of whether Healthco's transfer of funds to Repco escapes classification as a preference without affording any special respect to the bankruptcy court's factual determinations.  The BAP yielded to this importuning.  See In re Healthco, supra, slip op. at 5. What is more, the litigants are united in their insistence that we, too, should essay plenary, nondeferential review of the bankruptcy court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these peculiar circumstances, we are tempted simply to honor the parties' request.  Cf. United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 971 (1st Cir.1995) (warning that \"[t]he problem with wishes is that they sometimes come true\") (citing Aesop).  For one thing, the bankruptcy court's failure to articulate any particularized factual findings not only contradicts the rules of practice, see Fed.  R. Bankr.P. 7052 (adopting Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)'s requirement that \"the court shall find the facts specially\"), but also makes clear-error review exceptionally difficult.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  For another thing, the parties invited the BAP to indulge in de novo review and, at oral argument in this court, they continued to urge that we follow that course.  Declining to do so would risk \"plac[ing] a premium on agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.\"  Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588805\"><a href=\"/opinion/588805/dedham-water-co-inc-v-cumberland-farms-dairy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 459 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Merchant v.

In short, this case is sufficiently plain that, whether we bow to the parties' wishes and afford de novo review or bow to convention and employ the more deferential \"clearly erroneous\" rubric, we, like the BAP, would be compelled to set aside the bankruptcy court's contrary determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to guard against favoritism in the face of looming insolvency, the Bankruptcy Code provides that certain payments made by the debtor within ninety days preceding the institution of bankruptcy proceedings are voidable as preferences.  See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b).  This rule is not ironclad.  Thus, the Code holds harmless transfers made by the debtor during the ninety-day preference period if certain criteria are satisfied.  Specifically, a bankruptcy trustee may not annul a preference-period transfer to the extent that the transfer was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(A) in payment of a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business ... [between] the debtor and the transferee;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>(B) made in the ordinary course of business ... of the debtor and the transferee;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(C) made according to ordinary business terms[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(c)(2).  The rationale behind this carve-out is clear:  because \"the general policy of the preference section [is] to discourage unusual action by either the debtor or his creditors during the debtor's slide into bankruptcy,\" the ordinary course exemption promotes the corresponding congressional desire \"to leave undisturbed normal financial relations.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 595 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6329.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute itself is uninstructive as to the definition of the term \"ordinary course of business.\"   Courts abhor interpretive vacuums, and they have filled this one, articulating several factors that bear upon whether a particular transfer warrants protection under section 547(c)(2).  These factors include the amount transferred, the timing of the payment, the historic course of dealings between the debtor and the transferee, and the circumstances under which the transfer was effected.  See In re Yurika Foods, 888 F.2d at 45;  First Software Corp. v. Curtis Mfg. Co.  (In re First Software Corp.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1822296\"><a href=\"/opinion/1822296/in-re-first-software-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 212 (Bankr.D.Mass.1988).  After considering the record evidence in light of these factors, we are firmly convinced that the transfer from Healthco to Repco was extraordinary and that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding otherwise.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amount of the payment was uncommonly large;  Healthco never before had made a lump-sum payment to Repco in an amount approaching $235,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Put another way, the payment was nearly ten times as large as the average of the payments previously made by the debtor to Repco.  Then, too, the timing of the payment was highly suspicious.  It lumped old and new bills, and in the process, liquidated several invoices that were by accounting standards ancient (i.e., more than ninety days old) and several that were prepubescent (i.e., less than thirty days old).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  There were, moreover, virtually no significant similarities between the challenged payment and the antecedent course of dealings between the parties.  For example, the disputed transfer marked the first occasion that Healthco ventured to pay all its outstanding Repco invoices, the first time that Healthco wired funds to Repco, and the first time that Healthco's chief financial officer interceded to effectuate a payment to Repco.  Inasmuch as the hallmark of a payment in the ordinary course is consistency with prior practice, see WJM, Inc. v. Massachusetts Dep't of Pub. Welfare, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502425\"><a href=\"/opinion/502425/wjm-inc-etc-v-massachusetts-department-of-public-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 1011 (1st Cir.1988), this string of \"firsts\" is telling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances surrounding the wire transfer clinch the matter.  Healthco owed money to hundreds of creditors.  Of these, it paid only Repco, Kerr Manufacturing, and Clarke Industries in full by wire transfer during the preference period.  All three of these businesses had detectable links to Healthco's principals:  Thomas Hicks, chairman and chief executive officer of the firm that owned Healthco Holding Co.  (which, in turn, owned Healthco), was a director and beneficial owner of Kerr's parent corporation;  James Mills, chairman of Healthco Holding Co., chaired the board of Clarke's parent company and served as its chief executive officer;  and as mentioned above, Mills also had a longstanding relationship with Repco's proprietor.  Apart from these special relationships, there is no reasonable explanation for preferment of the three creditors.  This is especially true of Repco;  as Zaegel himself testified during his deposition, it is general industry custom to \"pay the printer last.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circumstances associated with the challenged transfer highlight the importance of Repco's special relationship.  Souza, Healthco's treasurer, testified that by February 1993 decisions about which creditors were to be paid when were being made by a committee of Healthco executives;  yet Moyle overrode this mechanism to effect the Repco payment.  At the same time, it was clear both from Zaegel's kid-glove approach and from the competitive nature of the printing industry that Repco's continued service did not hinge upon Healthco's payment of all outstanding debt as celeritously as possible.  Thus, Moyle's claim that he directed the payment to be made because Repco was \"pivotal\" to Healthco's operations is entitled to very little weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The circumstantial evidence fully persuades us that the debtor deviated sharply from its customary business practices to favor a select trio of creditors, Repco included.  This is precisely the type of preferment--taking care of a few well-connected vendors while playing hardball with the general multitude--that the drafters of the Bankruptcy Code intended to curtail.  See Lawson v. Ford Motor Co.  (In re Roblin Indus.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714129\"><a href=\"/opinion/714129/in-re-roblin-industries-inc-debtor-william-e-lawson-trustee-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 40 (2d Cir.1996) (explaining that \"equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor\" is one goal of the preference provision) (quoting legislative history).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Repco's other arguments are unconvincing and we reject them without elaboration.  It suffices to say that the circumstances surrounding the challenged transfer amply evince its extraordinary nature.  Therefore, we affirm the BAP's determination that, contrary to the bankruptcy court's view, the challenged transfer was not made in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the BAP, however, we do not believe that such a determination clears the way for judgment on the trustee's claim.  The bankruptcy court reserved the issue of Healthco's insolvency--an essential element of the preference claim--and that issue remains open.  Consequently, we must vacate the BAP's judgment to that extent and remand to the BAP with directions that it, in turn, remand the cause to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

The record reflects, however, that this credit term was honored mainly in the breach;  most of Repco's customers (and, indeed, the majority of firms purchasing services in the competitive printing industry) ignored this stricture</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record indicates that Zaegel was unaware of Healthco's financial problems at this time;  that he discussed the past-due invoices cordially with Moyle;  and that he neither threatened to cut off printing services nor demanded an immediate payment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In this circuit, bankruptcy appellate panels have had a mixed history.  After a short-lived experiment, the use of such panels was discontinued in 1983.  The First Circuit Judicial Council revivified the BAP structure on July 1, 1996, giving interested parties the option of electing intermediate appellate review before a BAP panel rather than before a federal district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be sure, occasional statements of this court, if wrested from context, might appear to suggest de novo review in such circumstances.  See, e.g., Brewer v.

Context provides a clearer perspective.  In the cases in which we purposed to scrutinize a paper record de novo, there were no facts in dispute.   Although a stipulated record sometimes will indicate the absence of factual discord, that is far from universally true.  See Vetter v.
