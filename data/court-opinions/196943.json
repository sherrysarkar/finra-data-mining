Porn  brought  this  diversity  action  in  Maine's\r\n\nfederal  district  court   against  National  Grange  seeking\r\n\nadditional  damages  for  its   alleged  mishandling  of  his\r\n\nunderinsured  motorist  claim.   The  district  court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment  in favor  of National Grange  based on  the\r\n\ndoctrines of  collateral estoppel (issue  preclusion) and res\r\n\njudicata  (claim  preclusion),   concluding  that  an   issue\r\n\nunderlying  one of  Porn's  claims had  been  decided in  the\r\n\nearlier  proceeding and that all of  Porn's claims could have\r\n\nbeen  raised  therein.   Porn  appeals  the  district court's\r\n\nsummary judgment order.

Because  his  damages  exceeded\r\n\nWilloughby's  $20,000  policy  limit, Porn  made  a  claim to\r\n\nNational Grange under his automobile policy  seeking recovery\r\n\nfrom  the underinsured  motorist  indorsement to  the policy.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nFor  reasons  not  apparent in  the  record,  National Grange\r\n\nrefused to pay the claim.  \r\n\n          Disgruntled by this refusal, Porn wrote to National\r\n\nGrange accusing  it of  bad faith in  handling his  claim and\r\n\nthreatening legal action.  Porn  sent copies of his letter to\r\n\nthe insurance commissioners of Connecticut and Massachusetts.\r\n\nNational  Grange,  unimpressed,  remained  steadfast  in  its\r\n\nrefusal to pay, and in November 1993, Porn filed suit against\r\n\nNational  Grange in Maine's federal district court for breach\r\n\nof the insurance contract (\"first action\").\r\n\n          Because Porn's policy with National Grange required\r\n\na finding of legal liability  on the part of the underinsured\r\n\nmotorist as a condition precedent to the payment of benefits,\r\n\nthe two-day trial before the magistrate judge1 focused on the\r\n\nquestion of Willoughby's  negligence and Porn's  contributory\r\n\nnegligence.   Following the  completion of the  evidence, the\r\n\nmagistrate judge entered judgment as a matter of law for Porn\r\n\non  the  issue  of  contributory  negligence,  and  the  jury\r\n\nreturned  a  verdict  for  Porn,  finding  that  Willoughby's\r\n\nnegligence had caused  him $400,000 worth of  damages.  After\r\n\nreducing  the   jury's  award  to  reflect   Porn's  $300,000\r\n\nunderinsured motorist policy  limit and appropriate set-offs,\r\n\nthe magistrate judge entered judgment for Porn in  the amount\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Under Fed.  R. Civ. P.  73, the parties consented  to the\r\nmagistrate judge, rather than the district  judge, conducting\r\nthe jury trial.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nof  $255,314.40.  The  magistrate judge denied  Porn's motion\r\n\nfor prejudgment interest, finding that while Maine law allows\r\n\nprejudgment interest in excess of the policy limit where  the\r\n\ninsurer  acted  in  bad faith  and  needlessly  prolonged the\r\n\nlitigation,  Porn  had presented  no  evidence that  National\r\n\nGrange exhibited such behavior.\r\n\n          Six  months  later,   Porn  commenced  this  action\r\n\nagainst  National Grange  in Maine's  federal district  court\r\n\n(\"second  action\").   This time  Porn  alleged that  National\r\n\nGrange's conduct in handling his underinsured  motorist claim\r\n\nconstituted breach of the covenant of good faith, intentional\r\n\ninfliction  of  emotional distress,  negligent  infliction of\r\n\nemotional distress,  and violations of the Connecticut Unfair\r\n\nInsurance  Practices Act  and  the  Connecticut Unfair  Trade\r\n\nPractices Act.   National Grange moved for  summary judgment,\r\n\narguing that the judgment in the first  action precluded Porn\r\n\nfrom bringing the second action.  The district court accepted\r\n\nthat  argument and  granted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of\r\n\nNational Grange on the grounds  that (1) one aspect of Porn's\r\n\nbad-faith claim was barred by issue preclusion and (2) all of\r\n\nPorn's claims were barred by claim preclusion.  \r\n\n          In reaching  its first holding, the  district court\r\n\nexplained that the  magistrate judge's decision not  to award\r\n\nPorn prejudgment interest  was based in  part on his  finding\r\n\nthat Porn had presented no evidence to  suggest that National\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nGrange  acted in  bad  faith  and  needlessly  prolonged  the\r\n\nlitigation.    Accordingly,  the  court  concluded  that  the\r\n\nquestion  of National Grange's  alleged bad-faith  conduct in\r\n\nlitigating the  first action  was raised  and decided  in the\r\n\nfirst  action, and, therefore, to the extent Porn's bad-faith\r\n\nclaim  involved National  Grange's conduct  during  the first\r\n\naction, it was barred by issue preclusion.\r\n\n          In  reaching its broader  holding that all  five of\r\n\nPorn's claims were  barred by claim preclusion,  the district\r\n\ncourt reasoned that once Porn chose to bring the first action\r\n\nagainst  National Grange  for  breach  of  contract,  he  was\r\n\nrequired to raise  all his claims arising from  the breach or\r\n\nelse  forfeit the  right to  do so.   Because  it  found that\r\n\nPorn's  five  tort  and statutory  claims,  like  the earlier\r\n\nbreach  of   contract  claim,   involved  National   Grange's\r\n\nobligations arising under the insurance  policy, the district\r\n\ncourt  concluded that  they should  have been brought  in the\r\n\nfirst  action and therefore  were barred by  claim preclusion\r\n\nfrom being raised in the second action.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                           Analysis\r                                       Analysis\r                                               \r\n\n          Porn appeals the district  court's grant of summary\r\n\njudgment  in favor  of  National  Grange,  arguing  that  the\r\n\njudgment in the first action  for breach of contract does not\r\n\npreclude  his bad-faith,  emotional  distress, and  statutory\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nunfair  practices  claims  (collectively  \"bad-faith  claim\")\r\n\nagainst National Grange  in this action.   Specifically, Porn\r\n\nargues that (1) the facts relevant to his bad-faith claim are\r\n\nseparate from those  relevant to his contract  claim, (2) the\r\n\nbad-faith facts do not form  a convenient trial unit with the\r\n\ncontract facts, (3) treatment of both sets of facts as a unit\r\n\ndoes not conform to the parties' expectations, and (4) it was\r\n\ninequitable to apply the res judicata bar where, as here, the\r\n\ninsurer's  conduct in the  contract litigation forms  part of\r\n\nthe bad-faith action.2  After reciting the standard of review\r\n\nand setting forth the governing res judicata law, we consider\r\n\neach argument in turn.    \r\n\n          We  review a  grant of  summary  judgment de  novo,\r                                                                        \r\n\nunder  the same standards that govern  the district court, to\r\n\ndetermine  whether  \"the pleadings,  depositions,  answers to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  All  of these arguments attack the district court's claim\r\npreclusion holding.   Porn  also makes arguments  challenging\r\nthe district court's conclusion that  the portion of his bad-\r\nfaith  claim relating  to National  Grange's  conduct in  the\r\nfirst  action was barred by issue  preclusion.  However, when\r\nPorn commenced the first action, he knew that National Grange\r\nhad neither settled  his benefits claim  despite overwhelming\r\nevidence  that  Willoughby  alone  caused  the  accident  nor\r\nconducted  an independent investigation into the cause of the\r\naccident  in  an   attempt  to  offset  Porn's   evidence  of\r\nWilloughby's wrongdoing.   Thus, we conclude that  Porn could\r\nhave  raised a  bad-faith  claim based  on  this evidence  of\r\nNational  Grange's litigation conduct in the first action and\r\ncould also  have used  National  Grange's ensuing  litigation\r\nconduct as further evidence of that claim in the same action.\r\nThe claim therefore is barred by the doctrine of res judicata\r\n(claim  preclusion), see  infra.    Accordingly,  we  do  not\r                                           \r\nconsider Porn's arguments regarding issue preclusion.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ninterrogatories, and  admissions on  file, together  with the\r\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n\nany material  fact and that  the moving party is  entitled to\r\n\njudgment  as a matter  of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  The\r                                         \r\n\napplicability  of the doctrine of  res judicata is a question\r\n\nof law subject to plenary review.  Wolf v.

See Johnson v.

Under  the  federal  law of  res  judicata, a  final\r\n\njudgment on  the merits  of an action  precludes the  parties\r\n\nfrom relitigating claims that were  raised or could have been\r\n\nraised in  that action.

For a claim  to be precluded, the following elements\r\n\nmust be established:   (1) a final judgment  on the merits in\r\n\nan earlier action, (2) sufficient identity between the causes\r\n\nof action  asserted in the  earlier and later suits,  and (3)\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsufficient identity  between the  parties in  the two  suits.\r\n\nSee  Apparel Art,  48 F.3d  at 583;  Gonzalez v.

Relation of the Facts in Time, Space, Origin,\r                                                                       \r\nor        Motivation\r                                \r\n\n          The first Restatement factor asks whether the facts\r\n\nunderlying  the breach of  contract and bad-faith  claims are\r\n\nrelated  in time, space, origin, or motivation, i.e., whether\r                                                                \r\n\nthey  arise out  of  the same  transaction, seek  redress for\r\n\nessentially the same basic wrong,  and rest on the same or  a\r\n\nsubstantially  similar factual basis.   See Kale  v. Combined\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns.

In this case,  our answers to\r                  \r\n\nthese questions lead us to conclude that the facts underlying\r\n\nthe two claims are closely related.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          First,  we find that  both the bad-faith  claim and\r\n\nthe contract claim derive from the same occurrence:  National\r\n\nGrange's refusal to pay Porn the proceeds of his underinsured\r\n\nmotorist policy  for the  July 17,  1990, accident.   Second,\r\n\nalthough the two claims present different legal theories, one\r\n\nsounding in  contract and the  other in tort, they  both seek\r\n\nredress for essentially the same basic wrong.   For instance,\r\n\nPorn's contract  action sought redress for  National Grange's\r\n\nrefusal  to  pay  the policy  proceeds,  while  his bad-faith\r\n\naction sought redress for its unreasonable refusal to pay the\r\n\nproceeds, see Buckman v. People  Express, Inc., 530 A.2d 596,\r                                                          \r\n\n599 (Conn. 1987).  Third,  a comparison of the two complaints\r\n\nillustrates that  the two  claims rest  on a  similar factual\r\n\nbasis.    Both  complaints,  in  their  factual  allegations,\r\n\noutline the circumstances of the accident, the particulars of\r\n\nthe  insurance  policy,  and  National  Grange's  conduct  in\r\n\nrefusing to pay.  In sum, the facts underlying the two claims\r\n\nare closely related in time, space, origin, and motivation.3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  A  majority of  the  courts  that  have  considered  this\r\nquestion,  i.e., whether  the facts  underlying  a breach  of\r                           \r\ninsurance   contract   claim  and   a  bad-faith   claim  are\r\nsufficiently  related for purposes of res judicata, also have\r\nconcluded that both claims arise out of the insurer's refusal\r\nto pay  the insured the proceeds  of the policy.

Of the courts\r                          \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Porn expends considerable effort characterizing the\r\n\ninstant action as arising out  of a transaction separate from\r\n\nthat giving  rise to the  first action.  In  particular, Porn\r\n\nmaintains  that  the  bad-faith  action  stems  from National\r\n\nGrange's conduct in handling his insurance claim, whereas the\r\n\ncontract action  stems from the circumstances surrounding the\r\n\ncar accident.  Porn's definition of the  two transactions out\r\n\nof which the  claims arise, however, is  artificially narrow.\r\n\nFor instance, the contract claim  arises out of more than the\r\n\ncar  accident  alone.   It  arises  out  of the  accident  in\r\n\nconjunction with National  Grange's refusal to pay  under the\r\n\npolicy.   Indeed, without  the  refusal to  pay, no  contract\r\n\nbreach could exist.   Similarly, the factual  basis of Porn's\r\n\nbad-faith  claim  cannot  be  limited  to  National  Grange's\r\n\nconduct in handling  Porn's insurance claim.   In this  case,\r\n\nthe facts of the car  accident are also probative of National\r\n\nGrange's reasonableness in refusing to pay Porn's claim.  For\r\n\ninstance, if, as  Porn suggests,  the facts  of the  accident\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nholding  otherwise,  i.e.,  that  the  facts  underlying  the\r                                     \r\ncontract and  bad-faith claims  are  unrelated, most  applied\r\nstate-law theories of res judicata  that differ significantly\r\nfrom the  federal res  judicata principles  that govern  this\r\ncase.   See,  e.g., Schmueser v.  Burkburnett Bank,  937 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n1025, 1031 (5th Cir. 1991) (applying Texas res judicata law);\r\nRobinson v.

The accident\r\n\nfacts,  for example,  will likely  receive  more emphasis  in\r\n\nproving  the  contract  claim,   while  the  facts  regarding\r\n\nNational Grange's conduct in handling  Porn's insurance claim\r\n\nwill be more focal in  proving the bad-faith claim.  However,\r\n\nthe  Restatement makes clear  that merely because  two claims\r\n\ndepend  on different  shadings  of  the  facts  or  emphasize\r\n\ndifferent  elements of  the facts,  we should  not color  our\r\n\nperception  of  the  transaction  underlying  them,  creating\r\n\nmultiple  transactions  where  only  one transaction  exists.\r\n\nRestatement    24  cmt. c.   By  focusing exclusively  on the\r\n\nfacts most critical to each claim, Porn has ignored the other\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Porn's argument  that the facts  underlying the bad-faith\r\nand  contract claims  are not  related  in time  is similarly\r\nunpersuasive.  Porn argues that the facts underlying the bad-\r\nfaith action  go to National  Grange's handling of  the claim\r\nafter  the car  accident,  while  the  facts  underlying  the\r                 \r\ncontract action  go to the  accident itself.  However,  as we\r\nexplained above,  the factual basis of the contract action is\r\nformed  by more  than  just the  accident;  it also  includes\r\nNational Grange's refusal  to pay, and that  refusal occurred\r\nafter  the accident.   Therefore,  the  facts underlying  the\r\ncontract  action cannot be limited to the accident itself but\r\nextend to the time period after the accident as well, thereby\r\nminimizing any time differential between the facts underlying\r\nthe two claims. \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nfacts underlying each  claim.  Accordingly, we  reject Porn's\r\n\ngrouping of the facts underlying the two claims into separate\r\n\ntransactions. \r\n\n          2.  Trial Convenience\r                                           \r\n\n          The  second   Restatement  factor  directs   us  to\r\n\ndetermine  whether the facts underlying the contract and bad-\r\n\nfaith claims  form  a convenient  trial unit.   This  factor,\r\n\naimed at  conserving judicial resources, provides  that where\r\n\nthe witnesses or  proof needed in  the second action  overlap\r\n\nsubstantially with those used in the first action, the second\r\n\naction should ordinarily be precluded.  Restatement   24 cmt.\r\n\nb.  We conclude that Porn's bad-faith claim would use much of\r\n\nthe same evidence produced in  the first action for breach of\r\n\nthe  insurance contract,  and therefore  it  would have  been\r\n\nconvenient and efficient for the district court to have heard\r\n\nthe two claims in the same action.\r\n\n          Testimony and  exhibits about the  circumstances of\r\n\nthe accident are relevant to both  the contract and bad-faith\r\n\nclaims.    To  establish that  National  Grange  breached the\r\n\ninsurance policy in  not paying his claim, Porn  had to prove\r\n\nthat  Willoughby's negligence caused the accident and that he\r\n\nwas  not contributorily negligent.  Accordingly, in the first\r\n\naction, Porn  presented evidence detailing  the circumstances\r\n\nof the  accident.    This evidence  would  likely  have  been\r\n\nrepeated in a second action for bad faith, as Porn would have\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nsought   to  portray  the   accident  facts  as   so  plainly\r\n\nestablishing Willoughby's negligence that National Grange had\r\n\nno credible reason for refusing to pay his claim.    \r\n\n          The  evidence in the contract action and the second\r\n\naction  would  also  overlap  as  to  the  terms   of  Porn's\r\n\nunderinsured motorist policy and National Grange's refusal to\r\n\npay his  claim.   To prove  breach of contract,  Porn had  to\r\n\nestablish that National Grange refused to pay his claim where\r\n\nthe  terms  of  the  policy  so   required.    Likewise,  the\r\n\nreasonableness of  National  Grange's refusal  to pay,  i.e.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nwhether it  acted in  bad faith, depends  on what  the policy\r\n\nrequired.  \r\n\n          Rather  than  addressing  the degree  to  which the\r\n\nevidence supporting each claim  overlaps, Porn challenges the\r\n\nconvenience  of bringing  the claims  together  on two  other\r\n\ngrounds.   First, Porn  argues that evidence  relevant to the\r\n\nbad-faith  claim,  specifically  evidence  of  the amount  of\r\n\ninsurance available  and the  fact of  settlement offers  and\r\n\nnegotiations,  would prejudice  the insurer's defense  of the\r\n\ncontract claim,  and therefore the  two claims do not  form a\r\n\nconvenient trial  unit.  However, we agree  with the district\r\n\ncourt  that  any  potential prejudice  could  be  resolved by\r\n\nbifurcating the trial.  With bifurcation, the evidence common\r\n\nto  both  claims,  which was  considerable,  could  have been\r\n\npresented at once and not \"in separate  lawsuits commenced at\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\na distance of months or years.\"  Porn v. National Grange Mut.\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns. Co., No. 95-140-P-H, 1995 WL 626374, at *3 (D. Me. Sept.\r                    \r\n\n27, 1995).\r\n\n          Second,  Porn argues  that  he  had  to  procure  a\r\n\njudgment that National Grange breached the insurance contract\r\n\nbefore the  cause of  action for bad  faith could  accrue and\r\n\ntherefore  the bad-faith  and contract  claims  could not  be\r\n\njoined in the same action.   Porn bases this contention on an\r\n\nassumption  that, although  a Connecticut  court  has yet  to\r\n\ndecide this issue, it would follow jurisdictions like Florida\r\n\nand  require a  judgment of  contract breach  as a  condition\r\n\nprecedent to  the pursuit of  a bad-faith claim.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nBlanchard v. State Farm Mut.  Auto. Ins.

Invoking the doctrine of res judicata,\r\n\nthe  Connecticut  Supreme Court  held that  Duhaime's earlier\r\n\naction for breach of the insurance policy barred a subsequent\r\n\naction  for  bad  faith.   Id.    In  so holding,  the  court\r                                          \r\n\nimplicitly  acknowledged that  a bad-faith action  can accrue\r\n\nwithout a  separate judgment  of contract  breach.   Although\r\n\nDuhaime involved  disability insurance  and the  instant case\r                   \r\n\ninvolves underinsured  motorist  insurance,  we  see  nothing\r\n\nunique  about  underinsured  motorist  insurance  that  would\r\n\npreclude Duhaime's holding from governing here.6\r                            \r\n\n          3.

For the following reasons, we conclude that it\r\n\ndoes.  \r\n\n          When he brought his contract suit in November 1993,\r\n\nPorn knew the facts necessary for bringing a bad-faith claim.\r\n\nHe knew  that National Grange had refused to pay; he knew its\r\n\nalleged reasons  for so refusing;  and he knew the  extent of\r\n\nthe delay in payment attributable to the refusal.  Therefore,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In all events, in a bifurcated trial such as the district\r\ncourt envisioned, see supra, the jury would first be asked to\r                                       \r\ndetermine the breach of contract  claim.  Only if the insured\r\nprevailed on that claim would the second (bad-faith) phase of\r\nthe trial transpire.  Thus,  the insured would have to secure\r\na finding that  the insurer breached  the contract before  he\r\ncould recover on his bad-faith claim.   We do not think  that\r\nthe Connecticut Supreme Court would require more.  \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nbecause the two claims  arose in the  same time frame out  of\r\n\nsimilar facts, one would reasonably expect them to be brought\r\n\ntogether.   See  18 Charles  A.  Wright &amp;  Arthur R.  Miller,\r                           \r\n\nFederal  Practice  and   Procedure     4407,  at   56  (1981)\r                                              \r\n\n(\"Defendants  may reasonably  demand that disposition  of the\r\n\nfirst  suit establish repose as  to all matters that ordinary\r\n\npeople  would  intuitively  count  part  of  a  single  basic\r\n\ndispute.\").   Indeed, in  February 1993,  nine months  before\r\n\nfiling  the  first action,  Porn wrote  a letter  to National\r\n\nGrange in which  he made a demand for his policy proceeds and\r\n\nconcomitantly threatened to  sue for bad faith.   In light of\r\n\nthis letter, it would not have been unreasonable for National\r\n\nGrange  to expect  that  any  subsequent  lawsuit  that  Porn\r\n\ninitiated  would include claims  for both breach  of contract\r\n\nand bad faith.   Finally, bringing related claims together is\r\n\narguably more conducive to settlement and therefore, at least\r\n\nin this case, may have had some pragmatic appeal.         \r\n\n          In  sum, applying  the Restatement's  transactional\r\n\ntest to this case, we conclude that the two lawsuits involved\r\n\nsufficiently identical causes  of action.  Because  the cause\r\n\nof  action  should not  have  been split  into  two lawsuits,\r\n\nPorn's bad-faith claim is barred by claim preclusion.  \r\n\nB.  Equitable Exception\r                                   \r\n\n          As his final  argument, Porn contends that  even if\r\n\nwe  find  that  res  judicata  applies,  equity  demands  its\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nsuspension  in this  case.   Specifically,  Porn argues  that\r\n\nbecause  National Grange's decision to proceed to judgment in\r\n\nthe contract  action with no evidence to  support its defense\r\n\n(\"litigation  conduct\") is probative  of bad faith,  the full\r\n\nnature of National  Grange's bad-faith tort was  not revealed\r\n\nuntil   judgment  was   entered  in   the   contract  action.\r\n\nTherefore, Porn argues, it would  be premature and unfair  to\r\n\nrequire him  to bring his  bad-faith claim together  with his\r\n\ncontract claim.  \r\n\n          The  Supreme Court has  counselled us to  adhere to\r\n\ntraditional principles  of res judicata  and not to  make any\r\n\n\"ad hoc determination of the equities in a particular  case.\"\r\n\nFederated Dep't  Stores, Inc.  v. Moitie,  452 U.S.  394, 401\r                                                    \r\n\n(1981) (refusing to condone an exception to an application of\r\n\nres judicata  that would  bar relitigation  of an  unappealed\r\n\nadverse judgment where  other plaintiffs  in similar  actions\r\n\nagainst common defendants successfully appealed the judgments\r\n\nagainst  them).

Assuming  arguendo that Moitie did not foreclose\r                                                       \r\n\nthe possibility  of an equitable exception, we  find that, in\r\n\nthe context of this case, requiring the bad-faith claim to be\r\n\nbrought  in the first action creates  no unusual hardship for\r\n\nPorn and therefore the exception does not apply.  \r\n\n          First,   we   challenge  Porn's   assumption   that\r\n\nrequiring  the  two  claims  to  be  brought  together  would\r\n\nnecessarily preclude as  support for the bad-faith  claim any\r\n\nevidence  about  National  Grange's  decision  to proceed  to\r\n\njudgment in the  contract action with no  evidence to support\r\n\nits defense.   Had  the  contract and  bad-faith claims  been\r\n\nbrought  together,  the  district  court  would  likely  have\r\n\nbifurcated  the trial into  two phases.   By the  time of the\r\n\nbad-faith  phase of  the  trial,  the  contract  phase  would\r\n\nalready have  been  completed and  Porn would  know both  the\r\n\nquality of evidence  National Grange presented to  defend the\r\n\ncontract  claim and  that the  magistrate  judge had  granted\r\n\njudgment  as  a matter  of  law  for  Porn  on the  issue  of\r\n\ncontributory negligence.   Accordingly,  we see nothing  that\r\n\nwould  have prevented Porn  from presenting this  evidence in\r\n\nthe bad-faith phase of the trial and arguing to the jury that\r\n\nNational  Grange's  refusal  to  settle the  contract  action\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ndespite insufficient  evidence of  a meritorious  defense was\r\n\nmore evidence of its bad faith.7\r\n\n          Moreover, assuming arguendo  that Porn's assumption\r                                                 \r\n\nwas  correct and  that at  the time  he brought  the contract\r\n\naction he  was unaware of  the litigation conduct  that would\r\n\noccur therein, we nonetheless conclude that Porn was aware of\r\n\nother conduct by National Grange sufficient to support a bad-\r\n\nfaith   claim.    Indeed,  of  the  ten  factual  allegations\r\n\nsupporting  Porn's  bad-faith complaint,  nine were  known to\r\n\nPorn  at  the time  he  instituted  the  first action.    For\r\n\ninstance, the  second complaint alleged  that National Grange\r\n\nfailed to act on the claim for nine months; failed to make an\r\n\noffer on the  claim for sixteen months; failed  to allow Porn\r\n\nto  settle  with  Willoughby's   carrier  for  the  available\r\n\nliability proceeds for  two years; justified delays  with the\r\n\npossibility of other insurance coverage when it  knew no such\r\n\ninsurance  existed; made Porn  investigate the possibility of\r\n\nother coverage;  failed to investigate  the claim; repeatedly\r\n\nlied to  Porn about  the policy's terms;  and instructed  its\r\n\nclaims personnel  to withhold  helpful information about  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Even if  the trial had  not been bifurcated and  Porn did\r\nnot yet know  that the magistrate judge  would grant judgment\r\nas a matter  of law on the issue  of contributory negligence,\r\nPorn still  could have pointed  to National Grange's  lack of\r\nevidence of contributory negligence and  argued that National\r\nGrange's  refusal to  settle the  contract case  with  such a\r\nmeager defense was more evidence of its bad faith.  See supra\r                                                                         \r\nnote 2. \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\npolicy  from Porn.    Because  the  events  underlying  these\r\n\nallegations had occurred  by the time Porn  brought his first\r\n\naction, we  find that Porn had ample  opportunity to litigate\r\n\nthe bad-faith  claim therein,  see Gonzalez,  27 F.3d  at 758\r                                                       \r\n\n(holding that for claim preclusion to apply, a litigant first\r\n\nmust have  had a  full and fair  opportunity to  litigate her\r\n\nclaim), and  his asserted  inability to  present evidence  of\r\n\nNational Grange's  litigation conduct  as additional  support\r\n\nfor his bad-faith claim does not present an\r\n\nunusual hardship.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For  the   reasons  stated  above,  we  affirm  the\r                                                                    \r\n\ndistrict  court's grant  of  summary  judgment  in  favor  of\r\n\nNational Grange.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n",

Porn brought this diversity action in Maine's federal district court against National Grange seeking additional damages for its alleged mishandling of his underinsured motorist claim.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of National Grange based on the doctrines of collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) and res judicata (claim preclusion), concluding that an issue underlying one of Porn's claims had been decided in the earlier proceeding and that all of Porn's claims could have been raised therein.  Porn appeals the district court's summary judgment order.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background &amp; Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1990, Porn, a Connecticut resident, was involved in an automobile accident in Portland, Maine, when motorist Lori Willoughby sped through a stop sign and broadsided his vehicle.  Because his damages exceeded Willoughby's $20,000 policy limit, Porn made a claim to National Grange under his automobile policy seeking recovery from the underinsured motorist indorsement to the policy.  For reasons not apparent in the record, National Grange refused to pay the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disgruntled by this refusal, Porn wrote to National Grange accusing it of bad faith in handling his claim and threatening legal action.  Porn sent copies of his letter to the insurance commissioners of Connecticut and Massachusetts.  National Grange, unimpressed, remained steadfast in its refusal to pay, and in November 1993, Porn filed suit against National Grange in Maine's federal district court for breach of the insurance contract (\"first action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Porn's policy with National Grange required a finding of legal liability on the part of the underinsured motorist as a condition precedent to the payment of benefits, the two-day trial before the magistrate judge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> focused on the question of Willoughby's negligence and Porn's contributory negligence.  Following the completion of the evidence, the magistrate judge entered judgment as a matter of law for Porn on the issue of contributory negligence, and the jury returned a verdict for Porn, finding that Willoughby's negligence had caused him $400,000 worth of damages.  After reducing the jury's award to reflect Porn's $300,000 underinsured motorist policy limit and appropriate set-offs, the magistrate judge entered judgment for Porn in the amount of $255,314.40.  The magistrate judge denied Porn's motion for prejudgment interest, finding that while Maine law allows prejudgment interest in excess of the policy limit where the insurer acted in bad faith and needlessly prolonged the litigation, Porn had presented no evidence that National Grange exhibited such behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, Porn commenced this action against National Grange in Maine's federal district court (\"second action\").  This time Porn alleged that National Grange's conduct in handling his underinsured motorist claim constituted breach of the covenant of good faith, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.  National Grange moved for summary judgment, arguing that the judgment in the first action precluded Porn from bringing the second action.  The district court accepted that argument and granted summary judgment in favor of National Grange on the grounds that (1) one aspect of Porn's bad-faith claim was barred by issue preclusion and (2) all of Porn's claims were barred by claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its first holding, the district court explained that the magistrate judge's decision not to award Porn prejudgment interest was based in part on his finding that Porn had presented no evidence to suggest that National Grange acted in bad faith and needlessly prolonged the litigation.  Accordingly, the court concluded that the question of National Grange's alleged bad-faith conduct in litigating the first action was raised and decided in the first action, and, therefore, to the extent Porn's bad-faith claim involved National Grange's conduct during the first action, it was barred by issue preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its broader holding that all five of Porn's claims were barred by claim preclusion, the district court reasoned that once Porn chose to bring the first action against National Grange for breach of contract, he was required to raise all his claims arising from the breach or else forfeit the right to do so.  Because it found that Porn's five tort and statutory claims, like the earlier breach of contract claim, involved National Grange's obligations arising under the insurance policy, the district court concluded that they should have been brought in the first action and therefore were barred by claim preclusion from being raised in the second action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Porn appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of National Grange, arguing that the judgment in the first action for breach of contract does not preclude his bad-faith, emotional distress, and statutory unfair practices claims (collectively \"bad-faith claim\") against National Grange in this action.  Specifically, Porn argues that (1) the facts relevant to his bad-faith claim are separate from those relevant to his contract claim, (2) the bad-faith facts do not form a convenient trial unit with the contract facts, (3) treatment of both sets of facts as a unit does not conform to the parties' expectations, and (4) it was inequitable to apply the res judicata bar where, as here, the insurer's conduct in the contract litigation forms part of the bad-faith action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After reciting the standard of review and setting forth the governing res judicata law, we consider each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, under the same standards that govern the district court, to determine whether \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).  The applicability of the doctrine of res judicata is a question of law subject to plenary review.  Wolf v. Gruntal &amp; Co., 45 F.3d 524, 527 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the judgment in the first action was rendered by a federal court, the preclusive effect of that judgment in the instant diversity action is governed by federal res judicata principles.  See Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., Inc., 931 F.2d 970, 974 (1st Cir.1991) (noting in addition that the application of federal res judicata principles allows federal courts to define the effect of their own judgments);  see also Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Amertex Enters.  Ltd., 48 F.3d 576, 582-83, 583 n. 7 (1st Cir.1995).   Under the federal law of res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating claims that were raised or could have been raised in that action.  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 414, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980).  For a claim to be precluded, the following elements must be established:  (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier action, (2) sufficient identity between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identity between the parties in the two suits.  See Apparel Art, 48 F.3d at 583;  Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994).  Because there is no dispute that the first and third elements of the test are established, we focus on the second element:  whether the causes of action in the two lawsuits are sufficiently identical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defining the cause of action for res judicata purposes, this circuit has adopted the \"transactional\" approach of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments.  Manego v. Orleans Bd. of Trade, 773 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1084, 106 S.Ct. 1466, 89 L.Ed.2d 722 (1986).  Under this approach, a valid and final judgment in the first action will extinguish subsequent claims \" 'with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.' \"  Id. (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 24 (1982)).  We determine what factual grouping constitutes a \"transaction\" pragmatically, giving weight to such factors as \"whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties' expectations.\"   Restatement &#167; 24;  see also Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 978 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 973, 113 S.Ct. 1416, 122 L.Ed.2d 786 (1993).  These factors, however, are merely suggestive;  they are not intended to be exhaustive, nor is any one factor determinative.  See Restatement &#167; 24 cmt. b;  Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 756.   Finally, in making this determination, we are mindful that a single transaction may give rise to a multiplicity of claims, Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 755, and recognize that \"the mere fact that different legal theories are presented in each case does not mean that the same transaction is not behind each,\" Manego, 773 F.2d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Consideration of the Restatement Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that background, we inquire whether the causes of action asserted in the first and second suits are sufficiently identical, focusing on the three Restatement factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Relation of the Facts in Time, Space, Origin, or Motivation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first Restatement factor asks whether the facts underlying the breach of contract and bad-faith claims are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, i.e., whether they arise out of the same transaction, seek redress for essentially the same basic wrong, and rest on the same or a substantially similar factual basis.  See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 924 F.2d 1161, 1166 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 816, 112 S.Ct. 69, 116 L.Ed.2d 44 (1991).  In this case, our answers to these questions lead us to conclude that the facts underlying the two claims are closely related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we find that both the bad-faith claim and the contract claim derive from the same occurrence:  National Grange's refusal to pay Porn the proceeds of his underinsured motorist policy for the July 17, 1990, accident.  Second, although the two claims present different legal theories, one sounding in contract and the other in tort, they both seek redress for essentially the same basic wrong.  For instance, Porn's contract action sought redress for National Grange's refusal to pay the policy proceeds, while his bad-faith action sought redress for its unreasonable refusal to pay the proceeds, see Buckman v. People Express, Inc., 205 Conn. 166, 530 A.2d 596, 599 (1987).  Third, a comparison of the two complaints illustrates that the two claims rest on a similar factual basis.  Both complaints, in their factual allegations, outline the circumstances of the accident, the particulars of the insurance policy, and National Grange's conduct in refusing to pay.  In sum, the facts underlying the two claims are closely related in time, space, origin, and motivation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Porn expends considerable effort characterizing the instant action as arising out of a transaction separate from that giving rise to the first action.  In particular, Porn maintains that the bad-faith action stems from National Grange's conduct in handling his insurance claim, whereas the contract action stems from the circumstances surrounding the car accident.  Porn's definition of the two transactions out of which the claims arise, however, is artificially narrow.  For instance, the contract claim arises out of more than the car accident alone.  It arises out of the accident in conjunction with National Grange's refusal to pay under the policy.  Indeed, without the refusal to pay, no contract breach could exist.  Similarly, the factual basis of Porn's bad-faith claim cannot be limited to National Grange's conduct in handling Porn's insurance claim.  In this case, the facts of the car accident are also probative of National Grange's reasonableness in refusing to pay Porn's claim.  For instance, if, as Porn suggests, the facts of the accident present a clear picture that Willoughby was the legal cause of the accident and Porn was not contributorily negligent, National Grange would have had less reason to contest the claim and therefore its refusal to pay appears less reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, each legal theory relies more heavily on some of the underlying facts than others.  The accident facts, for example, will likely receive more emphasis in proving the contract claim, while the facts regarding National Grange's conduct in handling Porn's insurance claim will be more focal in proving the bad-faith claim.  However, the Restatement makes clear that merely because two claims depend on different shadings of the facts or emphasize different elements of the facts, we should not color our perception of the transaction underlying them, creating multiple transactions where only one transaction exists.  Restatement &#167; 24 cmt. c.  By focusing exclusively on the facts most critical to each claim, Porn has ignored the other facts underlying each claim.  Accordingly, we reject Porn's grouping of the facts underlying the two claims into separate transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Trial Convenience</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Restatement factor directs us to determine whether the facts underlying the contract and bad-faith claims form a convenient trial unit.  This factor, aimed at conserving judicial resources, provides that where the witnesses or proof needed in the second action overlap substantially with those used in the first action, the second action should ordinarily be precluded.  Restatement &#167; 24 cmt. b.  We conclude that Porn's bad-faith claim would use much of the same evidence produced in the first action for breach of the insurance contract, and therefore it would have been convenient and efficient for the district court to have heard the two claims in the same action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony and exhibits about the circumstances of the accident are relevant to both the contract and bad-faith claims.  To establish that National Grange breached the insurance policy in not paying his claim, Porn had to prove that Willoughby's negligence caused the accident and that he was not contributorily negligent.  Accordingly, in the first action, Porn presented evidence detailing the circumstances of the accident.  This evidence would likely have been repeated in a second action for bad faith, as Porn would have sought to portray the accident facts as so plainly establishing Willoughby's negligence that National Grange had no credible reason for refusing to pay his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in the contract action and the second action would also overlap as to the terms of Porn's underinsured motorist policy and National Grange's refusal to pay his claim.  To prove breach of contract, Porn had to establish that National Grange refused to pay his claim where the terms of the policy so required.  Likewise, the reasonableness of National Grange's refusal to pay, i.e., whether it acted in bad faith, depends on what the policy required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than addressing the degree to which the evidence supporting each claim overlaps, Porn challenges the convenience of bringing the claims together on two other grounds.  First, Porn argues that evidence relevant to the bad-faith claim, specifically evidence of the amount of insurance available and the fact of settlement offers and negotiations, would prejudice the insurer's defense of the contract claim, and therefore the two claims do not form a convenient trial unit.  However, we agree with the district court that any potential prejudice could be resolved by bifurcating the trial.  With bifurcation, the evidence common to both claims, which was considerable, could have been presented at once and not \"in separate lawsuits commenced at a distance of months or years.\"  Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., No. 95-140-P-H, 1995 WL 626374, at * 3 (D.Me. Sept. 27, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Porn argues that he had to procure a judgment that National Grange breached the insurance contract before the cause of action for bad faith could accrue and therefore the bad-faith and contract claims could not be joined in the same action.  Porn bases this contention on an assumption that, although a Connecticut court has yet to decide this issue, it would follow jurisdictions like Florida and require a judgment of contract breach as a condition precedent to the pursuit of a bad-faith claim.  See, e.g., Blanchard v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 575 So.2d 1289, 1290 (Fla.1991) (\"[A]n insured's underlying first-party action for insurance benefits against the insurer necessarily must be resolved favorably to the insured before the cause of action for bad faith in settlement negotiations can accrue.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The district court correctly observed, however, that the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected this contention in Duhaime v. American Reserve Life Ins. Co., 200 Conn. 360, 511 A.2d 333, 334-35 (1986).  Invoking the doctrine of res judicata, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that Duhaime's earlier action for breach of the insurance policy barred a subsequent action for bad faith.  Id.  In so holding, the court implicitly acknowledged that a bad-faith action can accrue without a separate judgment of contract breach.  Although Duhaime involved disability insurance and the instant case involves underinsured motorist insurance, we see nothing unique about underinsured motorist insurance that would preclude Duhaime 's holding from governing here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Parties' Expectations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final Restatement factor is whether treating the underlying facts as a trial unit conforms to the parties' expectations.  For the following reasons, we conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he brought his contract suit in November 1993, Porn knew the facts necessary for bringing a bad-faith claim.  He knew that National Grange had refused to pay;  he knew its alleged reasons for so refusing;  and he knew the extent of the delay in payment attributable to the refusal.  Therefore, because the two claims arose in the same time frame out of similar facts, one would reasonably expect them to be brought together.  See 18 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4407, at 56 (1981) (\"Defendants may reasonably demand that disposition of the first suit establish repose as to all matters that ordinary people would intuitively count part of a single basic dispute.\").  Indeed, in February 1993, nine months before filing the first action, Porn wrote a letter to National Grange in which he made a demand for his policy proceeds and concomitantly threatened to sue for bad faith.  In light of this letter, it would not have been unreasonable for National Grange to expect that any subsequent lawsuit that Porn initiated would include claims for both breach of contract and bad faith.  Finally, bringing related claims together is arguably more conducive to settlement and therefore, at least in this case, may have had some pragmatic appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, applying the Restatement's transactional test to this case, we conclude that the two lawsuits involved sufficiently identical causes of action.  Because the cause of action should not have been split into two lawsuits, Porn's bad-faith claim is barred by claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Equitable Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his final argument, Porn contends that even if we find that res judicata applies, equity demands its suspension in this case.  Specifically, Porn argues that because National Grange's decision to proceed to judgment in the contract action with no evidence to support its defense (\"litigation conduct\") is probative of bad faith, the full nature of National Grange's bad-faith tort was not revealed until judgment was entered in the contract action.  Therefore, Porn argues, it would be premature and unfair to require him to bring his bad-faith claim together with his contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has counselled us to adhere to traditional principles of res judicata and not to make any \"ad hoc determination of the equities in a particular case.\"  Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 2429, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981) (refusing to condone an exception to an application of res judicata that would bar relitigation of an unappealed adverse judgment where other plaintiffs in similar actions against common defendants successfully appealed the judgments against them).  In a post-Moitie decision, however, this court has suggested that an \" 'occasional exception' to claim preclusion\" may still exist in instances of \" 'unusual hardship.' \"  Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168 (quoting Rose v. Town of Harwich, 778 F.2d 77, 82 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986));  but see Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., Inc., 931 F.2d 970, 977 (1st Cir.1991) (citing Moitie for the proposition that \"we cannot relax the principles of claim preclusion even if we find that the equities cry out for us to do so\").  Assuming arguendo that Moitie did not foreclose the possibility of an equitable exception, we find that, in the context of this case, requiring the bad-faith claim to be brought in the first action creates no unusual hardship for Porn and therefore the exception does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we challenge Porn's assumption that requiring the two claims to be brought together would necessarily preclude as support for the bad-faith claim any evidence about National Grange's decision to proceed to judgment in the contract action with no evidence to support its defense.  Had the contract and bad-faith claims been brought together, the district court would likely have bifurcated the trial into two phases.  By the time of the bad-faith phase of the trial, the contract phase would already have been completed and Porn would know both the quality of evidence National Grange presented to defend the contract claim and that the magistrate judge had granted judgment as a matter of law for Porn on the issue of contributory negligence.  Accordingly, we see nothing that would have prevented Porn from presenting this evidence in the bad-faith phase of the trial and arguing to the jury that National Grange's refusal to settle the contract action despite insufficient evidence of a meritorious defense was more evidence of its bad faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, assuming arguendo that Porn's assumption was correct and that at the time he brought the contract action he was unaware of the litigation conduct that would occur therein, we nonetheless conclude that Porn was aware of other conduct by National Grange sufficient to support a bad-faith claim.  Indeed, of the ten factual allegations supporting Porn's bad-faith complaint, nine were known to Porn at the time he instituted the first action.  For instance, the second complaint alleged that National Grange failed to act on the claim for nine months;  failed to make an offer on the claim for sixteen months;  failed to allow Porn to settle with Willoughby's carrier for the available liability proceeds for two years;  justified delays with the possibility of other insurance coverage when it knew no such insurance existed;  made Porn investigate the possibility of other coverage;  failed to investigate the claim;  repeatedly lied to Porn about the policy's terms;  and instructed its claims personnel to withhold helpful information about the policy from Porn.  Because the events underlying these allegations had occurred by the time Porn brought his first action, we find that Porn had ample opportunity to litigate the bad-faith claim therein, see Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 758 (holding that for claim preclusion to apply, a litigant first must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate her claim), and his asserted inability to present evidence of National Grange's litigation conduct as additional support for his bad-faith claim does not present an unusual hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of National Grange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 73, the parties consented to the magistrate judge, rather than the district judge, conducting the jury trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> All of these arguments attack the district court's claim preclusion holding.  Porn also makes arguments challenging the district court's conclusion that the portion of his bad-faith claim relating to National Grange's conduct in the first action was barred by issue preclusion.  However, when Porn commenced the first action, he knew that National Grange had neither settled his benefits claim despite overwhelming evidence that Willoughby alone caused the accident nor conducted an independent investigation into the cause of the accident in an attempt to offset Porn's evidence of Willoughby's wrongdoing.  Thus, we conclude that Porn could have raised a bad-faith claim based on this evidence of National Grange's litigation conduct in the first action and could also have used National Grange's ensuing litigation conduct as further evidence of that claim in the same action.  The claim therefore is barred by the doctrine of res judicata (claim preclusion), see infra.   Accordingly, we do not consider Porn's arguments regarding issue preclusion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A majority of the courts that have considered this question, i.e., whether the facts underlying a breach of insurance contract claim and a bad-faith claim are sufficiently related for purposes of res judicata, also have concluded that both claims arise out of the insurer's refusal to pay the insured the proceeds of the policy.  See, e.g., McCarty v. First of Ga.  Ins. Co., 713 F.2d 609, 612 (10th Cir.1983) (applying Oklahoma res judicata law);  Duhaime v. American Reserve Life Ins. Co., 200 Conn. 360, 511 A.2d 333, 334 (1986);  Chandler v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 467 So.2d 244, 250 (Ala.1985);  Hubbell v. Trans World Life Ins. Co., 50 N.Y.2d 899, 430 N.Y.S.2d 589, 590, 408 N.E.2d 918, 919 (1980);  Stone v. Beneficial Standard Life Ins. Co., 273 Or. 594, 542 P.2d 892, 894 (1975).  Of the courts holding otherwise, i.e., that the facts underlying the contract and bad-faith claims are unrelated, most applied state-law theories of res judicata that differ significantly from the federal res judicata principles that govern this case.  See, e.g., Schmueser v. Burkburnett Bank, 937 F.2d 1025, 1031 (5th Cir.1991) (applying Texas res judicata law);  Robinson v. MFA Mut. Ins. Co., 629 F.2d 497, 501-02 (8th Cir.1980) (applying Arkansas's \"primary rights\" theory of res judicata);  Corral v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 92 Cal.App.3d 1004, 155 Cal.Rptr. 342, 345 (1979) (applying \"primary rights\" theory);  but see Rios v. Allstate Ins. Co., 68 Cal.App.3d 811, 137 Cal.Rptr. 441, 445-46 (1977) (reaching contrary conclusion under \"primary rights\" theory)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Porn's argument that the facts underlying the bad-faith and contract claims are not related in time is similarly unpersuasive.  Porn argues that the facts underlying the bad-faith action go to National Grange's handling of the claim after the car accident, while the facts underlying the contract action go to the accident itself.  However, as we explained above, the factual basis of the contract action is formed by more than just the accident;  it also includes National Grange's refusal to pay, and that refusal occurred after the accident.  Therefore, the facts underlying the contract action cannot be limited to the accident itself but extend to the time period after the accident as well, thereby minimizing any time differential between the facts underlying the two claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Porn's reliance on McAllaster v. Bruton, 655 F.Supp. 1371, 1374 (D.Me.1987), as additional support for this proposition is sorely misplaced.  McAllaster held that an insurer could not be required to pay uninsured motorist benefits without a prior judgment that the uninsured motorist was liable.  Id. at 1374-75.  McAllaster does not address whether a judgment finding breach of the insurance policy is a condition precedent to pursuit of a bad-faith claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In all events, in a bifurcated trial such as the district court envisioned, see supra, the jury would first be asked to determine the breach of contract claim.  Only if the insured prevailed on that claim would the second (bad-faith) phase of the trial transpire.  Thus, the insured would have to secure a finding that the insurer breached the contract before he could recover on his bad-faith claim.  We do not think that the Connecticut Supreme Court would require more</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even if the trial had not been bifurcated and Porn did not yet know that the magistrate judge would grant judgment as a matter of law on the issue of contributory negligence, Porn still could have pointed to National Grange's lack of evidence of contributory negligence and argued that National Grange's refusal to settle the contract case with such a meager defense was more evidence of its bad faith.

Porn brought this diversity action in Maine's federal district court against National Grange seeking additional damages for its alleged mishandling of his underinsured motorist claim.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of National Grange based on the doctrines of collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) and res judicata (claim preclusion), concluding that an issue underlying one of Porn's claims had been decided in the earlier proceeding and that all of Porn's claims could have been raised therein.  Porn appeals the district court's summary judgment order.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background &amp; Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 1990, Porn, a Connecticut resident, was involved in an automobile accident in Portland, Maine, when motorist Lori Willoughby sped through a stop sign and broadsided his vehicle.  Because his damages exceeded Willoughby's $20,000 policy limit, Porn made a claim to National Grange under his automobile policy seeking recovery from the underinsured motorist indorsement to the policy.  For reasons not apparent in the record, National Grange refused to pay the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Disgruntled by this refusal, Porn wrote to National Grange accusing it of bad faith in handling his claim and threatening legal action.  Porn sent copies of his letter to the insurance commissioners of Connecticut and Massachusetts.  National Grange, unimpressed, remained steadfast in its refusal to pay, and in November 1993, Porn filed suit against National Grange in Maine's federal district court for breach of the insurance contract (\"first action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Porn's policy with National Grange required a finding of legal liability on the part of the underinsured motorist as a condition precedent to the payment of benefits, the two-day trial before the magistrate judge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> focused on the question of Willoughby's negligence and Porn's contributory negligence.  Following the completion of the evidence, the magistrate judge entered judgment as a matter of law for Porn on the issue of contributory negligence, and the jury returned a verdict for Porn, finding that Willoughby's negligence had caused him $400,000 worth of damages.  After reducing the jury's award to reflect Porn's $300,000 underinsured motorist policy limit and appropriate set-offs, the magistrate judge entered judgment for Porn in the amount of $255,314.40.  The magistrate judge denied Porn's motion for prejudgment interest, finding that while Maine law allows prejudgment interest in excess of the policy limit where the insurer acted in bad faith and needlessly prolonged the litigation, Porn had presented no evidence that National Grange exhibited such behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, Porn commenced this action against National Grange in Maine's federal district court (\"second action\").  This time Porn alleged that National Grange's conduct in handling his underinsured motorist claim constituted breach of the covenant of good faith, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.  National Grange moved for summary judgment, arguing that the judgment in the first action precluded Porn from bringing the second action.  The district court accepted that argument and granted summary judgment in favor of National Grange on the grounds that (1) one aspect of Porn's bad-faith claim was barred by issue preclusion and (2) all of Porn's claims were barred by claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its first holding, the district court explained that the magistrate judge's decision not to award Porn prejudgment interest was based in part on his finding that Porn had presented no evidence to suggest that National Grange acted in bad faith and needlessly prolonged the litigation.  Accordingly, the court concluded that the question of National Grange's alleged bad-faith conduct in litigating the first action was raised and decided in the first action, and, therefore, to the extent Porn's bad-faith claim involved National Grange's conduct during the first action, it was barred by issue preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching its broader holding that all five of Porn's claims were barred by claim preclusion, the district court reasoned that once Porn chose to bring the first action against National Grange for breach of contract, he was required to raise all his claims arising from the breach or else forfeit the right to do so.  Because it found that Porn's five tort and statutory claims, like the earlier breach of contract claim, involved National Grange's obligations arising under the insurance policy, the district court concluded that they should have been brought in the first action and therefore were barred by claim preclusion from being raised in the second action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Porn appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of National Grange, arguing that the judgment in the first action for breach of contract does not preclude his bad-faith, emotional distress, and statutory unfair practices claims (collectively \"bad-faith claim\") against National Grange in this action.  Specifically, Porn argues that (1) the facts relevant to his bad-faith claim are separate from those relevant to his contract claim, (2) the bad-faith facts do not form a convenient trial unit with the contract facts, (3) treatment of both sets of facts as a unit does not conform to the parties' expectations, and (4) it was inequitable to apply the res judicata bar where, as here, the insurer's conduct in the contract litigation forms part of the bad-faith action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After reciting the standard of review and setting forth the governing res judicata law, we consider each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, under the same standards that govern the district court, to determine whether \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  see also Celotex Corp. v.

See Restatement &#167; 24 cmt. b;  Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 756.   Finally, in making this determination, we are mindful that a single transaction may give rise to a multiplicity of claims, Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 755, and recognize that \"the mere fact that different legal theories are presented in each case does not mean that the same transaction is not behind each,\" Manego, 773 F.2d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Consideration of the Restatement Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that background, we inquire whether the causes of action asserted in the first and second suits are sufficiently identical, focusing on the three Restatement factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Relation of the Facts in Time, Space, Origin, or Motivation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first Restatement factor asks whether the facts underlying the breach of contract and bad-faith claims are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, i.e., whether they arise out of the same transaction, seek redress for essentially the same basic wrong, and rest on the same or a substantially similar factual basis.  See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555434\"><a href=\"/opinion/555434/carl-kale-v-combined-insurance-company-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1166 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></span> (1991).  In this case, our answers to these questions lead us to conclude that the facts underlying the two claims are closely related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we find that both the bad-faith claim and the contract claim derive from the same occurrence:  National Grange's refusal to pay Porn the proceeds of his underinsured motorist policy for the July 17, 1990, accident.  Second, although the two claims present different legal theories, one sounding in contract and the other in tort, they both seek redress for essentially the same basic wrong.  For instance, Porn's contract action sought redress for National Grange's refusal to pay the policy proceeds, while his bad-faith action sought redress for its unreasonable refusal to pay the proceeds, see Buckman v. People Express, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></span>, 599 (1987).  Third, a comparison of the two complaints illustrates that the two claims rest on a similar factual basis.  Both complaints, in their factual allegations, outline the circumstances of the accident, the particulars of the insurance policy, and National Grange's conduct in refusing to pay.  In sum, the facts underlying the two claims are closely related in time, space, origin, and motivation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Porn expends considerable effort characterizing the instant action as arising out of a transaction separate from that giving rise to the first action.  In particular, Porn maintains that the bad-faith action stems from National Grange's conduct in handling his insurance claim, whereas the contract action stems from the circumstances surrounding the car accident.  Porn's definition of the two transactions out of which the claims arise, however, is artificially narrow.  For instance, the contract claim arises out of more than the car accident alone.  It arises out of the accident in conjunction with National Grange's refusal to pay under the policy.  Indeed, without the refusal to pay, no contract breach could exist.  Similarly, the factual basis of Porn's bad-faith claim cannot be limited to National Grange's conduct in handling Porn's insurance claim.  In this case, the facts of the car accident are also probative of National Grange's reasonableness in refusing to pay Porn's claim.  For instance, if, as Porn suggests, the facts of the accident present a clear picture that Willoughby was the legal cause of the accident and Porn was not contributorily negligent, National Grange would have had less reason to contest the claim and therefore its refusal to pay appears less reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, each legal theory relies more heavily on some of the underlying facts than others.  The accident facts, for example, will likely receive more emphasis in proving the contract claim, while the facts regarding National Grange's conduct in handling Porn's insurance claim will be more focal in proving the bad-faith claim.  However, the Restatement makes clear that merely because two claims depend on different shadings of the facts or emphasize different elements of the facts, we should not color our perception of the transaction underlying them, creating multiple transactions where only one transaction exists.  Restatement &#167; 24 cmt. c.  By focusing exclusively on the facts most critical to each claim, Porn has ignored the other facts underlying each claim.  Accordingly, we reject Porn's grouping of the facts underlying the two claims into separate transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Trial Convenience</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Restatement factor directs us to determine whether the facts underlying the contract and bad-faith claims form a convenient trial unit.  This factor, aimed at conserving judicial resources, provides that where the witnesses or proof needed in the second action overlap substantially with those used in the first action, the second action should ordinarily be precluded.  Restatement &#167; 24 cmt. b.  We conclude that Porn's bad-faith claim would use much of the same evidence produced in the first action for breach of the insurance contract, and therefore it would have been convenient and efficient for the district court to have heard the two claims in the same action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony and exhibits about the circumstances of the accident are relevant to both the contract and bad-faith claims.  To establish that National Grange breached the insurance policy in not paying his claim, Porn had to prove that Willoughby's negligence caused the accident and that he was not contributorily negligent.  Accordingly, in the first action, Porn presented evidence detailing the circumstances of the accident.  This evidence would likely have been repeated in a second action for bad faith, as Porn would have sought to portray the accident facts as so plainly establishing Willoughby's negligence that National Grange had no credible reason for refusing to pay his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in the contract action and the second action would also overlap as to the terms of Porn's underinsured motorist policy and National Grange's refusal to pay his claim.  To prove breach of contract, Porn had to establish that National Grange refused to pay his claim where the terms of the policy so required.  Likewise, the reasonableness of National Grange's refusal to pay, i.e., whether it acted in bad faith, depends on what the policy required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than addressing the degree to which the evidence supporting each claim overlaps, Porn challenges the convenience of bringing the claims together on two other grounds.  First, Porn argues that evidence relevant to the bad-faith claim, specifically evidence of the amount of insurance available and the fact of settlement offers and negotiations, would prejudice the insurer's defense of the contract claim, and therefore the two claims do not form a convenient trial unit.  However, we agree with the district court that any potential prejudice could be resolved by bifurcating the trial.  With bifurcation, the evidence common to both claims, which was considerable, could have been presented at once and not \"in separate lawsuits commenced at a distance of months or years.\"  Porn v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., No. 95-140-P-H, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">626374</span></span>, at * 3 (D.Me. Sept. 27, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Porn argues that he had to procure a judgment that National Grange breached the insurance contract before the cause of action for bad faith could accrue and therefore the bad-faith and contract claims could not be joined in the same action.  Porn bases this contention on an assumption that, although a Connecticut court has yet to decide this issue, it would follow jurisdictions like Florida and require a judgment of contract breach as a condition precedent to the pursuit of a bad-faith claim.  See, e.g., Blanchard v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1838797\"><a href=\"/opinion/1838797/blanchard-v-state-farm-mut-auto-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1290 (Fla.1991) (\"[A]n insured's underlying first-party action for insurance benefits against the insurer necessarily must be resolved favorably to the insured before the cause of action for bad faith in settlement negotiations can accrue.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The district court correctly observed, however, that the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected this contention in Duhaime v. American Reserve Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span>, 334-35 (1986).  Invoking the doctrine of res judicata, the Connecticut Supreme Court held that Duhaime's earlier action for breach of the insurance policy barred a subsequent action for bad faith.  Id.  In so holding, the court implicitly acknowledged that a bad-faith action can accrue without a separate judgment of contract breach.  Although Duhaime involved disability insurance and the instant case involves underinsured motorist insurance, we see nothing unique about underinsured motorist insurance that would preclude Duhaime 's holding from governing here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Parties' Expectations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final Restatement factor is whether treating the underlying facts as a trial unit conforms to the parties' expectations.  For the following reasons, we conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he brought his contract suit in November 1993, Porn knew the facts necessary for bringing a bad-faith claim.  He knew that National Grange had refused to pay;  he knew its alleged reasons for so refusing;  and he knew the extent of the delay in payment attributable to the refusal.  Therefore, because the two claims arose in the same time frame out of similar facts, one would reasonably expect them to be brought together.  See 18 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4407, at 56 (1981) (\"Defendants may reasonably demand that disposition of the first suit establish repose as to all matters that ordinary people would intuitively count part of a single basic dispute.\").  Indeed, in February 1993, nine months before filing the first action, Porn wrote a letter to National Grange in which he made a demand for his policy proceeds and concomitantly threatened to sue for bad faith.  In light of this letter, it would not have been unreasonable for National Grange to expect that any subsequent lawsuit that Porn initiated would include claims for both breach of contract and bad faith.  Finally, bringing related claims together is arguably more conducive to settlement and therefore, at least in this case, may have had some pragmatic appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, applying the Restatement's transactional test to this case, we conclude that the two lawsuits involved sufficiently identical causes of action.  Because the cause of action should not have been split into two lawsuits, Porn's bad-faith claim is barred by claim preclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Equitable Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his final argument, Porn contends that even if we find that res judicata applies, equity demands its suspension in this case.  Specifically, Porn argues that because National Grange's decision to proceed to judgment in the contract action with no evidence to support its defense (\"litigation conduct\") is probative of bad faith, the full nature of National Grange's bad-faith tort was not revealed until judgment was entered in the contract action.  Therefore, Porn argues, it would be premature and unfair to require him to bring his bad-faith claim together with his contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has counselled us to adhere to traditional principles of res judicata and not to make any \"ad hoc determination of the equities in a particular case.\"  Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v.

Assuming arguendo that Moitie did not foreclose the possibility of an equitable exception, we find that, in the context of this case, requiring the bad-faith claim to be brought in the first action creates no unusual hardship for Porn and therefore the exception does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we challenge Porn's assumption that requiring the two claims to be brought together would necessarily preclude as support for the bad-faith claim any evidence about National Grange's decision to proceed to judgment in the contract action with no evidence to support its defense.  Had the contract and bad-faith claims been brought together, the district court would likely have bifurcated the trial into two phases.  By the time of the bad-faith phase of the trial, the contract phase would already have been completed and Porn would know both the quality of evidence National Grange presented to defend the contract claim and that the magistrate judge had granted judgment as a matter of law for Porn on the issue of contributory negligence.  Accordingly, we see nothing that would have prevented Porn from presenting this evidence in the bad-faith phase of the trial and arguing to the jury that National Grange's refusal to settle the contract action despite insufficient evidence of a meritorious defense was more evidence of its bad faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, assuming arguendo that Porn's assumption was correct and that at the time he brought the contract action he was unaware of the litigation conduct that would occur therein, we nonetheless conclude that Porn was aware of other conduct by National Grange sufficient to support a bad-faith claim.  Indeed, of the ten factual allegations supporting Porn's bad-faith complaint, nine were known to Porn at the time he instituted the first action.  For instance, the second complaint alleged that National Grange failed to act on the claim for nine months;  failed to make an offer on the claim for sixteen months;  failed to allow Porn to settle with Willoughby's carrier for the available liability proceeds for two years;  justified delays with the possibility of other insurance coverage when it knew no such insurance existed;  made Porn investigate the possibility of other coverage;  failed to investigate the claim;  repeatedly lied to Porn about the policy's terms;  and instructed its claims personnel to withhold helpful information about the policy from Porn.  Because the events underlying these allegations had occurred by the time Porn brought his first action, we find that Porn had ample opportunity to litigate the bad-faith claim therein, see Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 758 (holding that for claim preclusion to apply, a litigant first must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate her claim), and his asserted inability to present evidence of National Grange's litigation conduct as additional support for his bad-faith claim does not present an unusual hardship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of National Grange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 73, the parties consented to the magistrate judge, rather than the district judge, conducting the jury trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> All of these arguments attack the district court's claim preclusion holding.  Porn also makes arguments challenging the district court's conclusion that the portion of his bad-faith claim relating to National Grange's conduct in the first action was barred by issue preclusion.  However, when Porn commenced the first action, he knew that National Grange had neither settled his benefits claim despite overwhelming evidence that Willoughby alone caused the accident nor conducted an independent investigation into the cause of the accident in an attempt to offset Porn's evidence of Willoughby's wrongdoing.  Thus, we conclude that Porn could have raised a bad-faith claim based on this evidence of National Grange's litigation conduct in the first action and could also have used National Grange's ensuing litigation conduct as further evidence of that claim in the same action.  The claim therefore is barred by the doctrine of res judicata (claim preclusion), see infra.   Accordingly, we do not consider Porn's arguments regarding issue preclusion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A majority of the courts that have considered this question, i.e., whether the facts underlying a breach of insurance contract claim and a bad-faith claim are sufficiently related for purposes of res judicata, also have concluded that both claims arise out of the insurer's refusal to pay the insured the proceeds of the policy.

Of the courts holding otherwise, i.e., that the facts underlying the contract and bad-faith claims are unrelated, most applied state-law theories of res judicata that differ significantly from the federal res judicata principles that govern this case.

Porn argues that the facts underlying the bad-faith action go to National Grange's handling of the claim after the car accident, while the facts underlying the contract action go to the accident itself.  However, as we explained above, the factual basis of the contract action is formed by more than just the accident;  it also includes National Grange's refusal to pay, and that refusal occurred after the accident.  Therefore, the facts underlying the contract action cannot be limited to the accident itself but extend to the time period after the accident as well, thereby minimizing any time differential between the facts underlying the two claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Porn's reliance on McAllaster v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span>, 1374 (D.Me.1987), as additional support for this proposition is sorely misplaced.  McAllaster held that an insurer could not be required to pay uninsured motorist benefits without a prior judgment that the uninsured motorist was liable.  Id. at 1374-75.  McAllaster does not address whether a judgment finding breach of the insurance policy is a condition precedent to pursuit of a bad-faith claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In all events, in a bifurcated trial such as the district court envisioned, see supra, the jury would first be asked to determine the breach of contract claim.  Only if the insured prevailed on that claim would the second (bad-faith) phase of the trial transpire.  Thus, the insured would have to secure a finding that the insurer breached the contract before he could recover on his bad-faith claim.  We do not think that the Connecticut Supreme Court would require more</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even if the trial had not been bifurcated and Porn did not yet know that the magistrate judge would grant judgment as a matter of law on the issue of contributory negligence, Porn still could have pointed to National Grange's lack of evidence of contributory negligence and argued that National Grange's refusal to settle the contract case with such a meager defense was more evidence of its bad faith.
