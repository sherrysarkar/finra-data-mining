Maffei, Robert\r\nDiAdamo, and Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nApril 29, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  In this diversity case,\r\ndefendants-appellants BC Associates, et al. (\"appellants\") appeal\r\na final judgment of the district court, issued in part on a jury\r\nverdict and in part as a matter of law.  Appellants also challenge\r\nthe court's denial of their motion for a new trial on damages.  We\r\nreverse the district court's judgment as a matter of law and affirm\r\nthe court's denial of the motion for a new trial.\r\n                         I.  Facts\r\nOn appeal, two partners dispute whether a 1991 settlement\r\npayment made to third parties by one of the partners should be\r\ncharacterized under the partnership agreements as a \"Deficit Loan\"\r\nor as an indemnification obligation.  Insofar as appellants are\r\nchallenging the judgment entered against them as a matter of law by\r\nthe district court, we view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to them.  See Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731,\r\n733 (1st Cir. 1994).  But insofar as they are challenging the\r\njury's verdict, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nthe verdict.  See Dichner v. Liberty Travel, 141 F.3d 24, 27 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  Defendants BCA-1 and BCA-2 (together \"BCA\") and\r\nplaintiff-appellee FHS Properties Limited Partnership (\"FHS\"), are\r\nrespectively the managing partners and sole other general partner\r\nof two partnerships that developed and now own International Place,\r\na two-tower office complex in downtown Boston.  FHS has a sixty-\r\npercent interest in the two partnerships.  BCA has a forty-percent\r\ninterest.  The partners envisioned developing the complex in two\r\ndistinct phases and therefore formed Fort Hill Square Associates\r\n(\"Partnership 1\") to develop Phase 1 of the project and Fort Hill\r\nSquare Phase 2 Associates (\"Partnership 2\") to develop Phase 2. \r\nThe partners signed two partnership agreements (\"Partnership\r\nAgreements\"), essentially identical in their terms, which provided\r\nthat the agreements would be construed in accordance with\r\nMassachusetts law.\r\nPhase 1 of the project was initially financed through a\r\nconstruction loan from Bank of Boston.  When construction was\r\ncomplete, the construction loan was \"taken out\" and replaced with\r\npermanent financing by Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association\r\n(\"TIAA\").  When the partners decided to proceed with Phase 2, Bank\r\nof Boston again agreed to finance the construction, subject to a\r\npermanent \"take out\" commitment from TIAA.  The second construction\r\nloan was secured by all of the partnerships' assets, including a\r\nmortgage on Phase 1.  Notwithstanding its security interest, Bank\r\nof Boston, in May 1990, approved a plan to distribute $15 million\r\nof partnership cash to the partners on three future distribution\r\ndates, provided that certain conditions were satisfied on those\r\ndates.\r\nThe settlement obligation at issue in this case arose in\r\nJanuary 1991, when two entities, who were then limited partners of\r\nBCA-1 and who shared an interest in Phase 1 but not Phase 2 of the\r\nproject, sued defendants Partnership 1, BCA-1, FHS, Donald\r\nChiofaro, Theodore Oatis, Bank of Boston, and TIAA, claiming that\r\nthe general partners of BCA-1 had misused partnership assets by\r\npledging them as security for the construction of Phase 2 (the\r\n\"Dimeo\" suit).  The initiation of the suit distressed the\r\npartnerships' lenders.  Bank of Boston sought an assurance from\r\nTIAA that notwithstanding the pendency of the suit, it would honor\r\nits promise to pay off the bank's construction loan and replace it\r\nwith permanent financing once Phase 2 was complete.  TIAA refused\r\nto give such an assurance.  Bank of Boston responded by threatening\r\nto cease financing Phase 2 construction and insisted that the\r\npartnerships sign a \"Forbearance Agreement,\" which became effective\r\non March 14, 1991.  That agreement stated that it would be an event\r\nof default under the construction loan if the Dimeo suit was not\r\nsettled by April 15, 1991; and pending the April 15 deadline, the\r\nbank would finance only fifty percent of the requisitions made\r\nunder the loan agreement, forcing the partnerships to cover the\r\nbalance from other funds, which could potentially include the $15\r\nmillion earmarked for distribution.\r\nNot surprisingly, BCA and FHS jointly worked to resolve\r\nthe Dimeo suit by the April 15 deadline.  They negotiated on\r\nmultiple occasions with the Dimeo plaintiffs' lawyers and met with\r\nBank of Boston and TIAA in an effort either to borrow funds with\r\nwhich to settle the suit or to eliminate the terms of the\r\nForbearance Agreement.  On each occasion, the lenders refused to\r\nlend the necessary money or to change the terms of the Forbearance\r\nAgreement.\r\nOn April 12, 1991, the last business day before the\r\nbank's deadline, BCA and FHS reached an oral agreement with the\r\nDimeo plaintiffs to settle the suit for $5.6 million.  Payment was\r\ndue in one week, on April 19.  The partners promptly informed Bank\r\nof Boston and TIAA that the case had been resolved.  \r\nOn April 18, however, FHS informed BCA, by notice to\r\nBCA's general partner Chiofaro, that BCA was forbidden from using\r\nPartnership 1 or Partnership 2 funds to satisfy the settlement, and\r\nthreatened to remove BCA as managing general partner should it do\r\nso.  FHS added that it would notify Bank of Boston and TIAA of its\r\nposition.  According to FHS, partnership funds could not be used to\r\npay the settlement because the settlement was solely BCA's\r\nobligation.\r\nAfter deliberating through the evening of April 18,\r\nChiofaro decided on the morning of April 19 to use only BCA funds\r\nto pay the settlement.  That day, he paid the Dimeo plaintiffs\r\n$5.6 million.  In return, the Dimeo plaintiffs forfeited to BCA\r\ntheir small, indirect equity interests in Phase 1, represented by\r\nthe limited partnership interests in BCA-1.  \r\nSection 5.2 of the Partnership Agreements permits a\r\npartner to lend the partnerships certain amounts as \"Deficit Loans\"\r\nif four conditions are met: (1) there must exist a \"financial\r\nrequirement\" of the partnership, that (2) \"cannot . . . reasonably\r\nbe satisfied from partnership capital, additional capital,\r\nfinancing proceeds, revenues and other partnership moneys,\" (3)\r\n\"the parties [have] use[d] their best efforts to obtain reasonable\r\nnon-recourse institutional financing . . . of the required amounts\"\r\nbut have been unable to \"obtain such financing,\" and (4) a partner\r\nhas \"elect[ed] . . . in its sole discretion\" to loan the\r\npartnership the necessary funds.\"  In November 1991, some six\r\nmonths after satisfying the Dimeo settlement, BCA sent a letter to\r\nFHS, asserting that its settlement payment constituted a \"Deficit\r\nLoan,\" accruing interest at 18%.  FHS responded that no such\r\nDeficit Loan had been made, and that BCA was not entitled to\r\nindemnification for any part of the $5.6 million payment.  FHS then\r\nfiled the instant action seeking a declaration that neither\r\nPartnership 1 nor Partnership 2 owed any sum to BCA.\r\n                   II.  Prior Proceedings\r\nThe parties tried the case to a jury over twelve days\r\nbeginning October 14, 1997.  Although denominated defendants,\r\nappellants assumed the burden of proof and proceeded through trial\r\neffectively as plaintiffs.  Upon the close of appellants' evidence,\r\nFHS moved for judgment as a matter of law on the Deficit Loan\r\nissue, contending that the second requirement of Section 5.2 had\r\nnot been met because \"[t]here can be no question before the jury\r\nthat the partnership[s] had money with which to pay this\r\nobligation.\"  The court reserved ruling on the motion and submitted\r\nthe question to the jury.  The district court also instructed the\r\njury on damages, advising that damages should reflect the $5.6\r\nmillion settlement payment made by BCA, less the value of any\r\nbenefits obtained by it, including the limited partnership\r\ninterests in Phase 1 obtained in the settlement and the value, if\r\nany, of the release from the lawsuit.  Appellants did not object to\r\nthis instruction. \r\nAfter deliberation, the jury answered special\r\ninterrogatories establishing that appellants had proved each of the\r\nfour conjunctive elements for a \"Deficit Loan;\" and alternatively,\r\nthat appellants were entitled to be indemnified by the partnerships\r\nfor the settlement payment.  Following the return of the special\r\nverdict, the court gave a number of additional instructions on\r\ndamages.  In the end, the jury returned a verdict establishing\r\nappellants' damages at $2.1 million.\r\nFollowing the jury's verdict, FHS renewed its motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law and appellants filed a motion for a new\r\ntrial on damages.  The court, on May 13, 1998, entered final\r\njudgment, ruling that a Deficit Loan did not exist under the\r\npartnership agreements as a matter of law and that appellants were\r\nonly entitled to indemnification.  According to the court, \"the\r\nfacts established at trial show that the Dimeo suit could\r\nreasonably have been paid from partnership funds.\"  Additionally,\r\nthe court denied appellants' motion for a new trial.  In the end,\r\nthe court entered judgment awarding appellants indemnification\r\npayments in the amount of $2.1 million accruing interest at 6% per\r\nannum.  By contrast, as a Deficit Loan, the amount the partnerships\r\nowed appellants would have accrued interest at 18% per annum.  \r\nAppellants appeal both the judgment as a matter of law\r\nand the denial of their motion for a new trial.  \r\n                      III.  Discussion\r\nA.  Judgment as a Matter of Law\r\nWe review a district court's granting of judgment as a\r\nmatter of law de novo.  See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69\r\nF.3d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir. 1995).  \"A judgment as a matter of law\r\nmay be granted only if the evidence, viewed from the perspective\r\nmost favorable to the nonmovant, is so one-sided that the movant is\r\nplainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ\r\nas to the outcome.\"  Gibson, 37 F.3d at 735.  In considering the\r\nevidence, we, like the district court, \"cannot evaluate the\r\ncredibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or\r\nevaluate the weight of evidence.\"  Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d\r\n437, 441 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).  \r\nDuring trial, appellants contended that the partnerships'\r\nadmittedly plentiful funds were not reasonably available to pay the\r\nDimeo settlement because of restrictions imposed by the loan\r\nagreements.  Appellants also argued that FHS's refusal to permit\r\nBCA to use partnership funds further hindered these funds from\r\nbeing reasonably available.  \r\nThe court, however, rejected these theories as a matter\r\nof law because it regarded as undisputed two facts: (1) Bank of\r\nBoston had permitted Partnership 1 to distribute up to $15 million\r\nto the partners and this money could have been used to fund the\r\nsettlement; and (2) Chiofaro's and Oatis's testimony that before\r\nFHS's objection on April 18, 1991, they intended to pay the\r\nsettlement from partnership funds without obtaining bank approval\r\ndemonstrated that loan restrictions did not hinder the use of\r\nfunds.  The court additionally found that FHS's refusal to permit\r\nthe use of partnership funds was irrelevant because BCA, as\r\nmanaging general partner, had the authority to settle the lawsuit\r\nwith partnership funds regardless of FHS's position.\r\nReviewing the record in the light most favorable to\r\nappellants, we disagree with the district court's assessment of the\r\nevidence as undisputed.  In our view, the jury verdict was\r\nadequately supported by appellants' evidence that partnership funds\r\nwere not reasonably available because of loan restrictions and\r\nFHS's lack of cooperation.  The partnerships' loan documents\r\nprovided that all of the partnerships' assets served as collateral\r\nfor the construction loan.  Specifically, section 14(c) of the\r\nConstruction Loan Agreement and the related Pledge and Escrow\r\nAgreement of Cash Account stated that Bank of Boston had a security\r\ninterest in all of the partnerships' assets and that neither\r\npartnership could apply funds for any purpose without bank consent. \r\nWitness testimony further supported this documentary evidence:\r\nChiofaro and Oatis testified that funds could not be used to pay\r\nthe settlement without bank permission, which was not forthcoming;\r\nand Coleman Benedict, an FHS representative, testified that the\r\npartnerships did not have enough free cash to fund the settlement.\r\nIt is true that Bank of Boston authorized the\r\ndisbursement of $15 million to the partners, but appellants\r\nintroduced evidence that these funds were not reasonably available\r\nto pay the Dimeo settlement.  Fifteen million dollars had been\r\nearmarked for distribution on three dates: $8 million on June 5,\r\n1990, $3 million six months thereafter, and $4 million six months\r\nthereafter.  According to loan documents and Oatis's testimony,\r\nthese earmarked funds could not be distributed without bank\r\napproval on each disbursement date.  Moreover, according to Oatis,\r\nthe earmarked funds were not sufficient on April 19, 1991 to pay\r\nthe $5.6 million settlement.  Eight million dollars had already\r\nbeen distributed to the partners as of the first release date and\r\ntherefore were no longer part of the partnership assets.  The next\r\n$3 million were not distributed on the scheduled second\r\ndisbursement date because that amount had been used to fund fifty\r\npercent of the Phase 2 construction expenses during the pendency of\r\nthe Forbearance Agreement.  Finally, the last $4 million were\r\nearmarked for distribution in May 1991, after the settlement\r\npayment was due.  While BCA theoretically could have used the $4\r\nmillion in anticipation of the forthcoming release date, the jury\r\ncould have found that FHS's threats, as well as uncertainty\r\nregarding the bank's required consent, rendered the funds not\r\nreasonably available on April 19, 1991.  In all events, simple\r\narithmetic proves that $4 million is not $5.6 million.\r\nWe also disagree with the district court's decision that\r\nChiofaro's and Oatis's testimony that they had initially intended\r\nto pay the settlement from partnership funds without obtaining bank\r\napproval is conclusive evidence that bank restrictions did not\r\nencumber partnership funds.  While such testimony tends to prove\r\nthat partnership funds were reasonably available, it is not\r\nconclusive evidence on this point.  The jury could have credited\r\nOatis's testimony that he did not intend to obtain bank permission\r\nbefore April 19 because it was not until that date that he realized\r\nthe distribution of funds necessary for payment could not occur\r\nwithout FHS's cooperation. \r\nThe testimony introduced at trial therefore sufficiently\r\nsupported the jury's finding that funds were not reasonably\r\navailable to settle the Dimeo suit on April 19, 1991.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, the district court erred in ruling as a matter of\r\nlaw that the conditions for a Deficit Loan had not been met.  Thus,\r\nwe reverse the court's judgment as a matter of law, reinstate the\r\njury's finding that the conditions for a Deficit Loan were met, and\r\nremand so that judgment may be entered in accordance with this\r\nopinion.  \r\nB.  Motion for New Trial\r\nAppellants also challenge the district court's refusal to\r\ngrant a new trial on damages, contending that the court's\r\ninstructions to the jury on damages were erroneous and\r\nalternatively, that the jury's valuation of their damages at only\r\n$2.1 million is not supported by the evidence.  We review the\r\ncourt's denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See Air Safety v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston,\r\n94 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nAccording to appellants, the district court erred in\r\ninstructing the jury that it could deduct the value of the limited\r\npartners' release from its base damages when there was no evidence\r\nof the value of the release in the record.  See Kelliher v. General\r\nTransp. Serv., Inc., 29 F.3d 750, 754 (1st Cir. 1994) (jury\r\ninstruction may not be given if there is insufficient evidence to\r\nsupport it).  \r\nAppellants, however, did not preserve this argument for\r\nappeal.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 states, in relevant part, that \"[n]o\r\nparty may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an\r\ninstruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury\r\nretires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter\r\nobjected to and the grounds of the objection.\"  \r\nAlthough appellants contend that they objected to the\r\njury instruction and further submission of the issue, we have been\r\nunable to discern any such objection.  Rather, our reading of the\r\nrecord indicates that appellants failed to object when the court,\r\nat the close of the evidence, instructed the jury: \r\n  In calculating damages, I instruct you that\r\nthe base figure on which your calculation is\r\nmade is the 5.6 million paid to settle the\r\nsuit.  From that amount, you should deduct the\r\nvalue, if any, of the assets which you find\r\nthat Chiofaro purchased from [the limited\r\npartners] in settlement of the suit, that is,\r\nwhat you find to be the value, again, if any,\r\nof the 22 percent interest in the BCA[-1]\r\npartnership, as well as the value of the\r\nrelease given Chiofaro by [the limited\r\npartners].\r\n\nAppellants also failed to object when the jury, after a period of\r\ndeliberation, requested by note that the court \"supply parameters\r\n'for the value of the release.'\"  Appellants' assertion that during\r\na resulting lobby conference, they \"stated that there existed no\r\ntestimony in the record as to the value of the release [and]\r\nobjected to additional instruction concerning the value of the\r\nrelease and to further submission of the issue to the jury\"\r\nmisstates the record.  During the lobby conference, the court asked\r\nthe parties whether there was testimony on the value of the\r\nreleases.  Counsel for appellants responded: \"The only testimony,\r\nI believe, was opinion testimony on the value of the interest.  So\r\nsubtraction works, but I think that's unfair.\"  Counsel did not,\r\nhowever, object to the court's instructing the jury to subtract the\r\nvalue of the release from the $5.6 million base figure.  Rather,\r\nthe only so-called objection noted by counsel at that time was\r\n\"[y]ou've got to repeat your [earlier] instruction and say the\r\nevidence is the evidence.\"  These comments, together, fall short of\r\nRule 51's requirement that the objection \"stat[e] distinctly the\r\nmatter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"\r\nAbsent a timely objection, an erroneous jury instruction\r\nwarrants a new trial only where the assigned error \"'caused a\r\nmiscarriage of justice or . . . undermined the integrity of the\r\njudicial process.'\"  Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia\r\nCommunications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting\r\nScarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 940 (1st Cir. 1995)). \r\nWe see no miscarriage of justice here and therefore hold that\r\nappellants have waived their objection to the jury instruction. \r\nSee, e.g., Play Time, 123 F.3d at 30, n.8 (no miscarriage of\r\njustice where the issue \"implicates only the question of damages\r\nfor breach of a private agreement between the litigants;\" and no\r\ndamage to integrity of the judicial process where \"the proceedings\r\nbelow were conducted with meticulous attention to the rights of\r\nboth parties\").\r\nAppellants also make the argument that even if the value\r\nof the release played no role in the jury's reduction of its\r\nrecovery   so that the $3.5 million reduction represents the value\r\nof limited partnership interests only   they are still entitled to\r\na new trial on damages because the jury's valuation is not\r\nsupported by the record.  In challenging the jury's damage award,\r\nappellants face a daunting task.  Our review \"is limited to\r\nexamining whether evidence in the record supports the verdict.  If\r\nthe jury award has a rational basis in evidence, we must affirm\r\nit.\"  Air Safety, 94 F.3d at 4  (citation and internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).  \"While 'the jury may not render a verdict based on\r\nspeculation or guesswork,' a reviewing court will not tinker with\r\nthe jury's assessment of money damages as long as it does not fall\r\noutside the broad universe of theoretically possible awards that\r\ncan be said to be supported by the evidence.\"  Dopp v. Pritzker, 38\r\nF.3d 1239, 1249 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation omitted).  In the end,\r\n\"[w]e will not disturb an award of damages for economic loss\r\nprovided it does not violate the conscience of the court or strike\r\nsuch a dissonant chord that justice would be denied were the\r\njudgment permitted to stand.\"  Vera-Lozano v. Int'l Broadcasting,\r\n50 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). \r\nHere, the jury's valuation of the limited partnership\r\ninterests falls within the broad universe of awards supported by\r\nthe evidence.  Together, the limited partners had a 22.5% interest\r\nin BCA-1, which in turn had a 40% interest in Phase 1.  Thus, the\r\nlimited partners had a 9% interest in Phase 1.  Oatis testified\r\nduring trial that, in 1989, he prepared for FHS a valuation of\r\nPhase 1 for $150 to $200 million.  Using the 9% figure, the limited\r\npartnership interests in this amount would have been $13 to $18\r\nmillion.  Francis McCarthy, former comptroller of Chiofaro Company,\r\none of Chiofaro's interests, testified that, some time after August\r\n1990, Chiofaro asked him to calculate certain tax consequences of\r\nacquiring one of the limited partner's interest at purchase prices\r\nranging from $1.96 to $4 million.  The jury could have determined\r\nthat this testimony reflected a proper valuation of one of the\r\nlimited partner's interest.  Appellants themselves introduced into\r\nevidence a letter from Richard Renehan, lead trial counsel for\r\ndefendants in Dimeo, to Earl Cooley, counsel for plaintiffs,\r\nstating that defendants were \"prepared to buy your clients out for\r\ncash at the fair market value of their interests\" and offering $1.6\r\nmillion.  Kevin Currier, the Chief Financial Officer of Dimeo\r\nConstruction Company (\"Dimeo\"), a limited partner with a 20%\r\ninterest in BCA-1, testified that, based on this letter, he valued\r\nthe sale of Dimeo's interest at $1.5 million on Dimeo's 1991 tax\r\nreturn (and the IRS challenged this valuation as insufficient). \r\nFinally, Coleman Benedict testified that during settlement\r\nnegotiations he discussed with Chiofaro the limited partners'\r\ninterest at values ranging from zero to $15 million, depending on\r\n\"assumptions you used about the condition of the market in the\r\nfuture.\"  Based on the sum of this evidence, the jury could have\r\nreasonably valued the limited partnership interests in BCA-1 at\r\n$3.5 million.  We will not second-guess its decision to do so.\r\n                      IV.  Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the\r\ndistrict court in part and affirm in part.  No costs.\n",

City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 733 (1st Cir.1994).  But insofar as they are challenging the jury's verdict, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See Dichner v. Liberty Travel, 141 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.1998).  Defendants BCA-1 and BCA-2 (together \"BCA\") and plaintiff-appellee FHS Properties Limited Partnership (\"FHS\"), are respectively the managing partners and sole other general partner of two partnerships that developed and now own International Place, a two-tower office complex in downtown Boston.  FHS has a sixty-percent interest in the two partnerships.  BCA has a forty-percent interest.  The partners envisioned developing the complex in two distinct phases and therefore formed Fort Hill Square Associates (\"Partnership 1\") to develop Phase 1 of the project and Fort Hill Square Phase 2 Associates (\"Partnership 2\") to develop Phase 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The partners signed two partnership agreements (\"Partnership Agreements\"), essentially identical in their terms, which provided that the agreements would be construed in accordance with Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phase 1 of the project was initially financed through a construction loan from Bank of Boston.  When construction was complete, the construction loan was \"taken out\" and replaced with permanent financing by Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association (\"TIAA\").  When the partners decided to proceed with Phase 2, Bank of Boston again agreed to finance the construction, subject to a permanent \"take out\" commitment from TIAA.  The second construction loan was secured by all of the partnerships' assets, including a mortgage on Phase 1. Notwithstanding its security interest, Bank of Boston, in May 1990, approved a plan to distribute $15 million of partnership cash to the partners on three future distribution dates, provided that certain conditions were satisfied on those dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement obligation at issue in this case arose in January 1991, when two entities, who were then limited partners of BCA-1 and who shared an interest in Phase 1 but not Phase 2 of the project, sued defendants Partnership 1, BCA-1, FHS, Donald Chiofaro, Theodore Oatis, Bank of Boston, and TIAA, claiming that the general partners of BCA-1 had misused partnership assets by pledging them as security for the construction of Phase 2 (the \"Dimeo \" suit).  The initiation of the suit distressed the partnerships' lenders.  Bank of Boston sought an assurance from TIAA that notwithstanding the pendency of the suit, it would honor its promise to pay off the bank's construction loan and replace it with permanent financing once Phase 2 was complete.  TIAA refused to give such an assurance.  Bank of Boston responded by threatening to cease financing Phase 2 construction and insisted that the partnerships sign a \"Forbearance Agreement,\" which became effective on March 14, 1991.  That agreement stated that it would be an event of default under the construction loan if the Dimeo suit was not settled by April 15, 1991;  and pending the April 15 deadline, the bank would finance only fifty percent of the requisitions made under the loan agreement, forcing the partnerships to cover the balance from other funds, which could potentially include the $15 million earmarked for distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, BCA and FHS jointly worked to resolve the Dimeo suit by the April 15 deadline.  They negotiated on multiple occasions with the Dimeo plaintiffs' lawyers and met with Bank of Boston and TIAA in an effort either to borrow funds with which to settle the suit or to eliminate the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.  On each occasion, the lenders refused to lend the necessary money or to change the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 1991, the last business day before the bank's deadline, BCA and FHS reached an oral agreement with the Dimeo plaintiffs to settle the suit for $5.6 million.  Payment was due in one week, on April 19.  The partners promptly informed Bank of Boston and TIAA that the case had been resolved.  On April 18, however, FHS informed BCA, by notice to BCA's general partner Chiofaro, that BCA was forbidden from using Partnership 1 or Partnership 2 funds to satisfy the settlement, and threatened to remove BCA as managing general partner should it do so.  FHS added that it would notify Bank of Boston and TIAA of its position.  According to FHS, partnership funds could not be used to pay the settlement because the settlement was solely BCA's obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberating through the evening of April 18, Chiofaro decided on the morning of April 19 to use only BCA funds to pay the settlement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  That day, he paid the Dimeo plaintiffs $5.6 million.  In return, the Dimeo plaintiffs forfeited to BCA their small, indirect equity interests in Phase 1, represented by the limited partnership interests in BCA-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5.2 of the Partnership Agreements permits a partner to lend the partnerships certain amounts as \"Deficit Loans\" if four conditions are met:  (1) there must exist a \"financial requirement\" of the partnership, that (2) \"cannot ... reasonably be satisfied from partnership capital, additional capital, financing proceeds, revenues and other partnership moneys,\" (3) \"the parties [have] use[d] their best efforts to obtain reasonable non-recourse institutional financing ... of the required amounts\" but have been unable to \"obtain such financing,\" and (4) a partner has \"elect[ed] ... in its sole discretion\" to loan the partnership the \"necessary funds.\"   In November 1991, some six months after satisfying the Dimeo settlement, BCA sent a letter to FHS, asserting that its settlement payment constituted a \"Deficit Loan,\" accruing interest at 18%.  FHS responded that no such Deficit Loan had been made, and that BCA was not entitled to indemnification for any part of the $5.6 million payment.  FHS then filed the instant action seeking a declaration that neither Partnership 1 nor Partnership 2 owed any sum to BCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties tried the case to a jury over twelve days beginning October 14, 1997.  Although denominated defendants, appellants assumed the burden of proof and proceeded through trial effectively as plaintiffs.  Upon the close of appellants' evidence, FHS moved for judgment as a matter of law on the Deficit Loan issue, contending that the second requirement of Section 5.2 had not been met because \"[t]here can be no question before the jury that the partnership[s] had money with which to pay this obligation.\"   The court reserved ruling on the motion and submitted the question to the jury.  The district court also instructed the jury on damages, advising that damages should reflect the $5.6 million settlement payment made by BCA, less the value of any benefits obtained by it, including the limited partnership interests in Phase 1 obtained in the settlement and the value, if any, of the release from the lawsuit.  Appellants did not object to this instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberation, the jury answered special interrogatories establishing that appellants had proved each of the four conjunctive elements for a \"Deficit Loan;\" and alternatively, that appellants were entitled to be indemnified by the partnerships for the settlement payment.  Following the return of the special verdict, the court gave a number of additional instructions on damages.  In the end, the jury returned a verdict establishing appellants' damages at $2.1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the jury's verdict, FHS renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and appellants filed a motion for a new trial on damages.  The court, on May 13, 1998, entered final judgment, ruling that a Deficit Loan did not exist under the partnership agreements as a matter of law and that appellants were only entitled to indemnification.  According to the court, \"the facts established at trial show that the Dimeo suit could reasonably have been paid from partnership funds.\"   Additionally, the court denied appellants' motion for a new trial.  In the end, the court entered judgment awarding appellants indemnification payments in the amount of $2.1 million accruing interest at 6% per annum.  By contrast, as a Deficit Loan, the amount the partnerships owed appellants would have accrued interest at 18% per annum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants appeal both the judgment as a matter of law and the denial of their motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's granting of judgment as a matter of law de novo.  See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir.1995).  \"A judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if the evidence, viewed from the perspective most favorable to the nonmovant, is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Gibson, 37 F.3d at 735.   In considering the evidence, we, like the district court, \"cannot evaluate the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of evidence.\"  Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, appellants contended that the partnerships' admittedly plentiful funds were not reasonably available to pay the Dimeo settlement because of restrictions imposed by the loan agreements.  Appellants also argued that FHS's refusal to permit BCA to use partnership funds further hindered these funds from being reasonably available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, however, rejected these theories as a matter of law because it regarded as undisputed two facts:  (1) Bank of Boston had permitted Partnership 1 to distribute up to $15 million to the partners and this money could have been used to fund the settlement;  and (2) Chiofaro's and Oatis's testimony that before FHS's objection on April 18, 1991, they intended to pay the settlement from partnership funds without obtaining bank approval demonstrated that loan restrictions did not hinder the use of funds.  The court additionally found that FHS's refusal to permit the use of partnership funds was irrelevant because BCA, as managing general partner, had the authority to settle the lawsuit with partnership funds regardless of FHS's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing the record in the light most favorable to appellants, we disagree with the district court's assessment of the evidence as undisputed.  In our view, the jury verdict was adequately supported by appellants' evidence that partnership funds were not reasonably available because of loan restrictions and FHS's lack of cooperation.  The partnerships' loan documents provided that all of the partnerships' assets served as collateral for the construction loan.  Specifically, section 14(c) of the Construction Loan Agreement and the related Pledge and Escrow Agreement of Cash Account stated that Bank of Boston had a security interest in all of the partnerships' assets and that neither partnership could apply funds for any purpose without bank consent.  Witness testimony further supported this documentary evidence:  Chiofaro and Oatis testified that funds could not be used to pay the settlement without bank permission, which was not forthcoming;  and Coleman Benedict, an FHS representative, testified that the partnerships did not have enough free cash to fund the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Bank of Boston authorized the disbursement of $15 million to the partners, but appellants introduced evidence that these funds were not reasonably available to pay the Dimeo settlement.  Fifteen million dollars had been earmarked for distribution on three dates:  $8 million on June 5, 1990, $3 million six months thereafter, and $4 million six months thereafter.  According to loan documents and Oatis's testimony, these earmarked funds could not be distributed without bank approval on each disbursement date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, according to Oatis, the earmarked funds were not sufficient on April 19, 1991 to pay the $5.6 million settlement.  Eight million dollars had already been distributed to the partners as of the first release date and therefore were no longer part of the partnership assets.  The next $3 million were not distributed on the scheduled second disbursement date because that amount had been used to fund fifty percent of the Phase 2 construction expenses during the pendency of the Forbearance Agreement.  Finally, the last $4 million were earmarked for distribution in May 1991, after the settlement payment was due.  While BCA theoretically could have used the $4 million in anticipation of the forthcoming release date, the jury could have found that FHS's threats, as well as uncertainty regarding the bank's required consent, rendered the funds not reasonably available on April 19, 1991.  In all events, simple arithmetic proves that $4 million is not $5.6 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with the district court's decision that Chiofaro's and Oatis's testimony that they had initially intended to pay the settlement from partnership funds without obtaining bank approval is conclusive evidence that bank restrictions did not encumber partnership funds.  While such testimony tends to prove that partnership funds were reasonably available, it is not conclusive evidence on this point.  The jury could have credited Oatis's testimony that he did not intend to obtain bank permission before April 19 because it was not until that date that he realized the distribution of funds necessary for payment could not occur without FHS's cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony introduced at trial therefore sufficiently supported the jury's finding that funds were not reasonably available to settle the Dimeo suit on April 19, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Under these circumstances, the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the conditions for a Deficit Loan had not been met.  Thus, we reverse the court's judgment as a matter of law, reinstate the jury's finding that the conditions for a Deficit Loan were met, and remand so that judgment may be entered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also challenge the district court's refusal to grant a new trial on damages, contending that the court's instructions to the jury on damages were erroneous and alternatively, that the jury's valuation of their damages at only $2.1 million is not supported by the evidence.  We review the court's denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.  See Air Safety v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, 94 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to appellants, the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could deduct the value of the limited partners' release from its base damages when there was no evidence of the value of the release in the record.  See Kelliher v. General Transp. Serv., Inc., 29 F.3d 750, 754 (1st Cir.1994) (jury instruction may not be given if there is insufficient evidence to support it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, however, did not preserve this argument for appeal.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 states, in relevant part, that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellants contend that they objected to the jury instruction and further submission of the issue, we have been unable to discern any such objection.  Rather, our reading of the record indicates that appellants failed to object when the court, at the close of the evidence, instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>In calculating damages, I instruct you that the base figure on which your calculation is made is the 5.6 million paid to settle the suit.  From that amount, you should deduct the value, if any, of the assets which you find that Chiofaro purchased from [the limited partners] in settlement of the suit, that is, what you find to be the value, again, if any, of the 22 1/2 percent interest in the BCA[-1] partnership, as well as the value of the release given Chiofaro by [the limited partners].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also failed to object when the jury, after a period of deliberation, requested by note that the court \"supply parameters 'for the value of the release.' \"   Appellants' assertion that during a resulting lobby conference, they \"stated that there existed no testimony in the record as to the value of the release [and] objected to additional instruction concerning the value of the release and to further submission of the issue to the jury\" misstates the record.  During the lobby conference, the court asked the parties whether there was testimony on the value of the releases.  Counsel for appellants responded:  \"The only testimony, I believe, was opinion testimony on the value of the interest.  So subtraction works, but I think that's unfair.\"   Counsel did not, however, object to the court's instructing the jury to subtract the value of the release from the $5.6 million base figure.  Rather, the only so-called objection noted by counsel at that time was \"[y]ou've got to repeat your [earlier] instruction and say the evidence is the evidence.\"   These comments, together, fall short of Rule 51's requirement that the objection \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"Absent a timely objection, an erroneous jury instruction warrants a new trial only where the assigned error \" 'caused a miscarriage of justice or ... undermined the integrity of the judicial process.' \"  Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 940 (1st Cir.1995)).  We see no miscarriage of justice here and therefore hold that appellants have waived their objection to the jury instruction.  See, e.g., Play Time, 123 F.3d at 30, n. 8 (no miscarriage of justice where the issue \"implicates only the question of damages for breach of a private agreement between the litigants;\" and no damage to integrity of the judicial process where \"the proceedings below were conducted with meticulous attention to the rights of both parties\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also make the argument that even if the value of the release played no role in the jury's reduction of its recovery--so that the $3.5 million reduction represents the value of limited partnership interests only--they are still entitled to a new trial on damages because the jury's valuation is not supported by the record.  In challenging the jury's damage award, appellants face a daunting task.  Our review \"is limited to examining whether evidence in the record supports the verdict.  If the jury award has a rational basis in evidence, we must affirm it.\"  Air Safety, 94 F.3d at 4 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \"While 'the jury may not render a verdict based on speculation or guesswork,' a reviewing court will not tinker with the jury's assessment of money damages as long as it does not fall outside the broad universe of theoretically possible awards that can be said to be supported by the evidence.\"  Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1249 (1st Cir.1994) (citation omitted).  In the end, \"[w]e will not disturb an award of damages for economic loss provided it does not violate the conscience of the court or strike such a dissonant chord that justice would be denied were the judgment permitted to stand.\"  Vera-Lozano v. Int'l Broadcasting, 50 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir.1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the jury's valuation of the limited partnership interests falls within the broad universe of awards supported by the evidence.  Together, the limited partners had a 22.5% interest in BCA-1, which in turn had a 40nterest in Phase 1. Thus, the limited partners had a 9% interest in Phase 1. Oatis testified during trial that, in 1989, he prepared for FHS a valuation of Phase 1 for $150 to $200 million.  Using the 9% figure, the limited partnership interests in this amount would have been $13 to $18 million.  Francis McCarthy, former comptroller of Chiofaro Company, one of Chiofaro's interests, testified that, some time after August 1990, Chiofaro asked him to calculate certain tax consequences of acquiring one of the limited partner's interest at purchase prices ranging from $1.96 to $4 million.  The jury could have determined that this testimony reflected a proper valuation of one of the limited partner's interest.  Appellants themselves introduced into evidence a letter from Richard Renehan, lead trial counsel for defendants in Dimeo, to Earl Cooley, counsel for plaintiffs, stating that defendants were \"prepared to buy your clients out for cash at the fair market value of their interests\" and offering $1.6 million.  Kevin Currier, the Chief Financial Officer of Dimeo Construction Company (\"Dimeo\"), a limited partner with a 20% interest in BCA-1, testified that, based on this letter, he valued the sale of Dimeo's interest at $1.5 million on Dimeo's 1991 tax return (and the IRS challenged this valuation as insufficient).  Finally, Coleman Benedict testified that during settlement negotiations he discussed with Chiofaro the limited partners' interest at values ranging from zero to $15 million, depending on \"assumptions you used about the condition of the market in the future.\"   Based on the sum of this evidence, the jury could have reasonably valued the limited partnership interests in BCA-1 at $3.5 million.  We will not second-guess its decision to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court in part and reverse in part, and remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

We reject FHS's argument.  In denying FHS's motion for summary judgment, the district court correctly ruled that under the terms of the Partnership Agreements, these two provisions were not conditions for the creation of a Deficit Loan.

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, two partners dispute whether a 1991 settlement payment made to third parties by one of the partners should be characterized under the partnership agreements as a \"Deficit Loan\" or as an indemnification obligation.  Insofar as appellants are challenging the judgment entered against them as a matter of law by the district court, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to them.  See Gibson v. City of Cranston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195652\"><a href=\"/opinion/195652/gibson-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 733 (1st Cir.1994).  But insofar as they are challenging the jury's verdict, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See Dichner v. Liberty Travel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197902\"><a href=\"/opinion/197902/dichner-v-liberty-travel/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1998).  Defendants BCA-1 and BCA-2 (together \"BCA\") and plaintiff-appellee FHS Properties Limited Partnership (\"FHS\"), are respectively the managing partners and sole other general partner of two partnerships that developed and now own International Place, a two-tower office complex in downtown Boston.  FHS has a sixty-percent interest in the two partnerships.  BCA has a forty-percent interest.  The partners envisioned developing the complex in two distinct phases and therefore formed Fort Hill Square Associates (\"Partnership 1\") to develop Phase 1 of the project and Fort Hill Square Phase 2 Associates (\"Partnership 2\") to develop Phase 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The partners signed two partnership agreements (\"Partnership Agreements\"), essentially identical in their terms, which provided that the agreements would be construed in accordance with Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phase 1 of the project was initially financed through a construction loan from Bank of Boston.  When construction was complete, the construction loan was \"taken out\" and replaced with permanent financing by Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association (\"TIAA\").  When the partners decided to proceed with Phase 2, Bank of Boston again agreed to finance the construction, subject to a permanent \"take out\" commitment from TIAA.  The second construction loan was secured by all of the partnerships' assets, including a mortgage on Phase 1. Notwithstanding its security interest, Bank of Boston, in May 1990, approved a plan to distribute $15 million of partnership cash to the partners on three future distribution dates, provided that certain conditions were satisfied on those dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The settlement obligation at issue in this case arose in January 1991, when two entities, who were then limited partners of BCA-1 and who shared an interest in Phase 1 but not Phase 2 of the project, sued defendants Partnership 1, BCA-1, FHS, Donald Chiofaro, Theodore Oatis, Bank of Boston, and TIAA, claiming that the general partners of BCA-1 had misused partnership assets by pledging them as security for the construction of Phase 2 (the \"Dimeo \" suit).  The initiation of the suit distressed the partnerships' lenders.  Bank of Boston sought an assurance from TIAA that notwithstanding the pendency of the suit, it would honor its promise to pay off the bank's construction loan and replace it with permanent financing once Phase 2 was complete.  TIAA refused to give such an assurance.  Bank of Boston responded by threatening to cease financing Phase 2 construction and insisted that the partnerships sign a \"Forbearance Agreement,\" which became effective on March 14, 1991.  That agreement stated that it would be an event of default under the construction loan if the Dimeo suit was not settled by April 15, 1991;  and pending the April 15 deadline, the bank would finance only fifty percent of the requisitions made under the loan agreement, forcing the partnerships to cover the balance from other funds, which could potentially include the $15 million earmarked for distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, BCA and FHS jointly worked to resolve the Dimeo suit by the April 15 deadline.  They negotiated on multiple occasions with the Dimeo plaintiffs' lawyers and met with Bank of Boston and TIAA in an effort either to borrow funds with which to settle the suit or to eliminate the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.  On each occasion, the lenders refused to lend the necessary money or to change the terms of the Forbearance Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 12, 1991, the last business day before the bank's deadline, BCA and FHS reached an oral agreement with the Dimeo plaintiffs to settle the suit for $5.6 million.  Payment was due in one week, on April 19.  The partners promptly informed Bank of Boston and TIAA that the case had been resolved.  On April 18, however, FHS informed BCA, by notice to BCA's general partner Chiofaro, that BCA was forbidden from using Partnership 1 or Partnership 2 funds to satisfy the settlement, and threatened to remove BCA as managing general partner should it do so.  FHS added that it would notify Bank of Boston and TIAA of its position.  According to FHS, partnership funds could not be used to pay the settlement because the settlement was solely BCA's obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberating through the evening of April 18, Chiofaro decided on the morning of April 19 to use only BCA funds to pay the settlement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  That day, he paid the Dimeo plaintiffs $5.6 million.  In return, the Dimeo plaintiffs forfeited to BCA their small, indirect equity interests in Phase 1, represented by the limited partnership interests in BCA-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5.2 of the Partnership Agreements permits a partner to lend the partnerships certain amounts as \"Deficit Loans\" if four conditions are met:  (1) there must exist a \"financial requirement\" of the partnership, that (2) \"cannot ... reasonably be satisfied from partnership capital, additional capital, financing proceeds, revenues and other partnership moneys,\" (3) \"the parties [have] use[d] their best efforts to obtain reasonable non-recourse institutional financing ... of the required amounts\" but have been unable to \"obtain such financing,\" and (4) a partner has \"elect[ed] ... in its sole discretion\" to loan the partnership the \"necessary funds.\"   In November 1991, some six months after satisfying the Dimeo settlement, BCA sent a letter to FHS, asserting that its settlement payment constituted a \"Deficit Loan,\" accruing interest at 18%.  FHS responded that no such Deficit Loan had been made, and that BCA was not entitled to indemnification for any part of the $5.6 million payment.  FHS then filed the instant action seeking a declaration that neither Partnership 1 nor Partnership 2 owed any sum to BCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties tried the case to a jury over twelve days beginning October 14, 1997.  Although denominated defendants, appellants assumed the burden of proof and proceeded through trial effectively as plaintiffs.  Upon the close of appellants' evidence, FHS moved for judgment as a matter of law on the Deficit Loan issue, contending that the second requirement of Section 5.2 had not been met because \"[t]here can be no question before the jury that the partnership[s] had money with which to pay this obligation.\"   The court reserved ruling on the motion and submitted the question to the jury.  The district court also instructed the jury on damages, advising that damages should reflect the $5.6 million settlement payment made by BCA, less the value of any benefits obtained by it, including the limited partnership interests in Phase 1 obtained in the settlement and the value, if any, of the release from the lawsuit.  Appellants did not object to this instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberation, the jury answered special interrogatories establishing that appellants had proved each of the four conjunctive elements for a \"Deficit Loan;\" and alternatively, that appellants were entitled to be indemnified by the partnerships for the settlement payment.  Following the return of the special verdict, the court gave a number of additional instructions on damages.  In the end, the jury returned a verdict establishing appellants' damages at $2.1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the jury's verdict, FHS renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and appellants filed a motion for a new trial on damages.  The court, on May 13, 1998, entered final judgment, ruling that a Deficit Loan did not exist under the partnership agreements as a matter of law and that appellants were only entitled to indemnification.  According to the court, \"the facts established at trial show that the Dimeo suit could reasonably have been paid from partnership funds.\"   Additionally, the court denied appellants' motion for a new trial.  In the end, the court entered judgment awarding appellants indemnification payments in the amount of $2.1 million accruing interest at 6% per annum.  By contrast, as a Deficit Loan, the amount the partnerships owed appellants would have accrued interest at 18% per annum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants appeal both the judgment as a matter of law and the denial of their motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's granting of judgment as a matter of law de novo.  See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir.1995).  \"A judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if the evidence, viewed from the perspective most favorable to the nonmovant, is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Gibson, 37 F.3d at 735.   In considering the evidence, we, like the district court, \"cannot evaluate the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of evidence.\"  Criado v. IBM Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197991\"><a href=\"/opinion/197991/criado-v-ibm-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span>, 441 (1st Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, appellants contended that the partnerships' admittedly plentiful funds were not reasonably available to pay the Dimeo settlement because of restrictions imposed by the loan agreements.  Appellants also argued that FHS's refusal to permit BCA to use partnership funds further hindered these funds from being reasonably available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, however, rejected these theories as a matter of law because it regarded as undisputed two facts:  (1) Bank of Boston had permitted Partnership 1 to distribute up to $15 million to the partners and this money could have been used to fund the settlement;  and (2) Chiofaro's and Oatis's testimony that before FHS's objection on April 18, 1991, they intended to pay the settlement from partnership funds without obtaining bank approval demonstrated that loan restrictions did not hinder the use of funds.  The court additionally found that FHS's refusal to permit the use of partnership funds was irrelevant because BCA, as managing general partner, had the authority to settle the lawsuit with partnership funds regardless of FHS's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing the record in the light most favorable to appellants, we disagree with the district court's assessment of the evidence as undisputed.  In our view, the jury verdict was adequately supported by appellants' evidence that partnership funds were not reasonably available because of loan restrictions and FHS's lack of cooperation.  The partnerships' loan documents provided that all of the partnerships' assets served as collateral for the construction loan.  Specifically, section 14(c) of the Construction Loan Agreement and the related Pledge and Escrow Agreement of Cash Account stated that Bank of Boston had a security interest in all of the partnerships' assets and that neither partnership could apply funds for any purpose without bank consent.  Witness testimony further supported this documentary evidence:  Chiofaro and Oatis testified that funds could not be used to pay the settlement without bank permission, which was not forthcoming;  and Coleman Benedict, an FHS representative, testified that the partnerships did not have enough free cash to fund the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Bank of Boston authorized the disbursement of $15 million to the partners, but appellants introduced evidence that these funds were not reasonably available to pay the Dimeo settlement.  Fifteen million dollars had been earmarked for distribution on three dates:  $8 million on June 5, 1990, $3 million six months thereafter, and $4 million six months thereafter.  According to loan documents and Oatis's testimony, these earmarked funds could not be distributed without bank approval on each disbursement date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, according to Oatis, the earmarked funds were not sufficient on April 19, 1991 to pay the $5.6 million settlement.  Eight million dollars had already been distributed to the partners as of the first release date and therefore were no longer part of the partnership assets.  The next $3 million were not distributed on the scheduled second disbursement date because that amount had been used to fund fifty percent of the Phase 2 construction expenses during the pendency of the Forbearance Agreement.  Finally, the last $4 million were earmarked for distribution in May 1991, after the settlement payment was due.  While BCA theoretically could have used the $4 million in anticipation of the forthcoming release date, the jury could have found that FHS's threats, as well as uncertainty regarding the bank's required consent, rendered the funds not reasonably available on April 19, 1991.  In all events, simple arithmetic proves that $4 million is not $5.6 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also disagree with the district court's decision that Chiofaro's and Oatis's testimony that they had initially intended to pay the settlement from partnership funds without obtaining bank approval is conclusive evidence that bank restrictions did not encumber partnership funds.  While such testimony tends to prove that partnership funds were reasonably available, it is not conclusive evidence on this point.  The jury could have credited Oatis's testimony that he did not intend to obtain bank permission before April 19 because it was not until that date that he realized the distribution of funds necessary for payment could not occur without FHS's cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony introduced at trial therefore sufficiently supported the jury's finding that funds were not reasonably available to settle the Dimeo suit on April 19, 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Under these circumstances, the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the conditions for a Deficit Loan had not been met.  Thus, we reverse the court's judgment as a matter of law, reinstate the jury's finding that the conditions for a Deficit Loan were met, and remand so that judgment may be entered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also challenge the district court's refusal to grant a new trial on damages, contending that the court's instructions to the jury on damages were erroneous and alternatively, that the jury's valuation of their damages at only $2.1 million is not supported by the evidence.  We review the court's denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.  See Air Safety v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196931\"><a href=\"/opinion/196931/air-safety-inc-v-archbishop-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to appellants, the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could deduct the value of the limited partners' release from its base damages when there was no evidence of the value of the release in the record.  See Kelliher v. General Transp. Serv., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195506\"><a href=\"/opinion/195506/kelliher-v-gts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 754 (1st Cir.1994) (jury instruction may not be given if there is insufficient evidence to support it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, however, did not preserve this argument for appeal.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 states, in relevant part, that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellants contend that they objected to the jury instruction and further submission of the issue, we have been unable to discern any such objection.  Rather, our reading of the record indicates that appellants failed to object when the court, at the close of the evidence, instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>In calculating damages, I instruct you that the base figure on which your calculation is made is the 5.6 million paid to settle the suit.  From that amount, you should deduct the value, if any, of the assets which you find that Chiofaro purchased from [the limited partners] in settlement of the suit, that is, what you find to be the value, again, if any, of the 22 1/2 percent interest in the BCA[-1] partnership, as well as the value of the release given Chiofaro by [the limited partners].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also failed to object when the jury, after a period of deliberation, requested by note that the court \"supply parameters 'for the value of the release.' \"   Appellants' assertion that during a resulting lobby conference, they \"stated that there existed no testimony in the record as to the value of the release [and] objected to additional instruction concerning the value of the release and to further submission of the issue to the jury\" misstates the record.  During the lobby conference, the court asked the parties whether there was testimony on the value of the releases.  Counsel for appellants responded:  \"The only testimony, I believe, was opinion testimony on the value of the interest.  So subtraction works, but I think that's unfair.\"   Counsel did not, however, object to the court's instructing the jury to subtract the value of the release from the $5.6 million base figure.  Rather, the only so-called objection noted by counsel at that time was \"[y]ou've got to repeat your [earlier] instruction and say the evidence is the evidence.\"   These comments, together, fall short of Rule 51's requirement that the objection \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"Absent a timely objection, an erroneous jury instruction warrants a new trial only where the assigned error \" 'caused a miscarriage of justice or ... undermined the integrity of the judicial process.' \"  Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197505\"><a href=\"/opinion/197505/play-time-inc-v-ldds-metromedia/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196064\"><a href=\"/opinion/196064/scarfo-v-cabletron-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span>, 940 (1st Cir.1995)).  We see no miscarriage of justice here and therefore hold that appellants have waived their objection to the jury instruction.  See, e.g., Play Time, 123 F.3d at 30, n. 8 (no miscarriage of justice where the issue \"implicates only the question of damages for breach of a private agreement between the litigants;\" and no damage to integrity of the judicial process where \"the proceedings below were conducted with meticulous attention to the rights of both parties\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also make the argument that even if the value of the release played no role in the jury's reduction of its recovery--so that the $3.5 million reduction represents the value of limited partnership interests only--they are still entitled to a new trial on damages because the jury's valuation is not supported by the record.  In challenging the jury's damage award, appellants face a daunting task.  Our review \"is limited to examining whether evidence in the record supports the verdict.  If the jury award has a rational basis in evidence, we must affirm it.\"  Air Safety, 94 F.3d at 4 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \"While 'the jury may not render a verdict based on speculation or guesswork,' a reviewing court will not tinker with the jury's assessment of money damages as long as it does not fall outside the broad universe of theoretically possible awards that can be said to be supported by the evidence.\"  Dopp v.

Together, the limited partners had a 22.5% interest in BCA-1, which in turn had a 40nterest in Phase 1. Thus, the limited partners had a 9% interest in Phase 1. Oatis testified during trial that, in 1989, he prepared for FHS a valuation of Phase 1 for $150 to $200 million.  Using the 9% figure, the limited partnership interests in this amount would have been $13 to $18 million.  Francis McCarthy, former comptroller of Chiofaro Company, one of Chiofaro's interests, testified that, some time after August 1990, Chiofaro asked him to calculate certain tax consequences of acquiring one of the limited partner's interest at purchase prices ranging from $1.96 to $4 million.  The jury could have determined that this testimony reflected a proper valuation of one of the limited partner's interest.  Appellants themselves introduced into evidence a letter from Richard Renehan, lead trial counsel for defendants in Dimeo, to Earl Cooley, counsel for plaintiffs, stating that defendants were \"prepared to buy your clients out for cash at the fair market value of their interests\" and offering $1.6 million.  Kevin Currier, the Chief Financial Officer of Dimeo Construction Company (\"Dimeo\"), a limited partner with a 20% interest in BCA-1, testified that, based on this letter, he valued the sale of Dimeo's interest at $1.5 million on Dimeo's 1991 tax return (and the IRS challenged this valuation as insufficient).  Finally, Coleman Benedict testified that during settlement negotiations he discussed with Chiofaro the limited partners' interest at values ranging from zero to $15 million, depending on \"assumptions you used about the condition of the market in the future.\"   Based on the sum of this evidence, the jury could have reasonably valued the limited partnership interests in BCA-1 at $3.5 million.  We will not second-guess its decision to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

We will refer to them collectively as \"appellants\" unless it is necessary to distinguish among them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> BCA-1 and FHS are the general partners of Partnership 1;  BCA-2 and FHS are the general partners of Partnership 2</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Chiofaro actually used his and Oatis's personal funds to pay the settlement.  All parties, however, appear to consider the payment to have been made by BCA for purposes of the Deficit Loan issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although appellants contend that they objected to the submission of the \"release\" valuation to the jury, we can find no such objection in the record.  See infra at Part III(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> A further difference between a Deficit Loan and indemnification obligation is that a Deficit Loan shall be secured by mortgages on Phase 1 and Phase 2 to the extent permitted by other financing obligations.  Moreover, there can be no distributions to any partner while a Deficit Loan remains outstanding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> FHS contends that bank authorization was not required for the distributions.  The loan documents, however, indicate to the contrary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> FHS contends that there are two additional reasons that a Deficit Loan did not exist as a matter of law:  (1) Section 5.2 of the Partnership Agreements states that any Deficit Loan \"shall be evidenced by notes of the Partnership\" and no such note exists;  and (2) Section 5.2 provides that \"[w]hile any Deficit Loans remain outstanding, there shall be no distributions of any nature ... to any partner,\" and BCA violated this provision by distributing funds to the partners on April 22, 1991.  We reject FHS's argument.  In denying FHS's motion for summary judgment, the district court correctly ruled that under the terms of the Partnership Agreements, these two provisions were not conditions for the creation of a Deficit Loan.
