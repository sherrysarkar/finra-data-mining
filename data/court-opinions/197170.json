Le\r                                                                         \r\n\nBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 841 (1st Cir. 1993),\r                                       \r\n\ncert. denied, 511 U.S. 1018 (1994).\r                        \r\n\n     Late on the evening  of August 6, 1989,  officers Alfred\r\n\nDonovan and Robert Budryk  arrived at the home of  Joanne and\r\n\nJames Joyce  (\"the Joyces\")  in Tewksbury, seeking  to arrest\r\n\nthe  Joyces' son, Lance Joyce.   Although Lance  did not live\r\n\nwith his parents, the  police had received a call  earlier in\r\n\nthe evening from Lance's ex-girlfriend informing them that he\r\n\nwas  there.   Allegedly, an  outstanding warrant  existed for\r\n\nLance's  arrest  on  a  charge of  violating  a  chapter 209A\r\n\ndomestic restraining order.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A,   7.\r\n\n     Lance answered  the officers' knock at  the Joyces' side\r\n\ndoor,  opening the interior door but keeping the outer screen\r\n\ndoor closed.  Officer Budryk told Lance that the officers had\r\n\na  warrant for  his arrest,  and asked  him to  step outside.\r\n\nInstead,  Lance retorted  \"ya  right\" and  withdrew from  the\r\n\ndoorway, calling for his  mother.   The police  followed him.\r\n\nJoanne Joyce, who  had been asleep,  then came downstairs  to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nfind her son and  the police officers standing in  her dining\r\n\nroom.  Her husband entered the room a few minutes later.\r\n\n     The  Joyces asked  the officers  what was  going on  and\r\n\nwhether they had a warrant; the officers explained that  they\r\n\nwere there to  arrest Lance and that a warrant for his arrest\r\n\nexisted,  although they  did not  have it  with them.   James\r\n\nJoyce left the  room with  a third officer  (who had  arrived\r\n\nseparately) to call  the police  department, which  confirmed\r\n\nDonovan   and  Budryk's  understanding   that  there  was  an\r\n\noutstanding warrant for Lance's arrest.\r\n\n     While her husband was gone, a scuffle ensued between the\r\n\npolice officers and  Joanne Joyce.  Joanne  Joyce admits that\r\n\nshe protested  Lance's immediate arrest, although  she denies\r\n\npushing  the  police officers  away.    One of  the  officers\r\n\ngrasped  Joanne  Joyce's  upper  arms and  moved  her  aside,\r\n\nallowing them to handcuff Lance and secure his arrest; Joanne\r\n\nJoyce  claims that one of the officers threatened to kill her\r\n\nunless she got out of the way.  Joanne Joyce was charged with\r\n\nassault and battery but acquitted in a state court jury trial\r\n\nin February 1990.\r\n\n     In April 1990, the Joyces brought suit alleging that the\r\n\nofficers,  the chief of police  and the town  had violated 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983  and the Massachusetts Civil  Rights Act, Mass.\r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 12,   11I.   The section 1983 claims were based\r\n\nupon  alleged  violations   of  the  Fourth   and  Fourteenth\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nAmendments  during  the  officers'  entry  without  a  search\r\n\nwarrant  into the  Joyce home  and  claimed use  of excessive\r\n\nforce in arresting Lance Joyce.  The Joyces also claimed that\r\n\nthe officers had  committed assault and  battery, intentional\r\n\ninfliction  of emotional distress  and malicious prosecution,\r\n\nand that the town had negligently trained and  supervised the\r\n\nofficers in  violation of the Massachusetts  Tort Claims Act,\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 258.\r\n\n     The defendants  moved for summary judgment  on the issue\r\n\nof  illegal entry.  Citing United States v. Santana, 427 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n38 (1976), they  said that  the police had  not violated  the\r\n\nFourth  Amendment  because they  entered  the  Joyce home  in\r\n\npursuit  of  Lance Joyce  whom they  were  in the  process of\r\n\nlawfully arresting.   The district court  granted defendants'\r\n\nmotion  by  margin  order,  explaining that  \"[t]here  is  no\r\n\nevidence in the  record to  support [that] the  entry was  in\r\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\"\r\n\n     A jury trial followed.   The record indicates that  only\r\n\nthree  of  the remaining  claims were  presented at  trial: a\r\n\nsection 1983  claim alleging  that the officers  had violated\r\n\nthe Fourth Amendment by using excessive force to arrest Lance\r\n\nJoyce,  causing  his mother  injury; a  malicious prosecution\r\n\nclaim; and  a Massachusetts Civil  Rights Act claim  based on\r\n\nthe alleged threat by the officers to Joanne Joyce during the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\naltercation.  The jury returned a  verdict for the defendants\r\n\non all counts.  \r\n\n     Joanne  Joyce then  appealed on  her own  behalf and  as\r\n\nexecutrix of  the estate of James Joyce.   She asked not only\r\n\nfor reversal  of the  summary judgment  grant on  the illegal\r\n\nentry claim but  also for a  new trial  on the other  claims,\r\n\narguing  that  the trial  of  the latter  claims  was tainted\r\n\nbecause the jury was not  allowed to consider unlawful  entry\r\n\nas one  of the circumstances incident to the excessive force,\r\n\nmalicious prosecution and MCRA claims.  A panel of this court\r\n\naffirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment.\r\n\n     Joanne  Joyce  then  petitioned for  rehearing  en banc,\r                                                                        \r\n\nsupported  by the  American Civil  Liberties Union  as amicus\r                                                                         \r\n\ncuriae.  Both urge that the officers' entry, without a search\r                  \r\n\nwarrant,  violated  the  Fourth Amendment;  they  distinguish\r\n\nSantana  on the ground that the suspect there was standing in\r                   \r\n\npublic space (just outside her house) when the police engaged\r\n\nher,  while   Lance  Joyce  was  inside   his  parents'  home\r\n\nthroughout.   Joyce also argues that  the underlying offense,\r\n\nviolation of  a  restraining order,  is  not a  felony  under\r\n\nMassachusetts law.\r\n\n     In considering  the petition  for rehearing en  banc, we\r                                                                     \r\n\nconcluded  that  the  claim  against the  officers  might  be\r\n\nforeclosed by qualified immunity.  Accordingly, we  requested\r\n\nsupplemental  memoranda.  Having considered the memoranda, we\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nhave decided to grant  rehearing en banc, withdraw  the panel\r                                                    \r\n\nopinion, and substitute  this opinion as the en  banc court's\r                                                                 \r\n\nresolution of  the appeal.  Because  qualified immunity turns\r\n\nprimarily on an appraisal of existing case law, oral argument\r\n\nhas been deemed unnecessary.\r\n\n     When the police enter  the home of the person  they wish\r\n\nto arrest, the arrest warrant suffices for entry if \"there is\r\n\nreason  to believe  the suspect  is within.\"   Payton  v. New\r                                                                         \r\n\nYork, 445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980).   But even when armed with an\r                \r\n\narrest warrant,  police must generally have  a search warrant\r\n\nto  enter lawfully a third person's home.  Steagald v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates,  451  U.S. 204,  212-13  (1981).   However,  a  third\r                  \r\n\nperson's  house  may be  lawfully  entered  without a  search\r\n\nwarrant if exigent circumstances exist, Steagald, 451 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n213-14,  and  exigent  circumstances include  \"hot  pursuit.\"\r\n\nSantana, 427 U.S.  at 42-43; Hegarty  v. Somerset County,  53\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d  1367, 1374  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  116 S.  Ct. 675\r                                                       \r\n\n(1995).  \r\n\n     Here, the  defendants claim that Santana justified their\r                                                         \r\n\nentrance into the Joyce home because they were in hot pursuit\r\n\nof  Lance  Joyce.   Joanne Joyce  and  the ACLU  respond that\r\n\npolice first  engaged Santana when she was  outside her home,\r                                                               \r\n\nstanding directly  on her threshold.   Ultimately, they argue\r\n\nthat  to uphold  the entry  in this  case creates  a slippery\r\n\nslope, allowing the  police to enter without a search warrant\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nif the police merely suspect that the person sought is inside\r\n\nthe house.\r\n\n     The governing  case law under the  Fourth Amendment does\r\n\nnot  yield  very  many  bright  line  rules.    This  is  not\r\n\nsurprising   since  the   ultimate  touchstone   is   one  of\r\n\nreasonableness:  the hot pursuit is only one of several well-\r\n\nestablished examples of \"exigent  circumstances\" that make it\r\n\nreasonable for the police to enter without obtaining a search\r\n\nwarrant.   See Minnesota v.  Olsen, 495 U.S.  91, 100 (1990);\r                                              \r\n\nHegarty, 43 F.3d at  1374.  Conversely, we are  not impressed\r                   \r\n\nby the slippery slope argument:  entry where an arrest is not\r\n\nalready in progress,  or where the offense  is truly trivial,\r\n\nwould present quite a different case.\r\n\n     But  even  within  this  reasonableness  framework,  the\r\n\npresent  case  is not  entirely  straightforward.   Santana's\r                                                                       \r\n\nexception  likely does not turn  on whether the individual is\r\n\nstanding immediately outside or immediately inside the  house\r\n\nwhen  the police  first confront  him and attempt  an arrest.\r\n\nAnd,  the fact  that  Massachusetts  classifies  the  alleged\r\n\nviolation  here  as a  misdemeanor does  not  reduce it  to a\r\n\n\"minor offense,\"  see Welsh v.  Wisconsin, 466 U.S.  740, 753\r                                                     \r\n\n(1984); we  agree with the panel that  \"domestic violence and\r\n\nviolations  of protective  orders  are among  the more  grave\r\n\noffenses affecting our society.\"\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     On  the other hand, we have no information as to whether\r\n\nLance  Joyce's conduct that gave rise to the protective order\r\n\ninvolved actual  violence, although  the police may  have had\r\n\nsome basis  for concern apart from the  protective order.1 We\r\n\nhave  ourselves suggested  that certain  \"mitigating factors\"\r\n\nmay undermine  an exigency showing, including  any inadequacy\r\n\nin the opportunity afforded for a peaceable surrender and the\r\n\nfact that entry  occurs at  nighttime.  Hegarty,  43 F.3d  at\r                                                           \r\n\n1374.  So, there are arguments to be made on both sides.  \r\n\n     The Supreme Court cases,  with Steagald at one  pole and\r                                                        \r\n\nSantana at  the other,  do not definitively  resolve our  own\r                   \r\n\ncase.  Even a quick review of lower court  cases reveals that\r\n\nthere  is no  settled answer as  to the  constitutionality of\r\n\ndoorway arrests.  See State v. Morse, 480 A.2d 183, 186 (N.H.\r                                                \r\n\n1984)  (collecting cases); 3 W.

Circuit court precedent is also\r\n\ndivided,  with some decisions  helpful to the  police in this\r\n\ncase and others less so.2  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The police officers' testimony at  trial indicated that\r\nLance  had   a  drinking   problem  (information  which   was\r\ncorroborated by  Mrs. Joyce's testimony), had  been placed in\r\nprotective  custody ten or eleven  times and arrested once or\r\ntwice by the  Tewksbury police, had resisted  arrest or tried\r\nto  escape on prior  occasions, and that  officer Donovan had\r\nbeen involved in a few of the earlier incidents.\r\n\n     2Compare, e.g., United States  v.

One would think\r                    \r\n\nthat a Fourth Amendment right cannot possibly be deemed  \"clearly\r\n\nestablished\"  from the  point  of view  of  the defendant  police\r\n\nofficers when  a total of  seven judges,  including the  district\r\n\ncourt, the appellate panel, and finally the en banc First Circuit\r\n\ncourt,  are themselves in disagreement as to the precise scope of\r\n\nthat right.  \r\n\n          I write  separately, however, only because  I believe\r\n\nthat my  dissenting  brothers,  in  their  efforts  to  show  how\r\n\nSteagald v.

See U.S. Const. Amend.

Our strong and  deep-seated\r\n\nintuitions regarding  the sanctity  of the home  obviously inform\r\n\nthe determination of  what kinds  of searches are,  and are  not,\r\n\nreasonable.    We  follow  the  Supreme  Court's  lead  in  these\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\ndifficult determinations, but where the unique facts of a case do\r\n\nnot fall squarely under any one Supreme Court precedent, as here,\r\n\nwe cannot help but consider the reasonableness of  the particular\r\n\nsearch at issue.\r\n\n          We  know from Santana  that it  may be  reasonable to\r                                           \r\n\nfollow  a  fleeing  suspect  from  the  threshold  of  a  private\r\n\nresidence into that residence, without a  search warrant, for the\r\n\npurpose of effectuating an arrest.

We  also  know  from  Steagald  that  it  is\r                                                             \r\n\ncertainly  not  reasonable  to   simply  enter  a  third  party's\r                        \r\n\nresidence  without a search  warrant, in  the absence  of exigent\r\n\ncircumstances,  in  the  belief that  the  subject  of  an arrest\r\n\nwarrant is  inside.   One may  seek to  subsume the  present case\r\n\nunder  either  Santana  or Steagald    --  but  either way,  this\r                                             \r\n\nrequires that we draw some conclusions regarding their scope.  In\r\n\ndrawing  the  outlines of  the  \"exigent  circumstances\" or  \"hot\r\n\npursuit\"  exception,   I  find   myself   naturally  turning   to\r\n\nreasonableness.\r\n\n          The  precise   question,  then,  is  whether   it  is\r\n\nreasonable for  police  officers, who  are  acting on  an  arrest\r\n\nwarrant arising  from the commission  of a jailable  offense, who\r\n\nare standing a  few feet  away from, and  face-to-face with,  the\r\n\nsubject of that  arrest warrant (separated only by  a transparent\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nouter  screen door), who have  informed the same  subject that he\r\n\nmust  step outside because he is under  arrest, and who then find\r\n\nthat  the arrestee  refuses  to cooperate  and retreats  into the\r\n\nresidence, to follow  that arrestee  into the house  in order  to\r\n\neffectuate the arrest.   (And add to this the  fact that although\r\n\nthe residence  belonged technically to a third party, a suspect's\r\n\nparents' residence is often looked upon  as approximating his own\r\n\nresidence.)    Because  I  believe,  on  these  facts,  that  the\r\n\nofficers' entry and  arrest was reasonable, I  conclude that this\r\n\ncase  falls  under  the  \"hot  pursuit\"  rationale  discussed  in\r\n\nSantana.  Let us not lose sight  of reasonableness in our efforts\r                 \r\n\nto  follow   precedents  that  are,  on   occasion,  not  clearly\r\n\ndeterminative.\r\n\n          This  said, it  may be  that this  particular damages\r\n\nsuit, with its spotty record, is not the best context in which to\r\n\ndefine those \"exigent circumstance\" parameters on  the merits.  I\r\n\nam confident, moreover, that  these defendants are fully entitled\r\n\nto qualified  immunity.  After all,  this is not a  case in which\r                                                          \r\n\nthe police  entered an unrelated third-party's home  in search of\r\n\nan  arrestee  without any  process at  all  -- such  action would\r\n\nclearly  violate Steagald -- although some  members of this court\r                                   \r\n\nmay  question  whether the  process  that was  followed  here was\r\n\nenough to satisfy the Fourth Amendment.\r\n\n             Concurrence follows.\r                                            \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n          LYNCH,  Circuit  Judge (concurring).

That\r\n\nthe judges  of this court so strongly  disagree about whether\r\n\nthere  was a Fourth Amendment violation means that the law in\r\n\nthis  area is  not  so clearly  established  as to  make  the\r\n\nofficers'   actions  objectively unreasonable.

The\r\n\nen banc court, seeking cover under the doctrine of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity (a doctrine  which, as I understand  it, was neither\r\n\nbriefed  nor argued  to the  panel), effectively  condones an\r\n\nunconstitutional encroachment  on the  sanctity of  the home.\r\n\nAlthough  I applaud the  withdrawal of  the panel  opinion, I\r\n\ncannot in good  conscience join  the opinion of  the en  banc\r\n\ncourt; that  opinion admittedly  edges closer to  the holding\r\n\ndemanded  by  clearly established  law,  but  stops short  of\r\n\nadhering  to  it  and, thus,  perpetuates  a constitutionally\r\n\nintolerable result.  Respectfully and regretfully, I dissent.\r\n\n          As  the  en  banc  court  faithfully  relates,  the\r\n\ndoctrine of qualified  immunity protects  state actors  whose\r\n\nactions are reasonable, if  mistaken.  But qualified immunity\r\n\ndoes   not   shield   violations   of   clearly   established\r\n\nconstitutional principles merely because the specific factual\r\n\nsituation in which a violation arises has novel features.

See  Payton v. New\r                                                                         \r\n\nYork, 445 U.S. 573,  576 (1980).  Of course,  once the police\r                \r\n\nprocure  a valid arrest warrant, they may enter the suspect's\r\n\nhome  for the limited purpose  of effecting the  arrest.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid. at 603.  But even then, the police may not enter a  third\r                                                                         \r\n\nperson's  home   without  consent,   a  search   warrant  (in\r                          \r\n\ncontradistinction   to  an   arrest   warrant),  or   exigent\r\n\ncircumstances.  See  Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204,\r                                                          \r\n\n205-06, 212-15 (1981).\r\n\n          In  this case  the police transgressed  the clearly\r\n\nestablished  rule  laid  down by  the  Steagald  Court.   The\r                                                           \r\n\nplaintiff,  Joanne Joyce, was not herself a suspect.  Yet the\r\n\ndefendant  officers entered  her  home  without her  consent,\r\n\nwithout a search warrant,  and in the absence of  any exigent\r\n\ncircumstances.   To  be sure,  the defendants  had an  arrest\r\n\nwarrant for  the plaintiff's son,  Lance Joyce,  but that  is\r\n\nscantconsolation becauseLance didnot livein hismother's home.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\n          In  stitching together a qualified immunity defense\r\n\nfrom  this  poor-quality  cloth,  the en  banc  court  relies\r\n\nheavily    indeed, almost exclusively    on United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSantana, 427 U.S. 38 (1976).  The court's reliance strikes me\r                   \r\n\nas misplaced.  Santana is an \"exigent circumstances\" case; it\r                                  \r\n\nstands only for the proposition that when the police confront\r\n\na suspect whom they have probable cause to arrest in a public\r                                                                         \r\n\nplace, and the suspect subsequently flees into  her own home,\r                 \r\n\nthey may  pursue and  arrest her.   See id.  at 42-43.   That\r                                                       \r\n\nproposition has no application here for  two reasons (each of\r\n\nwhich is independently sufficient to defenestrate the en banc\r\n\ncourt's reasoning).\r\n\n          First,  under Steagald,  warrantless non-consensual\r                                            \r\n\nsearches of a third person's home are only excused by exigent\r\n\ncircumstances.  451 U.S. at 205-06.  Santana involved exigent\r                                                        \r\n\ncircumstances:  the hot  pursuit of a fleeing suspect  from a\r\n\npublic place into a private one.  427 U.S. at 42-43.  In this\r\n\ncase,  by contrast, there is  simply no evidence  of any need\r\n\nfor  pursuit   hot, cold,  or lukewarm.   Certainly, the mere\r\n\nfact  that Lance Joyce, prompted by police action, moved from\r\n\none part of his  mother's home to another did  not create any\r\n\ncognizable exigency.   See United States  v. Curzi, 867  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n36, 40-43,  43 n.6  (1st Cir.  1989) (explaining  that police\r\n\nofficers  cannot use  exigent  circumstances that  they  have\r\n\ncreated to justify a warrantless search).\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n          Second,   and  equally  important,  the  record  is\r\n\npellucid  that Lance  was  not in  a  public place  when  the\r\n\nofficers first confronted him; although he opened an interior\r\n\ndoor,  he remained  completely within the  house and  kept an\r\n\nexterior  weather  door  between  himself  and  the  officers\r\n\nentirely shut.  While the en banc court blithely asserts that\r\n\nSantana  does not  turn on  whether the  individual  whom the\r                   \r\n\npolice  desire to apprehend is inside or outside a house when\r\n\nthe first contact occurs, this distinction makes every bit of\r\n\ndifference.3   The rule prohibiting  warrantless invasions of\r\n\nthird  parties'  homes  emerged  in  Steagald,  a  case  that\r                                                         \r\n\nfollowed  and  interpreted  Santana.   Rather  than extending\r                                               \r\n\nSantana,  Steagald,  451 U.S.  at  214  n.7, 222,  reinforces\r                              \r\n\nPayton,  a case  in which  the Supreme  Court concluded  that\r                  \r\n\n\"physical entry of the  home is the chief evil  against which\r\n\nthe wording of the  Fourth Amendment is directed.\"   445 U.S.\r\n\nat  585  (citation  omitted).    Consequently,  \"the   Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  has drawn  a  firm line  at  the entrance  to  the\r\n\nhouse.\"  Id. at 590.  The Constitution does not equivocate on\r                        \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Recent Supreme Court case law confirms that police action\r\ndirected at individuals  within the confines of a dwelling is\r\nsubject   to   intense    constitutional   scrutiny.      The\r\nconstitutional   requirement   to   \"knock   and   announce,\"\r\nestablished in  Wilson v. Arkansas, 115 S.  Ct. 1914, 1915-16\r                                              \r\n(1995), pertains  only when the subject of the arrest warrant\r\nis within a dwelling.   The elevation of this  requirement to\r\nconstitutional status can only be understood  in terms of the\r\nspecial  protection granted  those persons  who are  within a\r\nprivate home's confines  when the police first arrive  on the\r\nscene.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nthis point.  See  United States v. Berkowitz, 927  F.2d 1376,\r                                                        \r\n\n1388 (7th  Cir. 1991) (\"Payton did  not draw the  line one or\r                                          \r\n\ntwo  feet into  the  home; it  drew the  line  at the  home's\r\n\nentrance.\"); State v. Morse, 480 A.2d 183, 186 (N.H. 1984); 3\r                                       \r\n\nW. LaFave, Search  and Seizure   6.1(e)  (3d ed. 1996).   Nor\r                                          \r\n\nshould we.\r\n\n          In  sum, I believe that  the officers' entry into a\r\n\nthird  party's  home  in  the absence  of  consent,  a search\r\n\nwarrant, or  exigent circumstances plainly  violated Steagald\r                                                                         \r\n\nand thus violated the homeowner's clearly established  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment rights.  See United States v. McCraw, 920 F.2d 224,\r                                                          \r\n\n228-29 (4th Cir. 1990) (rejecting use of Santana when door to\r                                                            \r\n\ndwelling was only partially opened from within).  By  hedging\r\n\non  this point,  the  en  banc  court  not  only  denies  the\r\n\nplaintiff her day in court but also invites the proliferation\r\n\nof such incidents.  Since we will be seen as sanctioning that\r\n\nwhich we are unwilling to condemn, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n",
