Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael A. Tucker on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Donald C.\nLockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDismissal for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 12, 2001\n\f      Per Curiam. Defendant Aaron John Davis, who is presently\n\nserving an eight-month prison sentence, to be followed by twenty-\n\neight months of supervised release, seeks to appeal from the\n\nfollowing special condition of his supervised release:\n\n      The defendant is to cooperate with the Probation Officer\n      in all investigations and interviews during his period of\n      supervised release.\n\nDavis argues that the circumstances surrounding the imposition of\n\nthe special condition -- including the district court's specific\n\nwarning that if Davis failed to answer truthfully questions about\n\nhis use of aliases and falsification of identification documents,\nhis supervised release would be revoked -- amounted to a violation\n\nof his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n      The government has filed a motion for summary dismissal on the\nground that the issue raised on appeal is not ripe for review.\n\nDavis responds that he is challenging the special condition itself,\nnot   its   application   or   enforcement.     The   judgment   imposing\nsentence, of which the challenged special condition is a part, is\n\na final judgment.    \"That an issue may arise concerning a party's\nsubsequent compliance with an order does not negate the . . .\norder's finality.\" United States v. Allee, 888 F.2d 208, 212 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).\n      Davis's term of supervised release will commence in less than\ntwo months.    He will then be subject to the challenged condition\n\nimposed by the district court.          Under these circumstances, the\nchallenge is not hypothetical. Compare United States v. Schoenborn,\n\n4 F.3d 1424, 1434 (7th Cir. 1993) (dismissing appeal for lack of\n\n                                    2\n\fripeness where defendant sought to challenge the effect that a\n\npossible revocation of his supervised release would have on the\n\nlength of his sentence).        Davis faces a sufficiently \"direct and\nimmediate dilemma,\" Stern v. U.S. District Court for District of\n\nMassachusetts, 214 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, __\n\nS.Ct. __, 2001 WL 137645 (Feb. 20, 2001), as he reasonably seeks to\ndetermine whether exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege in\n\nresponse to questions by his probation officer will result in\n\nrevocation of his supervised release.          See Pustell v. Lynn Public\n\nSchools, 18 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding that controversy\n\nwas ripe where plaintiffs faced \"possible sanctions\" regardless of\n\nthe imminence of an enforcement action).         As limited by Davis, his\n\nchallenge   to   the   district   court's     imposition   of   the    special\ncondition is ripe for review.1\n\n     The    Fifth   Amendment     privilege    against     compelled    self-\n\nincrimination applies in the context of interviews with probation\nofficers. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 426 (1984).\n\nHowever, \"the general obligation to appear and answer questions\n\ntruthfully\" does not amount to compulsion. Id. at 427. The answers\n\nare \"compelled\" only if \"the witness is required to answer over his\n\nvalid claim of the privilege.\" Id.       Here, the questioning has not\n\nyet happened.    \"Compulsion therefore turns on what the government\n\nwould do in such a case, rather than on what in fact it has done.\"\n\nNat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees v. Greenberg, 983 F.2d 286, 392 (D.C.\n\n     1\n        The government's unsupported statement that the probation\ndepartment will not question Davis about his use of aliases and\ncounterfeited documents does not defeat ripeness.\n\n                                     3\n\fCir. 1993).\n\n     The Supreme Court's \"decisions have made clear that the State\n\ncould not constitutionally carry out a threat to revoke probation\nfor the legitimate exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\"\n\nMurphy, 465 U.S. at 438. Although the district court's comments at\n\nsentencing might possibly be interpreted to contain such a threat,\nthat is not their only reasonable interpretation.                    The sentencing\n\ncourt stated that the information was sought \"so [Davis] can be\n\nproperly supervised.\"      The district court so stated in the context\n\nof   discussing    an   antecedent       Magistrate       Judge's        report     and\n\nrecommendation    expressing      concern      that    Davis     might      have    been\n\nplanning to use false identification documents to relocate in\n\nanother state and escape supervision by the Probation Department.\nTherefore,    questions    about   Davis's       use    of     aliases      and    false\n\nidentification     documents      have       obvious    relevance        to    Davis's\n\nprobationary     status,   particularly         in     light    of    the     standard\nconditions that he not leave the judicial district without the\n\nprobation officer's permission and that he notify the probation\n\nofficer ten days prior to any change of residence. And not all such\n\ninformation necessarily would be incriminating.\n\n     As the Murphy Court observed, \"we are hesitant to read into\n\nthe truthfulness requirement an additional obligation that [a\n\nprobationer]     refrain   from     raising       legitimate         objections      to\n\nfurnishing information that might lead to his conviction for\n\nanother crime.\" 465 U.S. at 437.             Should the court revoke Davis's\n\nsupervised release as a penalty for his legitimate exercise of his\n\n\n                                         4\n\fFifth Amendment privilege, he remains free to challenge that action\n\nat the time it occurs.     That eventuality, however, has not yet\n\noccurred (and may never occur).         For now, we must focus on the\nchallenged   special   condition    itself.    We   do   not   find   that\n\ncondition, even as explained by the district court, to carry a\n\nrealistic threat of such a penalty. So construed, Davis's sentence,\nincluding the special condition requiring cooperation with his\n\nprobation officer, is valid.       We therefore grant the government's\n\nmotion for summary disposition and affirm the sentence. See 1st Cir.\nR. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                    5\n\f",
