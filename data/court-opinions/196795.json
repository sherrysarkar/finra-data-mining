The  appeal is from a final judgment\r\n\nby the district court after a jury trial, disposing of all claims\r\n\nin respect to all parties.\r\n\n                BACKGROUND:  A BAND OUT OF BOSTON\r                          BACKGROUND:  A BAND OUT OF BOSTON\r\n\n          In this case, the parties dispute many of the facts and\r\n\nthe  inferences to  be drawn  from them.   Thus  we start  with a\r\n\nsketch of the basic  facts, and address the individual  issues in\r\n\nmore detail  below.   Appellant and cross-appellee  Donald Thomas\r\n\nScholz (\"Scholz\")  is a  musician, composer, and  record producer\r\n\nwho was, and is, a member of the musical group BOSTON (\"BOSTON\").\r\n\nIn late 1975, Scholz entered into three  agreements with appellee\r\n\nand cross-appellant Paul F.  Ahern (\"Ahern\"), who was engaged  in\r\n\nthe business of promoting and managing music groups, and his then\r\n\npartner,  Charles McKenzie (\"McKenzie\")  (collectively, the \"1975\r\n\nAgreements\").   First,  Scholz  made a  recording agreement  (the\r\n\n\"Recording  Agreement\")  with  Ahern  and  McKenzie  d/b/a   P.C.\r\n\nProductions, to  which Bradley Delp,  the lead singer  of BOSTON,\r\n\nwas  also  a  party.   Second  was  a  management agreement  (the\r\n\n\"Management   Agreement\"),   also   between   Scholz   and   P.C.\r\n\nProductions,  under  which  Ahern  and  McKenzie  were  appointed\r\n\nScholz'  exclusive  personal  managers  worldwide.     The  third\r\n\nagreement  was a  songwriter  agreement made  between Scholz  and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nAhern, under  which Scholz  was  obligated to  furnish Ahern  his\r\n\nexclusive songwriting services for a period of five years.\r\n\n          In   early   1976,  CBS   Records  (\"CBS\")   and  Ahern\r\n\nAssociates, a business name of Ahern and McKenzie, entered into a\r\n\nrecording  agreement  for  the  exclusive  recording  services of\r\n\nBOSTON.  The group's first album (the \"first album\") was released\r\n\nin 1976, and sold approximately  11 million copies -- one  of the\r\n\nhighest-selling debut albums ever.  Its second album (the \"second\r\n\nalbum\") was  released in  August 1978,  and sold  approximately 6\r\n\nmillion copies.\r\n\n          In 1978, Scholz and the other members of BOSTON entered\r\n\ninto a  modification agreement  with Ahern and  P.C. Productions,\r\n\ndated April 24, 1978.  Among other things, the First Modification\r\n\nAgreement modified the 1975  Agreements and changed the financial\r\n\nrelationship between Scholz and his managers.  Ahern and McKenzie\r\n\ndissolved their partnership.  A few  years later, in May of 1981,\r\n\nAhern and Scholz, individually  and under various business names,\r\n\nentered  into  a  further  modification  agreement (the  \"Further\r\n\nModification  Agreement\" or \"FMA\"), which is at the heart of this\r\n\ndispute.  Ahern ceased to be Scholz' manager.\r\n\n          In 1982, with the third album not yet released, CBS cut\r\n\noff  the payment of royalties generated from the first and second\r\n\nalbums.  In 1983, CBS brought suit against Scholz, Ahern, and the\r\n\nmembers of  BOSTON for failure  to timely deliver  record albums.\r\n\nScholz'  counsel in  that action  was Donald S.  Engel (\"Engel\");\r\n\nAhern  had his own counsel.   While that  litigation was pending,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nthe third album  was released by MCA Records  (\"MCA\") in 1986 and\r\n\nsold  well over 4 million copies.  At the close of trial -- seven\r\n\nyears  after  the CBS  litigation began  --  the jury  found that\r\n\nScholz was not in breach of contract.  Scholz incurred legal fees\r\n\nof about $3.4 million dollars.\r\n\n          In February 1991,  Ahern commenced this  action against\r\n\nScholz for  breach of the FMA claiming a failure to pay royalties\r\n\ndue under the  third album.  Scholz asserted  various affirmative\r\n\ndefenses and counterclaims against Ahern, including breach of the\r\n\nFMA.   During trial, Engel, Scholz' lead trial counsel, was twice\r\n\ncalled  as a witness.   At the  close of the  evidence, the court\r\n\ngranted Scholz' directed verdict dismissing Ahern's Count III for\r\n\nfraud and IV  for breach  of implied covenant  of good faith  and\r\n\nfair dealing.  The court also granted Ahern's motion for directed\r\n\nverdict dismissing Scholz' First, Second, and Third Counterclaims\r\n\nand his, Third, Fourth, and Fifth affirmative defenses.  Only the\r\n\nparties' respective breach  of contract claims went to  the jury.\r\n\nThe jury found that Scholz  breached section 5.2.1 of the  FMA to\r\n\npay  Ahern royalties from the  third album, and  found that Ahern\r\n\nhad not breached the FMA to account for and pay  Scholz royalties\r\n\ndue from the  first and second albums.  It awarded Ahern $547,007\r\n\nin damages.\r\n\n          The  trial  court sitting  without  a  jury also  found\r\n\nScholz  had  breached the  FMA, and  heard  Ahern's Count  II for\r\n\ndeclaratory relief and Count V for violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r\n\n93A and Scholz'  Fifth Counterclaim for recision of  contract for\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfailure  to obtain a license.   The court  denied the declaratory\r\n\nrelief Ahern sought in  Count I, and awarded him  costs, interest\r\n\nand  attorney's fees pursuant to  Count V for  violation of Mass.\r\n\nGen. L. ch. 93A    2 &amp; 11.  The court denied the relief sought by\r\n\nScholz  in his  Fifth Counterclaim  and held  that he  waived his\r\n\nCounts VI and  VII at oral argument.  After  a hearing on Ahern's\r\n\nbill of costs and application for  reasonable attorney's fees and\r\n\ninterest, the court awarded Ahern $265,000 in attorney's fees and\r\n\n$135,000 in costs.  \r\n\n          The district court  denied, without a hearing,  Scholz'\r\n\nmotion  for a new trial,  motion to amend  the court's memorandum\r\n\nand  order and  judgment  entered thereon,  motion  to admit  new\r\n\nevidence, and motion  to amend the  court's memorandum and  order\r\n\nand  the  judgment  entered   thereon  regarding  Scholz'   Sixth\r\n\nCounterclaim.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                      MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\r                                MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\r\n\n          Appellant first argues that the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying his motion for a new trial, made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP.  59(a).   We therefore  review the  record below  to determine\r\n\nwhether the evidence  required that the district  court grant the\r\n\nmotion  for a  new trial.    See Vda.  de P rez  v. Hospital  del\r                                                                           \r\n\nMaestro, 910 F.2d 1004,  1006 (1st Cir. 1990).  In  reviewing the\r                 \r\n\nrecord of the 16-day  trial, we note that both  parties presented\r\n\nextensive evidence.  The jury heard testimony regarding a history\r\n\nthat  spans  two  decades,  involves at  least  seven  contracts,\r\n\nincludes detailed numerical accounting, and references more  than\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nhalf a dozen other legal battles.  The parties called  a total of\r\n\nfifteen witnesses,  seven of  whom, including Ahern,  Scholz, and\r\n\nEngel,  Scholz' counsel,  testified  twice.   In short,  the jury\r\n\nfaced  a complex and sometimes conflicting set of facts in making\r\n\nits decision  as  to whether  either,  neither, or  both  parties\r\n\nbreached the 1981 Further Modification Agreement.  Ultimately, we\r\n\nfind that  the jury's verdict was not against the clear weight of\r\n\nthe evidence, and the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nin so finding.  \r\n\n          A.

We address each of  the\r\n\ntwo breach of contract claims the jury decided in turn.\r\n\n          B.   Did Ahern Breach the FMA?\r                    B.   Did Ahern Breach the FMA?\r                                                  \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          Scholz argues that Ahern breached his obligations under\r\n\nthe  1981 FMA to  both account for  and pay to  Scholz, every six\r\n\nmonths, his share of  the royalties from the compositions  on the\r\n\nfirst and second albums:  indeed, Ahern admitted at trial that he\r\n\nhad failed  to make some payments  he owed Scholz under  the FMA.\r\n\nThe  jury and the trial court disagreed with Scholz, however, and\r\n\nfound that Ahern's  breach of the  FMA was not  material.1    The\r\n\nquestion  facing us, then,  is whether the  district court abused\r\n\nits  discretion  in finding  that  the  jury's decision  was  not\r\n\nagainst the weight  of the evidence.  After careful review of the\r\n\nrecord,  we  find no  abuse of  discretion  in the  lower court's\r\n\ndecision not to disturb the jury's finding.  \r\n\n          Scholz  argues at  some length  on appeal  that Ahern's\r\n\nbreach  was  by  definition  material, both  for  his  failure to\r\n\naccount and his failure to pay.   As for the first contention, we\r\n\nnote  that while  Scholz' reading  of the  FMA as  requiring that\r\n\nAhern  render Scholz  direct accountings  every  six months  is a\r\n\nconvincing one,  it is not the only plausible one.  Indeed, Ahern\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Regarding substantial performance, the court's instructions to\r\nthe jury stated that\r\n\n            The term \"performance\" contains within it\r\n            substantial  performance.   Namely,  if a\r\n            person has substantially performed, that,\r\n            in  the   eyes  of   the  law,   is  full\r\n            performance  of  one's  obligations.   So\r\n            when I've used  the term \"performance\" or\r\n            \"breach of the obligations,\" just include\r\n            within  those  concepts  the question  of\r\n            what  is  the   definition  of  the  term\r\n            \"substantial performance\" or \"substantial\r\n            breach.\"\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncontends  that  the FMA  only  required him  to  send irrevocable\r\n\nletters of direction to  various entities involved directing them\r\n\nto send Scholz his share of the royalties when collected.  In the\r\n\nend, it would not be against the clear weight of  the evidence to\r\n\nfind that letters of  directions would satisfy Ahern's accounting\r\n\nobligations  under the  FMA,  and that  such  letters were  sent.\r\n\nTherefore,  Ahern's failure to account every six months was not a\r\n\nmaterial breach.  \r\n\n          As  for  the  second contention,  Scholz  supports  his\r\n\nposition  that Ahern's  failure  to pay  constitutes a  separate,\r\n\nmaterial breach  by drawing on  both New York2  and Massachusetts\r\n\ncase law.  He points to the Second Circuit's refusal to  overturn\r\n\nsummary  judgment  in ARP  Films,  Inc.  v.

Scholz\r                                     \r\n\nargues  that Ahern's  breach,  spanning thirteen  years, is  more\r\n\negregious  than  these  cases  of  a  six-month  failure  to  pay\r\n\nconcession and rental fees, four-month failure to pay license and\r\n\nlease  fees,  and  seven-month  failure to  pay  (and  five-month\r\n\nfailure  to  account).3    Therefore, Scholz  concludes,  Ahern's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Scholz states  that  this is  especially true  here, where  a\r\ntransfer of copyrights are  involved, and notes Ahern's admission\r\nthat this  imposed on  him a heightened  duty to account  and pay\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nfailure  to pay Scholz at least $459,000 is clearly a substantial\r\n\nbreach.\r\n\n          We  are not convinced.  We  remind appellant that under\r\n\nour  standard of  review, we  do not sit  as a  juror, evaluating\r\n\ncredibility and weighing  evidence, as he seems to ask  us to do.\r\n\nRather, we  simply weigh whether  the district court  committed a\r\n\nclear  abuse  of  its discretion  in  determining  that the  jury\r\n\nverdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence.

Our review\r                                            \r\n\nof the  record reveals  that Ahern's counsel  presented testimony\r\n\nquestioning, to  varying degrees, nine  of the thirteen  items of\r\n\nthe estimate  Scholz' accounting expert  made of  how much  Ahern\r\n\nowed  Scholz.     Phillip  Ames  (\"Ames\"),   a  certified  public\r\n\naccountant who  served  as business  manager for  both Ahern  and\r\n\nBOSTON from 1976 through  sometime in 1981 or 1982,  made several\r\n\nestimates  of how much Ahern owed Scholz, which he labelled \"ball\r\n\npark  figures.\"   While  we note  that  Ames' final  estimate was\r\n\n$277,000, for a total of $459,000 with interest, we cannot assume\r\n\nthat the jury  accepted this figure as gospel.   Given that Ahern\r\n\nsought  over a  million dollars  in principal  and interest  from\r\n\nScholz, the jury may  reasonably have found that the  Ames figure\r\n\nwas  not a substantial breach  in the particular  context of this\r\n\ncase.   It may  have determined that  the amount  of money  Ahern\r\n\nowed,  taken   in  the  perspective  of   the  contract,  Ahern's\r\n\nobligations, and the total amounts of money concerned, was not so\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nroyalties.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nsignificant  a breach  as to violate  \"an essential  and inducing\r\n\nfeature of the contract.\"  Lease-it, 600 N.E.2d at 602.  Finally,\r                                             \r\n\naddressing the case  law Scholz  relies on for  support, we  note\r\n\nthat here, unlike in those cases, the amount of money owed was in\r\n\nquestion.\r\n\n          Ultimately,  examining the record in full, the evidence\r\n\nclearly  provides the  jury  and trial  court  with a  basis  for\r\n\nfinding that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA.  As this\r\n\nCircuit stated on another occasion,\r\n\n               We  can understand how a jury might\r\n               have decided for [defendant] on the\r\n               basis  of this  evidence.   But the\r\n               jury  did not  do this;  it decided\r\n               for [plaintiff].  We do not see how\r\n               one could say that the jury clearly\r\n               made a mistake.   We do not see how\r\n               one  could  say  that the  evidence\r\n               overwhelmingly      favored     the\r\n               [defendant].   Rather, the evidence\r\n               simply was mixed and contradictory.\r\n\nVda. de  P rez, 910 F.2d at  1008.

Scholz argued at  trial that he\r\n\ndid not  breach  the  FMA,  but the  jury  and  the  trial  court\r\n\ndisagreed.\r\n\n          On  appeal,  Scholz  contends  that  their  finding  is\r\n\nagainst  the  weight  of  the  evidence,  because  Ahern's  prior\r\n\nmaterial breaches excused  Scholz' performance under the  Further\r\n\nModification Agreement.   Scholz points  out that paragraph  2 of\r\n\nthe FMA states that \r\n\n               Scholz  wishes  to  guarantee  that\r\n               Ahern  shall  receive at  a minimum\r\n               certain   amounts   of  monies   in\r\n               connection  with  future recordings\r\n               embodying  the performances  of the\r\n               group \"BOSTON\" . . . .  in exchange\r\n               for the agreement  of Ahern as  set\r\n               forth herein.\r\n\nScholz shapes his argument  on appeal as follows:   Since Ahern's\r\n\nonly  agreement of substance was his agreement to account for and\r\n\npay royalties to Scholz  for prior BOSTON albums, Ahern's  breach\r\n\nof his  commitment excused  Scholz' performance.   Indeed, Scholz\r\n\nnotes, the parties' mutual commitments to account to and pay each\r\n\nother  are expressly stated to be in consideration of each other.\r\n\nIn  such   \"bilateral  contracts   for  an  agreed   exchange  of\r\n\nperformances, even though the promises  are in form absolute, the\r\n\nlaw regards them as constructively conditioned in order  to avoid\r\n\nan  unjust  result.\"   Industrial  Mercantile Fac.

Thus the  earliest he could have owed money to\r\n\nAhern  under the FMA was August 15,  1987 -- and by that date, he\r\n\nargues,  Ahern had already failed to account to Scholz or pay him\r\n\nroyalties  with respect  to the  first two  albums for  over five\r\n\nyears.   Therefore,  Scholz maintains  he  was excused,  at least\r\n\nuntil  Ahern tendered  payment, from  rendering an  accounting or\r\n\npaying royalties  to Ahern  from the  third album.   At  the very\r\n\nleast,  Scholz argues,  he  could have  withheld  payment of  the\r\n\n$459,000 admittedly owed him  as a set-off against any  amount he\r\n\nowed  Ahern.

Since Scholz does not revisit the merits of the  evidence\r\n\npresented  at trial  regarding  his breach,  we  will not  do  so\r\n\nhere.6  However,  since we  have already found  that the  verdict\r\n\nthat Ahern did not  substantially breach the FMA was  not against\r\n\nthe clear  weight  of the  evidence, Scholz'  argument here  must\r\n\nfail.  Clearly, it  would be inconsistent with our  acceptance of\r\n\nthe  verdict that Ahern did  not substantially breach  the FMA to\r\n\nfind  that Scholz'  performance was  excused by  Ahern's material\r\n\nbreach.  Accordingly, we affirm  the district court's decision to\r\n\nrefuse the motion for a new trial on this issue.7 \r\n\n          D.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                    D.

However, we  need not address\r\nhis  contention.    Scholz provides  no  more  than  a couple  of\r\ncitations to flesh out his position:  he does not explain how the\r\njury verdict places Ahern in a better position than he would have\r\nbeen if Scholz had not  breached the FMA.  It is by now axiomatic\r\nthat \"issues  adverted to in a  perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\r\nby some  effort at  developed argumentation, are  deemed waived.\"\r\nUnited  States v.

First, the evidence\r\n\nwas overwhelming that he breached the FMA by failing to pay Ahern\r\n\nhis share of the  royalties from the third album;  indeed, Scholz\r\n\ndoes  not attempt to argue otherwise.  Second, although the issue\r\n\nof  the  materiality  of  Ahern's  breach  is  fairly  close,  as\r\n\ndiscussed above, there was sufficient evidence in the record  for\r\n\nthe  jury to determine that  Ahern did not  materially breach the\r\n\nFurther Modification  Agreement.  Finally, having  made these two\r\n\ndeterminations, the award of damages was appropriate.  Therefore,\r\n\ngiven the scope of  the evidence as  described, we find that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's denial of appellant's motion for a new trial was\r\n\namply supported and not an abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          E.

The Length of the Jury Deliberations\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n          Scholz next contends that the jury failed to follow its\r\n\ninstructions.8    The district  court  instructed  the jury  that\r\n\ndamages could only be awarded if it found  one party breached the\r\n\nFMA and the other did not.  If it found that both parties were in\r\n\nbreach, no damages could  be awarded.  In making  his contention,\r\n\nScholz  reiterates   his   argument   that   the   evidence   was\r\n\ninsufficient, emphasizing that Ahern  admitted he did not perform\r\n\nhis  obligations  under the  FMA,  and  maintaining that  Ahern's\r\n\naccountant  admitted that he both failed to pay at least $459,000\r\n\nto  Scholz and  mischaracterized an advance  from a  foreign sub-\r\n\npublisher as a loan.  Under the jury instructions, Scholz argues,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  The jury was instructed, in pertinent part, that:\r\n\n            A   party   which   has   performed   its\r\n            obligations under a contract  is entitled\r\n            to  have the  other  party  do the  same.\r\n            Conversely,   a   party  which   has  not\r\n            performed   its   obligations   under   a\r\n            contract is not  entitled to  performance\r\n            from  the  other  party.    So  once  you\r\n            understand the terms of the contract, you\r\n            should  determine  whether any  party has\r\n            failed to perform any of the terms of the\r\n            contract.\r\n                               ***\r\n               If your determination  should be  that\r\n            the    defendant    or    defendant    in\r\n            counterclaim  breached  the contract  and\r\n            that  the  plaintiff   or  plaintiff   in\r\n            counterclaim did not,  at that point  you\r\n            would consider the issue of damages.\r\n                               ***\r\n               If you find that both parties breached\r\n            their   obligations  under   the  Further\r\n            Modification  Agreement, then  no damages\r\n            should  be accorded to either party under\r\n            the contract.\r\n\n(Day 15, pages 90-92).\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nthese factors preclude the jury from finding that Scholz breached\r\n\nthe FMA, or at  least from awarding Ahern  any royalties.   These\r\n\ncontentions have been dismissed in our discussion above.  \r\n\n          However, Scholz raises  a new factor:   he argues  that\r\n\nthe   jury's  verdict   and   the  extremely   short  period   of\r\n\ndeliberations  -- one and a half hours9 following fifteen days of\r\n\ntestimony   --  reveal   that  the   jury  ignored   the  court's\r\n\ninstructions and rendered an  erroneous and inconsistent verdict.\r\n\nHe cites  the fact  that one  of the  jurors planned  to go  on a\r\n\ncruise  two days after the date of  the verdict as proof that the\r\n\njury was in  a hurry  to finish  its deliberations.   The  jury's\r\n\nquestions,10  Scholz adds,  demonstrates  that it  was determined\r\n\nto award Ahern $547,000 regardless of who was in breach.  Between\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9    For  the purposes  of  this  discussion,  we accept  Scholz'\r\ncalculation of the time the jury spent deliberating its verdict.\r\n\n10   The  jury's  questions, and  the  court's answers,  were  as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n               Question No. 1,  if neither  breached,\r\n            are damages awarded?\r\n               [Answer:]  No.\r\n               [Question No. 2:]  Verdict sheet  uses\r\n            the words, quote,  \"only if,\" unquote, in\r\n            question three.

There,  the court explicitly required  that the brief\r\n\ndeliberation be paired with  a verdict contrary to the  weight of\r\n\nthe evidence, noting  that \"'[i]f the  evidence is sufficient  to\r\n\nsupport the verdict, the  length of time the jury  deliberates is\r\n\nimmaterial.'\"   Kearns, 863 F.2d at 182 (quoting Marx v.

Finally,  we note  that the\r\n\njury's task was  relatively simple.   Although  it heard  complex\r\n\ntestimony  and was asked to weigh detailed evidence, the district\r\n\ncourt  had already  dismissed as a  matter of law  all the claims\r\n\nexcept  for the respective contract claims, and the sums at issue\r\n\nhad been clearly defined in the evidence and closing arguments.\r\n\n                    ENGEL'S TESTIMONY AT TRIAL\r                              ENGEL'S TESTIMONY AT TRIAL\r\n\n          As noted above, Engel, Scholz' lead counsel, was called\r\n\nby  both parties  as a  witness.   Maintaining that  Ahern called\r\n\nEngel as  an expert  witness, instead  of  a percipient  witness,\r\n\nScholz now  argues that the district  court committed prejudicial\r\n\nerror  by, first,  permitting  Ahern to  do  so, and  second,  by\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nrefusing to  allow follow-up  questioning by  Engel's co-counsel,\r\n\nPassin.11  \r\n\n          Our examination of each of  Scholz' contentions follows\r\n\nthe same legal framework.   In each analysis, two  questions face\r\n\nus:   first,  whether the  district court  erred in  admitting or\r\n\nrefusing the  testimony or motion; and second, whether that error\r\n\nwas  harmful.  See Doty v. Sewall,  908 F.2d 1053, 1057 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1990).

The  objected-to  portion of  his\r\n\nquestioning  sought  testimony  regarding the  Scholz  Statement,\r\n\nwhich  purported to account to  Ahern for the  royalties from the\r\n\nthird  album.  In the Statement, Scholz deducted $1.7 million for\r\n\nlegal  fees charged  by  Engel's law  firm,  which the  Statement\r\n\nlisted as equivalent to half  of the fees charged in  relation to\r\n\nthe negotiation of the agreement with MCA and the CBS litigation.\r\n\nThe  immediate issue  at  trial was  whether  this deduction  was\r\n\npermissible  as a  \"commercially  reasonable  recording  expense\"\r\n\ndeductible from  the royalties  under section  5.2.1 of  the FMA.\r\n\nBecause the record is determinative of this issue, we quote it at\r\n\nlength:   \r\n\n            Q. Now, as far as legal fees as recording\r\n            costs  are  concerned,  you've  had  some\r\n            experience over the  years, have you not,\r\n            in reviewing the contracts  of performing\r\n            artists  and groups in the musical field;\r\n            is that right?\r\n            A.  Yes.\r\n            Q.  And could  you give the Court and the\r\n            jury  some  estimate  of  the  number  of\r\n            contracts that you believe is an estimate\r\n            that you reviewed over the period of time\r\n            that  you've been  doing such  matters in\r\n            the entertainment field?\r\n            A. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and\r\n            more.\r\n            Q. Okay.\r\n               Have  you ever  seen legal  fees as  a\r\n            recording cost  in any of  those hundreds\r\n            and hundreds of contracts?\r\n               MR.

If  you can't\r\n            answer it, say you can't answer it.\r\n               THE  WITNESS:   I can  answer it,  but\r\n            it's  a little  awkward to  call me  as a\r\n            witness,  as  an  expert in  my  client's\r\n            case.\r\n               THE  COURT:    Overruled.

I have never  seen legal fees  -- You\r\n            mean designated in a contract?\r\n            Q.  Yes, as a recording cost or expense.\r\n            A.

See Prentiss  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nCarlisle Co.  v.

In\r             \r\n\nturn, Ahern  contends that the  questions asked were  not seeking\r\n\nEngel's  expert opinion  under  Federal Rule  of Evidence  701,12\r\n\nor,  in the alternative, that the district court acted within its\r\n\ndiscretion  in admitting  the testimony.   See  Espeaignnette, 43\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at   10-11  (\"Determinations   of  whether  a   witness  is\r\n\nsufficiently qualified to testify as an expert on a given subject\r\n\nand whether such expert  testimony would be helpful to  the trier\r\n\nof  fact are  committed  to the  sound  discretion of  the  trial\r\n\ncourt.\"); United  States v.

His final contention  is that\r\n\nScholz' complaint  should be  deemed waived because  Scholz first\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12   We note  in passing  that we are  skeptical both  of Ahern's\r\nclaim  that Engel  was  not called  as an  expert and  of Scholz'\r\nposition  that  Engel was  surprised  at being  questioned  as an\r\nexpert, in  light of  the following discussion,  held immediately\r\nbefore Engel took the stand:\r\n               MR. ENGEL: ... The other thing is this\r\n            delicate  situation.     I'm  an   expert\r\n            witness, right?\r\n               MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.\r\n               MR. ENGEL:  So  I'm being called as an\r\n            expert?\r\n               THE COURT:  Which you were on notice.\r\n               MR ENGEL:  I understand.\r\n\n(Day 7, pages 53-54).  Despite Scholz' protestations in his brief\r\nthat  the reference to Engel as an  expert must be a misstatement\r\nby Engel, an  error by the court reporter, or  based on something\r\noutside the reporter's hearing, it seems apparent to us that both\r\nparties  foresaw  the  possibility   of  expert  testimony  being\r\nelicited.  Indeed,  the court's statement above suggests  that it\r\nbased its later ruling on the same premise.\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\ninjected  Engel's opinion  testimony  into the  case through  his\r\n\naffidavits.  \r\n\n          We need  not consider these arguments,  however, for we\r\n\nfind that, even assuming  the trial court erred in  admitting the\r\n\nchallenged  section  of Engel's  testimony,  it  was not  harmful\r\n\nerror.   Essentially, the  challenged evidence  was  that in  the\r\n\n\"hundreds and hundreds and  hundreds and more\" contracts  that he\r\n\nhas reviewed,  Engel  never  saw  \"legal  fees  designated  in  a\r\n\ncontract  as anything,  and  certainly not  as recording  costs.\"\r\n\n(Day  7, page  73).   Having examined  the record  as a  whole to\r\n\ndetermine if admitting this evidence affected Scholz' substantial\r\n\nrights,  in accordance with our legal framework, we find that any\r\n\ncourt error did not amount to  harmful error. \r\n\n          First, although  the issue  of whether Scholz  breached\r\n\nthe  FMA was  certainly a  major focus of  the case,  and Engel's\r\n\ntestimony related to the single largest  deduction taken from the\r\n\nroyalties  on  the Scholz  Statement,  we  disagree with  Scholz'\r\n\ncontention that it  was probably determinative for  the jury, for\r\n\nseveral  reasons.   Ames and  Stewart L.  Levy (\"Levy\"),  who has\r\n\nserved as  Ahern's counsel in the past  and who was designated an\r\n\nexpert on  the subject of  the reasonableness  of the  attorney's\r\n\nfees,  both  testified that  attorney's  fees  are not  recording\r\n\nexpenses or recording costs.   Ahern testified that they  are not\r\n\nartist costs or  expenses for  recording purposes.   We found  no\r\n\ntestimony,   besides  Engel's,  contesting   this  point.    Levy\r\n\nchallenged the fees' inclusion on the Scholz Statement on another\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nfront as well,  stating that Ahern was asked  to pay for services\r\n\nthat at times were working  against his best interests, including\r\n\ntime billed on motions to preclude a stipulation which would have\r\n\nhad Sony  or CBS dropping Ahern  from the lawsuit.   In short, he\r\n\nstated, \r\n\n               We start off  with the  proposition\r\n               that here is  Mr. Ahern who is  not\r\n               directing   Mr. Scholz   to    jump\r\n               labels,  not instructing  Mr. Engel\r\n               to do anything.  Because Mr. Scholz\r\n               decides to do what he is doing, not\r\n               only  does Mr.  Ahern  get sued  by\r\n               CBS, not only is Mr. Ahern's income\r\n               from  CBS cut  off, now  Mr. Scholz\r\n               and his attorney, Mr. Engel, expect\r\n               Mr.  Ahern not only  to accept that\r\n               but to  defray part of the  cost of\r\n               Mr. Engel doing this.  I find  that\r\n               outrageous.\r\n\n(Day 7, page 95).  Engel testified that the attempt to keep Ahern\r\n\nin the case was not  directed solely at him,  but was part of  an\r\n\nattempt to keep CBS from making deals with potential witnesses.\r\n\n          The fees were not  disputed solely on the basis  of the\r\n\nappropriateness  of their  deduction.   Levy testified  at length\r\n\nthat the fees themselves were unreasonable.  He testified that he\r\n\nfelt that Engel's firm\r\n\n               did  the work without any regard to\r\n               any kind of budget, without any cap\r\n               on  their work.   Then  they turned\r\n               around  and  said, he  said  we had\r\n               carte blanche. .  . . Suddenly when\r\n               the case  is over  in 1990,  we are\r\n               told it is $3  million. . . . There\r\n               were no parameters.   Mr. Engel did\r\n               what he  wanted to do.   No one was\r\n               checking what he did to say  it was\r\n               too expensive, don't do it.\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\n(Day 7, pages 104-05).   In turn,  Engel testified that the  fees\r\n\nwere higher  than originally  estimated because  the head  of CBS\r\n\npersonally pursued  the litigation  to the \"bitter  end,\" despite\r\n\nrepeated attempts  to settle.  Ultimately,  he maintained, Scholz\r\n\nprevailed and won moneys for the entire band -- and Ahern. \r\n\n          In  fact,  the  attorney's   fees  were  not  the  only\r\n\nchallenged deduction on the Scholz Statement.   There was lengthy\r\n\ntestimony questioning and defending many of the other deductions,\r\n\nmost notably the producer's fee and the more than 11,000 hours of\r\n\nstudio time Scholz charged for.  Therefore, even if the jury felt\r\n\nthe deduction of the attorney's fees -- or of some of them -- was\r\n\nappropriate, they  could still have reasonably  found that Scholz\r\n\nmaterially breached the FMA.  Between the additional evidence, on\r\n\nboth  sides, as to whether  the legal fees  could be commercially\r\n\nreasonable recording expenses, whether the amount of fees charged\r\n\nwere reasonable,  and whether  other deductions on  the Statement\r\n\nwere reasonable,  we find  that Engel's challenged  testimony was\r\n\nnot central to the case.\r\n\n          Second, the  evidence admitted  did not have  an unduly\r\n\nprejudicial  effect.  When called to the stand by his co-counsel,\r\n\nEngel was able to clarify that,  while he felt he was asked about\r\n\n\"recording   costs,\"  the   FMA  actually   addresses  \"recording\r\n\nexpenses\":\r\n\n            Q.  Does the  -- The first question, does\r\n            the  further  modification  use the  term\r\n            \"recording costs\"?\r\n            A.    My  recollection  is,  the  [F]irst\r\n            Modification  Agreement   uses  the  term\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\n            \"recording  expenses.\"  I was asked about\r\n            recording costs.\r\n                               ***\r\n            Q.  Do  recording contracts use  the term\r\n            \"recording   expenses\"    or   \"recording\r\n            costs\"?\r\n            A.   I,  in all  the recording  contracts\r\n            I've  seen,  in  many of  them,  I  don't\r\n            remember  the  term \"recording  expenses\"\r\n            ever used, it's always  \"recording costs\"\r\n            that I've seen in the clause.\r\n\n(Day  13, pages 110-112).  He followed  up on this in his closing\r\n\nargument, stating  that \"[q]uestions  were asked  about recording\r\n\ncosts, but recording  costs is not  the word used [in  the FMA].\"\r\n\n(Day 15,  page 18).   We find  that this additional  testimony by\r\n\nEngel counters the potential prejudicial effect of his challenged\r\n\nstatement.   Scholz argues on appeal  that the prejudicial effect\r\n\nof  the  testimony was  compounded  by the  statement  of Ahern's\r\n\ncounsel in his closing argument that \r\n\n               there is no  testimony before  you,\r\n               ladies  and  gentlemen, that  legal\r\n               costs in litigation that Mr. Scholz\r\n               was in  is a  recording  cost.   In\r\n               fact,  to  the  contrary, the  only\r\n               testimony here has been  that legal\r\n               costs -- legal fees and legal costs\r\n               are not recording costs.\r\n               You    may    recall   Mr.    Engel\r\n               uncomfortably on the witness stand,\r\n               after  I  qualified   him  on   his\r\n               expertise in matters of  this sort,\r\n               acknowledging  that  this  was  the\r\n               case.  \r\n\n(Day 15, page 45).  However, between the totality of the evidence\r\n\nat trial  and the additional statements Engel  himself made, both\r\n\nas witness  and as counsel, we do not feel that this reference to\r\n\nEngel  in the hour spent  in closing argument  by Ahern's counsel\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\ncould  be found  to sway the  jury's decision,  prompting harmful\r\n\nerror.

After stating  that the FMA used the  term \"recording\r\n\nexpenses,\" not  \"recording costs,\" and reading  out the pertinent\r\n\nsection of the FMA, Engel's testimony continued as follows:\r\n\n            Q. Have  you  seen  contracts using  only\r\n            [the]   words  \"recording   costs\"  where\r\n            artists were paid for legal fees?\r\n            A. Yes.\r\n            Q.

We disagree.  The first time Engel\r\n\ntestified, he  was asked  about \"contracts of  performing artists\r\n\nand  groups in the musical field.\"   (Day 7, page 71).  He stated\r\n\nin  the disputed  testimony that  he had  \"never seen  legal fees\r\n\ndesignated  in  a  contract as  anything,  and  certainly not  as\r                                                  \r\n\nrecording costs.\"  (Day 7, page 73 (emphasis added)).   When next\r\n\ncalled to the  stand, Engel  agreed that he  had seen  \"contracts\r                                                          \r\n\nusing only [the] words 'recording costs' where artists were  paid\r\n\nfor legal  fees.\"  (Day 13,  page 112).  The  court's decision to\r\n\nsustain  the objection  made  by Ahern's  counsel in  the ensuing\r\n\ndialogue was not a refusal to allow Engel to explain his evidence\r\n\non  the basis of  its prejudicial effect  against Ahern:   it was\r\n\nevidently a reaction to  the apparent inconsistency between these\r\n\nstatements.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\n          Essentially,  on appeal  Scholz maintains  that Engel's\r\n\nco-counsel was not allowed to  \"cross-examine\" him on the subject\r\n\nof his  direct testimony for  Ahern, thereby precluding  him from\r\n\npresenting clarifying  evidence or diminishing the  \"sting\" of an\r\n\nattorney  testifying   against  his  own  client.     This  error\r\n\ncompounded the  error  of  admitting  Engel's  expert  testimony,\r\n\nScholz  contends.    He complains  that  because  of the  court's\r\n\nruling,  the jury never  got to hear  Engel's testimony regarding\r\n\nother types  of contracts, such as  agreements between performers\r\n\nand  managers, or  the difference  between \"recording  costs\" and\r\n\n\"recording expenses.\"  Nor did they hear his explanation that his\r\n\nanswer  might  differ  if  asked  about  \"commercially reasonable\r\n\nrecording expenses,\" not  \"recording costs,\" he  notes.  We  view\r\n\nthis  final protest with  some skepticism,  however, in  light of\r\n\nEngel's  testimony on the stand that he had never seen legal fees\r\n\ndesignated   \"as  anything,\"  which  would,  presumably,  include\r\n\ncommercially reasonable recording expenses.  \r\n\n          Assuming, arguendo,  that  Engel would  have  made  the\r                                      \r\n\nabove testimony and  that the district  court erred in  excluding\r\n\nthe  line  of  questioning,  any resulting  error  was  harmless.\r\n\nFirst, for the same reasons outlined above, the  testimony, while\r\n\nrelated to a  central issue, was  not central  in and of  itself.\r\n\nAmes  and  Levy  stated  that  they  saw  no  difference  between\r\n\n\"recording costs\" and \"recording expenses.\"  Additional testimony\r\n\ndebated  the total amount  of fees charged as  well as many other\r\n\naspects  of  the   Scholz  Statement.    As  for   the  potential\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nprejudicial effect, the testimony Engel was able to give,  quoted\r\n\nabove, made it clear  that his earlier statement was  directed to\r\n\n\"recording  costs,\"  not  \"recording  expenses,\" an  argument  he\r\n\nreiterated in his closing, mitigating the potential effect of the\r\n\napparent inconsistency.   Additionally,  during his first  day on\r\n\nthe stand  Engel stated,  in response  to  questioning about  the\r\n\nactual charging  of recording costs or  expenses by a  group or a\r\n\nperforming artist, that although he reviews accountings after the\r\n\nfact, he has never  reviewed an accounting like that  provided in\r\n\nthe Scholz Statement.   He  testified that \"[t]his  is a  special\r\n\ncase.  I  don't remember  any accounting that  really falls  into\r\n\nthis category.   This is not a standard contract.\"   (Day 7, page\r\n\n81).   While this  testimony does  not go  directly to his  prior\r\n\nstatements,  it does  emphasize that  the FMA  is not  a standard\r\n\ncontract, implying  that his  and others' statements  about other\r\n\ncontracts may not be pertinent.   Weighing the above in the light\r\n\nof the record as a  whole, see Doty, 908 F.2d at  1057, we cannot\r                                             \r\n\nsay that  the court's  evidentiary ruling excluded  evidence that\r\n\nwas  either central  or prejudicial  in its  effect such  that it\r\n\ncould have swayed the  factfinders' decision.  Thus, even  if the\r\n\ncourt erred, it did not rise to the level  of harmful error.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLubanski, 929 F.2d at 46.\r                  \r\n\n          C.

The Overall Impact of Engel's Testimony\r                                                               \r\n\n          Of course, it is not just the impact of the information\r\n\nelicited  from  Engel that  we must  evaluate under  the harmless\r\n\nerror standard.   We must also address the  potential prejudicial\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\neffect on the  jury of  seeing Engel, Scholz'  counsel, take  the\r\n\nstand,  dispute with  the  court and  opposing  counsel over  his\r\n\ntestimony, and finally make a  statement, apparently unwillingly,\r\n\nagainst his client's  interest -- a  statement against which,  he\r\n\nargues, he had to take an apparently inconsistent position in his\r\n\nclosing argument.   There is no  doubt in our mind  that this had\r\n\nsome  prejudicial effect on the jury.  Nonetheless, we cannot say\r\n\nwith   \"'fair  assurance  .  .   .  that  the   judgment  was  []\r\n\nsubstantially swayed by the error.'\"  Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 9\r                                                             \r\n\n(quoting Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46).  The jury sat through fifteen\r                           \r\n\ndays   of  trial,  received   substantial  and  often  cumulative\r\n\ntestimony  on  all  points,13  and  heard  an  hour   of  closing\r\n\nargument from each party's  counsel.  We find it  highly unlikely\r\n\nthat  the  verdict  could  have   been  the  result  of   Engel's\r\n\nquestioning and the attendant  commentary.  Cf. United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nRosales,  19  F.3d  763,  768  (1st   Cir.  1994)  (holding  that\r                 \r\n\nprosecutor's inappropriate argument  in closing  did not  warrant\r\n\nnew trial under harmless error standard).\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13   Indeed, the  evidence was  so redundant  that the  court was\r\nprompted to exclaim that\r\n\n               in all  my years, I have never seen\r\n               a  case in  which the  same matters\r\n               have come  up so  many times.

When the attorney\r\n\nis called to the stand by his client's opponent, the concerns are\r\n\njust as substantial, if not more.  See Siguel, 141  F.R.D. at 396\r                                                       \r\n\n(\"Although there are degrees of adverse testimony, there are few,\r\n\nif  any,   situations  that   justify  acceptance   or  continued\r\n\nemployment in  this circumstance.\").  Accordingly,  Model Rule of\r\n\nProfessional  Conduct 3.7 states that  a lawyer shall  not act as\r\n\nadvocate  at a trial where he or she  is likely to be a necessary\r\n\nwitness, except, among other  things, where the testimony relates\r\n\nto an uncontested issue or disqualification of the attorney would\r\n\nwork  substantial hardship on the client.  Finally, there is also\r\n\nthe danger that  the performance of the dual roles of counsel and\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nwitness will create  confusion on the jury's part  as to when the\r\n\nattorney is  speaking as a  witness, \"raising the  possibility of\r\n\nthe  trier  according  testimonial  credit  to  the  prosecutor's\r\n\nclosing  argument,\" United States v.

However,\r\n\nwhen counsel  is asked to  play that role  for the length  of one\r\n\nquestion in a fifteen-day trial, even acknowledging the impact of\r\n\nthe attendant discussion with the  court, attempts to examine him\r\n\non the testimony and  references to it in the  closing arguments,\r\n\nwe  cannot  hold that  it rises  to  the level  of  harmful error\r\n\naffecting  a party's  substantial  right where  the testimony  is\r\n\ncumulative and  not a central  part of the  case.  Any  prejudice\r\n\nthat resulted from the  objected-to portions of Engel's testimony\r\n\ndid not rise to the level of harmful error.  \r\n\n          D.

Approximately six weeks before\r\n\ntrial  was  scheduled to  begin, Ahern  filed  a third  motion to\r\n\ndisqualify.   This  time Scholz  agreed  to withdraw  his counsel\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nprovided that he was given time to find new lead counsel.  In his\r\n\nmemorandum in support of  his motion, Scholz stated that  he \"now\r\n\n[felt] he must retain new trial counsel in  this matter, to avoid\r\n\nthe risk of a  disqualification of his counsel just  prior to the\r\n\ntrial, and for other reasons.\"  (Scholz' Memorandum in Support of\r\n\nHis  Motion  to Continue  Trial, page  3).   The  district court,\r\n\nhowever,  denied both  Ahern's Renewed  Motion to  Disqualify and\r\n\nScholz' Motion to Continue Trial.  \r\n\n          As discussed  above, Scholz  maintains in his  brief on\r\n\nappeal that the  trial court erred by allowing Ahern to use Engel\r\n\nas his own expert against Scholz.  One of the four contentions he\r\n\nuses to support this position is that \r\n\n               the   trial  court   itself  placed\r\n               Scholz     in    his     precarious\r\n               predicament  when   it  refused  to\r\n               grant the last  motion by Ahern  to\r\n               disqualify  Engel  .   .  .  .  The\r\n               failure  to  grant the  continuance\r\n               under  these  circumstances,  which\r\n               resulted  in  severe  prejudice  to\r\n               Scholz,   is,  itself,   reversible\r\n               error.\r\n\n(Appellant's Brief,  page  34).   In  support of  his  statement,\r\n\nScholz cites  several cases weighing district  court decisions on\r\n\nmotions  for continuances.  See Lowe v. City of East Chicago, 897\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 272, 274-75 (7th Cir. 1990) (concluding that it was an abuse\r\n\nof discretion to deny motion  for continuance where plaintiff was\r\n\nfaced with choice between voluntary dismissal and going to  trial\r\n\nalthough  his attorney was not ready for trial); United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nFlynt,  756 F.2d 1352, 1358-59 (9th  Cir.)

Even if it did, the error was harmless.\r\n\n          Finally, we note that while we ultimately hold that the\r\n\ncourt  did  not commit  harmful error  in making  its evidentiary\r\n\nruling, we find  it very disturbing that trial  counsel testified\r\n\nin  this case.   In  making his  appeal, Scholz  directs us  to a\r\n\nseries of cases, several of which are referenced above, which lay\r\n\nout the real and serious  concerns implicated by allowing counsel\r\n\nto testify at trial.  See,  e.g., United States v. Dack, 747 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1172,  1172  n.5 (7th  Cir.  1984)  (\"Where  evidence  is  easily\r\n\navailable   from   other   sources   and   absent  'extraordinary\r\n\ncircumstances'   or  'compelling   reasons,'   an  attorney   who\r\n\nparticipates  in the case should  not be called  as a witness.\").\r\n\nWe ask whether  Scholz and  his counsel read  these cases  before\r\n\nopposing Ahern's first  two motions to disqualify.   The concerns\r\n\nthe cases voice are implicated whether counsel testifies for  his\r\n\nor her own client or for the opposing party.  What is  more, even\r\n\nif Engel  testified solely as  to ministerial  matters, we  still\r\n\ndoubt  the wisdom of allowing him on  the stand, as the matter of\r\n\nhis firm's  legal fees -- not only whether, as a whole, they were\r\n\ncommercially reasonable recording expenses but  also whether they\r\n\nwere reasonable  at all -- was  a matter of testimony.   The jury\r\n\nheard  deposition testimony  from  Ahern's expert  Levy that  the\r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\nlegal fees  from the  CBS  litigation were,  among other  things,\r\n\n\"excessive and  totally inappropriate\" (Day 7,  page 86); whether\r\n\nEngel  was called to  the stand by Scholz  or Ahern, indeed, even\r\n\nhad he  never testified,  his integrity  and judgment could  have\r\n\nbeen questioned by the factfinders.  \r\n\n    COUNTERCLAIM FOR FRAUD AND DECEIT AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\r              COUNTERCLAIM FOR FRAUD AND DECEIT AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\r\n\n          The  Further Modification Agreement provided that Ahern\r\n\nwas entitled to  a share of the royalties of  any album completed\r\n\nbefore  October  24,  1984.   Had  the  parties  adhered to  this\r\n\nprovision, Ahern would  not be  entitled to any  moneys from  the\r\n\nthird  album,  as it  was completed  after  that date.   Instead,\r\n\nScholz  waived   the  deadline,  conveying   his  waiver  through\r\n\ncommunications between the parties' attorneys in May of 1984.  In\r\n\nthis  action, Scholz drew  on his waiver  of the  deadline in his\r\n\nthird  counterclaim and  several of  his affirmative  defenses to\r\n\nargue  for rescission of the  waiver agreement on  the grounds of\r\n\nfraud and deceit and, alternatively, its invalidation.  On appeal\r\n\nbefore  us,  he appeals  the  district  court's directed  verdict\r\n\nagainst him on these claims.\r\n\n          Our standard of review is a familiar one.

It is  alleged\r\n               that  this  relationship proved  so\r\n               profitable to defendant that at one\r\n               point the Beatles constituted 25 to\r\n               30  percent of its  business.  Even\r\n               after  the  Beatles attained  their\r\n               remarkable degree of popularity and\r\n               success,  they  still continued  to\r\n               rely  on  Capitol  Records for  the\r\n               manufacture  and   distributing  of\r\n               their  recordings.

Like the parties in Apple Records,  at the\r                                                                  \r\n\ntime of the waiver in 1984 Ahern and Scholz had a long history of\r\n\nbusiness  dealings,   marked  by  a  series   of  agreements  and\r\n\nmodification agreements.  Also as in that  case, the relationship\r\n\nbetween  the  parties  here  was  a  profitable  one  for  Ahern.\r\n\nHowever, unlike that case,  Ahern no longer, as of  several years\r\n\npreviously, was  Scholz' manager.  Indeed,  Scholz testified that\r\n\n                               -45-\r\r\n\nin 1978, when he first started the process that culminated in the\r\n\nFMA,  he was no longer on speaking terms with Ahern.  While we do\r\n\nnot doubt  -- and  Ahern admitted  at trial --  that Ahern  had a\r\n\nfiduciary duty to Scholz until 1981, the question remains whether\r\n\nthere  was such a  special relationship  of trust  and confidence\r\n\nbetween the  parties at the  time of the waiver  that a fiduciary\r\n\nrelationship, at least  as regards  Ahern's duty  to pay  Scholz'\r\n\nshare  of  the  royalties  from  the  first  and  second  albums,\r\n\nremained.    Since a  reasonable juror  could  find that  it did,\r\n\nhowever, a  directed verdict is inappropriate on  the question of\r\n\nwhether  Ahern  owed Scholz  a  fiduciary  duty.   Therefore,  we\r\n\ncontinue our analysis and  turn to the evidence presented  on the\r\n\nelements listed above.\r\n\n          First, as for the  material false misrepresentation  or\r\n\nnondisclosure, it is undisputed  that Ahern did not disclose  his\r\n\nfailure to pay, a fact which a reasonable juror could easily find\r\n\nmaterial.    On the  other hand,  both  Ahern and  Barbara Sherry\r\n\n(\"Sherry\"),  who provided business  management services for Ahern\r\n\nand BOSTON while Ames served as their business manager and served\r\n\nas  Ahern's business  manager from  1982 up  through the  time of\r\n\ntrial,  testified that they were  not aware money  was owed until\r\n\nafter the waiver  was made, and Scholz  points to no evidence  of\r\n\nconcealment.   Second,  Scholz would  have us  read an  intent to\r\n\ndeceive into Sherry's  testimony agreeing with Engel's  statement\r\n\nthat  today,  looking at  a  royalty statement  from  the company\r\n\ncharged with  administrating  the publishing,  \"it's  immediately\r\n\n                               -46-\r\r\n\nplain to anyone who knows this business, that [the administration\r\n\ncompany] was not paying\"  the proper percentage to Scholz.   (Day\r\n\n6, pages 61-62).  Scholz cannot rely on this as an admission that\r\n\nSherry knew  Scholz was  not receiving  all his moneys,  however,\r\n\nsince  her actual  testimony was  that she  did not  know of  the\r\n\nfailure at the time.  Instead, he seeks to build on her admission\r\n\nthat one could have known from the face of the royalty statements\r\n\nthat there was an error,  as well as the  fact that there was  no\r\n\nevidence that letters of direction  were prepared for the foreign\r\n\nsub-publishers, to support his contention that Ahern \"had to have\r\n\nknown\" he was  not making all his  payments.  Ahern presented  no\r\n\nevidence  indicating that he could  not have known  of the error,\r\n\njust that he did not.  In essence, therefore, determining whether\r\n\nAhern intended to deceive Scholz becomes an issue of credibility,\r\n\none which of necessity is a question for the jury.\r\n\n          As  for whether  Scholz  reasonably  relied on  Ahern's\r\n\nnondisclosure,  his case is damaged by the fact that the evidence\r\n\nis undisputed  that Ahern  did not  actually solicit  the waiver.\r\n\nScholz'  attorney contacted  his counsel and  offered it  to him.\r\n\nScholz explained his motivation at trial:\r\n\n            A.   Well, I figured if  I, if I finished\r\n            the record six months later and  I missed\r\n            that date that Paul Ahern was entitled to\r\n            his  12  percent  of the  royalties,  you\r\n            know,  I missed  that date  and then  six\r\n            months  later delivered the record, I was\r\n            sure he would  be upset  about that  and,\r\n            and  want his  12 percent  anyway,  and I\r\n            didn't want to fight with him.\r\n            Q.   And  was it  your intention  at that\r\n            time --\r\n            A.  I had enough trouble at that point.\r\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\n            Q.    And did  you  ask  for anything  in\r\n            return for that waiver?\r\n            A.  No.\r\n\n(Day 10, pages 38-39).   However, Scholz points to  his testimony\r\n\nat  trial that he \"obviously\" would not have agreed to the waiver\r\n\nhad he known of  Ahern's failure to pay him  publishing royalties\r\n\nas evidence  of his reliance.   Giving Scholz the  benefit of all\r\n\nthe  inferences,  a  reasonable  juror  could  find  under  these\r\n\ncircumstances  that   Ahern  sought  to  induce   Scholz  into  a\r\n\nfraudulent agreement,  once it had  been offered to  him, through\r\n\nnondisclosure of his  failure to pay.  The presence of the fourth\r\n\nelement, damages, Scholz contends, is  witnessed by the fact that\r\n\nhe now owes  Ahern money:  had he not  waived the deadline, Ahern\r\n\nwould not have been  entitled to royalties from the  third album.\r\n\nGiven  all of  the  above,  we  find  that  Scholz  has  mustered\r\n\nsufficient evidence for the issue to go to the jury.  \r\n\n          B.   Invalidation of the Waiver\r                    B.   Invalidation of the Waiver\r                                                   \r\n\n          In his Fourth  and Fifth  Affirmative Defenses,  Scholz\r\n\nargues that the waiver  should be invalidated because he  did not\r\n\nknowingly give his  consent.  He maintains here that  in order to\r\n\nprevail, all  he must prove is  that he would not  have agreed to\r\n\nthe waiver if  he had known of Ahern's failure  to account to and\r\n\npay him royalties.  Since he testified to that effect, he argues,\r\n\nthe  district court  erred in  granting a  directed verdict.   We\r\n\ndisagree.  First, we note that  none of the cases Scholz looks to\r\n\nfor support discuss invalidation  as an affirmative defense under\r\n\nFederal  Rule of  Civil Procedure  8(c).

The  district court found that Scholz'  failure\r\n\nto pay royalties  as provided  in the FMA  violated Chapter  93A.\r\n\nMore specifically,  it held  that the Scholz  Statement regarding\r\n\nthe  royalties  on the  third  album  constituted an  unfair  and\r\n\ndeceptive business practice,  and that it  was a \"deliberate  and\r\n\nblatant attempt  to deprive Plaintiff Ahern  of moneys rightfully\r\n\ndue and owing  to him.\"   (District Court  Memorandum and  Order,\r\n\npage 3).

First, it found that Scholz agreed to pay\r\n\nAhern  royalties after deduction of only a producer's royalty and\r\n\nall  commercially reasonable  recording  expenses.   Second,  the\r\n\ncourt held that  the Scholz Statement  constituted an unfair  and\r\n\ndeceptive business  practice.   More specifically, it  found that\r\n\nthe  deductions taken for legal fees,  payment to Jeff Dorenfeld,\r\n\ntime  spent in the studio, and the resulting recording costs were\r\n\nall not commercially reasonable  recording expenses.  Rather, the\r\n\ncourt   stated,  $500,000   in   recording   expenses  would   be\r\n\ncommercially reasonable.   It  next found that  Scholz' Statement\r\n\nwas\r\n\n               a deliberate and blatant attempt to\r\n               deprive  the   Plaintiff  Ahern  of\r\n               monies rightfully due and  owing to\r\n               him as royalties  from the sales of\r\n               the  third  Boston  album.

It is  a question of  law whether this  attempt to deprive\r\n\nAhern rises  to the level of  a violation of Chapter  93A, as the\r\n\nlower  court held, and we believe the decision includes enough of\r\n\na basis  for the Chapter  93A finding  to save the  decision from\r\n\nremand.   The district court has  provided us with more than mere\r\n\nconclusions.

We note,  however, that our task  would\r\n\nhave been much simpler in this and other issues had the  district\r\n\ncourt seen fit to explicate more of its decision-making on paper.\r\n\nThere is a gap between  finding that deductions are  commercially\r\n\nunreasonable  and finding that the Scholz Statement as a whole is\r\n\nan attempt to deprive  Ahern deserving of the  modifiers \"unfair\"\r\n\nand \"deceptive\":  while we are willing to follow  the lower court\r\n\nacross the distance between  them, a bridge would have  been more\r\n\nthan welcome.\r\n\n          C.

As  noted above, whether an\r\n\nact was unfair and/or deceptive is  a question of fact.  Based on\r\n\nour  review of the evidence, we do  not hesitate to find that the\r\n\ndistrict  court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and\r\n\n                               -55-\r\r\n\nwe will  not disturb  them.16  See  United Truck  Leasing Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGeltman,  533 N.E.2d 647, 653  (Mass.

Thus, we assess  the lower court's award\r\n\nunder  Chapter  93A  in  the  light  of  its  finding  that  four\r\n\ndeductions -- which totalled $4.2 million -- were not reasonable,\r\n\nbut $0.5  million  would  be  commercially  reasonable  recording\r\n\ncosts,  and that the Scholz Statement was a deliberate attempt to\r\n\ndeprive Ahern of his  percentage of the royalties from  the third\r\n\nalbum.

However, the district  court's\r\nfindings  do  not  discuss  Scholz'  conduct  in  defending  this\r\nlawsuit, either by reference  or as a basis for  its conclusions.\r\nWe  refuse  to  move as  far  afield  from  the district  court's\r\nfindings in order to find extortionate conduct as Ahern requests.\r\nHis  reliance  on  the  court's  discussion  of  the  defendant's\r\nlitigation practices in Quaker  State is misplaced, because there\r                                               \r\nthe defendant's  prosecution of  the counterclaims was  raised in\r\nthe complaint,  and was  addressed by the  district court  below.\r\n884 F.2d at 1513-14.\r\n\n                               -59-\r\r\n\nwillful act calculated to obtain the benefits of [the] contract .\r\n\n.  .  without   cost  and  in  disregard   of  known  contractual\r\n\narrangements\").   Here,  the  court found  that Scholz  knowingly\r\n\nbreached the contract in order to gain a benefit -- Ahern's share\r\n\nof the royalties.  But  that would be true of any  knowing breach\r\n\nof  a contract.    The question,  then, is  whether the  level of\r\n\n\"rascality\" is  sufficient to rise to the level of a violation of\r\n\nChapter  93A.  We  find it is  not.  First,  while the deductions\r\n\nthat the court deemed commercially  unreasonable ate up more than\r\n\nhalf of the  royalties reported, we note that Scholz did not seek\r\n\nto conceal the nature of the deductions:  he laid them out on the\r\n\nScholz Statement in varying levels of detail.  Next, while Scholz\r\n\nhas an extensive degree of control over the moneys from the third\r\n\nalbum, there has been no allegation that he did not report all of\r\n\nthe royalties from  MCA on  the Scholz Statement.   Evidence  was\r\n\npresented  that  the  number of  hours  spent  on  the album  was\r\n\nreconstructed after the fact, but the district court did not find\r\n\nthat the figures given  were inaccurate, just that they  were not\r\n\ndeductible.   Scholz' breach amounted to more than a dispute over\r\n\nthe commercial reasonableness of  certain deductions, as he would\r\n\nhave us believe.  Nonetheless, his acts did not rise to the level\r\n\nof rascality  required for Chapter 93A  liability.18  Ultimately,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n18  Both parties devote sections of their briefs to six \"factors\"\r\nrelated  to Scholz'  \"rascality\" which  Scholz raises,  and Ahern\r\ndisputes.  We note that, for the most part, they prove irrelevant\r\nbecause  we focus here on  Scholz' actions in  breaching the FMA,\r\nnot  the nature of the  relationship between the  parties for the\r\nlast twenty years.\r\n\n                               -60-\r\r\n\ntherefore,  we conclude that the district court erred as a matter\r\n\nof law in finding  Scholz violated Chapter 93A, and  reverse that\r\n\nholding. \r\n\n             PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\r                       PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND ATTORNEY'S FEES\r\n\n          As  we have found  that Scholz did  not violate Chapter\r\n\n93A,  we need  not address  the parties' arguments  regarding the\r\n\naward  of attorney's  fees under that  statute.  Nor  do we weigh\r\n\nAhern's  cross-appeal of  the district  court's refusal  to award\r\n\nprejudgment  interest, since  that is  based on  his Chapter  93A\r\n\ncontention.   See Mass. Gen.

Thus we start with a sketch of the basic facts, and address the individual issues in more detail below.   Appellant and cross-appellee Donald Thomas Scholz (\"Scholz\") is a musician, composer, and record producer who was, and is, a member of the musical group BOSTON (\"BOSTON\").   In late 1975, Scholz entered into three agreements with appellee and cross-appellant Paul F. Ahern (\"Ahern\"), who was engaged in the business of promoting and managing music groups, and his then partner, Charles McKenzie (\"McKenzie\") (collectively, the \"1975 Agreements\").   First, Scholz made a recording agreement (the \"Recording Agreement\") with Ahern and McKenzie d/b/a P.C. Productions, to which Bradley Delp, the lead singer of BOSTON, was also a party.   Second was a management agreement (the \"Management Agreement\"), also between Scholz and P.C. Productions, under which Ahern and McKenzie were appointed Scholz' exclusive personal managers worldwide.   The third agreement was a songwriter agreement made between Scholz and Ahern, under which Scholz was obligated to furnish Ahern his exclusive songwriting services for a period of five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1976, CBS Records (\"CBS\") and Ahern Associates, a business name of Ahern and McKenzie, entered into a recording agreement for the exclusive recording services of BOSTON.   The group's first album (the \"first album\") was released in 1976, and sold approximately 11 million copies--one of the highest-selling debut albums ever.   Its second album (the \"second album\") was released in August 1978, and sold approximately 6 million copies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1978, Scholz and the other members of BOSTON entered into a modification agreement with Ahern and P.C. Productions, dated April 24, 1978.   Among other things, the First Modification Agreement modified the 1975 Agreements and changed the financial relationship between Scholz and his managers.   Ahern and McKenzie dissolved their partnership.   A few years later, in May of 1981, Ahern and Scholz, individually and under various business names, entered into a further modification agreement (the \"Further Modification Agreement\" or \"FMA\"), which is at the heart of this dispute.   Ahern ceased to be Scholz' manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, with the third album not yet released, CBS cut off the payment of royalties generated from the first and second albums.   In 1983, CBS brought suit against Scholz, Ahern, and the members of BOSTON for failure to timely deliver record albums.   Scholz' counsel in that action was Donald S. Engel (\"Engel\");  Ahern had his own counsel.   While that litigation was pending, the third album was released by MCA Records (\"MCA\") in 1986 and sold well over 4 million copies.   At the close of trial--seven years after the CBS litigation began--the jury found that Scholz was not in breach of contract.   Scholz incurred legal fees of about $3.4 million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1991, Ahern commenced this action against Scholz for breach of the FMA claiming a failure to pay royalties due under the third album.   Scholz asserted various affirmative defenses and counterclaims against Ahern, including breach of the FMA.   During trial, Engel, Scholz' lead trial counsel, was twice called as a witness.   At the close of the evidence, the court granted Scholz' directed verdict dismissing Ahern's Count III for fraud and IV for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   The court also granted Ahern's motion for directed verdict dismissing Scholz' First, Second, and Third Counterclaims and his, Third, Fourth, and Fifth affirmative defenses.   Only the parties' respective breach of contract claims went to the jury.   The jury found that Scholz breached section 5.2.1 of the FMA to pay Ahern royalties from the third album, and found that Ahern had not breached the FMA to account for and pay Scholz royalties due from the first and second albums.   It awarded Ahern $547,007 in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sitting without a jury also found Scholz had breached the FMA, and heard Ahern's Count II for declaratory relief and Count V for violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   93A and Scholz' Fifth Counterclaim for recision of contract for failure to obtain a license.   The court denied the declaratory relief Ahern sought in Count I, and awarded him costs, interest and attorney's fees pursuant to Count V for violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   93A &#167;&#167; 2 &amp; 11.   The court denied the relief sought by Scholz in his Fifth Counterclaim and held that he waived his Counts VI and VII at oral argument.   After a hearing on Ahern's bill of costs and application for reasonable attorney's fees and interest, the court awarded Ahern $265,000 in attorney's fees and $135,000 in costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied, without a hearing, Scholz' motion for a new trial, motion to amend the court's memorandum and order and judgment entered thereon, motion to admit new evidence, and motion to amend the court's memorandum and order and the judgment entered thereon regarding Scholz' Sixth Counterclaim.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial, made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a).   We therefore review the record below to determine whether the evidence required that the district court grant the motion for a new trial.   See de Perez v. Hospital del Maestro, 910 F.2d 1004, 1006 (1st Cir.1990).   In reviewing the record of the 16-day trial, we note that both parties presented extensive evidence.   The jury heard testimony regarding a history that spans two decades, involves at least seven contracts, includes detailed numerical accounting, and references more than half a dozen other legal battles.   The parties called a total of fifteen witnesses, seven of whom, including Ahern, Scholz, and Engel, Scholz' counsel, testified twice.   In short, the jury faced a complex and sometimes conflicting set of facts in making its decision as to whether either, neither, or both parties breached the 1981 Further Modification Agreement.   Ultimately, we find that the jury's verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir.1994).   In reaching its decision, \"the district court has broad legal authority to determine whether or not a jury's verdict is against the 'clear weight of the evidence.' \"  de Perez, 910 F.2d at 1006.   Nonetheless, \"the trial judge's discretion, although great, must be exercised with due regard to the rights of both parties to have questions which are fairly open resolved finally by the jury at a single trial.\"  Coffran v. Hitchcock Clinic, Inc., 683 F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1087, 103 S.Ct. 571, 74 L.Ed.2d 933 (1982);  see Kearns v. Keystone Shipping Co., 863 F.2d 177, 178-79 (1st Cir.1988).   Thus, the district court judge \"cannot displace a jury's verdict merely because he disagrees with it or would have found otherwise in a bench trial.\"  Milone, 847 F.2d at 37;  see Coffran, 683 F.2d at 6. \"The mere fact that a contrary verdict may have been equally--or even more easily--supportable furnishes no cognizable ground for granting a new trial.\"  Freeman v.

We address each of the two breach of contract claims the jury decided in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Did Ahern Breach the FMA?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz argues that Ahern breached his obligations under the 1981 FMA to both account for and pay to Scholz, every six months, his share of the royalties from the compositions on the first and second albums:  indeed, Ahern admitted at trial that he had failed to make some payments he owed Scholz under the FMA.   The jury and the trial court disagreed with Scholz, however, and found that Ahern's breach of the FMA was not material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The question facing us, then, is whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that the jury's decision was not against the weight of the evidence.   After careful review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion in the lower court's decision not to disturb the jury's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz argues at some length on appeal that Ahern's breach was by definition material, both for his failure to account and his failure to pay.   As for the first contention, we note that while Scholz' reading of the FMA as requiring that Ahern render Scholz direct accountings every six months is a convincing one, it is not the only plausible one.   Indeed, Ahern contends that the FMA only required him to send irrevocable letters of direction to various entities involved directing them to send Scholz his share of the royalties when collected.   In the end, it would not be against the clear weight of the evidence to find that letters of directions would satisfy Ahern's accounting obligations under the FMA, and that such letters were sent.   Therefore, Ahern's failure to account every six months was not a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second contention, Scholz supports his position that Ahern's failure to pay constitutes a separate, material breach by drawing on both New York<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and Massachusetts case law.   He points to the Second Circuit's refusal to overturn summary judgment in ARP Films, Inc. v. Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc., 952 F.2d 643, 649 (2d Cir.1991).   In that case, where plaintiffs failed to account and pay royalties in excess of $400,000, the court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>the district court correctly concluded that the breach by plaintiffs in failing to make the payments and provide the reports required ... was material as a matter of law, thus authorizing Marvel to terminate the contract.  [The parties' agreement] explicitly singled out plaintiffs' obligation to provide \"prompt accounting\" for distributions as a term and condition of the agreement, the substantial breach of which authorized Marvel to terminate the license provided by the agreement.   In addition, failure to tender payment is generally deemed a material breach of contract.   Finally, as the district court found, and the subsequent accounting confirmed, the amounts withheld from Marvel by plaintiffs were very substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citations omitted).   Scholz also points to a New York case holding that a licensee's failure to pay franchise fees totalling $40,129 over four months constituted a breach of contract, McDonald's Corp. v. Robert Makin, Inc., 653 F.Supp. 401, 402-04 (W.D.N.Y.1986), as well as Massachusetts language indicating that \"[a] material breach of an agreement occurs when there is a breach of 'an essential and inducing feature of the contract.' \"  Lease-it, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 33 Mass.App.Ct. 391, 600 N.E.2d 599, 602 (1992) (holding that six-month refusal to pay concession and rental fees was a material breach) (quoting Buchholz v. Green Bros. Co., 272 Mass. 49, 172 N.E. 101 (1930)).   Scholz argues that Ahern's breach, spanning thirteen years, is more egregious than these cases of a six-month failure to pay concession and rental fees, four-month failure to pay license and lease fees, and seven-month failure to pay (and five-month failure to account).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Therefore, Scholz concludes, Ahern's failure to pay Scholz at least $459,000 is clearly a substantial breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not convinced.   We remind appellant that under our standard of review, we do not sit as a juror, evaluating credibility and weighing evidence, as he seems to ask us to do.   Rather, we simply weigh whether the district court committed a clear abuse of its discretion in determining that the jury verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence.  Newell Puerto Rico, 20 F.3d at 22;  Kearns, 863 F.2d at 179.   Our review of the record reveals that Ahern's counsel presented testimony questioning, to varying degrees, nine of the thirteen items of the estimate Scholz' accounting expert made of how much Ahern owed Scholz.   Phillip Ames (\"Ames\"), a certified public accountant who served as business manager for both Ahern and BOSTON from 1976 through sometime in 1981 or 1982, made several estimates of how much Ahern owed Scholz, which he labelled \"ball park figures.\"   While we note that Ames' final estimate was $277,000, for a total of $459,000 with interest, we cannot assume that the jury accepted this figure as gospel.   Given that Ahern sought over a million dollars in principal and interest from Scholz, the jury may reasonably have found that the Ames figure was not a substantial breach in the particular context of this case.   It may have determined that the amount of money Ahern owed, taken in the perspective of the contract, Ahern's obligations, and the total amounts of money concerned, was not so significant a breach as to violate \"an essential and inducing feature of the contract.\"  Lease-It, 600 N.E.2d at 602.   Finally, addressing the case law Scholz relies on for support, we note that here, unlike in those cases, the amount of money owed was in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, examining the record in full, the evidence clearly provides the jury and trial court with a basis for finding that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA.   As this Circuit stated on another occasion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>We can understand how a jury might have decided for [defendant] on the basis of this evidence.

We do not see how one could say that the evidence overwhelmingly favored the [defendant].

Therefore we cannot say that the district court committed a clear breach of its discretion on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Did Scholz Breach the FMA?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern claimed below that Scholz breached his obligation under section 5.2.1 of the FMA to pay Ahern his share of the royalties due from the third album.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The evidence presented at trial centered on a document entitled \"Artist Royalty Statement\" (\"the Scholz Statement\"), which Scholz presented to Ahern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  That statement listed over $6 million in gross royalties reported by MCA prior to December 31, 1993, but reduced that figure by deducting, among other things, a producer share and artist costs, so that the net artist royalties fell to below zero--and Ahern was not entitled to any money.   Scholz argued at trial that he did not breach the FMA, but the jury and the trial court disagreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Scholz contends that their finding is against the weight of the evidence, because Ahern's prior material breaches excused Scholz' performance under the Further Modification Agreement.   Scholz points out that paragraph 2 of the FMA states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Scholz wishes to guarantee that Ahern shall receive at a minimum certain amounts of monies in connection with future recordings embodying the performances of the group \"BOSTON\" .... in exchange for the agreement of Ahern as set forth herein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz shapes his argument on appeal as follows:  Since Ahern's only agreement of substance was his agreement to account for and pay royalties to Scholz for prior BOSTON albums, Ahern's breach of his commitment excused Scholz' performance.   Indeed, Scholz notes, the parties' mutual commitments to account to and pay each other are expressly stated to be in consideration of each other.   In such \"bilateral contracts for an agreed exchange of performances, even though the promises are in form absolute, the law regards them as constructively conditioned in order to avoid an unjust result.\"  Industrial Mercantile Fac.  Co. v. Daisy Sportswear, 56 Misc.2d 104, 288 N.Y.S.2d 209, 211 (N.Y.Civ.Ct.1967), order aff'd, 56 Misc.2d 584, 289 N.Y.S.2d 332 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1968);  see Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#167; 237 cmt. a (1979).   Moreover, Scholz continues, the non-occurrence of a condition of a party's duty excuses the non-breaching party's obligation to perform even though that party does not know of its non-occurrence, id., &#167; 237 cmt. c, and the intention or scienter of a breaching party are not considered in the elements of breach of contract.   See Agron v. The Trustees of Columbia Univ., 1993 WL 118495 (S.D.N.Y., April 12, 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering this, Scholz points out that his first royalty statement regarding the third album was rendered by MCA on April 1, 1987.   Thus the earliest he could have owed money to Ahern under the FMA was August 15, 1987--and by that date, he argues, Ahern had already failed to account to Scholz or pay him royalties with respect to the first two albums for over five years.   Therefore, Scholz maintains he was excused, at least until Ahern tendered payment, from rendering an accounting or paying royalties to Ahern from the third album.   At the very least, Scholz argues, he could have withheld payment of the $459,000 admittedly owed him as a set-off against any amount he owed Ahern.   See Record Club of America v. United Artists Records, Inc., 80 B.R. 271, 276 (S.D.N.Y.1987), vacated on other grounds, 890 F.2d 1264 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so arguing, Scholz does not contend that he did not in fact breach the FMA:  he simply maintains that Ahern did so first.   Since Scholz does not revisit the merits of the evidence presented at trial regarding his breach, we will not do so here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, since we have already found that the verdict that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA was not against the clear weight of the evidence, Scholz' argument here must fail.   Clearly, it would be inconsistent with our acceptance of the verdict that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA to find that Scholz' performance was excused by Ahern's material breach.   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to refuse the motion for a new trial on this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote, Scholz adds that he is appealing the verdict not only in terms of the denial of his motion for a new trial, as discussed above, but also that he appeals each of the jury's findings--i.e. that Scholz breached the FMA, that Ahern did not breach the Agreement, and that Ahern was entitled to damages--on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence.   Scholz relies on Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1979), cert. denied sub nom.  Durham Distribs., Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 449 U.S. 890, 101 S.Ct. 248, 66 L.Ed.2d 116 (1980), to claim that our review of his alternative argument is limited to asking whether there is sufficient support in the record for the jury's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engine Specialties outlines the standard of review as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>If we can reach but one conclusion after reviewing the evidence and all inferences drawn fairly therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff (the prevailing party) and if that conclusion differs from the jury's, only then can the finding be set aside.   Even if contrary evidence was presented and conflicting inferences could be drawn, it is for the jury to draw the ultimate conclusion, and such determination will not be disturbed unless the condition described above is met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.;  see Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Anchor Media Television, Inc., 45 F.3d 546, 552-53 (1st Cir.1995) (outlining application of standard).   We note that, in fact, this is the standard of review applicable to motions for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50.   While it is a circumscribed review, it is nonetheless not as limited as our review of the district court's disposition of the motion for new trial.   See Sanchez, 37 F.3d at 716-17 (comparing the two standards of review).   We find nothing in the record to establish that appellant Scholz made a motion for judgment as a matter of law, so that he would be entitled to this less deferential standard of review.   Rather, he argues sufficiency of the evidence in his motion for a new trial.   Our review of the record, therefore, must be under the abuse of discretion standard outlined above.   See MacQuarrie v. Howard Johnson Co., 877 F.2d 126, 131 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the strict \"abuse of discretion\" standard \"is especially appropriate if the motion for a new trial is based on a claim that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence\");  Freeman, 865 F.2d at 1341-43 (evaluating the weight of the evidence as part of a motion for a new trial, separately from its review of the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irrespective of which standard of review we apply, however, Scholz' alternative argument fails.   First, the evidence was overwhelming that he breached the FMA by failing to pay Ahern his share of the royalties from the third album;  indeed, Scholz does not attempt to argue otherwise.   Second, although the issue of the materiality of Ahern's breach is fairly close, as discussed above, there was sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to determine that Ahern did not materially breach the Further Modification Agreement.   Finally, having made these two determinations, the award of damages was appropriate.   Therefore, given the scope of the evidence as described, we find that the district court's denial of appellant's motion for a new trial was amply supported and not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Length of the Jury Deliberations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz next contends that the jury failed to follow its instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The district court instructed the jury that damages could only be awarded if it found one party breached the FMA and the other did not.   If it found that both parties were in breach, no damages could be awarded.   In making his contention, Scholz reiterates his argument that the evidence was insufficient, emphasizing that Ahern admitted he did not perform his obligations under the FMA, and maintaining that Ahern's accountant admitted that he both failed to pay at least $459,000 to Scholz and mischaracterized an advance from a foreign sub-publisher as a loan.   Under the jury instructions, Scholz argues, these factors preclude the jury from finding that Scholz breached the FMA, or at least from awarding Ahern any royalties.   These contentions have been dismissed in our discussion above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Scholz raises a new factor:  he argues that the jury's verdict and the extremely short period of deliberations--one and a half hours<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> following fifteen days of testimony--reveal that the jury ignored the court's instructions and rendered an erroneous and inconsistent verdict.   He cites the fact that one of the jurors planned to go on a cruise two days after the date of the verdict as proof that the jury was in a hurry to finish its deliberations.   The jury's questions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Scholz adds, demonstrates that it was determined to award Ahern $547,000 regardless of who was in breach.   Between the insufficient evidence and the perfunctory deliberations, Scholz concludes, the district court had an affirmative duty to grant a new trial.   He seeks support for his argument in Kearns v. Keystone Shipping Co., 863 F.2d 177 (1st Cir.1988), where this Circuit held that a brief jury deliberation--one hour and eighteen minutes, following a three-day trial--coupled with a verdict contrary to the great weight of the evidence created a situation where the district court had an affirmative duty to set aside the verdict.  Id. at 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain unswayed.   Scholz' reliance on Kearns is misplaced.   There, the court explicitly required that the brief deliberation be paired with a verdict contrary to the weight of the evidence, noting that \" '[i]f the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict, the length of time the jury deliberates is immaterial.' \"  Kearns, 863 F.2d at 182 (quoting Marx v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., 321 F.2d 70, 71 (5th Cir.1963)).   We have already determined that, here, there was evidence sufficient to support the verdict.   Therefore, Scholz is merely left with a complaint that the jury should have deliberated longer.   His complaint is easily defeated, as \"no rule requires a jury to deliberate for any set length of time.\"  United States v.

Indeed, we have previously upheld a verdict on thirty-two counts which was reached in four hours, following a trial that lasted five weeks, incorporating more than fifty witnesses and hundreds of exhibits.  Penagaricano-Soler, 911 F.2d at 846;  see also United States v. Anderson, 561 F.2d 1301, 1303 (9th Cir.)

Cf. Clark v. Moran, 942 F.2d 24, 32 (1st Cir.1991) (refusing to impute reasonable doubt of guilt or of witnesses' credibility from fact that jury deliberation was lengthy or from questions asked).   Finally, we note that the jury's task was relatively simple.   Although it heard complex testimony and was asked to weigh detailed evidence, the district court had already dismissed as a matter of law all the claims except for the respective contract claims, and the sums at issue had been clearly defined in the evidence and closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ENGEL'S TESTIMONY AT TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, Engel, Scholz' lead counsel, was called by both parties as a witness.   Maintaining that Ahern called Engel as an expert witness, instead of a percipient witness, Scholz now argues that the district court committed prejudicial error by, first, permitting Ahern to do so, and second, by refusing to allow follow-up questioning by Engel's co-counsel, Passin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of each of Scholz' contentions follows the same legal framework.   In each analysis, two questions face us:  first, whether the district court erred in admitting or refusing the testimony or motion;  and second, whether that error was harmful.   See Doty v. Sewall, 908 F.2d 1053, 1057 (1st Cir.1990).   Only if we answer both questions in the positive will Scholz' argument on appeal prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court's error in an evidentiary ruling only rises to the level of harmful error if a party's substantial right is affected.   See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2111;  Fed.R.Evid. 103(a);  Lubanski v. Coleco Indus., Inc., 929 F.2d 42, 46 (1st Cir.1991).  \"In determining whether an error affected a party's substantial right, '[t]he central question is whether this court can say with fair assurance ... that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.' \"  Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46 (internal quotations omitted)).   Factors we must consider in determining whether substantial rights are implicated include both the centrality of the evidence and the prejudicial effect of its exclusion or inclusion.  Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46.   We weigh these factors in \" 'the context of the case as gleaned from the record as a whole.' \"  Id. (quoting Vincent v. Louis Marx &amp; Co., 874 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir.1989)).   We have repeatedly noted that \"no substantial right of the party is affected where the evidence omitted was cumulative as to other admitted evidence.\"  Doty, 908 F.2d at 1057.   Should a reviewing court be in \"grave doubt\" as to the likely effect an error had on the verdict, the error must be treated as if it had in fact affected the verdict.   O'Neal v. McAninch, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 994, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995) (noting that \"by 'grave doubt' we mean that, in the judge's mind, the matter is so evenly balanced as he feels himself in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that under Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a), we review the decision not only to determine whether a substantial right of the party is affected, but also to see whether a timely objection \"appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1);  see Bonilla v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 955 F.2d 150, 153 (1st Cir.1992).   Here, Scholz' counsel objected at the time of the challenged rulings.   Therefore, this element of our analysis is not at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established the legal framework, we examine each of Scholz' contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Contested Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phillips, Ahern's counsel, put Engel on the stand on the seventh day of trial.   The objected-to portion of his questioning sought testimony regarding the Scholz Statement, which purported to account to Ahern for the royalties from the third album.   In the Statement, Scholz deducted $1.7 million for legal fees charged by Engel's law firm, which the Statement listed as equivalent to half of the fees charged in relation to the negotiation of the agreement with MCA and the CBS litigation.   The immediate issue at trial was whether this deduction was permissible as a \"commercially reasonable recording expense\" deductible from the royalties under section 5.2.1 of the FMA.   Because the record is determinative of this issue, we quote it at length:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>Q.

First, he points out that Engel was not designated as an expert under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26.   See Prentiss &amp; Carlisle Co. v. Koehring-Waterous Div. of Timberjack, Inc., 972 F.2d 6 (1st Cir.1992) (upholding trial court's refusal to hear expert testimony from witness not designated as an expert).   Next, he maintains that under the applicable Rules of Professional Conduct, Engel should not have been required to testify against his client on an important and disputed point.   See Model Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102(B).   In turn, Ahern contends that the questions asked were not seeking Engel's expert opinion under Federal Rule of Evidence 701,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> or, in the alternative, that the district court acted within its discretion in admitting the testimony.   See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 10-11 (\"Determinations of whether a witness is sufficiently qualified to testify as an expert on a given subject and whether such expert testimony would be helpful to the trier of fact are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\");  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1183 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that manifest error standard applies to trial judge's rulings regarding expert testimony), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).   His final contention is that Scholz' complaint should be deemed waived because Scholz first injected Engel's opinion testimony into the case through his affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not consider these arguments, however, for we find that, even assuming the trial court erred in admitting the challenged section of Engel's testimony, it was not harmful error.   Essentially, the challenged evidence was that in the \"hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and more\" contracts that he has reviewed, Engel never saw \"legal fees designated in a contract as anything, and certainly not as recording costs.\"  (Day 7, page 73).   Having examined the record as a whole to determine if admitting this evidence affected Scholz' substantial rights, in accordance with our legal framework, we find that any court error did not amount to harmful error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, although the issue of whether Scholz breached the FMA was certainly a major focus of the case, and Engel's testimony related to the single largest deduction taken from the royalties on the Scholz Statement, we disagree with Scholz' contention that it was probably determinative for the jury, for several reasons.   Ames and Stewart L. Levy (\"Levy\"), who has served as Ahern's counsel in the past and who was designated an expert on the subject of the reasonableness of the attorney's fees, both testified that attorney's fees are not recording expenses or recording costs.   Ahern testified that they are not artist costs or expenses for recording purposes.   We found no testimony, besides Engel's, contesting this point.   Levy challenged the fees' inclusion on the Scholz Statement on another front as well, stating that Ahern was asked to pay for services that at times were working against his best interests, including time billed on motions to preclude a stipulation which would have had Sony or CBS dropping Ahern from the lawsuit.   In short, he stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>We start off with the proposition that here is Mr. Ahern who is not directing Mr. Scholz to jump labels, not instructing Mr. Engel to do anything.   Because Mr. Scholz decides to do what he is doing, not only does Mr. Ahern get sued by CBS, not only is Mr. Ahern's income from CBS cut off, now Mr. Scholz and his attorney, Mr. Engel, expect Mr. Ahern not only to accept that but to defray part of the cost of Mr. Engel doing this.   I find that outrageous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 7, page 95).   Engel testified that the attempt to keep Ahern in the case was not directed solely at him, but was part of an attempt to keep CBS from making deals with potential witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fees were not disputed solely on the basis of the appropriateness of their deduction.   Levy testified at length that the fees themselves were unreasonable.   He testified that he felt that Engel's firm</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>did the work without any regard to any kind of budget, without any cap on their work.   Then they turned around and said, he said we had carte blanche....  Suddenly when the case is over in 1990, we are told it is $3 million....  There were no parameters.   Mr. Engel did what he wanted to do.   No one was checking what he did to say it was too expensive, don't do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 7, pages 104-05).   In turn, Engel testified that the fees were higher than originally estimated because the head of CBS personally pursued the litigation to the \"bitter end,\" despite repeated attempts to settle.   Ultimately, he maintained, Scholz prevailed and won moneys for the entire band--and Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the attorney's fees were not the only challenged deduction on the Scholz Statement.   There was lengthy testimony questioning and defending many of the other deductions, most notably the producer's fee and the more than 11,000 hours of studio time Scholz charged for.   Therefore, even if the jury felt the deduction of the attorney's fees--or of some of them--was appropriate, they could still have reasonably found that Scholz materially breached the FMA.   Between the additional evidence, on both sides, as to whether the legal fees could be commercially reasonable recording expenses, whether the amount of fees charged were reasonable, and whether other deductions on the Statement were reasonable, we find that Engel's challenged testimony was not central to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the evidence admitted did not have an unduly prejudicial effect.   When called to the stand by his co-counsel, Engel was able to clarify that, while he felt he was asked about \"recording costs,\" the FMA actually addresses \"recording expenses\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>Q. Does the--The first question, does the further modification use the term \"recording costs\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>A. My recollection is, the [F]irst Modification Agreement uses the term \"recording expenses.\"   I was asked about recording costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>Q. Do recording contracts use the term \"recording expenses\" or \"recording costs\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>A. I, in all the recording contracts I've seen, in many of them, I don't remember the term \"recording expenses\" ever used, it's always \"recording costs\" that I've seen in the clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 13, pages 110-112).   He followed up on this in his closing argument, stating that \"[q]uestions were asked about recording costs, but recording costs is not the word used [in the FMA].\"  (Day 15, page 18).   We find that this additional testimony by Engel counters the potential prejudicial effect of his challenged statement.   Scholz argues on appeal that the prejudicial effect of the testimony was compounded by the statement of Ahern's counsel in his closing argument that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>there is no testimony before you, ladies and gentlemen, that legal costs in litigation that Mr. Scholz was in is a recording cost.   In fact, to the contrary, the only testimony here has been that legal costs--legal fees and legal costs are not recording costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>You may recall Mr. Engel uncomfortably on the witness stand, after I qualified him on his expertise in matters of this sort, acknowledging that this was the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 15, page 45).   However, between the totality of the evidence at trial and the additional statements Engel himself made, both as witness and as counsel, we do not feel that this reference to Engel in the hour spent in closing argument by Ahern's counsel could be found to sway the jury's decision, prompting harmful error.   See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Omitted Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz contends that the district court made a separate harmful error in upholding the objections made by Ahern's trial counsel when Engel's co-counsel called Engel to the stand on the thirteenth day of trial and tried to have him address his earlier testimony.   After stating that the FMA used the term \"recording expenses,\" not \"recording costs,\" and reading out the pertinent section of the FMA, Engel's testimony continued as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>Q.

We disagree.   The first time Engel testified, he was asked about \"contracts of performing artists and groups in the musical field.\"  (Day 7, page 71).   He stated in the disputed testimony that he had \"never seen legal fees designated in a contract as anything, and certainly not as recording costs.\"  (Day 7, page 73 (emphasis added)).   When next called to the stand, Engel agreed that he had seen \"contracts using only [the] words 'recording costs' where artists were paid for legal fees.\"  (Day 13, page 112).   The court's decision to sustain the objection made by Ahern's counsel in the ensuing dialogue was not a refusal to allow Engel to explain his evidence on the basis of its prejudicial effect against Ahern:  it was evidently a reaction to the apparent inconsistency between these statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, on appeal Scholz maintains that Engel's co-counsel was not allowed to \"cross-examine\" him on the subject of his direct testimony for Ahern, thereby precluding him from presenting clarifying evidence or diminishing the \"sting\" of an attorney testifying against his own client.   This error compounded the error of admitting Engel's expert testimony, Scholz contends.   He complains that because of the court's ruling, the jury never got to hear Engel's testimony regarding other types of contracts, such as agreements between performers and managers, or the difference between \"recording costs\" and \"recording expenses.\"   Nor did they hear his explanation that his answer might differ if asked about \"commercially reasonable recording expenses,\" not \"recording costs,\" he notes.   We view this final protest with some skepticism, however, in light of Engel's testimony on the stand that he had never seen legal fees designated \"as anything,\" which would, presumably, include commercially reasonable recording expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that Engel would have made the above testimony and that the district court erred in excluding the line of questioning, any resulting error was harmless.   First, for the same reasons outlined above, the testimony, while related to a central issue, was not central in and of itself.   Ames and Levy stated that they saw no difference between \"recording costs\" and \"recording expenses.\"   Additional testimony debated the total amount of fees charged as well as many other aspects of the Scholz Statement.   As for the potential prejudicial effect, the testimony Engel was able to give, quoted above, made it clear that his earlier statement was directed to \"recording costs,\" not \"recording expenses,\" an argument he reiterated in his closing, mitigating the potential effect of the apparent inconsistency.   Additionally, during his first day on the stand Engel stated, in response to questioning about the actual charging of recording costs or expenses by a group or a performing artist, that although he reviews accountings after the fact, he has never reviewed an accounting like that provided in the Scholz Statement.   He testified that \"[t]his is a special case.   I don't remember any accounting that really falls into this category.   This is not a standard contract.\"  (Day 7, page 81).   While this testimony does not go directly to his prior statements, it does emphasize that the FMA is not a standard contract, implying that his and others' statements about other contracts may not be pertinent.   Weighing the above in the light of the record as a whole, see Doty, 908 F.2d at 1057, we cannot say that the court's evidentiary ruling excluded evidence that was either central or prejudicial in its effect such that it could have swayed the factfinders' decision.   Thus, even if the court erred, it did not rise to the level of harmful error.   See Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Overall Impact of Engel's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, it is not just the impact of the information elicited from Engel that we must evaluate under the harmless error standard.   We must also address the potential prejudicial effect on the jury of seeing Engel, Scholz' counsel, take the stand, dispute with the court and opposing counsel over his testimony, and finally make a statement, apparently unwillingly, against his client's interest--a statement against which, he argues, he had to take an apparently inconsistent position in his closing argument.   There is no doubt in our mind that this had some prejudicial effect on the jury.   Nonetheless, we cannot say with \" 'fair assurance ... that the judgment was [ ] substantially swayed by the error.' \"  Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 9 (quoting Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46).   The jury sat through fifteen days of trial, received substantial and often cumulative testimony on all points,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and heard an hour of closing argument from each party's counsel.   We find it highly unlikely that the verdict could have been the result of Engel's questioning and the attendant commentary.   Cf. United States v. Rosales, 19 F.3d 763, 768 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that prosecutor's inappropriate argument in closing did not warrant new trial under harmless error standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are significant reasons why trial counsel should not be able to testify at trial, no matter for which party counsel testifies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p>The principal ethical considerations to a lawyer testifying on behalf of his client regarding contested issues are that the client's case will \"be presented through the testimony of an obviously interested witness who is subject to impeachment on that account;  and that the advocate is, in effect, put in the unseemly position of arguing his own credibility.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., 141 F.R.D. 393, 396 (D.Mass.1992) (quoting ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 339 (1975)).  \"Combining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the opposing party and can involve a conflict of interest between lawyer and client.\"   Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3.7 cmt. 1.   When the attorney is called to the stand by his client's opponent, the concerns are just as substantial, if not more.   See Siguel, 141 F.R.D. at 396 (\"Although there are degrees of adverse testimony, there are few, if any, situations that justify acceptance or continued employment in this circumstance.\").   Accordingly, Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7 states that a lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial where he or she is likely to be a necessary witness, except, among other things, where the testimony relates to an uncontested issue or disqualification of the attorney would work substantial hardship on the client.   Finally, there is also the danger that the performance of the dual roles of counsel and witness will create confusion on the jury's part as to when the attorney is speaking as a witness, \"raising the possibility of the trier according testimonial credit to the prosecutor's closing argument,\" United States v. Johnston, 690 F.2d 638, 643 (7th Cir.1982)--or, conversely, weighing the testimony as if it were argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All these concerns clearly come into play at a more heightened level when trial counsel acts as an expert.   However, when counsel is asked to play that role for the length of one question in a fifteen-day trial, even acknowledging the impact of the attendant discussion with the court, attempts to examine him on the testimony and references to it in the closing arguments, we cannot hold that it rises to the level of harmful error affecting a party's substantial right where the testimony is cumulative and not a central part of the case.   Any prejudice that resulted from the objected-to portions of Engel's testimony did not rise to the level of harmful error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Scholz opposed, and the district court refused, both motions.   When the parties presented their lists of witnesses, Engel appeared on both parties' lists.   Approximately six weeks before trial was scheduled to begin, Ahern filed a third motion to disqualify.   This time Scholz agreed to withdraw his counsel provided that he was given time to find new lead counsel.   In his memorandum in support of his motion, Scholz stated that he \"now [felt] he must retain new trial counsel in this matter, to avoid the risk of a disqualification of his counsel just prior to the trial, and for other reasons.\"  (Scholz' Memorandum in Support of His Motion to Continue Trial, page 3).   The district court, however, denied both Ahern's Renewed Motion to Disqualify and Scholz' Motion to Continue Trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, Scholz maintains in his brief on appeal that the trial court erred by allowing Ahern to use Engel as his own expert against Scholz.   One of the four contentions he uses to support this position is that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p>the trial court itself placed Scholz in his precarious predicament when it refused to grant the last motion by Ahern to disqualify Engel....  The failure to grant the continuance under these circumstances, which resulted in severe prejudice to Scholz, is, itself, reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Appellant's Brief, page 34).   In support of his statement, Scholz cites several cases weighing district court decisions on motions for continuances.   See Lowe v. City of East Chicago, 897 F.2d 272, 274-75 (7th Cir.1990) (concluding that it was an abuse of discretion to deny motion for continuance where plaintiff was faced with choice between voluntary dismissal and going to trial although his attorney was not ready for trial);  United States v. Flynt, 756 F.2d 1352, 1358-59 (9th Cir.)  (finding that district court abused its discretion in denying motion for continuance where doing so effectively foreclosed defendant from presenting a defense), amended, 764 F.2d 675 (9th Cir.1985).   We need not prolong our discussion.   Simply put, we do not feel the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.   Even if it did, the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that while we ultimately hold that the court did not commit harmful error in making its evidentiary ruling, we find it very disturbing that trial counsel testified in this case.   In making his appeal, Scholz directs us to a series of cases, several of which are referenced above, which lay out the real and serious concerns implicated by allowing counsel to testify at trial.   See, e.g., United States v. Dack, 747 F.2d 1172, 1172 n. 5 (7th Cir.1984) (\"Where evidence is easily available from other sources and absent 'extraordinary circumstances' or 'compelling reasons,' an attorney who participates in the case should not be called as a witness.\").   We ask whether Scholz and his counsel read these cases before opposing Ahern's first two motions to disqualify.   The concerns the cases voice are implicated whether counsel testifies for his or her own client or for the opposing party.   What is more, even if Engel testified solely as to ministerial matters, we still doubt the wisdom of allowing him on the stand, as the matter of his firm's legal fees--not only whether, as a whole, they were commercially reasonable recording expenses but also whether they were reasonable at all--was a matter of testimony.   The jury heard deposition testimony from Ahern's expert Levy that the legal fees from the CBS litigation were, among other things, \"excessive and totally inappropriate\" (Day 7, page 86);  whether Engel was called to the stand by Scholz or Ahern, indeed, even had he never testified, his integrity and judgment could have been questioned by the factfinders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p>COUNTERCLAIM FOR FRAUD AND DECEIT AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Further Modification Agreement provided that Ahern was entitled to a share of the royalties of any album completed before October 24, 1984.   Had the parties adhered to this provision, Ahern would not be entitled to any moneys from the third album, as it was completed after that date.   Instead, Scholz waived the deadline, conveying his waiver through communications between the parties' attorneys in May of 1984.   In this action, Scholz drew on his waiver of the deadline in his third counterclaim and several of his affirmative defenses to argue for rescission of the waiver agreement on the grounds of fraud and deceit and, alternatively, its invalidation.   On appeal before us, he appeals the district court's directed verdict against him on these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review is a familiar one.

Under New York law, applied here pursuant to the FMA choice of law provision, a party seeking to prove common law fraud must show that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p>(1) the [cross-]defendant made a material false representation, (2) the [cross-] defendant intended to defraud the [cross-] plaintiff thereby, (3) the [cross-] plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representation, and (4) the [cross-]plaintiff suffered damage as a result of such reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Banque Arabe et Internationale D'Investissement v.

The first element may be met by demonstrating not only a misrepresentation, but also a concealment or nondisclosure of a material fact.   See Allen v. WestPoint-Pepperell, Inc., 945 F.2d 40, 44 (2d Cir.1991);  Bickhardt v. Ratner, 871 F.Supp. 613, 618 (S.D.N.Y.1994).   In addition, the party claiming fraudulent concealment must demonstrate that the opposing party had a duty to disclose the material information in question and demonstrate each element of the claim by clear and convincing evidence.   See Banque Arabe et Internationale D'Investissement, 57 F.3d at 153.   We begin our analysis by weighing what duty Ahern owed Scholz, and then turn to the elements listed above, ultimately concluding that the district court erred in directing a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, Scholz argues that Ahern owed Scholz a duty to disclose because he was a fiduciary.   See Brass v. American Film Techs., 987 F.2d 142, 150 (2d Cir.1993).   Ahern contests that at the time the waiver was given in May 1984, the Management Agreement had terminated and so there was no fiduciary duty and, thus, no duty to disclose.  \"Under New York law, a fiduciary relationship includes 'both technical fiduciary relations and those informal relations which exist whenever one [person] trusts in, and relies upon, another.' \"  Allen, 945 F.2d at 45 (quoting Penato v. George, 52 A.D.2d 939, 383 N.Y.S.2d 900, 904-05 (1976));  see Apple Records, Inc. v. Capitol Records, Inc., 137 A.D.2d 50, 529 N.Y.S.2d 279, 283 (1988) (noting that fiduciary relationship can be found between close friends or where confidence is based upon prior business dealings).  \"New York courts typically focus on whether one person has reposed trust or confidence in another who thereby gains a resulting superiority or influence over the first.\"  Litton Inds., Inc. v.

Capitol Records, Inc., where the court found that plaintiffs, the New York corporation of the Beatles, stated a claim that a fiduciary relationship existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p>The business dealings between Capitol Records and the Beatles date back to 1962, when the still unacclaimed Beatles entrusted their musical talents to defendant Capitol records.   It is alleged that this relationship proved so profitable to defendant that at one point the Beatles constituted 25 to 30 percent of its business.   Even after the Beatles attained their remarkable degree of popularity and success, they still continued to rely on Capitol Records for the manufacture and distributing of their recordings.   It can be said that from such a long enduring relationship was borne a special relationship of trust and confidence, one which existed independent of the contractual duties, and one which plaintiffs argue was betrayed by fraud....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">529 N.Y.S.2d at 283.   Like the parties in Apple Records, at the time of the waiver in 1984 Ahern and Scholz had a long history of business dealings, marked by a series of agreements and modification agreements.   Also as in that case, the relationship between the parties here was a profitable one for Ahern.   However, unlike that case, Ahern no longer, as of several years previously, was Scholz' manager.   Indeed, Scholz testified that in 1978, when he first started the process that culminated in the FMA, he was no longer on speaking terms with Ahern.   While we do not doubt--and Ahern admitted at trial--that Ahern had a fiduciary duty to Scholz until 1981, the question remains whether there was such a special relationship of trust and confidence between the parties at the time of the waiver that a fiduciary relationship, at least as regards Ahern's duty to pay Scholz' share of the royalties from the first and second albums, remained.   Since a reasonable juror could find that it did, however, a directed verdict is inappropriate on the question of whether Ahern owed Scholz a fiduciary duty.   Therefore, we continue our analysis and turn to the evidence presented on the elements listed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as for the material false misrepresentation or nondisclosure, it is undisputed that Ahern did not disclose his failure to pay, a fact which a reasonable juror could easily find material.   On the other hand, both Ahern and Barbara Sherry (\"Sherry\"), who provided business management services for Ahern and BOSTON while Ames served as their business manager and served as Ahern's business manager from 1982 up through the time of trial, testified that they were not aware money was owed until after the waiver was made, and Scholz points to no evidence of concealment.   Second, Scholz would have us read an intent to deceive into Sherry's testimony agreeing with Engel's statement that today, looking at a royalty statement from the company charged with administrating the publishing, \"it's immediately plain to anyone who knows this business, that [the administration company] was not paying\" the proper percentage to Scholz.  (Day 6, pages 61-62).   Scholz cannot rely on this as an admission that Sherry knew Scholz was not receiving all his moneys, however, since her actual testimony was that she did not know of the failure at the time.   Instead, he seeks to build on her admission that one could have known from the face of the royalty statements that there was an error, as well as the fact that there was no evidence that letters of direction were prepared for the foreign sub-publishers, to support his contention that Ahern \"had to have known\" he was not making all his payments.   Ahern presented no evidence indicating that he could not have known of the error, just that he did not.   In essence, therefore, determining whether Ahern intended to deceive Scholz becomes an issue of credibility, one which of necessity is a question for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for whether Scholz reasonably relied on Ahern's nondisclosure, his case is damaged by the fact that the evidence is undisputed that Ahern did not actually solicit the waiver.   Scholz' attorney contacted his counsel and offered it to him.   Scholz explained his motivation at trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>A.  Well, I figured if I, if I finished the record six months later and I missed that date that Paul Ahern was entitled to his 12 percent of the royalties, you know, I missed that date and then six months later delivered the record, I was sure he would be upset about that and, and want his 12 percent anyway, and I didn't want to fight with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p>Q. And was it your intention at that time--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p>A.  I had enough trouble at that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p>Q. And did you ask for anything in return for that waiver?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p>A. No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 10, pages 38-39).   However, Scholz points to his testimony at trial that he \"obviously\" would not have agreed to the waiver had he known of Ahern's failure to pay him publishing royalties as evidence of his reliance.   Giving Scholz the benefit of all the inferences, a reasonable juror could find under these circumstances that Ahern sought to induce Scholz into a fraudulent agreement, once it had been offered to him, through nondisclosure of his failure to pay.   The presence of the fourth element, damages, Scholz contends, is witnessed by the fact that he now owes Ahern money:  had he not waived the deadline, Ahern would not have been entitled to royalties from the third album.   Given all of the above, we find that Scholz has mustered sufficient evidence for the issue to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Invalidation of the Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his Fourth and Fifth Affirmative Defenses, Scholz argues that the waiver should be invalidated because he did not knowingly give his consent.   He maintains here that in order to prevail, all he must prove is that he would not have agreed to the waiver if he had known of Ahern's failure to account to and pay him royalties.   Since he testified to that effect, he argues, the district court erred in granting a directed verdict.   We disagree.   First, we note that none of the cases Scholz looks to for support discuss invalidation as an affirmative defense under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c).   Although the case law indicates that there is precedent for such an affirmative defense, see, e.g., United States v. Krieger, 773 F.Supp. 580, 583 (S.D.N.Y.1991) (denying summary judgment on, inter alia, claim for invalidity of guarantees despite failure to claim it as an affirmative defense), we have found, and the parties present, no comprehensive discussion of its nature.   See 2A James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 8.27 n.6 (2d ed.1995) (listing most common affirmative defenses, excluding invalidity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no other support for Scholz' position in the cases he cites.  Allen, which he looks to for the proposition that all he has to prove is that he would not have agreed to the waiver, does not address invalidity of a waiver or release.   Rather, it notes that a court may rescind a release \" 'where it finds either mutual mistake or one party's unilateral mistake coupled with some fraud ... of the other party.' \"  Allen, 945 F.2d at 44 (quoting National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Walton Ins. Ltd., 696 F.Supp. 897, 902 (S.D.N.Y.1988)).   Scholz did not plead mutual mistake, and his rescission claim based on fraud is addressed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz states that he does not have to show Ahern owed him a fiduciary duty in order to state a claim for invalidation.   Indeed, the court in Allen notes that where one party has superior knowledge not available to the other party, a duty to disclose may arise, apparently exclusive of a fiduciary duty, id. at 45, but Scholz does not point to any evidence that he could not have discovered that Ahern had not been paying him.   His reliance on Gishen v. Dura Corp., 362 Mass. 177, 285 N.E.2d 117 (1972), apparently for the proposition that \"[a] party cannot waive information with respect to an error in calculation whose existence is unknown to him, particularly where his ignorance is caused by the very lack of disclosure in question and where the parties are not fully at arm's length,\" id. 285 N.E.2d at 122, is misplaced.   First and most importantly, under the choice-of-law provision of the FMA, the parties here are applying New York, not Massachusetts, law.   Second, the Gishen opinion addressed a request for a jury instruction on waiver, which was denied because the party had not previously presented the argument;  it does not involve an affirmative defense.  Id. at 121.   The quoted language is dicta--and seems to undercut Scholz' proposition that a fiduciary relationship is not necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz' citation to Werking v. Amity Estates, Inc., 2 N.Y.2d 43, 155 N.Y.S.2d 633, 137 N.E.2d 321 (1956), also proves unfruitful.   There, the court defines a waiver as \" 'the intentional relinquishment of a known right with both knowledge of its existence and an intention to relinquish it.' \"  Id. 155 N.Y.S.2d at 639, 137 N.E.2d at 327 (quoting Whitney on Contracts 273 (4th ed.1946)).   The court found the waiver in question, of jurisdictional defects in a tax sale of plaintiff's farm, invalid because plaintiff \"had no knowledge of the right he is charged with having knowingly and intentionally relinquished.\"  Id.

More specifically, it held that the Scholz Statement regarding the royalties on the third album constituted an unfair and deceptive business practice, and that it was a \"deliberate and blatant attempt to deprive Plaintiff Ahern of moneys rightfully due and owing to him.\"  (District Court Memorandum and Order, page 3).

The District Court's Findings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that Scholz had violated sections 2 and 11 through his failure to pay Ahern royalties from the third album, and made the following findings in its Memorandum and Order.   First, it found that Scholz agreed to pay Ahern royalties after deduction of only a producer's royalty and all commercially reasonable recording expenses.   Second, the court held that the Scholz Statement constituted an unfair and deceptive business practice.   More specifically, it found that the deductions taken for legal fees, payment to Jeff Dorenfeld, time spent in the studio, and the resulting recording costs were all not commercially reasonable recording expenses.   Rather, the court stated, $500,000 in recording expenses would be commercially reasonable.   It next found that Scholz' Statement was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p>a deliberate and blatant attempt to deprive the Plaintiff Ahern of monies rightfully due and owing to him as royalties from the sales of the third BOSTON album.   Such egregious conduct ... is patently an unfair and deceptive practice.   The submission of [the Scholz Statement] as an accounting by Scholz to Ahern is a shocking display of arrogant disdain for Ahern's contractual rights and was rendered in obvious bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(District Court Memorandum and Order, page 3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz challenges the sufficiency of these findings.   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) mandates that courts \"find the facts specially and state separately [their] conclusions of law thereon\" when trying facts without a jury.   See, e.g., Montanez v. Bagg, 24 Mass.App.Ct. 954, 510 N.E.2d 298, 300 (1987) (noting that judge did not make detailed findings of fact regarding Chapter 93A claims under Mass.  R. Civ. P. 52(a)).   Scholz notes that the court did not state that the deductions were actually deceptive, and reminds us that the Scholz Statement set forth in some detail what each of the deductions were.   Since the court did not make more specific findings as to unfair or deceptive practices, he maintains, we should reverse the Chapter 93A finding against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  See Schwanbeck, 578 N.E.2d at 803 (holding that district court finding of Chapter 93A violation lacked foundation in the court's subsidiary findings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we remind Scholz that under Rule 52(a) \"the judge need only make brief, definite pertinent findings and conclusions on the contested matters.\"  Makuc v. American Honda Motor Co., 835 F.2d 389, 394 (1st Cir.1987).   Here, the district court found that Scholz breached the FMA, that four of his deductions were commercially unreasonable, while a figure of $0.5 million would be reasonable;  and that the Scholz Statement was \"a deliberate and blatant attempt to deprive\" Ahern of moneys owed him.   It is a question of law whether this attempt to deprive Ahern rises to the level of a violation of Chapter 93A, as the lower court held, and we believe the decision includes enough of a basis for the Chapter 93A finding to save the decision from remand.   The district court has provided us with more than mere conclusions.   See Sidney Binder, Inc., 552 N.E.2d at 572 (holding that explanatory findings were necessary where court merely recited the evidence without making findings and concluded that \"neither party ha[d] sustained its burden of proof\" that Chapter 93A had been violated).   We note, however, that our task would have been much simpler in this and other issues had the district court seen fit to explicate more of its decision-making on paper.   There is a gap between finding that deductions are commercially unreasonable and finding that the Scholz Statement as a whole is an attempt to deprive Ahern deserving of the modifiers \"unfair\" and \"deceptive\":  while we are willing to follow the lower court across the distance between them, a bridge would have been more than welcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Scholz' Challenge to the Chapter 93A Findings</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having set forth our standard of review and the findings of the district court, we turn to the heart of Scholz' challenge to the Chapter 93A award.   As noted above, whether an act was unfair and/or deceptive is a question of fact.   Based on our review of the evidence, we do not hesitate to find that the district court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and we will not disturb them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  See United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 26 Mass.App.Ct. 847, 533 N.E.2d 647, 653 (1989), aff'd, 406 Mass. 811, 551 N.E.2d 20 (1990).   Thus, we assess the lower court's award under Chapter 93A in the light of its finding that four deductions--which totalled $4.2 million--were not reasonable, but $0.5 million would be commercially reasonable recording costs, and that the Scholz Statement was a deliberate attempt to deprive Ahern of his percentage of the royalties from the third album.   We ask now whether these facts rise to the level of a violation of Chapter 93A, section 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no clear definition of what conduct constitutes an \"unfair or deceptive\" act.

In evaluating whether an act or practice is unfair, we assess \"the equities between the parties,\" including what both parties knew or should have known.  Swanson v.

See, e.g., Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 821 (1991).   The simple fact that a party knowingly breached a contract does not raise the breach to the level of a Chapter 93A violation, however.   Cf. Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co., 754 F.2d at 18 (stating that \"mere breaches of contract, without more, do not violate [C]hapter 93A.\").   In the breach of contract context, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has \"said that conduct 'in disregard of known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party constitutes an unfair act or practice for [Chapter] 93A purposes.\"  Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 821;  see Wang Labs., Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc., 398 Mass. 854, 501 N.E.2d 1163, 1165 (1986).   Relying on the Appeals Court of Massachusetts' decision in Atkinson v. Rosenthal, 33 Mass.App.Ct. 219, 598 N.E.2d 666 (1992), Scholz seeks to limit this test.   There, the court examined a series of breach of contract cases and concluded that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p>[t]here is in those cases a constant pattern of the use of a breach of contract as a lever to obtain advantage for the party committing the breach in relation to the other party;  i.e., the breach of contract has an extortionate quality that gives it the rancid flavor of unfairness.   In the absence of conduct having that quality, a failure to perform obligations under a written lease, even though deliberate and for reasons of self-interest, does not present an occasion for invocation of [Chapter] 93A remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 598 N.E.2d at 670-71 (citation omitted).   We have not addressed, and find no Massachusetts case law addressing, whether this language from Atkinson extends beyond its immediate context to limit award of Chapter 93A damages in breach of contract cases to cases with an \"extortionate quality.\"   See NASCO, Inc. v. Public Storage, Inc., 29 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Atkinson and accepting, arguendo, that \"in a breach of contract situation, liability does not attach under [Chapter] 93A, section 11 unless a defendant knowingly breached a contact in order to secure additional benefits to itself to the detriment of a plaintiff.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not do so today, however.   First, if we accept the test for Chapter 93A violation Scholz claims Atkinson frames, the district court's award here will not stand because there has not been an extortionate element to the breach:  Scholz tried to hold on to Ahern's money, but he was not using the breach \"to force [Ahern] to do what otherwise [he] would not be legally required to do.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co., 754 F.2d at 18 (affirming Chapter 93A award where defendant withheld payment as a \"wedge\" to force plaintiff to supply more products);  see, e.g., Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 822 (holding that withholding approval as a pretext to force party into changing price of underlying contract violated Chapter 93A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if we were to find that Atkinson does not limit Chapter 93A liability to cases with an extortionate element, but rather address Scholz' acts under the test as stated in Anthony's Pier Four, we still find that Chapter 93A has not been violated.   That test asks whether there has been conduct \" 'in disregard of known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party.\"  Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 821;  see Wang Labs., 501 N.E.2d at 1165 (finding liability under Chapter 93A where interference with contract \"constituted a willful act calculated to obtain the benefits of [the] contract ... without cost and in disregard of known contractual arrangements\").   Here, the court found that Scholz knowingly breached the contract in order to gain a benefit--Ahern's share of the royalties.   But that would be true of any knowing breach of a contract.   The question, then, is whether the level of \"rascality\" is sufficient to rise to the level of a violation of Chapter 93A.   We find it is not.   First, while the deductions that the court deemed commercially unreasonable ate up more than half of the royalties reported, we note that Scholz did not seek to conceal the nature of the deductions:  he laid them out on the Scholz Statement in varying levels of detail.   Next, while Scholz has an extensive degree of control over the moneys from the third album, there has been no allegation that he did not report all of the royalties from MCA on the Scholz Statement.   Evidence was presented that the number of hours spent on the album was reconstructed after the fact, but the district court did not find that the figures given were inaccurate, just that they were not deductible.   Scholz' breach amounted to more than a dispute over the commercial reasonableness of certain deductions, as he would have us believe.   Nonetheless, his acts did not rise to the level of rascality required for Chapter 93A liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Ultimately, therefore, we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in finding Scholz violated Chapter 93A, and reverse that holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND ATTORNEY'S FEES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have found that Scholz did not violate Chapter 93A, we need not address the parties' arguments regarding the award of attorney's fees under that statute.   Nor do we weigh Ahern's cross-appeal of the district court's refusal to award prejudgment interest, since that is based on his Chapter 93A contention.   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   231 &#167; 6C (\"interest shall be added ... to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve percent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.\").

Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 687 F.2d 108 (5th Cir.1982) (upholding district court's grant of motion for new trial on grounds of unfair surprise due to testimony from surprise expert witness).   Since we find that the testimony was not in fact highly prejudicial to Scholz, this sparsely drawn alternative argument fails</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We note in passing that we are skeptical both of Ahern's claim that Engel was not called as an expert and of Scholz' position that Engel was surprised at being questioned as an expert, in light of the following discussion, held immediately before Engel took the stand:</p>\n        <p>MR. ENGEL:  ... The other thing is this delicate situation.   I'm an expert witness, right?</p>\n        <p>MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.</p>\n        <p>MR.

Despite Scholz' protestations in his brief that the reference to Engel as an expert must be a misstatement by Engel, an error by the court reporter, or based on something outside the reporter's hearing, it seems apparent to us that both parties foresaw the possibility of expert testimony being elicited.   Indeed, the court's statement above suggests that it based its later ruling on the same premise.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the evidence was so redundant that the court was prompted to exclaim that</p>\n        <p>in all my years, I have never seen a case in which the same matters have come up so many times.

However, the district court's findings do not discuss Scholz' conduct in defending this lawsuit, either by reference or as a basis for its conclusions.   We refuse to move as far afield from the district court's findings in order to find extortionate conduct as Ahern requests.   His reliance on the court's discussion of the defendant's litigation practices in Quaker State is misplaced, because there the defendant's prosecution of the counterclaims was raised in the complaint, and was addressed by the district court below.  884 F.2d at 1513-14</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Both parties devote sections of their briefs to six \"factors\" related to Scholz' \"rascality\" which Scholz raises, and Ahern disputes.

The appeal is from a final judgment by the district court after a jury trial, disposing of all claims in respect to all parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND:  A BAND OUT OF BOSTON</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the parties dispute many of the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them.   Thus we start with a sketch of the basic facts, and address the individual issues in more detail below.   Appellant and cross-appellee Donald Thomas Scholz (\"Scholz\") is a musician, composer, and record producer who was, and is, a member of the musical group BOSTON (\"BOSTON\").   In late 1975, Scholz entered into three agreements with appellee and cross-appellant Paul F. Ahern (\"Ahern\"), who was engaged in the business of promoting and managing music groups, and his then partner, Charles McKenzie (\"McKenzie\") (collectively, the \"1975 Agreements\").   First, Scholz made a recording agreement (the \"Recording Agreement\") with Ahern and McKenzie d/b/a P.C. Productions, to which Bradley Delp, the lead singer of BOSTON, was also a party.   Second was a management agreement (the \"Management Agreement\"), also between Scholz and P.C. Productions, under which Ahern and McKenzie were appointed Scholz' exclusive personal managers worldwide.   The third agreement was a songwriter agreement made between Scholz and Ahern, under which Scholz was obligated to furnish Ahern his exclusive songwriting services for a period of five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1976, CBS Records (\"CBS\") and Ahern Associates, a business name of Ahern and McKenzie, entered into a recording agreement for the exclusive recording services of BOSTON.   The group's first album (the \"first album\") was released in 1976, and sold approximately 11 million copies--one of the highest-selling debut albums ever.   Its second album (the \"second album\") was released in August 1978, and sold approximately 6 million copies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1978, Scholz and the other members of BOSTON entered into a modification agreement with Ahern and P.C. Productions, dated April 24, 1978.   Among other things, the First Modification Agreement modified the 1975 Agreements and changed the financial relationship between Scholz and his managers.   Ahern and McKenzie dissolved their partnership.   A few years later, in May of 1981, Ahern and Scholz, individually and under various business names, entered into a further modification agreement (the \"Further Modification Agreement\" or \"FMA\"), which is at the heart of this dispute.   Ahern ceased to be Scholz' manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, with the third album not yet released, CBS cut off the payment of royalties generated from the first and second albums.   In 1983, CBS brought suit against Scholz, Ahern, and the members of BOSTON for failure to timely deliver record albums.   Scholz' counsel in that action was Donald S. Engel (\"Engel\");  Ahern had his own counsel.   While that litigation was pending, the third album was released by MCA Records (\"MCA\") in 1986 and sold well over 4 million copies.   At the close of trial--seven years after the CBS litigation began--the jury found that Scholz was not in breach of contract.   Scholz incurred legal fees of about $3.4 million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1991, Ahern commenced this action against Scholz for breach of the FMA claiming a failure to pay royalties due under the third album.   Scholz asserted various affirmative defenses and counterclaims against Ahern, including breach of the FMA.   During trial, Engel, Scholz' lead trial counsel, was twice called as a witness.   At the close of the evidence, the court granted Scholz' directed verdict dismissing Ahern's Count III for fraud and IV for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   The court also granted Ahern's motion for directed verdict dismissing Scholz' First, Second, and Third Counterclaims and his, Third, Fourth, and Fifth affirmative defenses.   Only the parties' respective breach of contract claims went to the jury.   The jury found that Scholz breached section 5.2.1 of the FMA to pay Ahern royalties from the third album, and found that Ahern had not breached the FMA to account for and pay Scholz royalties due from the first and second albums.   It awarded Ahern $547,007 in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sitting without a jury also found Scholz had breached the FMA, and heard Ahern's Count II for declaratory relief and Count V for violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   93A and Scholz' Fifth Counterclaim for recision of contract for failure to obtain a license.   The court denied the declaratory relief Ahern sought in Count I, and awarded him costs, interest and attorney's fees pursuant to Count V for violation of Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   93A &#167;&#167; 2 &amp; 11.   The court denied the relief sought by Scholz in his Fifth Counterclaim and held that he waived his Counts VI and VII at oral argument.   After a hearing on Ahern's bill of costs and application for reasonable attorney's fees and interest, the court awarded Ahern $265,000 in attorney's fees and $135,000 in costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied, without a hearing, Scholz' motion for a new trial, motion to amend the court's memorandum and order and judgment entered thereon, motion to admit new evidence, and motion to amend the court's memorandum and order and the judgment entered thereon regarding Scholz' Sixth Counterclaim.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial, made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a).   We therefore review the record below to determine whether the evidence required that the district court grant the motion for a new trial.   See de Perez v. Hospital del Maestro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546215\"><a href=\"/opinion/546215/doris-velez-vda-de-perez-etc-v-hospital-del-maestro-appeal-of-dr/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1006 (1st Cir.1990).   In reviewing the record of the 16-day trial, we note that both parties presented extensive evidence.   The jury heard testimony regarding a history that spans two decades, involves at least seven contracts, includes detailed numerical accounting, and references more than half a dozen other legal battles.   The parties called a total of fifteen witnesses, seven of whom, including Ahern, Scholz, and Engel, Scholz' counsel, testified twice.   In short, the jury faced a complex and sometimes conflicting set of facts in making its decision as to whether either, neither, or both parties breached the 1981 Further Modification Agreement.   Ultimately, we find that the jury's verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Did Ahern Breach the FMA?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz argues that Ahern breached his obligations under the 1981 FMA to both account for and pay to Scholz, every six months, his share of the royalties from the compositions on the first and second albums:  indeed, Ahern admitted at trial that he had failed to make some payments he owed Scholz under the FMA.   The jury and the trial court disagreed with Scholz, however, and found that Ahern's breach of the FMA was not material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The question facing us, then, is whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that the jury's decision was not against the weight of the evidence.   After careful review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion in the lower court's decision not to disturb the jury's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz argues at some length on appeal that Ahern's breach was by definition material, both for his failure to account and his failure to pay.   As for the first contention, we note that while Scholz' reading of the FMA as requiring that Ahern render Scholz direct accountings every six months is a convincing one, it is not the only plausible one.   Indeed, Ahern contends that the FMA only required him to send irrevocable letters of direction to various entities involved directing them to send Scholz his share of the royalties when collected.   In the end, it would not be against the clear weight of the evidence to find that letters of directions would satisfy Ahern's accounting obligations under the FMA, and that such letters were sent.   Therefore, Ahern's failure to account every six months was not a material breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the second contention, Scholz supports his position that Ahern's failure to pay constitutes a separate, material breach by drawing on both New York<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and Massachusetts case law.   He points to the Second Circuit's refusal to overturn summary judgment in ARP Films, Inc. v. Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574892\"><a href=\"/opinion/574892/arp-films-inc-amerex-films-inc-and-claude-s-hill-cross-appellees-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span>, 649 (2d Cir.1991).   In that case, where plaintiffs failed to account and pay royalties in excess of $400,000, the court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>the district court correctly concluded that the breach by plaintiffs in failing to make the payments and provide the reports required ... was material as a matter of law, thus authorizing Marvel to terminate the contract.  [The parties' agreement] explicitly singled out plaintiffs' obligation to provide \"prompt accounting\" for distributions as a term and condition of the agreement, the substantial breach of which authorized Marvel to terminate the license provided by the agreement.   In addition, failure to tender payment is generally deemed a material breach of contract.   Finally, as the district court found, and the subsequent accounting confirmed, the amounts withheld from Marvel by plaintiffs were very substantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.

Scholz also points to a New York case holding that a licensee's failure to pay franchise fees totalling $40,129 over four months constituted a breach of contract, McDonald's Corp. v.

Scholz argues that Ahern's breach, spanning thirteen years, is more egregious than these cases of a six-month failure to pay concession and rental fees, four-month failure to pay license and lease fees, and seven-month failure to pay (and five-month failure to account).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Therefore, Scholz concludes, Ahern's failure to pay Scholz at least $459,000 is clearly a substantial breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not convinced.   We remind appellant that under our standard of review, we do not sit as a juror, evaluating credibility and weighing evidence, as he seems to ask us to do.   Rather, we simply weigh whether the district court committed a clear abuse of its discretion in determining that the jury verdict was not against the clear weight of the evidence.  Newell Puerto Rico, 20 F.3d at 22;  Kearns, 863 F.2d at 179.   Our review of the record reveals that Ahern's counsel presented testimony questioning, to varying degrees, nine of the thirteen items of the estimate Scholz' accounting expert made of how much Ahern owed Scholz.   Phillip Ames (\"Ames\"), a certified public accountant who served as business manager for both Ahern and BOSTON from 1976 through sometime in 1981 or 1982, made several estimates of how much Ahern owed Scholz, which he labelled \"ball park figures.\"   While we note that Ames' final estimate was $277,000, for a total of $459,000 with interest, we cannot assume that the jury accepted this figure as gospel.   Given that Ahern sought over a million dollars in principal and interest from Scholz, the jury may reasonably have found that the Ames figure was not a substantial breach in the particular context of this case.   It may have determined that the amount of money Ahern owed, taken in the perspective of the contract, Ahern's obligations, and the total amounts of money concerned, was not so significant a breach as to violate \"an essential and inducing feature of the contract.\"  Lease-It, 600 N.E.2d at 602.   Finally, addressing the case law Scholz relies on for support, we note that here, unlike in those cases, the amount of money owed was in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, examining the record in full, the evidence clearly provides the jury and trial court with a basis for finding that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA.   As this Circuit stated on another occasion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>We can understand how a jury might have decided for [defendant] on the basis of this evidence.   But the jury did not do this;  it decided for [plaintiff].  We do not see how one could say that the jury clearly made a mistake.   We do not see how one could say that the evidence overwhelmingly favored the [defendant].  Rather, the evidence simply was mixed and contradictory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">de Perez, 910 F.2d at 1008.

Did Scholz Breach the FMA?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern claimed below that Scholz breached his obligation under section 5.2.1 of the FMA to pay Ahern his share of the royalties due from the third album.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The evidence presented at trial centered on a document entitled \"Artist Royalty Statement\" (\"the Scholz Statement\"), which Scholz presented to Ahern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  That statement listed over $6 million in gross royalties reported by MCA prior to December 31, 1993, but reduced that figure by deducting, among other things, a producer share and artist costs, so that the net artist royalties fell to below zero--and Ahern was not entitled to any money.   Scholz argued at trial that he did not breach the FMA, but the jury and the trial court disagreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Scholz contends that their finding is against the weight of the evidence, because Ahern's prior material breaches excused Scholz' performance under the Further Modification Agreement.   Scholz points out that paragraph 2 of the FMA states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>Scholz wishes to guarantee that Ahern shall receive at a minimum certain amounts of monies in connection with future recordings embodying the performances of the group \"BOSTON\" .... in exchange for the agreement of Ahern as set forth herein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz shapes his argument on appeal as follows:  Since Ahern's only agreement of substance was his agreement to account for and pay royalties to Scholz for prior BOSTON albums, Ahern's breach of his commitment excused Scholz' performance.   Indeed, Scholz notes, the parties' mutual commitments to account to and pay each other are expressly stated to be in consideration of each other.   In such \"bilateral contracts for an agreed exchange of performances, even though the promises are in form absolute, the law regards them as constructively conditioned in order to avoid an unjust result.\"  Industrial Mercantile Fac.

Moreover, Scholz continues, the non-occurrence of a condition of a party's duty excuses the non-breaching party's obligation to perform even though that party does not know of its non-occurrence, id., &#167; 237 cmt. c, and the intention or scienter of a breaching party are not considered in the elements of breach of contract.   See Agron v. The Trustees of Columbia Univ., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">118495</span></span> (S.D.N.Y., April 12, 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering this, Scholz points out that his first royalty statement regarding the third album was rendered by MCA on April 1, 1987.   Thus the earliest he could have owed money to Ahern under the FMA was August 15, 1987--and by that date, he argues, Ahern had already failed to account to Scholz or pay him royalties with respect to the first two albums for over five years.   Therefore, Scholz maintains he was excused, at least until Ahern tendered payment, from rendering an accounting or paying royalties to Ahern from the third album.   At the very least, Scholz argues, he could have withheld payment of the $459,000 admittedly owed him as a set-off against any amount he owed Ahern.   See Record Club of America v.

Since Scholz does not revisit the merits of the evidence presented at trial regarding his breach, we will not do so here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, since we have already found that the verdict that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA was not against the clear weight of the evidence, Scholz' argument here must fail.   Clearly, it would be inconsistent with our acceptance of the verdict that Ahern did not substantially breach the FMA to find that Scholz' performance was excused by Ahern's material breach.   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decision to refuse the motion for a new trial on this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

We note that, in fact, this is the standard of review applicable to motions for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50.   While it is a circumscribed review, it is nonetheless not as limited as our review of the district court's disposition of the motion for new trial.   See Sanchez, 37 F.3d at 716-17 (comparing the two standards of review).   We find nothing in the record to establish that appellant Scholz made a motion for judgment as a matter of law, so that he would be entitled to this less deferential standard of review.   Rather, he argues sufficiency of the evidence in his motion for a new trial.   Our review of the record, therefore, must be under the abuse of discretion standard outlined above.   See MacQuarrie v. Howard Johnson Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524956\"><a href=\"/opinion/524956/j-conrad-macquarrie-v-howard-johnson-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 131 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the strict \"abuse of discretion\" standard \"is especially appropriate if the motion for a new trial is based on a claim that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence\");  Freeman, 865 F.2d at 1341-43 (evaluating the weight of the evidence as part of a motion for a new trial, separately from its review of the denial of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irrespective of which standard of review we apply, however, Scholz' alternative argument fails.   First, the evidence was overwhelming that he breached the FMA by failing to pay Ahern his share of the royalties from the third album;  indeed, Scholz does not attempt to argue otherwise.   Second, although the issue of the materiality of Ahern's breach is fairly close, as discussed above, there was sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to determine that Ahern did not materially breach the Further Modification Agreement.   Finally, having made these two determinations, the award of damages was appropriate.   Therefore, given the scope of the evidence as described, we find that the district court's denial of appellant's motion for a new trial was amply supported and not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. The Length of the Jury Deliberations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz next contends that the jury failed to follow its instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The district court instructed the jury that damages could only be awarded if it found one party breached the FMA and the other did not.   If it found that both parties were in breach, no damages could be awarded.   In making his contention, Scholz reiterates his argument that the evidence was insufficient, emphasizing that Ahern admitted he did not perform his obligations under the FMA, and maintaining that Ahern's accountant admitted that he both failed to pay at least $459,000 to Scholz and mischaracterized an advance from a foreign sub-publisher as a loan.   Under the jury instructions, Scholz argues, these factors preclude the jury from finding that Scholz breached the FMA, or at least from awarding Ahern any royalties.   These contentions have been dismissed in our discussion above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Scholz raises a new factor:  he argues that the jury's verdict and the extremely short period of deliberations--one and a half hours<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> following fifteen days of testimony--reveal that the jury ignored the court's instructions and rendered an erroneous and inconsistent verdict.   He cites the fact that one of the jurors planned to go on a cruise two days after the date of the verdict as proof that the jury was in a hurry to finish its deliberations.   The jury's questions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Scholz adds, demonstrates that it was determined to award Ahern $547,000 regardless of who was in breach.   Between the insufficient evidence and the perfunctory deliberations, Scholz concludes, the district court had an affirmative duty to grant a new trial.   He seeks support for his argument in Kearns v. Keystone Shipping Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515721\"><a href=\"/opinion/515721/48-fair-emplpraccas-969-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38511-john-t-kearns-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988), where this Circuit held that a brief jury deliberation--one hour and eighteen minutes, following a three-day trial--coupled with a verdict contrary to the great weight of the evidence created a situation where the district court had an affirmative duty to set aside the verdict.  Id. at 182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain unswayed.   Scholz' reliance on Kearns is misplaced.   There, the court explicitly required that the brief deliberation be paired with a verdict contrary to the weight of the evidence, noting that \" '[i]f the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict, the length of time the jury deliberates is immaterial.' \"  Kearns, 863 F.2d at 182 (quoting Marx v.

We have already determined that, here, there was evidence sufficient to support the verdict.   Therefore, Scholz is merely left with a complaint that the jury should have deliberated longer.

The objected-to portion of his questioning sought testimony regarding the Scholz Statement, which purported to account to Ahern for the royalties from the third album.   In the Statement, Scholz deducted $1.7 million for legal fees charged by Engel's law firm, which the Statement listed as equivalent to half of the fees charged in relation to the negotiation of the agreement with MCA and the CBS litigation.   The immediate issue at trial was whether this deduction was permissible as a \"commercially reasonable recording expense\" deductible from the royalties under section 5.2.1 of the FMA.

First, he points out that Engel was not designated as an expert under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26.   See Prentiss &amp; Carlisle Co. v. Koehring-Waterous Div. of Timberjack, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588168\"><a href=\"/opinion/588168/prentiss-carlisle-company-inc-v-koehring-waterous-division-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992) (upholding trial court's refusal to hear expert testimony from witness not designated as an expert).   Next, he maintains that under the applicable Rules of Professional Conduct, Engel should not have been required to testify against his client on an important and disputed point.   See Model Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-102(B).   In turn, Ahern contends that the questions asked were not seeking Engel's expert opinion under Federal Rule of Evidence 701,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> or, in the alternative, that the district court acted within its discretion in admitting the testimony.   See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 10-11 (\"Determinations of whether a witness is sufficiently qualified to testify as an expert on a given subject and whether such expert testimony would be helpful to the trier of fact are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\");  United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1183 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that manifest error standard applies to trial judge's rulings regarding expert testimony), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span> (1994).   His final contention is that Scholz' complaint should be deemed waived because Scholz first injected Engel's opinion testimony into the case through his affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not consider these arguments, however, for we find that, even assuming the trial court erred in admitting the challenged section of Engel's testimony, it was not harmful error.   Essentially, the challenged evidence was that in the \"hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and more\" contracts that he has reviewed, Engel never saw \"legal fees designated in a contract as anything, and certainly not as recording costs.\"  (Day 7, page 73).   Having examined the record as a whole to determine if admitting this evidence affected Scholz' substantial rights, in accordance with our legal framework, we find that any court error did not amount to harmful error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, although the issue of whether Scholz breached the FMA was certainly a major focus of the case, and Engel's testimony related to the single largest deduction taken from the royalties on the Scholz Statement, we disagree with Scholz' contention that it was probably determinative for the jury, for several reasons.   Ames and Stewart L. Levy (\"Levy\"), who has served as Ahern's counsel in the past and who was designated an expert on the subject of the reasonableness of the attorney's fees, both testified that attorney's fees are not recording expenses or recording costs.   Ahern testified that they are not artist costs or expenses for recording purposes.   We found no testimony, besides Engel's, contesting this point.   Levy challenged the fees' inclusion on the Scholz Statement on another front as well, stating that Ahern was asked to pay for services that at times were working against his best interests, including time billed on motions to preclude a stipulation which would have had Sony or CBS dropping Ahern from the lawsuit.   In short, he stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>We start off with the proposition that here is Mr. Ahern who is not directing Mr. Scholz to jump labels, not instructing Mr. Engel to do anything.   Because Mr. Scholz decides to do what he is doing, not only does Mr. Ahern get sued by CBS, not only is Mr. Ahern's income from CBS cut off, now Mr. Scholz and his attorney, Mr. Engel, expect Mr. Ahern not only to accept that but to defray part of the cost of Mr. Engel doing this.   I find that outrageous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 7, page 95).   Engel testified that the attempt to keep Ahern in the case was not directed solely at him, but was part of an attempt to keep CBS from making deals with potential witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fees were not disputed solely on the basis of the appropriateness of their deduction.   Levy testified at length that the fees themselves were unreasonable.   He testified that he felt that Engel's firm</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>did the work without any regard to any kind of budget, without any cap on their work.   Then they turned around and said, he said we had carte blanche....  Suddenly when the case is over in 1990, we are told it is $3 million....  There were no parameters.   Mr. Engel did what he wanted to do.   No one was checking what he did to say it was too expensive, don't do it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 7, pages 104-05).   In turn, Engel testified that the fees were higher than originally estimated because the head of CBS personally pursued the litigation to the \"bitter end,\" despite repeated attempts to settle.   Ultimately, he maintained, Scholz prevailed and won moneys for the entire band--and Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the attorney's fees were not the only challenged deduction on the Scholz Statement.   There was lengthy testimony questioning and defending many of the other deductions, most notably the producer's fee and the more than 11,000 hours of studio time Scholz charged for.   Therefore, even if the jury felt the deduction of the attorney's fees--or of some of them--was appropriate, they could still have reasonably found that Scholz materially breached the FMA.   Between the additional evidence, on both sides, as to whether the legal fees could be commercially reasonable recording expenses, whether the amount of fees charged were reasonable, and whether other deductions on the Statement were reasonable, we find that Engel's challenged testimony was not central to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the evidence admitted did not have an unduly prejudicial effect.   When called to the stand by his co-counsel, Engel was able to clarify that, while he felt he was asked about \"recording costs,\" the FMA actually addresses \"recording expenses\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>Q. Does the--The first question, does the further modification use the term \"recording costs\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>A. My recollection is, the [F]irst Modification Agreement uses the term \"recording expenses.\"   I was asked about recording costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>Q. Do recording contracts use the term \"recording expenses\" or \"recording costs\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>A. I, in all the recording contracts I've seen, in many of them, I don't remember the term \"recording expenses\" ever used, it's always \"recording costs\" that I've seen in the clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 13, pages 110-112).   He followed up on this in his closing argument, stating that \"[q]uestions were asked about recording costs, but recording costs is not the word used [in the FMA].\"  (Day 15, page 18).   We find that this additional testimony by Engel counters the potential prejudicial effect of his challenged statement.   Scholz argues on appeal that the prejudicial effect of the testimony was compounded by the statement of Ahern's counsel in his closing argument that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>there is no testimony before you, ladies and gentlemen, that legal costs in litigation that Mr. Scholz was in is a recording cost.   In fact, to the contrary, the only testimony here has been that legal costs--legal fees and legal costs are not recording costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>You may recall Mr. Engel uncomfortably on the witness stand, after I qualified him on his expertise in matters of this sort, acknowledging that this was the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 15, page 45).   However, between the totality of the evidence at trial and the additional statements Engel himself made, both as witness and as counsel, we do not feel that this reference to Engel in the hour spent in closing argument by Ahern's counsel could be found to sway the jury's decision, prompting harmful error.   See Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Omitted Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz contends that the district court made a separate harmful error in upholding the objections made by Ahern's trial counsel when Engel's co-counsel called Engel to the stand on the thirteenth day of trial and tried to have him address his earlier testimony.

We disagree.   The first time Engel testified, he was asked about \"contracts of performing artists and groups in the musical field.\"  (Day 7, page 71).   He stated in the disputed testimony that he had \"never seen legal fees designated in a contract as anything, and certainly not as recording costs.\"  (Day 7, page 73 (emphasis added)).   When next called to the stand, Engel agreed that he had seen \"contracts using only [the] words 'recording costs' where artists were paid for legal fees.\"  (Day 13, page 112).   The court's decision to sustain the objection made by Ahern's counsel in the ensuing dialogue was not a refusal to allow Engel to explain his evidence on the basis of its prejudicial effect against Ahern:  it was evidently a reaction to the apparent inconsistency between these statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, on appeal Scholz maintains that Engel's co-counsel was not allowed to \"cross-examine\" him on the subject of his direct testimony for Ahern, thereby precluding him from presenting clarifying evidence or diminishing the \"sting\" of an attorney testifying against his own client.   This error compounded the error of admitting Engel's expert testimony, Scholz contends.   He complains that because of the court's ruling, the jury never got to hear Engel's testimony regarding other types of contracts, such as agreements between performers and managers, or the difference between \"recording costs\" and \"recording expenses.\"   Nor did they hear his explanation that his answer might differ if asked about \"commercially reasonable recording expenses,\" not \"recording costs,\" he notes.   We view this final protest with some skepticism, however, in light of Engel's testimony on the stand that he had never seen legal fees designated \"as anything,\" which would, presumably, include commercially reasonable recording expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that Engel would have made the above testimony and that the district court erred in excluding the line of questioning, any resulting error was harmless.   First, for the same reasons outlined above, the testimony, while related to a central issue, was not central in and of itself.   Ames and Levy stated that they saw no difference between \"recording costs\" and \"recording expenses.\"   Additional testimony debated the total amount of fees charged as well as many other aspects of the Scholz Statement.   As for the potential prejudicial effect, the testimony Engel was able to give, quoted above, made it clear that his earlier statement was directed to \"recording costs,\" not \"recording expenses,\" an argument he reiterated in his closing, mitigating the potential effect of the apparent inconsistency.   Additionally, during his first day on the stand Engel stated, in response to questioning about the actual charging of recording costs or expenses by a group or a performing artist, that although he reviews accountings after the fact, he has never reviewed an accounting like that provided in the Scholz Statement.   He testified that \"[t]his is a special case.   I don't remember any accounting that really falls into this category.   This is not a standard contract.\"  (Day 7, page 81).   While this testimony does not go directly to his prior statements, it does emphasize that the FMA is not a standard contract, implying that his and others' statements about other contracts may not be pertinent.   Weighing the above in the light of the record as a whole, see Doty, 908 F.2d at 1057, we cannot say that the court's evidentiary ruling excluded evidence that was either central or prejudicial in its effect such that it could have swayed the factfinders' decision.   Thus, even if the court erred, it did not rise to the level of harmful error.   See Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Overall Impact of Engel's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, it is not just the impact of the information elicited from Engel that we must evaluate under the harmless error standard.   We must also address the potential prejudicial effect on the jury of seeing Engel, Scholz' counsel, take the stand, dispute with the court and opposing counsel over his testimony, and finally make a statement, apparently unwillingly, against his client's interest--a statement against which, he argues, he had to take an apparently inconsistent position in his closing argument.   There is no doubt in our mind that this had some prejudicial effect on the jury.   Nonetheless, we cannot say with \" 'fair assurance ... that the judgment was [ ] substantially swayed by the error.' \"  Espeaignnette, 43 F.3d at 9 (quoting Lubanski, 929 F.2d at 46).   The jury sat through fifteen days of trial, received substantial and often cumulative testimony on all points,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and heard an hour of closing argument from each party's counsel.   We find it highly unlikely that the verdict could have been the result of Engel's questioning and the attendant commentary.   Cf. United States v. Rosales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195287\"><a href=\"/opinion/195287/united-states-v-rosales/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 768 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that prosecutor's inappropriate argument in closing did not warrant new trial under harmless error standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are significant reasons why trial counsel should not be able to testify at trial, no matter for which party counsel testifies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p>The principal ethical considerations to a lawyer testifying on behalf of his client regarding contested issues are that the client's case will \"be presented through the testimony of an obviously interested witness who is subject to impeachment on that account;  and that the advocate is, in effect, put in the unseemly position of arguing his own credibility.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Siguel v.

When the attorney is called to the stand by his client's opponent, the concerns are just as substantial, if not more.   See Siguel, 141 F.R.D. at 396 (\"Although there are degrees of adverse testimony, there are few, if any, situations that justify acceptance or continued employment in this circumstance.\").   Accordingly, Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7 states that a lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial where he or she is likely to be a necessary witness, except, among other things, where the testimony relates to an uncontested issue or disqualification of the attorney would work substantial hardship on the client.   Finally, there is also the danger that the performance of the dual roles of counsel and witness will create confusion on the jury's part as to when the attorney is speaking as a witness, \"raising the possibility of the trier according testimonial credit to the prosecutor's closing argument,\" United States v. Johnston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409460\"><a href=\"/opinion/409460/united-states-v-ted-johnston/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 643 (7th Cir.1982)--or, conversely, weighing the testimony as if it were argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All these concerns clearly come into play at a more heightened level when trial counsel acts as an expert.   However, when counsel is asked to play that role for the length of one question in a fifteen-day trial, even acknowledging the impact of the attendant discussion with the court, attempts to examine him on the testimony and references to it in the closing arguments, we cannot hold that it rises to the level of harmful error affecting a party's substantial right where the testimony is cumulative and not a central part of the case.   Any prejudice that resulted from the objected-to portions of Engel's testimony did not rise to the level of harmful error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Scholz opposed, and the district court refused, both motions.   When the parties presented their lists of witnesses, Engel appeared on both parties' lists.   Approximately six weeks before trial was scheduled to begin, Ahern filed a third motion to disqualify.   This time Scholz agreed to withdraw his counsel provided that he was given time to find new lead counsel.   In his memorandum in support of his motion, Scholz stated that he \"now [felt] he must retain new trial counsel in this matter, to avoid the risk of a disqualification of his counsel just prior to the trial, and for other reasons.\"  (Scholz' Memorandum in Support of His Motion to Continue Trial, page 3).   The district court, however, denied both Ahern's Renewed Motion to Disqualify and Scholz' Motion to Continue Trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, Scholz maintains in his brief on appeal that the trial court erred by allowing Ahern to use Engel as his own expert against Scholz.   One of the four contentions he uses to support this position is that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p>the trial court itself placed Scholz in his precarious predicament when it refused to grant the last motion by Ahern to disqualify Engel....  The failure to grant the continuance under these circumstances, which resulted in severe prejudice to Scholz, is, itself, reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Appellant's Brief, page 34).   In support of his statement, Scholz cites several cases weighing district court decisions on motions for continuances.   See Lowe v. City of East Chicago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537233\"><a href=\"/opinion/537233/william-a-lowe-v-city-of-east-chicago-indiana-robert-pastrick-mayor-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 274-75 (7th Cir.1990) (concluding that it was an abuse of discretion to deny motion for continuance where plaintiff was faced with choice between voluntary dismissal and going to trial although his attorney was not ready for trial);  United States v.

We need not prolong our discussion.   Simply put, we do not feel the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.   Even if it did, the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that while we ultimately hold that the court did not commit harmful error in making its evidentiary ruling, we find it very disturbing that trial counsel testified in this case.   In making his appeal, Scholz directs us to a series of cases, several of which are referenced above, which lay out the real and serious concerns implicated by allowing counsel to testify at trial.   See, e.g., United States v. Dack, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444183\"><a href=\"/opinion/444183/united-states-v-edwin-e-dack/\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></a></span>, 1172 n. 5 (7th Cir.1984) (\"Where evidence is easily available from other sources and absent 'extraordinary circumstances' or 'compelling reasons,' an attorney who participates in the case should not be called as a witness.\").   We ask whether Scholz and his counsel read these cases before opposing Ahern's first two motions to disqualify.   The concerns the cases voice are implicated whether counsel testifies for his or her own client or for the opposing party.   What is more, even if Engel testified solely as to ministerial matters, we still doubt the wisdom of allowing him on the stand, as the matter of his firm's legal fees--not only whether, as a whole, they were commercially reasonable recording expenses but also whether they were reasonable at all--was a matter of testimony.   The jury heard deposition testimony from Ahern's expert Levy that the legal fees from the CBS litigation were, among other things, \"excessive and totally inappropriate\" (Day 7, page 86);  whether Engel was called to the stand by Scholz or Ahern, indeed, even had he never testified, his integrity and judgment could have been questioned by the factfinders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p>COUNTERCLAIM FOR FRAUD AND DECEIT AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Further Modification Agreement provided that Ahern was entitled to a share of the royalties of any album completed before October 24, 1984.   Had the parties adhered to this provision, Ahern would not be entitled to any moneys from the third album, as it was completed after that date.   Instead, Scholz waived the deadline, conveying his waiver through communications between the parties' attorneys in May of 1984.   In this action, Scholz drew on his waiver of the deadline in his third counterclaim and several of his affirmative defenses to argue for rescission of the waiver agreement on the grounds of fraud and deceit and, alternatively, its invalidation.   On appeal before us, he appeals the district court's directed verdict against him on these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review is a familiar one.

Like the parties in Apple Records, at the time of the waiver in 1984 Ahern and Scholz had a long history of business dealings, marked by a series of agreements and modification agreements.   Also as in that case, the relationship between the parties here was a profitable one for Ahern.   However, unlike that case, Ahern no longer, as of several years previously, was Scholz' manager.   Indeed, Scholz testified that in 1978, when he first started the process that culminated in the FMA, he was no longer on speaking terms with Ahern.   While we do not doubt--and Ahern admitted at trial--that Ahern had a fiduciary duty to Scholz until 1981, the question remains whether there was such a special relationship of trust and confidence between the parties at the time of the waiver that a fiduciary relationship, at least as regards Ahern's duty to pay Scholz' share of the royalties from the first and second albums, remained.   Since a reasonable juror could find that it did, however, a directed verdict is inappropriate on the question of whether Ahern owed Scholz a fiduciary duty.   Therefore, we continue our analysis and turn to the evidence presented on the elements listed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as for the material false misrepresentation or nondisclosure, it is undisputed that Ahern did not disclose his failure to pay, a fact which a reasonable juror could easily find material.   On the other hand, both Ahern and Barbara Sherry (\"Sherry\"), who provided business management services for Ahern and BOSTON while Ames served as their business manager and served as Ahern's business manager from 1982 up through the time of trial, testified that they were not aware money was owed until after the waiver was made, and Scholz points to no evidence of concealment.   Second, Scholz would have us read an intent to deceive into Sherry's testimony agreeing with Engel's statement that today, looking at a royalty statement from the company charged with administrating the publishing, \"it's immediately plain to anyone who knows this business, that [the administration company] was not paying\" the proper percentage to Scholz.  (Day 6, pages 61-62).   Scholz cannot rely on this as an admission that Sherry knew Scholz was not receiving all his moneys, however, since her actual testimony was that she did not know of the failure at the time.   Instead, he seeks to build on her admission that one could have known from the face of the royalty statements that there was an error, as well as the fact that there was no evidence that letters of direction were prepared for the foreign sub-publishers, to support his contention that Ahern \"had to have known\" he was not making all his payments.   Ahern presented no evidence indicating that he could not have known of the error, just that he did not.   In essence, therefore, determining whether Ahern intended to deceive Scholz becomes an issue of credibility, one which of necessity is a question for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for whether Scholz reasonably relied on Ahern's nondisclosure, his case is damaged by the fact that the evidence is undisputed that Ahern did not actually solicit the waiver.   Scholz' attorney contacted his counsel and offered it to him.   Scholz explained his motivation at trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p>A.  Well, I figured if I, if I finished the record six months later and I missed that date that Paul Ahern was entitled to his 12 percent of the royalties, you know, I missed that date and then six months later delivered the record, I was sure he would be upset about that and, and want his 12 percent anyway, and I didn't want to fight with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p>Q. And was it your intention at that time--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p>A.  I had enough trouble at that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p>Q. And did you ask for anything in return for that waiver?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p>A. No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 10, pages 38-39).   However, Scholz points to his testimony at trial that he \"obviously\" would not have agreed to the waiver had he known of Ahern's failure to pay him publishing royalties as evidence of his reliance.   Giving Scholz the benefit of all the inferences, a reasonable juror could find under these circumstances that Ahern sought to induce Scholz into a fraudulent agreement, once it had been offered to him, through nondisclosure of his failure to pay.   The presence of the fourth element, damages, Scholz contends, is witnessed by the fact that he now owes Ahern money:  had he not waived the deadline, Ahern would not have been entitled to royalties from the third album.   Given all of the above, we find that Scholz has mustered sufficient evidence for the issue to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Invalidation of the Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his Fourth and Fifth Affirmative Defenses, Scholz argues that the waiver should be invalidated because he did not knowingly give his consent.   He maintains here that in order to prevail, all he must prove is that he would not have agreed to the waiver if he had known of Ahern's failure to account to and pay him royalties.   Since he testified to that effect, he argues, the district court erred in granting a directed verdict.   We disagree.   First, we note that none of the cases Scholz looks to for support discuss invalidation as an affirmative defense under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c).   Although the case law indicates that there is precedent for such an affirmative defense, see, e.g., United States v. Krieger, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span>, 583 (S.D.N.Y.1991) (denying summary judgment on, inter alia, claim for invalidity of guarantees despite failure to claim it as an affirmative defense), we have found, and the parties present, no comprehensive discussion of its nature.   See 2A James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice p 8.27 n.6 (2d ed.1995) (listing most common affirmative defenses, excluding invalidity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no other support for Scholz' position in the cases he cites.  Allen, which he looks to for the proposition that all he has to prove is that he would not have agreed to the waiver, does not address invalidity of a waiver or release.   Rather, it notes that a court may rescind a release \" 'where it finds either mutual mistake or one party's unilateral mistake coupled with some fraud ... of the other party.' \"  Allen, 945 F.2d at 44 (quoting National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Walton Ins. Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1422231\"><a href=\"/opinion/1422231/national-union-fire-ins-co-v-walton-ins-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 902 (S.D.N.Y.1988)).   Scholz did not plead mutual mistake, and his rescission claim based on fraud is addressed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz states that he does not have to show Ahern owed him a fiduciary duty in order to state a claim for invalidation.   Indeed, the court in Allen notes that where one party has superior knowledge not available to the other party, a duty to disclose may arise, apparently exclusive of a fiduciary duty, id. at 45, but Scholz does not point to any evidence that he could not have discovered that Ahern had not been paying him.   His reliance on Gishen v. Dura Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252468\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252468/gishen-v-dura-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252468\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252468/gishen-v-dura-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span> (1972), apparently for the proposition that \"[a] party cannot waive information with respect to an error in calculation whose existence is unknown to him, particularly where his ignorance is caused by the very lack of disclosure in question and where the parties are not fully at arm's length,\" id. 285 N.E.2d at 122, is misplaced.   First and most importantly, under the choice-of-law provision of the FMA, the parties here are applying New York, not Massachusetts, law.   Second, the Gishen opinion addressed a request for a jury instruction on waiver, which was denied because the party had not previously presented the argument;  it does not involve an affirmative defense.  Id. at 121.   The quoted language is dicta--and seems to undercut Scholz' proposition that a fiduciary relationship is not necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz' citation to Werking v.

The court found the waiver in question, of jurisdictional defects in a tax sale of plaintiff's farm, invalid because plaintiff \"had no knowledge of the right he is charged with having knowingly and intentionally relinquished.\"  Id.

The district court found that Scholz' failure to pay royalties as provided in the FMA violated Chapter 93A.   More specifically, it held that the Scholz Statement regarding the royalties on the third album constituted an unfair and deceptive business practice, and that it was a \"deliberate and blatant attempt to deprive Plaintiff Ahern of moneys rightfully due and owing to him.\"  (District Court Memorandum and Order, page 3).

The District Court's Findings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that Scholz had violated sections 2 and 11 through his failure to pay Ahern royalties from the third album, and made the following findings in its Memorandum and Order.   First, it found that Scholz agreed to pay Ahern royalties after deduction of only a producer's royalty and all commercially reasonable recording expenses.   Second, the court held that the Scholz Statement constituted an unfair and deceptive business practice.   More specifically, it found that the deductions taken for legal fees, payment to Jeff Dorenfeld, time spent in the studio, and the resulting recording costs were all not commercially reasonable recording expenses.   Rather, the court stated, $500,000 in recording expenses would be commercially reasonable.   It next found that Scholz' Statement was</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p>a deliberate and blatant attempt to deprive the Plaintiff Ahern of monies rightfully due and owing to him as royalties from the sales of the third BOSTON album.   Such egregious conduct ... is patently an unfair and deceptive practice.   The submission of [the Scholz Statement] as an accounting by Scholz to Ahern is a shocking display of arrogant disdain for Ahern's contractual rights and was rendered in obvious bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(District Court Memorandum and Order, page 3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholz challenges the sufficiency of these findings.   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) mandates that courts \"find the facts specially and state separately [their] conclusions of law thereon\" when trying facts without a jury.   See, e.g., Montanez v. Bagg, 24 Mass.App.Ct. 954, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></span>, 300 (1987) (noting that judge did not make detailed findings of fact regarding Chapter 93A claims under Mass.  R. Civ. P. 52(a)).   Scholz notes that the court did not state that the deductions were actually deceptive, and reminds us that the Scholz Statement set forth in some detail what each of the deductions were.   Since the court did not make more specific findings as to unfair or deceptive practices, he maintains, we should reverse the Chapter 93A finding against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  See Schwanbeck, 578 N.E.2d at 803 (holding that district court finding of Chapter 93A violation lacked foundation in the court's subsidiary findings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we remind Scholz that under Rule 52(a) \"the judge need only make brief, definite pertinent findings and conclusions on the contested matters.\"  Makuc v. American Honda Motor Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498702\"><a href=\"/opinion/498702/anne-m-makuc-v-american-honda-motor-company-inc-john-d-makuc/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 394 (1st Cir.1987).   Here, the district court found that Scholz breached the FMA, that four of his deductions were commercially unreasonable, while a figure of $0.5 million would be reasonable;  and that the Scholz Statement was \"a deliberate and blatant attempt to deprive\" Ahern of moneys owed him.   It is a question of law whether this attempt to deprive Ahern rises to the level of a violation of Chapter 93A, as the lower court held, and we believe the decision includes enough of a basis for the Chapter 93A finding to save the decision from remand.   The district court has provided us with more than mere conclusions.   See Sidney Binder, Inc., 552 N.E.2d at 572 (holding that explanatory findings were necessary where court merely recited the evidence without making findings and concluded that \"neither party ha[d] sustained its burden of proof\" that Chapter 93A had been violated).   We note, however, that our task would have been much simpler in this and other issues had the district court seen fit to explicate more of its decision-making on paper.   There is a gap between finding that deductions are commercially unreasonable and finding that the Scholz Statement as a whole is an attempt to deprive Ahern deserving of the modifiers \"unfair\" and \"deceptive\":  while we are willing to follow the lower court across the distance between them, a bridge would have been more than welcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

As noted above, whether an act was unfair and/or deceptive is a question of fact.   Based on our review of the evidence, we do not hesitate to find that the district court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and we will not disturb them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  See United Truck Leasing Corp. v.

Thus, we assess the lower court's award under Chapter 93A in the light of its finding that four deductions--which totalled $4.2 million--were not reasonable, but $0.5 million would be commercially reasonable recording costs, and that the Scholz Statement was a deliberate attempt to deprive Ahern of his percentage of the royalties from the third album.

In the absence of conduct having that quality, a failure to perform obligations under a written lease, even though deliberate and for reasons of self-interest, does not present an occasion for invocation of [Chapter] 93A remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 598 N.E.2d at 670-71 (citation omitted).   We have not addressed, and find no Massachusetts case law addressing, whether this language from Atkinson extends beyond its immediate context to limit award of Chapter 93A damages in breach of contract cases to cases with an \"extortionate quality.\"   See NASCO, Inc. v. Public Storage, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195499\"><a href=\"/opinion/195499/nasco-inc-v-public-storage-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Atkinson and accepting, arguendo, that \"in a breach of contract situation, liability does not attach under [Chapter] 93A, section 11 unless a defendant knowingly breached a contact in order to secure additional benefits to itself to the detriment of a plaintiff.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not do so today, however.   First, if we accept the test for Chapter 93A violation Scholz claims Atkinson frames, the district court's award here will not stand because there has not been an extortionate element to the breach:  Scholz tried to hold on to Ahern's money, but he was not using the breach \"to force [Ahern] to do what otherwise [he] would not be legally required to do.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co., 754 F.2d at 18 (affirming Chapter 93A award where defendant withheld payment as a \"wedge\" to force plaintiff to supply more products);  see, e.g., Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 822 (holding that withholding approval as a pretext to force party into changing price of underlying contract violated Chapter 93A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, if we were to find that Atkinson does not limit Chapter 93A liability to cases with an extortionate element, but rather address Scholz' acts under the test as stated in Anthony's Pier Four, we still find that Chapter 93A has not been violated.   That test asks whether there has been conduct \" 'in disregard of known contractual arrangements' and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party.\"  Anthony's Pier Four, 583 N.E.2d at 821;  see Wang Labs., 501 N.E.2d at 1165 (finding liability under Chapter 93A where interference with contract \"constituted a willful act calculated to obtain the benefits of [the] contract ... without cost and in disregard of known contractual arrangements\").   Here, the court found that Scholz knowingly breached the contract in order to gain a benefit--Ahern's share of the royalties.   But that would be true of any knowing breach of a contract.   The question, then, is whether the level of \"rascality\" is sufficient to rise to the level of a violation of Chapter 93A.   We find it is not.   First, while the deductions that the court deemed commercially unreasonable ate up more than half of the royalties reported, we note that Scholz did not seek to conceal the nature of the deductions:  he laid them out on the Scholz Statement in varying levels of detail.   Next, while Scholz has an extensive degree of control over the moneys from the third album, there has been no allegation that he did not report all of the royalties from MCA on the Scholz Statement.   Evidence was presented that the number of hours spent on the album was reconstructed after the fact, but the district court did not find that the figures given were inaccurate, just that they were not deductible.   Scholz' breach amounted to more than a dispute over the commercial reasonableness of certain deductions, as he would have us believe.   Nonetheless, his acts did not rise to the level of rascality required for Chapter 93A liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Ultimately, therefore, we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in finding Scholz violated Chapter 93A, and reverse that holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>PREJUDGMENT INTEREST AND ATTORNEY'S FEES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have found that Scholz did not violate Chapter 93A, we need not address the parties' arguments regarding the award of attorney's fees under that statute.   Nor do we weigh Ahern's cross-appeal of the district court's refusal to award prejudgment interest, since that is based on his Chapter 93A contention.   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   231 &#167; 6C (\"interest shall be added ... to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve percent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.\").
