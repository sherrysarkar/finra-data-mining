See 18 U.S.C.    2, 924(c)(1) &amp; (3), 2119(3) (1994). \r                         \r\n\nHaving reviewed the record carefully, we detect no error.\r\n\n          In this instance, the sentencing court figured the\r\n\napplicable guideline sentencing range (GSR) to be 324 to 405\r\n\nmonths on count 1.  The government moved for a substantial\r\n\nassistance departure, USSG  5K1.1, and the appellant chimed in,\r\n\nseeking even greater clemency.  The court chose a sentence of 225\r\n\nmonths on count 1, followed by a mandatory minimum five-year\r\n\nconsecutive sentence on count 2.\r\n\n          The appellant does not contest the correctness of the\r\n\nGSR.  Nevertheless, he asserts that the court blundered in\r\n\ndenying him an appropriate downward departure by (a) erroneously\r\n\nconsidering his past criminal history (including a juvenile\r\n\noffense for which no conviction ensued), and (b) ignoring the\r\n\npurpose of USSG  5K1.1 and the policy of the Sentencing\r\n\nCommission in respect to offenders who assist the government. \r\n\nAdditionally, he contends that the district court erred by\r\n\nconsidering elements of the offense which already were considered\r\n\nby the Sentencing Commission when it assigned a base offense\r\n\nlevel to the crime of conviction.  These claims are meritless.\r\n\n          \"It is by now apodictic that a criminal defendant\r\n\ncannot ground an appeal on the sentencing court's discretionary\r\n\ndecision not to depart below the GSR.\"  United States v.

Vaknin,     F.3d    ,     (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1997) [No. 96-1394, slip op. at 10-11]; United States v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nMariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1155-57 (1st Cir. 1993).  In both\r                 \r\n\nsituations, the departure decision is unappealable as long as it\r\n\nrests on differential factfinding or on the weighing of competing\r\n\nequities; jurisdiction only attaches \"when it appears that the\r\n\nfailure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken\r\n\nimpression that it lacked the legal authority to depart or,\r\n\nrelatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules\r\n\ngoverning departure.\"  Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1153.  No such\r                                        \r\n\noversight occurred here.\r\n\n          The appellant labors to find a cognizable error, but he\r\n\nis unsuccessful.  The district court in fact departed downward. \r\n\nThe appellant's real dissatisfaction is that, as he sees it, the\r\n\nextent of the departure was not sufficiently generous.  In\r\n\ngeneral, such complaints are not cognizable on appeal.  See\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited States v. Pighetti, 898 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir. 1990). \r                                   \r\n\nMoreover, looking to the whole of the record, see United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 407 (1st Cir. 1995), it is perfectly\r                    \r\n\nclear that the trial judge knew he could depart once the\r\n\ngovernment invoked USSG  5K1.1.  He in fact did so, choosing, as\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwas his right, to impose a sentence greater than the prosecution\r\n\nhad recommended or the appellant had hoped but still below the\r\n\nnadir of the GSR.\r\n\n          The argument that the court should have gone further\r\n\nlacks force.  The transcript reveals that Judge Laffitte weighed\r\n\nthe assistance that the appellant rendered (indeed, the judge\r\n\nnoted that he had presided over the trial at which Ramos\r\n\ntestified).  To be sure, the judge did not stop there, but a\r\n\nsentencing court is not restricted to considering only the\r\n\ndefendant's substantial assistance on a section 5K1.1 motion; the\r\n\ncourt may (and should) consider other facts.  See Mariano, 983\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at 1156-57; see also 18 U.S.C.   3553.  Accordingly, we\r                                   \r\n\nbelieve it is entirely appropriate that Judge Laffitte mulled the\r\n\nnature of the offenses and the appellant's participation in them. \r\n\nThe judge also fully considered the purpose and policies\r\n\nunderlying section 5K1.1.  This is exemplified by the court's\r\n\nstatement that, had Ramos not cooperated, the court \"would have\r\n\ngiven . . . a life sentence,\" but refrained from imposing one\r\n\nbecause \"cooperat[ion] with the government must also in some\r\n\ndegree be rewarded as a lesson to others that might be involved\r\n\nin other criminal activities.\"  After pondering these\r\n\nconsiderations and other information in the record   all of which\r\n\nthe court had a right to consult1   the court determined that,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The record lacks any support for the appellant's assertion\r\nthat the court inappropriately considered prior criminal conduct\r\nin assessing the sentence.  The court appears merely to have\r\nmentioned the prior conduct when suggesting that Ramos' criminal\r\nhistory category underrepresented his prior record.  The court\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nunder the specific circumstances of the appellant's case, no\r\n\ngreater leniency was warranted.  Such a decision was a judgment\r\n\ncall, well within the sentencing court's discretion.  See Vaknin,\r                                                                          \r\n\n    F.3d at     [slip op. at 13].\r\n\n          The appellant's second argument deserves very short\r\n\nshrift.  His one-paragraph reference transgresses the \"settled\r\n\nappellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\r\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are\r\n\ndeemed waived.\"  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1990).  That ends the matter.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The district court's departure\r\n\ndecision is quite clearly a permissible exercise of the court's\r\n\ninformed discretion, unaccompanied by any detectable error of\r\n\nlaw.  We will not second-guess it.\r\n\n          The judgment and sentence are summarily affirmed.  See\r                    The judgment and sentence are summarily affirmed.\r                                                                          \r\n\n1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthen explained that Ramos ordinarily would have been a candidate\r\nfor an upward departure on this basis, but, given his\r\ncooperation, the court instead weighed the underrepresentation in\r\nconsidering the extent to which a downward departure was\r\nwarranted.  We discern no error.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n",

In both\r                 \r\n\nsituations, the departure decision is unappealable as long as it\r\n\nrests on differential factfinding or on the weighing of competing\r\n\nequities; jurisdiction only attaches \"when it appears that the\r\n\nfailure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken\r\n\nimpression that it lacked the legal authority to depart or,\r\n\nrelatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules\r\n\ngoverning departure.\"  Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1153.

The district court in fact departed downward. \r\n\nThe appellant's real dissatisfaction is that, as he sees it, the\r\n\nextent of the departure was not sufficiently generous.  In\r\n\ngeneral, such complaints are not cognizable on appeal.  See\r                                                                     \r\n\nUnited States v.

He in fact did so, choosing, as\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwas his right, to impose a sentence greater than the prosecution\r\n\nhad recommended or the appellant had hoped but still below the\r\n\nnadir of the GSR.\r\n\n          The argument that the court should have gone further\r\n\nlacks force.  The transcript reveals that Judge Laffitte weighed\r\n\nthe assistance that the appellant rendered (indeed, the judge\r\n\nnoted that he had presided over the trial at which Ramos\r\n\ntestified).  To be sure, the judge did not stop there, but a\r\n\nsentencing court is not restricted to considering only the\r\n\ndefendant's substantial assistance on a section 5K1.1 motion; the\r\n\ncourt may (and should) consider other facts.  See Mariano, 983\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at 1156-57; see also 18 U.S.C.   3553.  Accordingly, we\r                                   \r\n\nbelieve it is entirely appropriate that Judge Laffitte mulled the\r\n\nnature of the offenses and the appellant's participation in them. \r\n\nThe judge also fully considered the purpose and policies\r\n\nunderlying section 5K1.1.  This is exemplified by the court's\r\n\nstatement that, had Ramos not cooperated, the court \"would have\r\n\ngiven . . . a life sentence,\" but refrained from imposing one\r\n\nbecause \"cooperat[ion] with the government must also in some\r\n\ndegree be rewarded as a lesson to others that might be involved\r\n\nin other criminal activities.\"  After pondering these\r\n\nconsiderations and other information in the record   all of which\r\n\nthe court had a right to consult1   the court determined that,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The record lacks any support for the appellant's assertion\r\nthat the court inappropriately considered prior criminal conduct\r\nin assessing the sentence.  The court appears merely to have\r\nmentioned the prior conduct when suggesting that Ramos' criminal\r\nhistory category underrepresented his prior record.  The court\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nunder the specific circumstances of the appellant's case, no\r\n\ngreater leniency was warranted.  Such a decision was a judgment\r\n\ncall, well within the sentencing court's discretion.  See Vaknin,\r                                                                          \r\n\n    F.3d at     [slip op. at 13].\r\n\n          The appellant's second argument deserves very short\r\n\nshrift.  His one-paragraph reference transgresses the \"settled\r\n\nappellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\r\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are\r\n\ndeemed waived.\"  United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1990).  That ends the matter.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The district court's departure\r\n\ndecision is quite clearly a permissible exercise of the court's\r\n\ninformed discretion, unaccompanied by any detectable error of\r\n\nlaw.  We will not second-guess it.\r\n\n          The judgment and sentence are summarily affirmed.  See\r                    The judgment and sentence are summarily affirmed.\r                                                                          \r\n\n1st Cir.

We discern no error.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n</pre>",
