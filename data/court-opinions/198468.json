ROGERS,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n                 NORMAN BOWER, ETC., ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n       [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Charles F. Rogers on brief pro se.\r\n   William G. Scott, Marcia S. Kovalik and Boynton, Waldron,\r\nDoleac, Woodman &amp; Scott, P.A. on brief for appellees.\r\n\nMay 13, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  This pro se appeal stems from a civil\r\nrights action.  Among other things, plaintiff-appellant Charles\r\nF. Rogers alleged that defendant police officers used excessive\r\nforce when arresting him.  The case was tried to a jury, and\r\njudgment entered in favor of defendants.  We affirm.\r\n          Rogers argues that the district court erred in\r\ndenying his request for an extension of the deadline for\r\ndisclosure of experts and their written reports, and in\r\nsubsequently excluding his police-practice expert, George Page,\r\nfrom testifying at trial.  We see no abuse of discretion.  Cf.\r\nCoastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum\r\nCorp., 79 F.3d 182, 203 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"A trial court may\r\n'readily exclude a witness or exhibit if some previous order\r\nhad set a deadline for identification and the proponent [has],\r\nwithout adequate excuse, failed to list the witness or\r\nexhibit.'\") (citation omitted). Rogers had already received\r\nthree extensions of the discovery deadline; he had been warned\r\nthat no further extensions would be allowed; the further\r\nextension he sought would have interfered with the trial date\r\n(which had already been extended once); and there was no solid\r\nassurance that he could meet a new deadline.  We also think\r\nthat it would have been unfair to defendants to permit Page's\r\ntestimony at trial where, it appears, they had never been\r\nprovided with a written report. \r\n          Rogers also argues that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in refusing to ask any of his proposed jury voir\r\ndire questions, and that the court conducted a one-side inquiry\r\n                              --\r\ninto potential bias regarding government agents.  Our review of\r\nthis issue is hampered by the absence of a transcript.  The\r\nappellant bears the burden of producing \"a transcript of such\r\nparts of the proceedings [below] not already on file\" as is\r\nnecessary to enable this court to place the parties'\r\ncontentions into perspective.  See Fed. R. App. P. 10(b); Moore\r\nv. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1995).  Where a transcript\r\nhas not been produced, this court in its discretion either may\r\nscrutinize the merits of the case insofar as the record\r\npermits, or may dismiss the appeal if the absence of the\r\ntranscript thwarts intelligent review.  Moore, 47 F.3d at 10. \r\n          We are aware that appellant is proceeding in forma\r\npauperis, and that he filed a motion for a transcript at\r\ngovernment expense in the district court.  See 28 U.S.C. \r\n753(f).  However, the district court denied the motion on the\r\nground that the appeal fails to present any substantial issues,\r\nand Rogers has failed to appeal that denial or renew his\r\ntranscript request in this court.  Indigence does not relieve\r\nan appellant of the burden of producing a transcript.  See\r\nRichardson v. Henry, 902 F.2d 414, 416 (5th Cir. 1990)\r\n(dismissing issues on appeal for lack of a transcript despite\r\nappellant's indigence).  \r\n          In any event, the voir dire issue appears to be\r\nwithout merit.  Although the trial judge arguably was required\r\nto make some inquiry into pro-government bias, he was not\r\nrequired to use Rogers's specific questions.  See United States\r\nv. Victoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d 77, 84 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating\r\nthat the trial court should ordinarily make inquiry into\r\nwhether prospective jurors would be inclined to place greater\r\nfaith in a government agent's testimony but also stating that\r\nthe phrasing of the inquiry is up to the judge).  The trial\r\njudge's handwritten notations on Rogers's voir dire proposal\r\nindicate that he intended to cover some of the requested\r\nquestions (including a question as to whether jurors would give\r\ngreater credence to the testimony of a law-enforcement official\r\nthan an ordinary person).  Finally, defendants argue (and\r\nRogers does not deny) that Rogers made no objection to the\r\nquestions actually posed.  Under the circumstances, we must\r\nassume that any claim of error is waived.  \r\n          Affirmed.\n",
