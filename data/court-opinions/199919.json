George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Bownes and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     E. Peter Parker on brief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Theodore D.\nChuang, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief, for the United\nStates.\n\n\n                           April 12, 2002\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge. On April 29, 1998, a federal grand\n\njury returned a one-count indictment charging defendant-appellant\n\nJonathan Moore with possession of ammunition by a previously\n\nconvicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).   The facts of\n\nthe case are delineated in an earlier opinion of this court, United\n\nStates v. Moore, 235 F.3d 700, 702-03 (1st Cir. 2000), and it would\n\nbe pleonastic to rehearse them here.     For present purposes, it\n\nsuffices to say that, after we set aside the district court's order\n\nsuppressing certain evidence, id. at 704, Moore entered a guilty\n\nplea.\n\n           The district court sentenced Moore pursuant to the Armed\n\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), imposing a fifteen-\n\nyear term of immurement. In choosing this course, the court relied\n\nupon a sentence-enhancement provision, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), which\n\nstipulates, inter alia, that a defendant who has at least three\n\nprior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense\"\n\nis subject to a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence if he later\n\nviolates the felon-in-possession law.\n\n           For purposes of the section 924(e) enhancement, the term\n\n\"serious drug offense\" includes \"an offense under State law,\n\ninvolving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to\n\nmanufacture or distribute, a controlled substance . . . for which\n\na maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed\n\nby law.\"   18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).     Before committing the\n\n\n                                -2-\n\finstant offense, Moore had been convicted in the Massachusetts\n\nstate court system on four separate occasions for possessing\n\ncocaine    with   intent   to   deliver   —   a   crime   punishable   \"by\n\nimprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years, or in\n\na jail or house of correction for not more than two and one-half\n\nyears . . . .\"    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32A(a).       These were the\n\npredicate offenses upon which the sentencing court relied in\n\ninvoking 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).\n\n           Moore argued at the disposition hearing that the four\n\nconvictions did not constitute \"serious drug offenses\" within the\n\npurview of section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) because they were adjudicated\n\nin the state district court — a court which, by statute, cannot\n\nimpose a sentence of more than two and one-half years.1         See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 218, § 27 (providing that a defendant convicted in a\n\ndistrict court may not be sentenced to state prison); see also id.\n\nch. 279, § 23 (limiting sentences to the house of correction to two\n\nand one-half years).       The court below rejected this argument,\n\nstating:\n\n           There is a single offense defined in the\n           statute, and that is possession with intent to\n           distribute.    There are a possibility of\n           different ranges of punishments, but there is\n           a single offense. . . .           It is the\n           Massachusetts structure to provide different\n           forums for the punishment of that.\n\n\n     1\n      In Massachusetts, the superior and district courts have\nconcurrent jurisdiction over violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C,\n§ 32A. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 26.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fAccordingly, the court held that Moore's narcotics convictions\n\nqualified as ACCA predicate offenses.\n\n            Moore now appeals the sentence.      Since his appeal raises\n\nunvarnished questions of law, we review the district court's\n\ndeterminations de novo.        United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 191 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).    After careful perscrutation       of the applicable law,\n\nthe parties' briefs, and the record, we discern no error.\n\n            Moore's principal claim fails because it ignores the\n\nmethod that the Supreme Court has prescribed for determining\n\nwhether a prior conviction may serve as a predicate offense for\n\nsentence-enhancement purposes.        That method embodies \"a formal\n\ncategorical approach, looking only to the statutory definitions of\n\nthe prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying\n\nthose convictions.\"    Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600\n\n(1990).     Under the categorical approach — which applies in ACCA\n\ncases, see United States v. Nason, 269 F.3d 10, 13-14 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) — the sentencing court typically must limit its inquiry to\n\n\"the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior\n\noffense.\"    Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602.\n\n            In the context of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), this\n\napproach    necessitates   a   comparison   of   the   provisions   of   the\n\nrelevant state statute with the federal statute's definition of\n\n\"serious drug offense.\"        E.g., United States v. McMahon, 91 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f1394, 1398 (10th Cir. 1996); United States v. Jefferson, 88 F.3d\n\n240, 241-43 (3d Cir. 1996); United States v. Williams, 20 F.3d 125,\n\n132-34 (5th Cir. 1994).    The relevant state statute here, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32A(a), allows for a maximum possible penalty\n\nof ten years' incarceration, and, thus, fits comfortably within the\n\nambit of \"serious drug offense\" as that term is defined in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). See United States v. Gunn, 962 F. Supp.\n\n214, 215-16 (D. Mass. 1997) (concluding that a conviction under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, § 32(a) falls within the contours of a\n\n\"serious drug offense\" as that term is defined in the ACCA, despite\n\nthe fact that the defendant's prior conviction occurred in the\n\nstate district   court),   aff'd,   141   F.3d   1150   (1st   Cir.   1998)\n\n(table); cf. McCarthy v. United States, 135 F.3d 754, 756-57 (11th\n\nCir. 1998) (treating statutory maximum penalty under Florida law as\n\ndispositive, notwithstanding that the Florida sentencing guidelines\n\neffectively capped the defendant's sentence for the prior offense\n\nat four and one-half years).    No more is exigible.\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Moore\n\ndirects us to case law indicating that, in considering whether a\n\nparticular conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate offense, a\n\ncourt sometimes may look to sources beyond the statutory definition\n\nof a crime (such as the charging papers or jury instructions).\n\nE.g., United States v. Shepard, 231 F.3d 56, 69 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\ncert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 72 (2001); United States v. Damon, 127\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fF.3d 139, 140 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d\n\n1234, 1237 (1st Cir. 1992).                These cases are inapposite.        They\n\nrelate not to whether a crime is a \"serious drug offense,\" but,\n\nrather, to the conceptually different question of whether a crime\n\nis a \"violent felony\" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).                         That\n\nanalysis focuses not on whether the crime carries the requisite\n\nmaximum penalty, but on whether the characteristics of the crime\n\nplace     it   within    the   four    corners   of    a    particular   statutory\n\ndefinition.2         See Shepard, 231 F.3d at 59; Damon, 127 F.3d at 142;\n\nHarris, 964 F.2d at 1235.\n\n               In the case at bar, unlike in the \"violent felony\" cases,\n\nthere is a single offense — cocaine distribution — albeit one that\n\npresents       the    possibility     of   divergent   ranges    of   punishment.\n\nBecause there is no issue as to which of several different crimes\n\nMoore committed, there is no warrant for probing beneath the\n\n\n     2\n         The ACCA defines a \"violent felony\"               as\n\n     any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding\n     one year . . . that —\n\n               (i) has as an element the use, attempted use,\n               or threatened use of physical force against\n               the person of another; or\n\n               (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion,\n               involves the use of explosives, or otherwise\n               involves conduct that presents a serious\n               potential risk of physical injury to another\n               . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). The statute does not define \"serious\ndrug offense\" by reference to a similar set of characteristics.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fstatutory definition of the crime.             See United States v. Doe, 960\n\nF.2d 221, 224 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that consideration of\n\ninformation    beyond     the     statutory     definition    of    a    potential\n\npredicate offense is limited to instances in which \"a single\n\nstatutory     provision    defines       several   different       crimes\");   see\n\ngenerally United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (observing that the categorical approach centers on a court\n\n\"restricting its examination to the legislature's definition of the\n\ncrime\").\n\n            Relatedly, Moore asserts that he has been \"unfairly\n\ndeprived . . . of the results of his state-court plea bargains.\"\n\nAppellant's Br. at 12.            This assertion is jejune.              Sentence\n\nenhancements that build upon predicate offenses do not increase a\n\ndefendant's punishment for the earlier offenses but merely provide\n\na more onerous penalty for the newly-committed crime.                   Gryger v.\n\nBurke, 334 U.S. 728, 732 (1948).           This makes perfect sense because\n\nthe new crime, viewed against the backdrop of the defendant's\n\ncheckered   criminal      past,    \"is   considered   to     be    an   aggravated\n\noffense\" due to its recidivist quality.            Id.\n\n            Moore also argues that the application of the ACCA\n\nsentencing regime to his case flouts the Supreme Court's ruling in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), inasmuch as the prior\n\nconvictions were neither alleged in the indictment nor proven\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\findependently. The sentencing court rejected this argument, and so\n\ndo we.\n\n             At bottom, Moore's thesis is that, under Apprendi, the\n\nimposition of a sentence enhanced by reason of prior convictions\n\nviolates the Due Process Clause because the predicate offenses were\n\nneither charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Since the consequent fifteen-year sentence exceeds the\n\nbaseline ten-year statutory maximum, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2)\n\n(establishing baseline penalty provision for violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)), his thesis continues, the sentence cannot stand.\n\n             Moore's thesis relies on a myopic reading of the core\n\nprinciple set forth in Apprendi.            That principle holds that \"any\n\nfact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\n\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"        530 U.S. at 490.          But the Apprendi Court\n\nexplicitly exempted sentence-enhancement provisions based upon\n\nprior criminal convictions from the scope of this holding. See id.\n\n(prefacing the quoted language with the phrase \"[o]ther than the\n\nfact of a prior conviction\"). That is critically important because\n\nthe   exemption    left     intact   the    Court's   earlier     decision    in\n\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 247\n\n(1998)   —   a   decision    in   which     the   Court   upheld,   against    a\n\nconstitutional     challenge,     Congress's      decision   to   treat   prior\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fconvictions as a sentencing factor rather than an element of a\n\nfederal criminal offense.\n\n            In the post-Apprendi era, we have ruled with a regularity\n\nbordering on the monotonous that, given the explicit exception and\n\nthe force of Almendarez-Torres, the rationale of Apprendi does not\n\napply to sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal\n\nconvictions.    E.g., United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 294\n\n(1st Cir. 2002); United States v. Gomez-Estrada, 273 F.3d 400, 401-\n\n02 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1023 (2001).         In light of this\n\nunbroken line of authority, Moore's Apprendi-based thesis crumbles.\n\n            We need go no further.     For the foregoing reasons, the\n\nlower court did not err in sentencing Moore, pursuant to the ACCA,\n\nto a fifteen-year incarcerative term.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), inasmuch as the prior convictions were neither alleged in the indictment nor proven independently.

Since the consequent fifteen-year sentence exceeds the baseline ten-year statutory maximum, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2) (establishing baseline penalty provision for violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)), his thesis continues, the sentence cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore's thesis relies on a myopic reading of the core principle set forth in <i>Apprendi.</i> That principle holds that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. But the <i>Apprendi</i> Court explicitly exempted sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions from the scope of this holding. <i>See id.</i> (prefacing the quoted language with the phrase \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction\"). That is critically important because the exemption left intact the Court's earlier decision in <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) &#8212; a decision in which the Court upheld, against a constitutional challenge, Congress's decision to treat prior convictions as a sentencing factor rather than an element of a federal criminal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the post-<i>Apprendi</i> era, we have ruled with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that, given the explicit exception and the force of <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> the rationale of <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply to sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions. <i>E.g., United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 294 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Gomez-Estrada,</i> 273 F.3d 400, 401-02 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

The facts of the case are delineated in an earlier opinion of this court, <i>United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199209\"><a href=\"/opinion/199209/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 702-03 (1st Cir.2000), and it would be pleonastic to rehearse them here. For present purposes, it suffices to say that, after we set aside the district court's order suppressing certain evidence, <i>id.</i> at 704, Moore entered a guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Moore pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e), imposing a fifteen-year term of immurement. In choosing this course, the court relied upon a sentence-enhancement provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), which stipulates, inter alia, that a defendant who has at least three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense\" is subject to a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence if he later violates the felon-in-possession law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of the section 924(e) enhancement, the term \"serious drug offense\" includes \"an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Before committing the instant offense, Moore had been convicted in the Massachusetts state court system on four separate occasions for possessing cocaine with intent to deliver &#8212; a crime punishable \"by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years, or in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one-half years....\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32A(a). These were the predicate offenses upon which the sentencing court relied in invoking 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore argued at the disposition hearing that the four convictions did not constitute \"serious drug offenses\" within the purview of section 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) because they were adjudicated in the state district court &#8212; a court which, by statute, cannot impose a sentence of more than two and one-half years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, &#167; 27 (providing that a defendant convicted in a district court may not be sentenced to state prison); <i>see also id.</i> ch. 279, &#167; 23 (limiting sentences to the house of correction to two and one-half years). The court below rejected this argument, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a single offense defined in the statute, and that is possession with intent to distribute.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000), inasmuch as the prior convictions were neither alleged in the indictment nor proven independently. The sentencing court rejected this argument, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, Moore's thesis is that, under <i>Apprendi,</i> the imposition of a sentence enhanced by reason of prior convictions violates the Due Process Clause because the predicate offenses were neither charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the consequent fifteen-year sentence exceeds the baseline ten-year statutory maximum, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2) (establishing baseline penalty provision for violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)), his thesis continues, the sentence cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moore's thesis relies on a myopic reading of the core principle set forth in <i>Apprendi.</i> That principle holds that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>. But the <i>Apprendi</i> Court explicitly exempted sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions from the scope of this holding. <i>See id.</i> (prefacing the quoted language with the phrase \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction\"). That is critically important because the exemption left intact the Court's earlier decision in <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 226-27, 247, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Bradshaw,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199842\"><a href=\"/opinion/199842/united-states-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 294 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v.
