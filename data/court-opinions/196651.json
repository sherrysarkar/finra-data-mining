A panel of this court: 1) affirmed the\r\n\nconvictions  of all  defendants  for possession  of cocaine  with\r\n\nintent to distribute; 2)  affirmed the convictions of Su rez-Maya\r\n\nand  Ram rez-Ferrer for  using a  firearm in  relation to  a drug\r\n\ntrafficking offense, but reversed  the conviction of Troche-Matos\r\n\non  a  similar charge;  and 3)  reversed  the convictions  of all\r\n\ndefendants for  importation of narcotics into  the United States.\r\n\nThereafter, the full court reheard the case en banc.  The en banc\r                                                                           \r\n\ncourt  now  reverses  the   convictions  of  all  defendants  for\r\n\nimportation of narcotics into the  United States and remands  the\r\n\nfirearm  convictions for  further  consideration in  light of  an\r\n\nintervening Supreme Court decision.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The evidence, taken in the  light most favorable to the\r\n\ngovernment, United  States v.  Abreu,  952 F.2d  1458, 1460  (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 503  U.S. 994 (1992), permitted the  jury to\r                             \r\n\nfind the facts  that follow.  We emphasize the facts pertinent to\r\n\nthe importation charge.  On March 13,  1993, the Police of Puerto\r\n\nRico (\"POPR\") received an anonymous  telephone call.  The  caller\r\n\ninformed  the POPR  that  defendant Su rez-Maya  and three  other\r\n\nindividuals  had left  for Mona  Island, Puerto  Rico, in  a boat\r\n\nbelonging to a  relation of  Su rez-Maya, and that  the four  men\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwere going to acquire  a load of cocaine and ferry it to the main\r\n\nisland of  Puerto Rico.   Mona  Island is  one of numerous  small\r\n\nislands  near Puerto  Rico's  main island,  and  is part  of  the\r\n\nMunicipality of Cabo Rojo,  which also includes part of  the main\r\n\nisland's southwest corner.1   Mona Island is physically separated\r\n\nby about 39 miles of water from the main island of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          Prior  to 1989,  the  boundaries of  the United  States\r\n\nextended  three miles offshore.   United States  v. Williams, 617\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1063,  1073 n.6 (5th  Cir. 1980).   In that year,  they were\r\n\nextended by Presidential  Proclamation with qualifications to  12\r\n\nmiles.   Proclamation No. 5928,  54 Fed. Reg.  777 (1989) (citing\r\n\nthe 1982  United Nations  Convention on the  Law of  the Sea,  to\r\n\nwhich  the  U.S.  is a  signatory,  but  which the  U.S.  had not\r\n\nratified as of February,  1996).  Thus, given the  12-mile limit,\r\n\nto  travel from  Mona Island  to the main  island of  Puerto Rico\r\n\nrequires that a vessel cross international waters.\r\n\n          After verifying  that the  boat in question  was indeed\r\n\naway from its  mooring, the United States  Customs Service (USCS)\r\n\nand  POPR  flew  to  Mona  Island on  a  USCS  helicopter.    The\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The  only evidence in the record is  that defendants picked up\r                                             \r\nthe   cocaine  at  Mona  Island.     Mona  Island   is  not  just\r\ngeographically  part  of  the   Puerto  Rico  Archipelago,  which\r\nincludes the Islands of  Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, Desecheo,\r\nCaja de Muertos, Mona and Monito, as well as various other  minor\r\nislets  and keys.   Mona Island  is also politically  part of the\r\nSenatorial District of Mayaguez  and of the Municipality of  Cabo\r\nRojo  within  that district.   P.R.  Const.  art. VIII,    1, IV.\r\nThus, in effect, the defendants transported the drugs in question\r\nbetween  two points  within the  same municipality  within Puerto\r\nRico, the equivalent  of within two places within  Suffolk County\r\nin Massachusetts.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nauthorities located the subject boat and Su rez-Maya, accompanied\r\n\nby three other men as described.  At approximately 12:30 p.m. the\r\n\nnext  day, the authorities learned that the boat was leaving Mona\r\n\nIsland.   The  boat  was  interdicted  about  one  mile  off  the\r\n\nsouthwest coast of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          After  the boat was seized, it was found to be carrying\r\n\nabout  16 kilograms of cocaine.  A subsequent inventory search of\r\n\nthe boat turned up a firearm.  The   seized  firearm,   a  loaded\r\n\nrevolver,  was  found covered  by  a  T-shirt, behind  a  storage\r\n\ncompartment  near  the  location  where Ram rez-Ferrer  had  been\r\n\nseated at the time of the interdiction.  The search also revealed\r\n\nevidence linking the vessel to a relative of Su rez-Maya.\r\n\n          On March  31, 1993,  a grand jury  indicted defendants,\r\n\ncharging  all  three  in each  of  three  separate  counts.   The\r\n\nindictment   charged  each   with  possessing   approximately  16\r\n\nkilograms  of  cocaine with  intent to  distribute (count  1), 21\r\n\nU.S.C.    841(a) (1) (1994); with importing such cocaine into the\r\n\nUnited States (count 2), id.   952(a) (1994); and with possessing\r                                      \r\n\nand  carrying a firearm in  relation to a  drug trafficking crime\r\n\n(count  3),  18  U.S.C.      924(c)(1)  (1994).    A  superseding\r\n\nindictment  corrected the  description of  the seized  firearm in\r\n\ncount 3.\r\n\n          On  September  28, 1993,  a  jury  convicted all  three\r\n\ndefendants  on  each  count.   On  counts  1 and  2,  relating to\r\n\npossession and importation of cocaine, Su rez-Maya  was sentenced\r\n\nto life imprisonment, Ram rez-Ferrer to a term of 240 months, and\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nTroche-Matos to a  term of 120 months.   The sentences of Su rez-\r\n\nMaya and Ram rez-Ferrer  were enhanced under 21  U.S.C.    841(b)\r\n\nand 960(b) on account of prior drug crimes.  On count  3, the gun\r\n\ncount,  each appellant was sentenced  to a mandatory minimum term\r\n\nof  60  months to  be served  consecutively,  as required  by the\r\n\nstatute.\r\n\n          In  a decision released April 27, 1995, a panel of this\r\n\ncourt reversed  all  three defendants'  importation  convictions,\r\n\nreversed  Troche-Matos'  firearm  conviction,  and  affirmed  the\r\n\nremaining  convictions.  On June  26, 1995, this  court agreed to\r\n\nrehear the case en banc on the issue of the importation statute's\r                                 \r\n\ninterpretation.   Additionally,  the court  asked the  parties to\r\n\naddress  again  the firearms  convictions  of Ram rez-Ferrer  and\r\n\nSu rez-Maya.    The  en  banc   court  heard  oral  argument   on\r                                       \r\n\nSeptember 13, 1995.   While the  case was pending  before the  en\r                                                                           \r\n\nbanc  court, the  Supreme Court  on December  6, 1995  issued its\r              \r\n\nopinion in  Bailey v. United States,     U.S.    , 116 S. Ct. 501\r                                             \r\n\n(1995), overturning  precedent in this  and other circuits  as to\r\n\nthe proper construction of the term \"use\" in section 924(c)(1).\r\n\n        II.  THE POSSESSION CHARGE AND THE FIREARM CHARGE\r                  II.  THE POSSESSION CHARGE AND THE FIREARM CHARGE\r\n\n          On  the  possession charge  under  count  1, the  panel\r\n\nconcluded  that  the evidence  was  sufficient to  show  that the\r\n\ndefendants  knowingly possessed  the drugs  or aided  and abetted\r\n\ntheir possession.  Among  other evidence, the testimony permitted\r\n\nthe jury to conclude that the drugs  were stored in a bag with  a\r\n\nbroken  zipper  and that  the  drugs  were  plainly visible  from\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\noutside the bag, easily seen by anyone on the 20-foot  boat.  The\r\n\nen banc court did not request further argument on this issue.\r                 \r\n\n          On the  firearm charge, the story  is more complicated.\r\n\nSection 924(c)(1) is directed against anyone who \"uses or carries\r\n\na firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime\" and\r\n\nthe  district court  charged the  jury with  the language  of the\r\n\nstatute, defining  \"use\" in  accordance with circuit  precedent.2\r\n\nAssuming that  each  appellant was  aware  of the  revolver,  its\r\n\npresence on  the vessel made it available  for use to protect the\r\n\ndrugs.   The panel ruled that, assuming knowledge of the firearm,\r\n\nits proximity and potential for use permitted the jury to convict\r\n\nunder the so-called \"fortress\"  theory previously adopted by this\r\n\ncourt and others.   See,  e.g., United States  v. Wilkinson,  926\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 22,  25-26  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  111 S.  Ct. at  2813\r                                                    \r\n\n(1991).\r\n\n          The  panel had  more  difficulty with  the question  of\r\n\nwhether  a reasonable jury could find that each of the defendants\r\n\nknew that the gun was present;  unlike the drugs, the gun was not\r\n\nin  plain  view.   The panel  upheld  the conviction  of Ram rez-\r\n\nFerrer,  since  the revolver  was  located  behind a  compartment\r\n\nadjacent to his seat and served an obvious purpose to protect the\r\n\ncocaine.  The  panel also upheld  the conviction of  Su rez-Maya,\r\n\nwho was the central figure in the drug venture and the captain of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The indictment mistakenly charged the defendants  with \"having\r\npossess[ed] and carr[ied] the  firearm.\"  There is no  claim that\r\nthe variance was prejudicial error.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthe boat.  As to Troche-Matos, the court ruled that a  reasonable\r\n\njury could not infer that he knew of the weapon.\r\n\n          In their petitions for rehearing on this issue, Su rez-\r\n\nMaya and Ram rez-Ferrer  drew our attention  to United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nTorres-Maldonado,  14 F.3d 95  (1st Cir.  1994), arguing  that on\r                          \r\n\nsomewhat  similar facts  a  panel of  this  court had  found  the\r\n\nevidence   insufficient  to  support  convictions  under  section\r\n\n924(c)(1).   In that  case, the  weapon was  found in  a zippered\r\n\nopaque tote bag on a sofa in a room in which drugs and money were\r\n\nalso found, and the court concluded the evidence was not adequate\r\n\nto establish that two of the individuals  in the room actually or\r\n\nconstructively  possessed the weapon.   Id. at 102.   Despite its\r                                                     \r\n\ndiffering  outcome, Torres-Maldonado  does not conflict  with the\r                                              \r\n\noriginal Ram rez-Ferrer panel on the proper legal standards to be\r                                 \r\n\napplied.\r\n\n          Although the en banc court agreed to rehear the case as\r                                        \r\n\na whole, sufficiency of  the evidence is not normally  a question\r\n\nfor en  banc consideration unless  a mistaken legal  standard has\r                      \r\n\nbeen  used.  Any possible  tension between the  panel opinion and\r\n\nthe decision  in Torres-Maldonado stems from  their appraisals of\r                                           \r\n\ntheir own  respective  facts.    But given  the  kaleidoscope  of\r\n\ndifferent facts presented in  drug and gun cases and  the varying\r\n\ncompositions of panels  in the court, the en  banc court was, and\r                                                            \r\n\nremains, of  the view that  differences in weighing  evidence are\r\n\ninevitable  in cases of this  kind even within  a single circuit.\r\n\nNothing will  produce perfect  harmony among outcomes  unless the\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncourt  chooses to hear every drug and  gun case en banc, a course\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat is  neither practical  nor useful.   Therefore,  we conclude\r\n\nthat the full court should not seek to decide en banc whether the\r                                                               \r\n\nevidence  against  each appellant  in this  case  was or  was not\r\n\nsufficient  on the gun  charge.  As  a result, the  en banc court\r                                                                     \r\n\ndeclines to review the adequacy of the evidence on either count 1\r\n\nor count 3.\r\n\n          This  does not  end  the matter.    While the  en  banc\r                                                                           \r\n\nopinion  was being  prepared, the  Supreme Court  decided Bailey.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThere, the Supreme Court determined that a conviction for firearm\r\n\n\"use\"  under section 924(c)(1)  required \"evidence  sufficient to\r\n\nshow an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a  use\r                                   \r\n\nthat makes the  firearm an  operative factor in  relation to  the\r\n\npredicate offense.\"   Bailey,     U.S. at    , 116 S. Ct. at 505.\r                                      \r\n\nAs  far as  \"use\" is  concerned, the  Supreme Court  rejected the\r\n\nfortress  theory, disagreeing  with  the suggestion  that \"a  gun\r\n\nplaced  in  the  closet  is  'used'  because  its  mere  presence\r\n\nemboldens or protects  its owner.\"  Id.,     U.S.  at    , 116 S.\r                                                 \r\n\nCt. at 508.\r\n\n          Although  the Supreme  Court has rejected  the fortress\r\n\ntheory of \"use\" under which defendants were convicted,  the issue\r\n\nof  their  firearm  convictions   remains  unresolved.    Section\r\n\n924(c)(1) imposes a prison term upon a person who \"during and  in\r\n\nrelation to  any .  . .  drug  trafficking crime  . .  . uses  or\r\n\ncarries  a  firearm.\"   18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1)  (emphasis added).\r                 \r\n\nDefendants  were convicted on a  gun count that  went to the jury\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nwith  instructions that permitted the jury to convict if it found\r\n\nthat defendants either used or carried the weapon found under the\r\n\nT-shirt behind Ram rez-Ferrer.   The interpretive problems  posed\r\n\nby  the term \"carry\" are  apparent, given the  shadow that Bailey\r                                                                           \r\n\ncasts over previous circuit precedent.  Moreover, Bailey contains\r                                                                  \r\n\nlittle  comment  on  the  proper  scope  of  \"carry\"  in  section\r\n\n924(c)(1).   By contrast, the Supreme Court went on to state that\r\n\n\"use\" cannot extend to hypothetical situations where the offender\r\n\nhas \"hid[den  the firearm]  where he  can grab it  and use  it if\r\n\nnecessary,\"  id.,       U.S.  at     ,  116  S.  Ct.  at  508,  a\r                          \r\n\ndescription that, in the best  light for the government, includes\r\n\nthe set of  facts before this en banc panel.   However, the Court\r                                               \r\n\nwent on to state that the carry prong could cover situations that\r\n\nthe  use prong could  not, noting that  a firearm  can be carried\r\n\nwithout being used, \"e.g., when an offender keeps a gun hidden in\r                                   \r\n\nhis  clothing throughout a drug  transaction.\"  Id.,      U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n   , 116  S. Ct. at 507.  As a result, defendants' conviction for\r\n\n\"use\"   should   be   vacated,   and  they   should   face   only\r\n\nreconsideration of their convictions under the carry prong, since\r\n\nBailey  has both  limited the word  \"use\" to  the extent  that it\r                \r\n\ncannot  apply in the instant case and emphasized that \"carry\" has\r\n\nmeanings not covered by \"use.\"  Id.,      U.S. at    , 116 S. Ct.\r                                             \r\n\nat  508-09 (cautioning against  readings of  the word  \"use\" that\r\n\nrender the term \"carry\"  superfluous, and remanding two unrelated\r\n\ndefendants' convictions for consideration under the carry prong).\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          In  light of Bailey, then, we decline to decide en banc\r                                                                           \r\n\ndefendants'  firearm  convictions,  and  instead  require further\r\n\nconsideration  of count 3 under section 924(c)(1).  We think that\r\n\nthese  problems should  be  addressed in  proceedings before  the\r\n\npanel rather than the en banc court. \r                                       \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n                   III.  THE IMPORTATION COUNTS\r                             III.  THE IMPORTATION COUNTS\r\n\n          In accord with the panel's  decision, the en banc court\r                                                                     \r\n\nhas concluded that the importation statute, 21 U.S.C.   952, does\r\n\nnot embrace  defendants' conduct in transporting  16 kilograms of\r\n\ncocaine from Mona Island, Puerto Rico, to  approximately one mile\r\n\noffshore of the main  island of Puerto Rico, notwithstanding  the\r\n\nfact that  the contraband  traversed international waters  during\r\n\nthe  journey.    The  court concludes  that  this  interpretation\r\n\naccords  with  both  the  wording  of  the  statute  and  general\r\n\nprinciples of statutory construction.  Furthermore, absent either\r\n\npertinent  legislative history  or precedent,  the en  banc court\r                                                                     \r\n\nlikewise  concludes  that  the  historical  application  and  the\r\n\npotential  future application  of the  statute by  the government\r\n\nweigh in favor of this interpretation.\r\n\n                      A.  Statutory Language\r                                A.  Statutory Language\r\n\n          The defendants were convicted  under 21 U.S.C.   952(a)\r\n\nfor  importing drugs into the  United States.   In relevant part,\r\n\n  952(a) provides that\r\n\n            it shall be unlawful . . . to import into\r\n            the United States  from any place outside\r\n            thereof, any controlled substance.\r\n\nThe defendants  contend that they  did not  violate this  statute\r\n\nbecause they did  not bring the  drugs at  issue into the  United\r\n\nStates from a  \"place outside  thereof.\"  To  the contrary,  they\r\n\nargue  that the evidence in the record only establishes that they\r\n\nbrought the drugs  from one location  within the jurisdiction  of\r\n\nthe United  States  (i.e., Mona  Island)  to another  (i.e.,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nwaters  off Puerto Rico's main  island).  The  government, on the\r\n\nother  hand,  claims  that,  because  the  drugs  passed  through\r\n\ninternational waters  on their way  from Mona  Island, the  drugs\r\n\nwere  brought  into the  United  States  from  a  \"place  outside\r\n\nthereof\"   (i.e.,  international   waters).     Essentially,  the\r                          \r\n\ngovernment  argues that  the  quoted language  of section  952(a)\r\n\nestablishes   a  kind   of   transparent   curtain   around   the\r\n\njurisdictional boundaries  of the  United States,  and proscribes\r\n\nany  deliberate shipment  of drugs  through that  curtain without\r\n\nregard  to   the  \"place\"   from  which  the   shipment  actually\r\n\noriginated.\r\n\n          In Price  Waterhouse v.  Hopkins, 490 U.S.  228 (1989),\r                                                    \r\n\nthe Supreme Court stated:  \"We need not leave our common sense at\r\n\nthe doorstep  when we interpret  a statute.\"   Id. at  241.   The\r                                                            \r\n\ngovernment's newly  minted interpretation  of section  952(a) not\r\n\nonly is contrary to the plain  language of the statute, and flies\r\n\nin  the face  of  every common  and logical  meaning of  the word\r\n\n\"importation,\" but also places  at risk of prosecution thousands,\r\n\nperhaps hundreds of thousands, of persons  who up to now have not\r\n\nbeen prosecuted under this novel construction of section 952(a).\r\n\n          We should, first of all, leave no doubt as to what this\r\n\ncase is not about.  We are  not faced with a factual situation in\r                     \r\n\nwhich a defendant leaves  United States domestic territory empty-\r\n\nhanded,  proceeds  to  international   waters  or  to  a  foreign\r\n\nterritory  to  acquire  contraband  there, and  then  returns  to\r\n\ndomestic  territory with  this  contraband (for  example, when  a\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nvessel  leaves the  United  States, sails  out  to sea  where  it\r\n\nobtains  drugs from  a  \"mother ship\"  anchored in  international\r\n\nwaters,  and then  returns  to  the  United  States).    In  that\r\n\nhypothetical situation, the government might have a somewhat more\r\n\nconvincing argument  that international waters can  be deemed the\r\n\n\"place\"  from which  the controlled  substance is  being imported\r\n\ninto  the  United  States.3    While   we  might  imagine  strong\r\n\narguments  on  both sides,  we are  presently  faced with  a much\r\n\nnarrower factual situation.  We need only decide whether Congress\r\n\nintended to  treat in-transit  international waters as  a \"place\"\r                                       \r\n\nfor  purposes of  the importation  statute when  the government's\r\n\nevidence  shows that both the origination  and the destination of\r\n\nthecontrolled substance occurred within United States territory.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  We agree with the  dissent that both the day hiker  who strays\r\ninto  Canadian territory and then crosses back into the U.S., and\r\nthe tourist returning from British  territory, see dissent at 44,\r                                                            \r\nwould violate section 952 if they carry contraband drugs, because\r\nthey obviously  would be entering  U.S. territory  from a  \"place\r\noutside thereof.\"\r\n\n4     The   government   treats  defendants'   trip  across   the\r\ninternational waters  between Mona Island and  Puerto Rico's main\r\nisland as being the same as  if defendants had carried drugs from\r\nMona Island  into another  sovereign nation  and  then back  into\r\nPuerto  Rico.     Doubtless   the  latter  would   constitute  an\r\nimportation.    International waters,  however, are  not anything\r\nlike  a sovereign nation.  Waters twelve miles beyond Mona Island\r\nand the main  island of  Puerto Rico are  \"international\" in  the\r\nsense that the  vessels of  other nations  have a  right of  free\r\nnavigation  through   them.    See   54  Fed.  Reg.   777  (1988)\r                                            \r\n(Proclamation  5928,  entitled  \"Territorial Sea  of  the  United\r\nStates of America\") (citing the 1982 United Nations Convention on\r\nthe Law of  the Sea (to which the U.S. is  a signatory, but which\r\nthe U.S. had not ratified  as of January 1996)).

In its argument, the government overlooks\r\n\nthe  fact that  the text  of section  952(a) includes  a separate\r\n\nclause not  directly at issue in  this case.  With  this separate\r\n\nclause  included,   section  952(a),  entitled   \"importation  of\r\n\ncontrolled substances,\" provides\r\n\n            [i]t shall be unlawful [1] to import into\r\n            the  customs  territory  of   the  United\r\n            States  from  any  place outside  thereof\r\n            (but within the United States), or [2] to\r\n            import  into the  United States  from any\r\n            place  outside  thereof,  any  controlled\r\n            substance.\r\n\n21  U.S.C.  952(a).   The court  concludes  that, given  a proper\r\n\ninterpretation  of 21 U.S.C.   952(a), transport from one part of\r\n\nthe United  States  to another  does  not rise  to the  level  of\r\n\nimportation  simply  by  involving travel  through  international\r\n\nwaters.\r\n\n          The   definition  of   \"import\"  (\"any   bringing  in\")\r\n\nappearing  in  section 951  does not  implicate  the origin  of a\r\n\nshipment  of drugs.  Thus, the government argues that the statute\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ninternational law).

Coastal and  fishing  vessels and  private\r\nyachts commonly  navigate  interchangeably in  international  and\r\ndomestic waters when making  local trips, paying little attention\r\nto where the  one ends and the other begins,  and with no thought\r\nthat  they are making some kind of reentry into the United States\r\nupon their return to domestic waters.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndoes  not require any  inquiry into the  origin of a  shipment of\r\n\ndrugs; by the government's reading,  any shipment into the United\r\n\nStates that must pass into international waters or airspace would\r\n\nbe punishable under clause 2 of section 952(a).  However, section\r\n\n952(a)  itself  requires that  the  importation  into the  United\r\n\nStates  be \"from any place outside thereof\" (emphasis added).  It\r                                    \r\n\nis  the word \"place\" in  section 952(a), when  read together with\r\n\n\"from .  . . outside,\" that needs to be considered in the present\r\n\ncircumstances,  not just  the  word \"import.\"   The  government's\r\n\ninterpretation rests on the  assumption that Congress intended to\r\n\nfocus only on a result (i.e., each introduction of the drugs into\r                                                         \r\n\nthe  United States), irrespective of whether  its place of origin\r\n\nwas  another part  of the United  States.   But if  this were the\r\n\ncase, Congress  would not  have proscribed importation  \"from any\r                                                                       \r\n\nplace outside  thereof,\" but merely importation  \"into the United\r                                                                \r\n\nStates,\" omitting any mention of a place of origin.  Furthermore,\r\n\nwe should also consider the following test of the \"plain meaning\"\r\n\nof the word \"place\" in section 952(a).  Anyone aware of the facts\r\n\nin the record of this case, if asked, \"From what  'place' was the\r                                                                  \r\n\nillegal substance brought?\" would  answer \"From Mona Island,\" not\r\n\nas is argued, \"From international waters.\"\r\n\n          In  addition to its failure  to comport with the normal\r\n\nunderstanding    of   the   word    \"place,\"   the   government's\r\n\ninterpretation  of  clause  2   cannot  be  reconciled  with  any\r\n\nreasonable  reading of clause  1.  Clauses  1 and  2 were enacted\r\n\nsimultaneously  in 1970.   If  the phrase in  clause 2  -- \"place\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\noutside thereof\" refers to the location of the drugs  immediately\r\n\nbefore  they pass  through  the \"transparent  curtain\" into  U.S.\r\n\nterritory,  it must  be given  the same  connotation in  clause 1\r\n\nabsent  an  indication that  Congress  intended  otherwise.

The government argues that  clause 2 is\r\n\nmerely  the successor  to 21 U.S.C.    174  (enacted in  1909 and\r\n\nrepealed in  1970), whereas  clause  1 introduces  a new  concept\r\n\nadded to the  statute in 1970  out of  \"an abundance of  caution\"\r\n\nlest  some   unidentified  types  of   transportation  from  U.S.\r\n\nterritories   into   U.S.    customs   territory   might    prove\r\n\nnonprosecutable.     Although the government states that clause 2\r\n\nis the direct successor to repealed 21 U.S.C.   174, it points to\r\n\nno pre-1970 case law that would corroborate the thesis that   174\r\n\n(which  imposed  penalties against  anyone  who  \"fraudulently or\r\n\nknowingly imports  or brings  any narcotic  drug into  the United\r\n\nStates or  any territory under its control  or jurisdiction\") had\r\n\never been  construed so narrowly  as to foreclose  prosecution of\r\n\nimportation  from a U.S. territory  not part of  the U.S. customs\r\n\nterritory (e.g., the  United States Virgin Islands, Guam) to part\r                         \r\n\nof the U.S. which  is part of  the U.S. customs territory  (i.e.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nPuerto Rico, the 50  states, and the District  of Columbia).

But it is clear, that by enacting clause 1, Congress\r\ndid not proscribe such activity.\r\n\n6  Although we are charged by our dissenting colleagues with  the\r\ncommission   of  major   mayhem  to   the  canons   of  statutory\r\nconstruction, this claim may very  well be a case of whose  ox is\r\ngored.

In this\r\ncase, the suggestion that \"Mona Island is  a transshipment point\"\r\nis not only not part  of the record but is in  fact immaterial to\r\nthe  charge.     Puerto  Rico   or  Florida  or   California  are\r\ntransshipment points of imported drugs to other internal areas of\r                                                                  \r\nthe United States.

A close analysis of section  952(a) reveals\r\n\nthat the government's broad interpretation of clause 2 would both\r\n\nrender clause 1 superfluous and make it technically impossible to\r\n\nviolate.  Furthermore, the analysis makes it clear that  Congress\r\n\nconsidered  the  conduct  at  issue in  this  case  and  rejected\r\n\nproscribing it under the statute.\r\n\n          First, clause 1  proscribes the importation  of illegal\r\n\ndrugs  into the  customs territory  of the  United States  from a\r\n\nplace  outside the  customs territory  of the United  States, but\r\n\nwithin the United States.   The \"customs territory of  the United\r\n\nStates\"  is defined as \"the States, the District of Columbia, and\r\n\nPuerto  Rico.\"   See  Harmonized Tariff  Schedule  of the  United\r                              \r\n\nStates, n.2.   Thus,  clause  1 proscribes  importation from  any\r\n\nother U.S. territory not within the customs territory (e.g., U.S.\r                                                                     \r\n\nVirgin Islands, Guam) into \"the States, the District of Columbia,\r\n\nand Puerto Rico.\"\r\n\n          That  Congress  specifically  addressed this  situation\r\n\nsuggests  that it believed that the language  of clause 2 did not\r\n\nnecessarily cover  such conduct.  The  government's broad reading\r\n\nof clause  2, however,  brings any conduct  conceivably addressed\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nunder clause 1 within the coverage of clause 2.   In other words,\r\n\nany contraband shipped from a place inside the United States (but\r\n\nnot  within  the  customs  territory  --  e.g.,  the U.S.  Virgin\r                                                        \r\n\nIslands) would first pass  through international waters before it\r\n\nentered into the customs  territory of the United States.   Thus,\r\n\nthe conduct  aimed at under  clause 1 would be  proscribed by the\r\n\ngovernment's interpretation of clause 2.  Hence, the government's\r\n\nreading of clause 2 renders clause 1 completely superfluous.\r\n\n          Second,  the government's  broad  reading  of clause  2\r\n\nwould  make  it arguably  impossible  to  prosecute anyone  under\r\n\nclause  1.  Under the government's reading, the phrase \"any place\r\n\noutside  thereof\" essentially means the point  at which the drugs\r\n\nwere located  immediately before  passing into the  United States\r\n\n(i.e., the  international space  just outside the  jurisdictional\r               \r\n\nlimit of the United States).   If one applies this reading to the\r\n\nsame phrase  in clause 1, it  is impossible to violate  clause 1.\r\n\nIn  other  words,  there  is  no  \"place\"  just  outside  of  the\r\n\njurisdictional  limits of  the  customs territory  of the  United\r\n\nStates, that is also within the United States.  Any place that is\r\n\njust  outside  the customs  territory  of  the United  States  is\r\n\ninternational waters.   Thus,  arguably no individual  could ever\r\n\nviolate clause 1  because no one could  ship from a place  within\r\n\nthe United  States (but  outside the customs  territory) directly\r\n\ninto  the customs territory of the United States:  the individual\r\n\nwould always be directly shipping from  international waters.  If\r\n\na prosecutor attempted to  charge a defendant under clause  1 for\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nshipping drugs  from the U.S. Virgin Islands  to Florida (conduct\r\n\nclearly  meant to be proscribed by clause 1), the defendant could\r\n\nargue that  he  or she  did not  violate the  clause because  the\r\n\n\"place\"  from  which the  drugs were  imported  was not  the U.S.\r\n\nVirgin  Islands  but  the  international space  just  outside  of\r\n\nFlorida.   Although the prosecutor  could argue that  the \"place\"\r\n\nreferred to by the statute included  both the international space\r\n\nand  the U.S. Virgin  Islands, such a  reading  would  be hard to\r\n\nsquare with the  gloss the  government puts on  the phrase  under\r\n\nclause 2.7\r\n\n          Third, and perhaps most convincing, a close analysis of\r\n\nclause  1  reveals  that  Congress contemplated  whether  or  not\r\n\nillegal  drugs shipped from one part of the United States through\r\n\ninternational  waters and back  into the United  States should be\r\n\nprohibited under 21 U.S.C.   952.  Specifically, clause 1 evinces\r\n\nCongress'  intent  to  proscribe  such  conduct  in  the  certain\r\n\ninstances  in which drugs are imported into the customs territory\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   One  could quibble here  because national  territorial waters\r\nextend farther  than state territorial waters off any one state's\r\ncoast.  Thus,  it is possible  to argue that an  individual could\r\nviolate clause 1 by importing from the national waters (arguably,\r\noutside the customs territory, but inside the United States) into\r\nthe  state  waters.   However, the  point  fails to  undercut our\r\nanalysis  in  any  significant way.    In  other  words, even  if\r\n\"states\" in the  definition of customs territory  extends only to\r\nthe  state  jurisdictional  waters  (a  point  which  we  do  not\r\nnecessarily concede),  it seems unlikely that  in enacting clause\r\n1,  Congress was aiming only at drugs  shipped from one state out\r\ninto  national waters  and back  into that  or another  state (as\r\neverything else that would violate clause 1 would fall within the\r\ngovernment's broad interpretation of clause 2).  Moreover, such a\r\nreading  would be inconsistent with the general usage of the term\r\n\"customs territory\" in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nof the  United  States from  a  point in  the  United States  but\r\n\noutside the customs territory.  Clearly, Congress could have gone\r\n\nfurther and  proscribed any shipment of  drugs originating inside\r\n\nthe United  States that  passed through international  waters and\r\n\nentered  back  into the  United  States,  but  it  did not.    By\r\n\nexplicitly  limiting the  statute  to the  conduct proscribed  by\r\n\nclause 1, it  is fair to  infer that Congress  did not intend  to\r\n\nproscribe  the additional  conduct at  issue in  this case.   The\r\n\nreason  for this  is  clear.   In  enacting   952,  Congress  was\r\n\nattacking  classic  cases of  importation,  meaning international\r\n\nimportation, not domestic transportation, of drugs.8\r\n\n          Thus,    unlike    the   government's    reading,   the\r\n\ninterpretation adopted by the en banc court both accords with the\r                                               \r\n\nplain language of the statute and gives meaning to section 952 as\r\n\na  whole act.   However,  even  if such  were not  the case,  the\r\n\nconfusion that is patent even from the government's discussion of\r\n\nthe statute brings into play the rule of lenity,  and requires us\r\n\nto  give defendants  the  benefit of  the  doubt on  this  issue.\r\n\nRatzlaf v.

This  contention   purportedly  refutes  our\r\nsuperfluousness    argument,    yet   leaves    unexplained   the\r\ndisappearance  of   the  \"transparent  curtain\"   which  Congress\r\nenvisioned  \"around the  boundaries  of the  United States,\"  the\r\npenetration  of   which,  bearing   drugs,  \"is  the   crime  [of\r\nimportation].\"  We fail  to see how a principled  distinction can\r\nbe made  between such  an incursion into  international airspace,\r\nand the present case involving travel  between \"two U.S. points.\"\r\nThe  dissent's  \"yes if  by  water, no  if  by  air\" formula  for\r\ninstalling  its  transparent curtain  appears  to  respond to  no\r\nstatutory purpose identified by the dissent.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nwe see that the case law does not support the outcome proposed by\r\n\nthe  government.   The  government  views  precedent as  carrying\r\n\nspecial  weight  in formulating  its interpretation  of   952(a).\r\n\nThis is obviously a  principle which we generally agree  with, as\r\n\nfar as it goes.  However, the \"precedent\" on which the government\r\n\nrelies, with one exception, is inapposite.\r\n\n          The language  cited from United States  v. Peabody, 626\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1300, 1301  (5th Cir.  1980) (\"Had the  cargo of  contraband\r\n\noriginated in Texas,  that would not  alter the fact that  it was\r\n\nmeant  to reenter  the United  States from  international waters.\r\n\nThat  is enough.\"), which is  both the seminal  authority for the\r\n\ncases that follow and the anchor upon which the government relies\r\n\nfor its  interpretation  of    952(a),  is  particularly  flawed.\r\n\nAlthough the  cryptic statement in Peabody  fits the government's\r                                                    \r\n\nglove,  a reading  of  that case  clearly  demonstrates that  the\r\n\nproposition for which it stands is  total dicta, and is not based\r\n\non  even a  superficial  analysis of  the  issues raised  in  the\r\n\npresent appeal.  Indeed that opinion does not even cite   952(a),\r\n\nalthough it may  perhaps be surmised that such is  the statute at\r\n\nissue.  Nevertheless,  nothing in the factual  background of that\r\n\ncase  supports the  proposition  relied upon  by the  government.\r\n\nWithout question the  contraband in Peabody  was not coming  from\r                                                     \r\n\nanother domestic area in the  United States, Texas or  otherwise,\r\n\nand  thus the court's hyperbole was pure  dicta.  Peabody and its\r                                                                   \r\n\nprogeny constitute flimsy precedent upon which to hang one's hat.\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\n          In United  States v.

Although the drugs in question had\r                            \r\n\noriginated  in  the United  States, the  fact  is that  they were\r\n\nbrought into Mexico, and it was from there that they  entered the\r                                                    \r\n\ndomestic territory  of the United States.

In Nueva,  law enforcement\r                                                         \r\n\nauthorities  spotted  a  suspect  aircraft  traveling  from South\r\n\nAmerica  to Puerto Rico; the  authorities tracked the  plane to a\r\n\npoint  above the  ocean off  the coast  of Puerto Rico,  where it\r\n\ndropped bales of illegal drugs at a  rendezvous point for a boat.\r\n\nId. at 881-83.  Picking up contraband by going into international\r             \r\n\nwaters,  id., stands on the same footing  as going into a foreign\r                      \r\n\ncountry to do so (i.e., Friedman, Doyal, Goggin, Lueck, Phillips,\r                                                                          \r\n\nPeabody).   We do not question  that such a place  from which the\r                                                           \r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\ndefendant gains  possession of  the contraband, is  \"outside [the\r\n\nUnited States],\" and thus, that the entry from such a place, into\r                                                                     \r\n\nthe  United States, meets that element  of the importation charge\r\n\nin   952(a).\r\n\n          We  thus come to United  States v. P rez,  776 F.2d 797\r                                                            \r\n\n(9th  Cir.  1985).    This  is  the  only  case  which  factually\r\n\napproximates  the  present  one.10   There,  an  illegal load  of\r\n\nmarihuana was  transported by  boat from the  Mariana Islands  (a\r\n\nUnited   States  Trust   Territory  in   the  Pacific),   through\r\n\ninternational waters to  Guam, another U.S.  domestic area.   The\r\n\ncourt  squarely  holds  that  the  transit through  international\r\n\nwaters  is  sufficient to  sustain  an  importation charge  under\r\n\n  952(a).    It would  perhaps  have  been  helpful  for  present\r\n\npurposes,  had the deciding  court discussed the  issue with some\r\n\noriginal analysis  or some  enlightening reasoning in  support of\r\n\nits ephemeral  conclusion, but  such was  not to  be.   The court\r\n\nmerely  \"rounded up the  usual suspects,\" by  citing its Friedman\r                                                                           \r\n\ncase  (importation  from Mexico),  and  Peabody  and its  progeny\r                                                         \r\n\n(Lueck and Phillips), as being \"instructive,\" id. at 801, without\r                                                           \r\n\nproviding much more to  support the resolution of an  issue which\r\n\nit had admittedly \"never [before] addressed.\"  Id.11\r                                                            \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10   A difference is that in the  present case the two places are\r\nwithin the same jurisdiction, in fact the same municipality.

Historical Application of the Statute\r                      D.  Historical Application of the Statute\r\n\n          Actions speak louder than words.  In this case this old\r\n\nadage is not simply poetic expression, for  the interpretation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C.   952(a) promoted  by the government is most  certainly\r\n\nat odds  with the  government's past enforcement  practices under\r\n\nthis statute throughout its long life.\r\n\n          It is  difficult to  accept that Congress  intended the\r\n\ngovernment's reading  of   952(a), considering  that this reading\r\n\nof the statute has somehow lain lifeless for 25 years until given\r\n\nbreath in this  case by  the prosecution.   The government  would\r\n\nhave us believe that  throughout the life of this  statute, which\r\n\nhas been on the books in practically the same form since 1970, in\r\n\nevery  direct flight,  commercial or  private, between,  say, the\r\n\nMainland and Puerto Rico,  or the Mainland and Hawaii  or Alaska,\r\n\nor vice versa, or even between Miami and New  York, or Nantucket,\r\n\nMassachusetts and Boston, etc., all of whom at some point (or, in\r\n\nfact, throughout most of  their passage) fly within international\r\n\nairspace  before returning  to domestic territory,  the occupants\r\n\nhave always  been subject to  being charged  under this  hitherto\r\n\noverlooked definition of \"importation.\"  The government's novelty\r\n\nseems   all   the   more   striking  in   this   Circuit,   where\r\n\nnotwithstanding the hundreds  (perhaps thousands)  of such  daily\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nSpanish, and that  one of the passengers had a  map of Mexico, as\r\nwell as  a match box from  a Mexico motel, was  not sufficient to\r                                                             \r\nestablish that the marihuana had been imported from Mexico!\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nflights, the  government has somehow throughout  these many years\r\n\nnever pressed such a theory of importation.  Is this attributable\r\n\nto  prosecutorial  benevolence or  incompetence?   Certainly not.\r\n\nWhat  we have is the  tacit recognition that  such acts could not\r\n\nreasonably   be   considered   \"importation\"   within     952(a).\r\n\n\"Whatever other  statutes defendants may have  violated, they did\r\n\nnot violate this one.\"  Maravilla, 907 F.2d at 223 (Breyer, C.J.)\r                                           \r\n\n(holding  that custom agents who murdered a Dominican citizen who\r\n\nwas temporarily in the United States did not violate civil rights\r\n\nstatute because the victim was not an \"inhabitant\").\r\n\n          We  have a similar  situation with water-borne traffic.\r\n\nThere  are literally thousands of  vessels of all  sizes and with\r\n\nall  kinds  of purposes  that  daily  pass through  international\r\n\nwaters as they move between domestic areas which, without picking\r\n\nup  contraband  in  international   waters  or  visiting  foreign\r\n\njurisdictions, would  be subject to this  expanded interpretation\r\n\nof    952(a).   Not  only is  there  the obvious  marine  traffic\r\n\nbetween  the Mainland  and its  outlying domestic  areas (Hawaii,\r\n\nAlaska,  Puerto  Rico,  U.S.   Virgin  Islands,  etc.),  and  the\r\n\nconsiderable coastwise traffic in the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf and\r\n\nGreat Lakes waters which as a matter of course continuously exits\r\n\nand reenters international  waters.  There  are also hundreds  of\r\n\nthousands  of commercial fishermen, as well as those who fish for\r\n\nsport,  who  on  a  daily  basis  leave  domestic  waters,  enter\r                                   \r\n\ninternational  waters,  and  return  to  domestic  waters,  again\r\n\nwithout acquiring contraband in international waters or  entering\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nforeign  jurisdictions, who  would  be subject  to the  contested\r\n\ninterpretation   of    952(a).      However,   contrary  to   the\r\n\ngovernment's assertions at oral argument, it does not  stop here.\r\n\nFor example,  a passenger  on a commercial  whale-watching vessel\r\n\nwho   left  Provincetown,  Massachusetts,   went  thirteen  miles\r\n\noffshore into international waters  to watch these behemoths, and\r\n\nthen  reentered domestic waters would  be subject to  a charge of\r\n\nimportation if he or she had drugs when he or she originally left\r\n\nProvincetown.  A maritime worker traveling to and from an oil rig\r\n\non international waters in  the Gulf of Mexico off  Louisiana, or\r\n\non George's Bank  off New England, would  be equally exposed.   A\r\n\nsailboat  tacking  up  the  coast  would  engage  in  an  act  of\r\n\n\"importation\" every  time it reentered domestic  territory, if it\r\n\nhad contraband aboard when it  tacked out of domestic  territory.\r\n\nThe height  of absurdity,12  however, is  that  according to  the\r\n\ngovernment's interpretation  as expressed  at oral  argument, the\r\n\nact   of  leaving  domestic  territory  would  in  turn  also  be\r                           \r\n\nconsidered  an  illegal  exportation  subject  to   charge  under\r                                              \r\n\n  952(a)'s companion  provision,   953(a), even  though there was\r\n\nno  intention  or act  of visiting  a  foreign territory  or off-\r\n\nloading the  exported contraband  onto a vessel  in international\r\n\nwaters.

By its interpretation  of   952(a), the government has\r\n\nchosen to ignore  a basic rule  of statutory interpretation,  one\r\n\nfirmly  imbedded   in   the  jurisprudence   of   this   Circuit:\r\n\n\"[U]nreasonableness  of   the  result  produced   by  one   among\r\n\nalternative possible  interpretations of  a statute is  [a valid]\r\n\nreason  for rejecting  that  interpretation in  favor of  another\r\n\nwhich  would produce  a  reasonable result.\"    United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBayko, 774 F.2d  516, 522  (1st Cir.  1985) (quoting  Sutherland,\r               \r\n\nStatutory Construction,   45.12 (4th Ed. 1984)).\r                                \r\n\n          Furthermore, the undeniable fact is that section 952(a)\r\n\nhas  not been  used at  all in  the fashion  now promoted  by the\r                                     \r\n\nprosecution.

Although\r\nobviously they are  not at  issue in this  case, particularly  in\r\nview of the Government's assertions  at oral argument, they  fall\r\nwithin  the realm  of  consequences  that  will follow  from  the\r\ngovernment's proposed interpretation  of section 952(a), and  are\r\nvalid factors to be considered in determining whether Congress in\r\nenacting  that  statute  intended  the  result  espoused  by  the\r\ngovernment.   Needless to say, the  mere possibility is extremely\r\nworrisome  as nothing  of  this sort  has  ever occurred  in  the\r\nNation's history.\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nspeculation regarding  whether or not there are  other uncited or\r\n\nunreported prosecutions demonstrative of the government's view of\r\n\n  952(a).   At  oral  argument, the  government was  specifically\r\n\nasked  to produce evidence of  such a prosecution.  Nevertheless,\r\n\nthe government has failed to cite  even one case in this circuit,\r                                                     \r\n\nat any level,  reported or  otherwise, in which  a defendant  was\r\n\neven charged, much less convicted, in the manner now claimed, nor\r\n\nhas our own search revealed the existence of such a case.\r\n\n          Considering the possibility that the government may not\r\n\nhave  prosecuted  \"small quantities\"  of  drugs  transported over\r\n\ninternational  space from  a  prior United  States connection  as\r\n\nimportation under   952(a), but that similarly transported  large\r\n\namounts  have been  considered violations  of that  provision, we\r\n\nconducted our own search of reported cases.  The inquiry revealed\r\n\nthat such a distinction simply does not exist.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Yet, we are unaware of any\r\n\ncase  in   which  the  government   has  in  fact   charged  that\r\n\ntransporting the contraband from Puerto Rico  to the mainland (or\r\n\nvice versa) constituted an importation violation under   952(a).\r\n\n          Nor  is  the possibility  of  such  forbearance by  the\r\n\ngovernment  from  prosecuting  such  cases  in  the  future  very\r\n\nreassuring.

Although\r                                 \r\n\nprosecutors should perhaps  not be faulted for  seeking to expand\r\n\nthe  limits  of the  law, courts  cannot  allow themselves  to be\r\n\ncaught up  in this  euphoria.   Rather,  they are  duty bound  to\r\n\ncontain   the  government   within  established   limits.     The\r\n\ngovernment's  actions in not prosecuting such cases up to now are\r\n\npowerful evidence that Congress did not intend the interpretation\r\n\nnow promoted by the  government.  Such lengthy non-action  should\r\n\nnot be glibly overlooked.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\n          The government also claims  that the interpretation set\r\n\nforth  here would  inordinately burden  prosecutors by  adding to\r\n\ntheir burden the obligation of identifying and proving  the point\r\n\nof  origin of  drugs in  smuggling operations.   However,  when a\r\n\ndrug-laden ship coming from  an unknown point of origin  is shown\r\n\nto have traversed international waters and brought drugs into the\r\n\nUnited  States,   a  jury  could  presume,   without  more,  that\r\n\nimportation from a place outside the United States has occurred -\r\n\n- although the precise place from which the drugs emanated is not\r\n\nestablished.   Cf.  Turner v.  United States,  396 U.S.  398, 416\r                                                      \r\n\n(1970) (approving statutory permissive inference that a person in\r\n\npossession  of heroin  is  in knowing  possession of  an imported\r\n\nnarcotic  because  of  the  \"high probability\"  that  the  heroin\r\n\noriginated in a foreign country); see also Ulster County Court v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAllen, 442 U.S. 140,  156-57 (1979); Leary v.

In  other words, the government  can make\r\n\nout  a prima facie case of  importation, within the meaning of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.   952(a),  merely by  showing that a  ship carrying  drugs\r\n\nfrom  parts  unknown  has  cruised  international  waters  before\r\n\nentering the  United States.   Similar inferences would  apply to\r\n\nthe case of drugs off-loaded into this country from a mother ship\r\n\nlocated within international waters.  We therefore hold only that\r\n\na  defendant can  defeat an  importation charge  by demonstrating\r\n\naffirmatively by  competent evidence that the drugs came into the\r\n\nUnited States directly from another place that is also within the\r\n\nUnited States.   That is the case  before us.

The government never made out a prima facie\r\n\ncase that the drugs came from  a place outside the United States,\r                                                        \r\n\nas the statutory language requires.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We affirm  defendants'  convictions on  the  possession\r\n\ncounts.

I  write separately  because I believe  that neither  the\r\n\nmajority opinion  nor the dissent succeeds  in demonstrating that\r\n\nthe opposing result is absurd.  Whichever result Congress clearly\r\n\nchose to  require could not have  been rejected by  the courts as\r\n\nabsurd.   Moreover, in  my view the  interpretation given section\r\n\n952  by  the en  banc court  reflects  greater allegiance  to the\r                               \r\n\nordinary meaning of the statutory language Congress did use.\r\n\n                                             \"Dissenting\" follows\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\n          BOUDIN,  Circuit  Judge,  with whom  SELYA  and  LYNCH,\r                    BOUDIN,  Circuit  Judge,  with whom  SELYA  and  LYNCH,\r                                           \r\n\nCircuit Judges, join, dissenting.

The majority has  an endless supply of reasons why\r\n\nthe  statute does  not mean  what it  says.   But the  majority's\r\n\nopinion defies  the plain language of the statute; it contradicts\r\n\nuniform rulings in  three other circuits;  and it undermines  the\r\n\npurpose and administration of  the drug laws.  In  the majority's\r\n\neffort, scarcely a major canon of construction escapes damage.\r\n\n          The evidence showed  that the  defendants collected  16\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine hidden  on Mona Island, an island  under the\r\n\njurisdiction  of  Puerto  Rico  but  physically  separated   from\r\n\nmainland Puerto Rico by about 39 miles of water.   Assuming a 12-\r\n\nmile  limit for  U.S. territorial  waters, at  least 15  miles of\r\n\ninternational waters  separate Mona  Island from  mainland Puerto\r\n\nRico.  Any ship traveling between Mona Island and mainland Puerto\r\n\nRico is  unquestionably  outside the  United  States for  a  good\r\n\nportion of the trip.\r\n\n          In this case, the origin of the cocaine is unknown; but\r\n\nthe ship's captain  reported that it  was part of a  larger cache\r\n\nhidden on  Mona Island.   In  all likelihood,  Mona  Island is  a\r\n\ntranshipment  point.   Being  subject to  less surveillance  than\r\n\nmainland Puerto Rico, drugs can be brought to Mona Island in bulk\r\n\nfrom foreign origins and  then smuggled in smaller quantities  to\r\n\nthe  Puerto  Rico mainland  and  then to  the  continental United\r\n\nStates.   In all events, the defendants were arrested after their\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nsmall  boat crossed  from international  waters into  U.S. waters\r\n\nsurrounding Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          The  defendants  were  convicted  of  various  offenses\r\n\nincluding violation  of 21  U.S.C.    952(a) which prohibits  the\r\n\nimportation of specified drugs into  the United States.   Neither\r\n\nat  trial nor  on  appeal did  the  defendants argue  that  their\r\n\nconduct  fell  outside section  952;  but at  oral  argument, the\r\n\nparties  were  directed  by  the  original  panel  to  brief  the\r\n\nstatutory issue.  Subsequently,  the panel by a 2-to-1  vote held\r\n\nthat section 952 did not reach the defendants' conduct.\r\n\n          The panel majority's decision conflicted with a host of\r\n\ndecisions  in  the  Fifth,  Ninth  and  Eleventh  Circuits.   Not\r\n\nsurprisingly,  the full court voted  to rehear the  case en banc.\r\n\nWhat is surprising is that,  by a 4-to-3 vote, the en  banc court\r\n\nhas  now concluded  that  section  952  does  not  apply  to  the\r\n\ndefendants'  conduct in  bringing  16 kilograms  of cocaine  from\r\n\ninternational waters  to mainland  Puerto Rico.   This result  is\r\n\nwrong, and it does not take a treatise to show why.\r\n\n          1.  \"The starting  point in statutory interpretation is\r\n\n'the language [of the statute] itself.'\"  United States v.

Section 952(a)  says  that it  is\r\n\nunlawful \"to import [specified drugs] into the United States from\r\n\nany place outside thereof . .  . .\"  \"Import\" is given a  special\r                                                                           \r\n\ndefinition  for the illegal drugs  subchapter:  it  is defined to\r\n\nmean  \"any bringing in or  introduction of such  article into any\r\n\narea .  . .  .\"  21  U.S.C.   951(b).   The  prohibited area--the\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nUnited  States--is  defined  to  mean  \"all  places  and  waters,\r\n\ncontinental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United\r\n\nStates.\"  21 U.S.C.   802(28).\r\n\n          In  this case, the  defendants brought prohibited drugs\r\n\nfrom international waters between Mona Island and mainland Puerto\r\n\nRico to  within a mile or  so of the mainland  coastline, a point\r\n\nthat is unquestionably within the United States.  The drugs were,\r\n\ntherefore, brought  or introduced  \"into the United  States\" from\r\n\n\"any place outside thereof,\" namely, international waters--unless\r\n\n\"any place\"  has to  be  a land  area or  unless  \"import\" has  a\r\n\nspecialized meaning  excluding  drugs first  acquired within  the\r\n\nUnited States.\r\n\n          The   phrase  \"any  place  outside  thereof\"  assuredly\r\n\nincludes international waters.  See, United States v. Goggin, 853\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 843, 845 (11th Cir. 1988).   If drugs were manufactured on a\r\n\nship at  sea or found floating  on a raft, and  were then brought\r\n\ninto  shore by  motorboat, that  would be  an importation  from a\r\n\nplace outside the  United States.  The  juxtaposition of \"places\"\r\n\nand \"waters\" in section 802(28) was almost surely a precautionary\r\n\nredundancy.  Adding  \"waters\" to \"places\" avoids  the chance that\r\n\nanyone might mistakenly read \"places\" to mean only dry land.\r\n\n          The majority  does not  deny that  international waters\r\n\nmay be  a  \"place\" under  the  statute:   it  assumes that  drugs\r\n\nacquired from a mother  ship at sea might  be imported under  the\r\n\nstatute;  but it says that in this case defendants first acquired\r\n\nthe  drugs within the United  States, i.e., on  Mona Island.  But\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nthe  statute  says  nothing  about  where  the  defendants  first\r\n\nacquired their drugs.  Indeed, drugs \"acquired\" by a defendant in\r\n\nthe United States but  carried abroad can later be  illegally re-\r\n\nimported.   E.g., United States v. Friedman, 501 F.2d 1352, 1353-\r                                                     \r\n\n54  (9th  Cir.),  cert.  denied, 419  U.S.  1054  (1974) (transit\r                                         \r\n\nthrough Mexico).\r\n\n          As for the term \"import,\" absent a statutory definition\r\n\nthe common  connotation of foreign-country origin  might prevail.\r\n\nBut courts are  bound, Coluatti  v. Franklin, 439  U.S. 379,  392\r                                                      \r\n\nn.10  (1979),  by  Congress'  special   definition  of  \"import,\"\r                                               \r\n\nincorporated  into  section  952  by  section   951(b),  defining\r\n\n\"import\" in  relation to destination,  not origin.   E.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Peabody,  626 F.2d  1300, 1301 (5th  Cir. 1980).   This\r                           \r\n\ndefinition  applies  \"whether  or  not  such  a  bringing  in  or\r\n\nintroduction constitutes an importation within the meaning of the\r\n\ntariff laws of the United States.\"  21 U.S.C.   951(a)(1).\r\n\n          In a further  language argument, the majority  suggests\r\n\nthat its reading of section  952 is supported by a  comparison of\r\n\nsubsection (a)'s  two clauses.  The main  clause, barring imports\r\n\n\"into the United  States,\" is the core  provision whose substance\r\n\ncan be  traced back to 1909.   The other clause--added  in a 1970\r\n\nrecodification  of drug  laws--covers imports  into U.S.  customs\r\n\nterritory (the states, the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico)\r\n\nfrom any U.S.  possession.   The majority contends  that, on  the\r\n\ngovernment's reading  of the  main clause, the  customs territory\r\n\nclause is superfluous and has no independent effect.\r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\n          The origin and purpose  of the customs territory clause\r\n\nare remarkably obscure  (it appeared only in  certain House bills\r\n\nand was  nowhere  explained).   But  it  is fair  to  think  that\r\n\nsmuggling from some U.S.  possessions to the states had  become a\r\n\nproblem  and  Congress  therefore  included  language  that would\r\n\nunquestionably cover such shipments.  At the time Congress had no\r\n\nknowledge of  precisely how the main clause would be read, and it\r\n\ncertainly  had no  interest in  narrowing the  scope of  the main\r\n\nclause by implication.\r\n\n          In any event, the customs clause is neither superfluous\r\n\nnor without substantial independent application.   It is far from\r\n\nclear whether carrying drugs  aboard a scheduled non-stop airline\r\n\nflight  between  two   U.S.  points  could  ever  be  treated  as\r\n\nimportation under  the main  clause; a defendant  would certainly\r\n\nargue that for all practical purposes, drugs on such a flight are\r\n\nnever  outside the  country.    Yet such  a  flight  from a  U.S.\r\n\npossession  to  U.S. customs  territory,  say  from  Guam to  Los\r\n\nAngeles  or from  the  U.S. Virgin  Islands  to San  Juan,  could\r\n\nreadily be  prosecuted under the customs territory  clause.  That\r\n\ngeographic   content  to   the  customs  clause   eliminates  the\r\n\nmajority's superfluousness argument.\r\n\n          It is not  the government's position,  but that of  the\r\n\nmajority,  that ruptures  the superfluousness  canon.   Under the\r\n\nspecial  definition  of   import  in  section  951(b),   Congress\r\n\nenvisaged a kind of transparent curtain  around the boundaries of\r\n\nthe United States, and bringing drugs through that curtain is the\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\ncrime.    The  majority  has effectively  repealed  and  rendered\r\n\nmeaningless Congress' specialized definition, replacing it with a\r\n\nvernacular  definition  of  import  that  requires  no  statutory\r\n\ndefinition at all.\r\n\n          2.   The precedents  from other circuits,  reflecting a\r\n\npreviously  uniform application  of  the statute,  all treat  the\r                                                                \r\n\nintroduction of  drugs from international waters or international\r\n\nairspace as a  violation of the import statute.15   This has been\r\n\nthe consistent position  of the Fifth Circuit,  the Ninth Circuit\r\n\nand  the Eleventh  Circuit,  the  three  circuits whose  area  of\r\n\njurisdiction includes the  entire Pacific and Gulf  coasts of the\r\n\nUnited  States.    Until this  case,  no  circuit  has taken  the\r                                                  \r\n\ncontrary view.\r\n\n          For  example,  in affirming  a  conviction  based on  a\r\n\nshipment  intercepted in  Florida  waters, the  Fifth Circuit  in\r\n\nPeabody stated:\r                 \r\n\n          Had their cargo or contraband  originated in,\r\n          say,  Texas, that  would not  alter  the fact\r\n          that  it  was  meant  to  reenter the  United\r\n          States  from international  waters.   That is\r\n          enough.\r\n\n626 F.2d at 1301.   In Goggin, the Eleventh Circuit said  that it\r                                       \r\n\nwas  importation   to  bring  cocaine  \"into   the  country  from\r\n\ninternational  waters  or  from  airspace  in  excess  of  twelve\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n15  See United States v.

Similarly,\r\n\nin United  States v.

But it was from international waters that the defendants\r\n\nfinally \"[brought] in or  introduc[ed] . . . such  articles into\"\r\n\nthe United States, 21 U.S.C.   951(b); and reimportation is not a\r\n\ndefense to drug smuggling.\r\n\n          The present decision actually contradicts  precedent in\r\n\na fourth  circuit as well:   In United States v.  Nueva, 979 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n880  (1st Cir. 1992),  cert. denied, 113 S.

This circuit in Nueva,\r                                                                          \r\n\nquoting Goggin,  ruled that \"importation\" into  the United States\r                        \r\n\nunder section 952 \"requires  proof that the 'defendant [conspired\r\n\nto  bring] cocaine into the  country from international waters or\r\n\nairspace in excess of twelve geographical miles  outward from the\r\n\ncoastline.'\"  Id. at 884.\r                           \r\n\n          The majority's answer to all of these cases is that the\r\n\ndecisions of other circuits are ill-reasoned, or that their plain\r\n\nlanguage--adverse to the dissent--was  unnecessary, or both.  But\r\n\nnone  of  the many  different  judges who  participated  in these\r\n\ndecisions apparently  thought the statute  should be read  as the\r\n\nmajority reads it.   As of today, a  major criminal statute means\r\n\none  thing in  the 15  states of  the Fifth,  Ninth  and Eleventh\r\n\nCircuits; and it means  something eccentrically different in four\r\n\nNortheastern states and Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          This parade  of appellate cases from  other circuits is\r\n\nsurely  only a  sample of  similar prosecutions  and convictions;\r\n\nthere must  certainly be  others where,  as here,  the defendants\r\n\nwere convicted for importing  drugs from international waters and\r\n\nthen did not choose to  dispute the import charge on appeal.   By\r\n\nthemselves,  the  authorities  from  three  circuits  refute  the\r\n\nmajority's claim that  the government's reading of the statute is\r\n\nnewly minted or  at odds  with enforcement practices.   The  only\r\n\nnovelty in this case is the majority's decision.\r\n\n          3.  A final test of statutory meaning is the underlying\r\n\npurpose of the statute.   Borella v. Borden Co., 145 F.2d  63, 64\r                                                         \r\n\n                               -45-\r\r\n\n(2d Cir. 1944) (L. Hand), aff'd, 325 U.S. 679 (1945).   Congress'\r                                         \r\n\ninterest in protecting U.S. borders echoes through the history of\r                                             \r\n\nthe  statute.   In  proposing  the  legislation, the  President's\r\n\nspecial message said that the import provisions were intended \"to\r\n\nintercept [drugs] at their point of illegal entry into the United\r\n\nStates,\" and  there are  numerous  references--by the  President,\r\n\nfrom law enforcement witnesses,  and by legislators--to  guarding\r\n\nthe nation's \"borders\" against drugs.16\r\n\n          The legislators had no reason  to care one whit whether\r\n\nthe  drugs were  brought  from  international  waters or  from  a\r\n\nforeign land, so long as they crossed the U.S. boundary.  Indeed,\r\n\nCongress' indifference to origins  is reflected three times over:\r\n\nin  its  expressed purpose  to  protect  our  \"borders,\"  in  the\r\n\nexpansive phrase  \"from  any place  outside  thereof,\" and  in  a\r\n\ncompanion  statute  making  it  unlawful for  anyone  to  possess\r\n\nprohibited  drugs  on board  a  vessel \"arriving\"  in  the United\r\n\nStates unless  manifested  as cargo  or  official supplies.    21\r\n\nU.S.C.   955.\r\n\n          It  was irrelevant  to  Congress' purpose  whether  the\r\n\ndrugs were originally produced within the United States, as might\r\n\nmatter under  a tariff statute  designed to protect  U.S. markets\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n16  1969 Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States 513\r                                                                       \r\n(Presidential  message);  Hearings  on  Legislation  to  Regulate\r                                                                           \r\nControlled Dangerous Substances and Amend Narcotics and Drug Laws\r                                                                           \r\nBefore the House Ways  and Means Committee, 91st Cong.,  2d Sess.\r                                                    \r\n205  (1970) (statement of the Director of the Bureau of Narcotics\r\nand  Dangerous Drugs);  id. at  322 (statement  of Representative\r                                     \r\nPepper).\r\n\n                               -46-\r\r\n\nfrom  foreign competition  and  to  favor  local producers.

If  one\r\n\nadded  to the government's burden of proof the obligation to show\r\n\nthe point of origin, time would be spent by courts and parties on\r\n\nan issue wholly irrelevant to Congress' concern to exclude drugs.\r\n\nIn many cases, the  government would win; in some  it might lose.\r\n\nSuch proof serves no  purpose except to waste time,  squander law\r\n\nenforcement and judicial resources, and  cause occasional erratic\r\n\nacquittals of drug importers.\r\n\n          To suggest  that Congress  could not have  intended the\r\n\nstatute  to apply,  the majority  summons up  visions of  federal\r\n\nagents  arresting day  sailors or  airline  passengers transiting\r\n\nfrom one U.S. point to another with a few joints  of marijuana on\r\n\nboard.   But such dubious  results are not  avoided by distorting\r\n\nthe statute: a  day hiker with a few joints  who strayed over the\r\n\nborder  to Canada  and then back  again or  a tourist  with a few\r\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\njoints returning from London  by plane would be importing  by any\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n          More to the point, there is no record  of prosecutorial\r\n\nabuse of section 952.  Indeed, the majority twists this fact into\r\n\na claim that the government's interpretation must  therefore be a\r\n\nradical  change in  position, but  the majority has  confused two\r\n\ndifferent points.  The  government has not abused the  statute by\r\n\napplying  it  to trivial  amounts for  personal  use; but  it has\r\n\napplied it  to major  drug shipments arriving  from international\r\n\nwaters  or international air space.   As the  precedents show, it\r\n\nhas been upheld in every reported case.\r\n\n          The courts  are capable of warding  off unjust results,\r\n\nif and when they arise.  E.g., United States v.  Aversa, 984 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n493 (1st  Cir. 1993), vacated, 114  S. Ct. 873 (1994).   But such\r                                       \r\n\nsurgery is properly done  with a scalpel rather than  an axe, and\r\n\nthere  is no  cause for any  surgery here.     In this  case, the\r                                                                \r\n\ndefendants  were not day sailors or tourists; they were importing\r\n\n16 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico after a substantial trip\r\n\nthrough  international waters.    They fall  squarely within  the\r\n\npurpose, as well as the plain language, of section 952.  The rule\r\n\nof lenity has nothing to do with such a case.\r\n\n          To  conclude:   The majority  opinion is  not  short of\r\n\n\"reasons\" for  its  result; after  many  pages of  argument,  one\r\n\nemerges  half-dazed  from the  labyrinth  of  explanations.   But\r\n\nnothing the majority  says can  overcome a single  phrase in  the\r\n\nstatute--section 951(b)'s definition of \"import\" as \"any bringing\r\n\n                               -48-\r\r\n\nin  or introduction\" of  drugs into the  United States.   That is\r\n\nwhat  the defendants  did in  this case,  and that  is  why their\r\n\nconvictions under section 952 should be affirmed.\r\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n",

We emphasize the facts pertinent to\r\n\nthe importation charge.  On March 13,  1993, the Police of Puerto\r\n\nRico (\"POPR\") received an anonymous  telephone call.  The  caller\r\n\ninformed  the POPR  that  defendant Su rez-Maya  and three  other\r\n\nindividuals  had left  for Mona  Island, Puerto  Rico, in  a boat\r\n\nbelonging to a  relation of  Su rez-Maya, and that  the four  men\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwere going to acquire  a load of cocaine and ferry it to the main\r\n\nisland of  Puerto Rico.   Mona  Island is  one of numerous  small\r\n\nislands  near Puerto  Rico's  main island,  and  is part  of  the\r\n\nMunicipality of Cabo Rojo,  which also includes part of  the main\r\n\nisland's southwest corner.1   Mona Island is physically separated\r\n\nby about 39 miles of water from the main island of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          Prior  to 1989,  the  boundaries of  the United  States\r\n\nextended  three miles offshore.

In that year,  they were\r\n\nextended by Presidential  Proclamation with qualifications to  12\r\n\nmiles.   Proclamation No. 5928,  54 Fed. Reg.  777 (1989) (citing\r\n\nthe 1982  United Nations  Convention on the  Law of  the Sea,  to\r\n\nwhich  the  U.S.  is a  signatory,  but  which the  U.S.  had not\r\n\nratified as of February,  1996).  Thus, given the  12-mile limit,\r\n\nto  travel from  Mona Island  to the main  island of  Puerto Rico\r\n\nrequires that a vessel cross international waters.\r\n\n          After verifying  that the  boat in question  was indeed\r\n\naway from its  mooring, the United States  Customs Service (USCS)\r\n\nand  POPR  flew  to  Mona  Island on  a  USCS  helicopter.    The\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The  only evidence in the record is  that defendants picked up\r                                             \r\nthe   cocaine  at  Mona  Island.     Mona  Island   is  not  just\r\ngeographically  part  of  the   Puerto  Rico  Archipelago,  which\r\nincludes the Islands of  Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, Desecheo,\r\nCaja de Muertos, Mona and Monito, as well as various other  minor\r\nislets  and keys.   Mona Island  is also politically  part of the\r\nSenatorial District of Mayaguez  and of the Municipality of  Cabo\r\nRojo  within  that district.   P.R.  Const.  art. VIII,    1, IV.\r\nThus, in effect, the defendants transported the drugs in question\r\nbetween  two points  within the  same municipality  within Puerto\r\nRico, the equivalent  of within two places within  Suffolk County\r\nin Massachusetts.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nauthorities located the subject boat and Su rez-Maya, accompanied\r\n\nby three other men as described.  At approximately 12:30 p.m. the\r\n\nnext  day, the authorities learned that the boat was leaving Mona\r\n\nIsland.   The  boat  was  interdicted  about  one  mile  off  the\r\n\nsouthwest coast of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          After  the boat was seized, it was found to be carrying\r\n\nabout  16 kilograms of cocaine.  A subsequent inventory search of\r\n\nthe boat turned up a firearm.  The   seized  firearm,   a  loaded\r\n\nrevolver,  was  found covered  by  a  T-shirt, behind  a  storage\r\n\ncompartment  near  the  location  where Ram rez-Ferrer  had  been\r\n\nseated at the time of the interdiction.  The search also revealed\r\n\nevidence linking the vessel to a relative of Su rez-Maya.\r\n\n          On March  31, 1993,  a grand jury  indicted defendants,\r\n\ncharging  all  three  in each  of  three  separate  counts.   The\r\n\nindictment   charged  each   with  possessing   approximately  16\r\n\nkilograms  of  cocaine with  intent to  distribute (count  1), 21\r\n\nU.S.C.    841(a) (1) (1994); with importing such cocaine into the\r\n\nUnited States (count 2), id.   952(a) (1994); and with possessing\r                                      \r\n\nand  carrying a firearm in  relation to a  drug trafficking crime\r\n\n(count  3),  18  U.S.C.      924(c)(1)  (1994).    A  superseding\r\n\nindictment  corrected the  description of  the seized  firearm in\r\n\ncount 3.\r\n\n          On  September  28, 1993,  a  jury  convicted all  three\r\n\ndefendants  on  each  count.   On  counts  1 and  2,  relating to\r\n\npossession and importation of cocaine, Su rez-Maya  was sentenced\r\n\nto life imprisonment, Ram rez-Ferrer to a term of 240 months, and\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nTroche-Matos to a  term of 120 months.   The sentences of Su rez-\r\n\nMaya and Ram rez-Ferrer  were enhanced under 21  U.S.C.    841(b)\r\n\nand 960(b) on account of prior drug crimes.  On count  3, the gun\r\n\ncount,  each appellant was sentenced  to a mandatory minimum term\r\n\nof  60  months to  be served  consecutively,  as required  by the\r\n\nstatute.\r\n\n          In  a decision released April 27, 1995, a panel of this\r\n\ncourt reversed  all  three defendants'  importation  convictions,\r\n\nreversed  Troche-Matos'  firearm  conviction,  and  affirmed  the\r\n\nremaining  convictions.  On June  26, 1995, this  court agreed to\r\n\nrehear the case en banc on the issue of the importation statute's\r                                 \r\n\ninterpretation.

THE POSSESSION CHARGE AND THE FIREARM CHARGE\r                  II.  THE POSSESSION CHARGE AND THE FIREARM CHARGE\r\n\n          On  the  possession charge  under  count  1, the  panel\r\n\nconcluded  that  the evidence  was  sufficient to  show  that the\r\n\ndefendants  knowingly possessed  the drugs  or aided  and abetted\r\n\ntheir possession.  Among  other evidence, the testimony permitted\r\n\nthe jury to conclude that the drugs  were stored in a bag with  a\r\n\nbroken  zipper  and that  the  drugs  were  plainly visible  from\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\noutside the bag, easily seen by anyone on the 20-foot  boat.

The panel ruled that, assuming knowledge of the firearm,\r\n\nits proximity and potential for use permitted the jury to convict\r\n\nunder the so-called \"fortress\"  theory previously adopted by this\r\n\ncourt and others.

In that  case, the  weapon was  found in  a zippered\r\n\nopaque tote bag on a sofa in a room in which drugs and money were\r\n\nalso found, and the court concluded the evidence was not adequate\r\n\nto establish that two of the individuals  in the room actually or\r\n\nconstructively  possessed the weapon.

Any possible  tension between the  panel opinion and\r\n\nthe decision  in Torres-Maldonado stems from  their appraisals of\r                                           \r\n\ntheir own  respective  facts.    But given  the  kaleidoscope  of\r\n\ndifferent facts presented in  drug and gun cases and  the varying\r\n\ncompositions of panels  in the court, the en  banc court was, and\r                                                            \r\n\nremains, of  the view that  differences in weighing  evidence are\r\n\ninevitable  in cases of this  kind even within  a single circuit.\r\n\nNothing will  produce perfect  harmony among outcomes  unless the\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncourt  chooses to hear every drug and  gun case en banc, a course\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat is  neither practical  nor useful.   Therefore,  we conclude\r\n\nthat the full court should not seek to decide en banc whether the\r                                                               \r\n\nevidence  against  each appellant  in this  case  was or  was not\r\n\nsufficient  on the gun  charge.

While the  en  banc\r                                                                           \r\n\nopinion  was being  prepared, the  Supreme Court  decided Bailey.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThere, the Supreme Court determined that a conviction for firearm\r\n\n\"use\"  under section 924(c)(1)  required \"evidence  sufficient to\r\n\nshow an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a  use\r                                   \r\n\nthat makes the  firearm an  operative factor in  relation to  the\r\n\npredicate offense.\"   Bailey,     U.S. at    , 116 S. Ct. at 505.\r                                      \r\n\nAs  far as  \"use\" is  concerned, the  Supreme Court  rejected the\r\n\nfortress  theory, disagreeing  with  the suggestion  that \"a  gun\r\n\nplaced  in  the  closet  is  'used'  because  its  mere  presence\r\n\nemboldens or protects  its owner.\"  Id.,     U.S.  at    , 116 S.\r                                                 \r\n\nCt. at 508.\r\n\n          Although  the Supreme  Court has rejected  the fortress\r\n\ntheory of \"use\" under which defendants were convicted,  the issue\r\n\nof  their  firearm  convictions   remains  unresolved.    Section\r\n\n924(c)(1) imposes a prison term upon a person who \"during and  in\r\n\nrelation to  any .  . .  drug  trafficking crime  . .  . uses  or\r\n\ncarries  a  firearm.\"   18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1)  (emphasis added).\r                 \r\n\nDefendants  were convicted on a  gun count that  went to the jury\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nwith  instructions that permitted the jury to convict if it found\r\n\nthat defendants either used or carried the weapon found under the\r\n\nT-shirt behind Ram rez-Ferrer.   The interpretive problems  posed\r\n\nby  the term \"carry\" are  apparent, given the  shadow that Bailey\r                                                                           \r\n\ncasts over previous circuit precedent.  Moreover, Bailey contains\r                                                                  \r\n\nlittle  comment  on  the  proper  scope  of  \"carry\"  in  section\r\n\n924(c)(1).   By contrast, the Supreme Court went on to state that\r\n\n\"use\" cannot extend to hypothetical situations where the offender\r\n\nhas \"hid[den  the firearm]  where he  can grab it  and use  it if\r\n\nnecessary,\"  id.,       U.S.  at     ,  116  S.  Ct.  at  508,  a\r                          \r\n\ndescription that, in the best  light for the government, includes\r\n\nthe set of  facts before this en banc panel.   However, the Court\r                                               \r\n\nwent on to state that the carry prong could cover situations that\r\n\nthe  use prong could  not, noting that  a firearm  can be carried\r\n\nwithout being used, \"e.g., when an offender keeps a gun hidden in\r                                   \r\n\nhis  clothing throughout a drug  transaction.\"  Id.,      U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n   , 116  S. Ct. at 507.  As a result, defendants' conviction for\r\n\n\"use\"   should   be   vacated,   and  they   should   face   only\r\n\nreconsideration of their convictions under the carry prong, since\r\n\nBailey  has both  limited the word  \"use\" to  the extent  that it\r                \r\n\ncannot  apply in the instant case and emphasized that \"carry\" has\r\n\nmeanings not covered by \"use.\"  Id.,      U.S. at    , 116 S. Ct.\r                                             \r\n\nat  508-09 (cautioning against  readings of  the word  \"use\" that\r\n\nrender the term \"carry\"  superfluous, and remanding two unrelated\r\n\ndefendants' convictions for consideration under the carry prong).\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          In  light of Bailey, then, we decline to decide en banc\r                                                                           \r\n\ndefendants'  firearm  convictions,  and  instead  require further\r\n\nconsideration  of count 3 under section 924(c)(1).  We think that\r\n\nthese  problems should  be  addressed in  proceedings before  the\r\n\npanel rather than the en banc court. \r                                       \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n                   III.  THE IMPORTATION COUNTS\r                             III.  THE IMPORTATION COUNTS\r\n\n          In accord with the panel's  decision, the en banc court\r                                                                     \r\n\nhas concluded that the importation statute, 21 U.S.C.   952, does\r\n\nnot embrace  defendants' conduct in transporting  16 kilograms of\r\n\ncocaine from Mona Island, Puerto Rico, to  approximately one mile\r\n\noffshore of the main  island of Puerto Rico, notwithstanding  the\r\n\nfact that  the contraband  traversed international waters  during\r\n\nthe  journey.    The  court concludes  that  this  interpretation\r\n\naccords  with  both  the  wording  of  the  statute  and  general\r\n\nprinciples of statutory construction.  Furthermore, absent either\r\n\npertinent  legislative history  or precedent,  the en  banc court\r                                                                     \r\n\nlikewise  concludes  that  the  historical  application  and  the\r\n\npotential  future application  of the  statute by  the government\r\n\nweigh in favor of this interpretation.\r\n\n                      A.  Statutory Language\r                                A.  Statutory Language\r\n\n          The defendants were convicted  under 21 U.S.C.   952(a)\r\n\nfor  importing drugs into the  United States.   In relevant part,\r\n\n  952(a) provides that\r\n\n            it shall be unlawful . . . to import into\r\n            the United States  from any place outside\r\n            thereof, any controlled substance.\r\n\nThe defendants  contend that they  did not  violate this  statute\r\n\nbecause they did  not bring the  drugs at  issue into the  United\r\n\nStates from a  \"place outside  thereof.\"  To  the contrary,  they\r\n\nargue  that the evidence in the record only establishes that they\r\n\nbrought the drugs  from one location  within the jurisdiction  of\r\n\nthe United  States  (i.e., Mona  Island)  to another  (i.e.,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nwaters  off Puerto Rico's main  island).  The  government, on the\r\n\nother  hand,  claims  that,  because  the  drugs  passed  through\r\n\ninternational waters  on their way  from Mona  Island, the  drugs\r\n\nwere  brought  into the  United  States  from  a  \"place  outside\r\n\nthereof\"   (i.e.,  international   waters).     Essentially,  the\r                          \r\n\ngovernment  argues that  the  quoted language  of section  952(a)\r\n\nestablishes   a  kind   of   transparent   curtain   around   the\r\n\njurisdictional boundaries  of the  United States,  and proscribes\r\n\nany  deliberate shipment  of drugs  through that  curtain without\r\n\nregard  to   the  \"place\"   from  which  the   shipment  actually\r\n\noriginated.\r\n\n          In Price  Waterhouse v.

We are  not faced with a factual situation in\r                     \r\n\nwhich a defendant leaves  United States domestic territory empty-\r\n\nhanded,  proceeds  to  international   waters  or  to  a  foreign\r\n\nterritory  to  acquire  contraband  there, and  then  returns  to\r\n\ndomestic  territory with  this  contraband (for  example, when  a\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nvessel  leaves the  United  States, sails  out  to sea  where  it\r\n\nobtains  drugs from  a  \"mother ship\"  anchored in  international\r\n\nwaters,  and then  returns  to  the  United  States).    In  that\r\n\nhypothetical situation, the government might have a somewhat more\r\n\nconvincing argument  that international waters can  be deemed the\r\n\n\"place\"  from which  the controlled  substance is  being imported\r\n\ninto  the  United  States.3    While   we  might  imagine  strong\r\n\narguments  on  both sides,  we are  presently  faced with  a much\r\n\nnarrower factual situation.  We need only decide whether Congress\r\n\nintended to  treat in-transit  international waters as  a \"place\"\r                                       \r\n\nfor  purposes of  the importation  statute when  the government's\r\n\nevidence  shows that both the origination  and the destination of\r\n\nthecontrolled substance occurred within United States territory.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  We agree with the  dissent that both the day hiker  who strays\r\ninto  Canadian territory and then crosses back into the U.S., and\r\nthe tourist returning from British  territory, see dissent at 44,\r                                                            \r\nwould violate section 952 if they carry contraband drugs, because\r\nthey obviously  would be entering  U.S. territory  from a  \"place\r\noutside thereof.\"\r\n\n4     The   government   treats  defendants'   trip  across   the\r\ninternational waters  between Mona Island and  Puerto Rico's main\r\nisland as being the same as  if defendants had carried drugs from\r\nMona Island  into another  sovereign nation  and  then back  into\r\nPuerto  Rico.     Doubtless   the  latter  would   constitute  an\r\nimportation.    International waters,  however, are  not anything\r\nlike  a sovereign nation.  Waters twelve miles beyond Mona Island\r\nand the main  island of  Puerto Rico are  \"international\" in  the\r\nsense that the  vessels of  other nations  have a  right of  free\r\nnavigation  through   them.

In its argument, the government overlooks\r\n\nthe  fact that  the text  of section  952(a) includes  a separate\r\n\nclause not  directly at issue in  this case.  With  this separate\r\n\nclause  included,   section  952(a),  entitled   \"importation  of\r\n\ncontrolled substances,\" provides\r\n\n            [i]t shall be unlawful [1] to import into\r\n            the  customs  territory  of   the  United\r\n            States  from  any  place outside  thereof\r\n            (but within the United States), or [2] to\r\n            import  into the  United States  from any\r\n            place  outside  thereof,  any  controlled\r\n            substance.\r\n\n21  U.S.C.  952(a).   The court  concludes  that, given  a proper\r\n\ninterpretation  of 21 U.S.C.   952(a), transport from one part of\r\n\nthe United  States  to another  does  not rise  to the  level  of\r\n\nimportation  simply  by  involving travel  through  international\r\n\nwaters.\r\n\n          The   definition  of   \"import\"  (\"any   bringing  in\")\r\n\nappearing  in  section 951  does not  implicate  the origin  of a\r\n\nshipment  of drugs.  Thus, the government argues that the statute\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ninternational law).

Coastal and  fishing  vessels and  private\r\nyachts commonly  navigate  interchangeably in  international  and\r\ndomestic waters when making  local trips, paying little attention\r\nto where the  one ends and the other begins,  and with no thought\r\nthat  they are making some kind of reentry into the United States\r\nupon their return to domestic waters.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndoes  not require any  inquiry into the  origin of a  shipment of\r\n\ndrugs; by the government's reading,  any shipment into the United\r\n\nStates that must pass into international waters or airspace would\r\n\nbe punishable under clause 2 of section 952(a).  However, section\r\n\n952(a)  itself  requires that  the  importation  into the  United\r\n\nStates  be \"from any place outside thereof\" (emphasis added).  It\r                                    \r\n\nis  the word \"place\" in  section 952(a), when  read together with\r\n\n\"from .  . . outside,\" that needs to be considered in the present\r\n\ncircumstances,  not just  the  word \"import.\"   The  government's\r\n\ninterpretation rests on the  assumption that Congress intended to\r\n\nfocus only on a result (i.e., each introduction of the drugs into\r                                                         \r\n\nthe  United States), irrespective of whether  its place of origin\r\n\nwas  another part  of the United  States.   But if  this were the\r\n\ncase, Congress  would not  have proscribed importation  \"from any\r                                                                       \r\n\nplace outside  thereof,\" but merely importation  \"into the United\r                                                                \r\n\nStates,\" omitting any mention of a place of origin.  Furthermore,\r\n\nwe should also consider the following test of the \"plain meaning\"\r\n\nof the word \"place\" in section 952(a).  Anyone aware of the facts\r\n\nin the record of this case, if asked, \"From what  'place' was the\r                                                                  \r\n\nillegal substance brought?\" would  answer \"From Mona Island,\" not\r\n\nas is argued, \"From international waters.\"\r\n\n          In  addition to its failure  to comport with the normal\r\n\nunderstanding    of   the   word    \"place,\"   the   government's\r\n\ninterpretation  of  clause  2   cannot  be  reconciled  with  any\r\n\nreasonable  reading of clause  1.  Clauses  1 and  2 were enacted\r\n\nsimultaneously  in 1970.   If  the phrase in  clause 2  -- \"place\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\noutside thereof\" refers to the location of the drugs  immediately\r\n\nbefore  they pass  through  the \"transparent  curtain\" into  U.S.\r\n\nterritory,  it must  be given  the same  connotation in  clause 1\r\n\nabsent  an  indication that  Congress  intended  otherwise.

The government argues that  clause 2 is\r\n\nmerely  the successor  to 21 U.S.C.    174  (enacted in  1909 and\r\n\nrepealed in  1970), whereas  clause  1 introduces  a new  concept\r\n\nadded to the  statute in 1970  out of  \"an abundance of  caution\"\r\n\nlest  some   unidentified  types  of   transportation  from  U.S.\r\n\nterritories   into   U.S.    customs   territory   might    prove\r\n\nnonprosecutable.     Although the government states that clause 2\r\n\nis the direct successor to repealed 21 U.S.C.   174, it points to\r\n\nno pre-1970 case law that would corroborate the thesis that   174\r\n\n(which  imposed  penalties against  anyone  who  \"fraudulently or\r\n\nknowingly imports  or brings  any narcotic  drug into  the United\r\n\nStates or  any territory under its control  or jurisdiction\") had\r\n\never been  construed so narrowly  as to foreclose  prosecution of\r\n\nimportation  from a U.S. territory  not part of  the U.S. customs\r\n\nterritory (e.g., the  United States Virgin Islands, Guam) to part\r                         \r\n\nof the U.S. which  is part of  the U.S. customs territory  (i.e.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nPuerto Rico, the 50  states, and the District  of Columbia).

A close analysis of section  952(a) reveals\r\n\nthat the government's broad interpretation of clause 2 would both\r\n\nrender clause 1 superfluous and make it technically impossible to\r\n\nviolate.  Furthermore, the analysis makes it clear that  Congress\r\n\nconsidered  the  conduct  at  issue in  this  case  and  rejected\r\n\nproscribing it under the statute.\r\n\n          First, clause 1  proscribes the importation  of illegal\r\n\ndrugs  into the  customs territory  of the  United States  from a\r\n\nplace  outside the  customs territory  of the United  States, but\r\n\nwithin the United States.   The \"customs territory of  the United\r\n\nStates\"  is defined as \"the States, the District of Columbia, and\r\n\nPuerto  Rico.\"   See  Harmonized Tariff  Schedule  of the  United\r                              \r\n\nStates, n.2.   Thus,  clause  1 proscribes  importation from  any\r\n\nother U.S. territory not within the customs territory (e.g., U.S.\r                                                                     \r\n\nVirgin Islands, Guam) into \"the States, the District of Columbia,\r\n\nand Puerto Rico.\"\r\n\n          That  Congress  specifically  addressed this  situation\r\n\nsuggests  that it believed that the language  of clause 2 did not\r\n\nnecessarily cover  such conduct.  The  government's broad reading\r\n\nof clause  2, however,  brings any conduct  conceivably addressed\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nunder clause 1 within the coverage of clause 2.   In other words,\r\n\nany contraband shipped from a place inside the United States (but\r\n\nnot  within  the  customs  territory  --  e.g.,  the U.S.  Virgin\r                                                        \r\n\nIslands) would first pass  through international waters before it\r\n\nentered into the customs  territory of the United States.   Thus,\r\n\nthe conduct  aimed at under  clause 1 would be  proscribed by the\r\n\ngovernment's interpretation of clause 2.  Hence, the government's\r\n\nreading of clause 2 renders clause 1 completely superfluous.\r\n\n          Second,  the government's  broad  reading  of clause  2\r\n\nwould  make  it arguably  impossible  to  prosecute anyone  under\r\n\nclause  1.  Under the government's reading, the phrase \"any place\r\n\noutside  thereof\" essentially means the point  at which the drugs\r\n\nwere located  immediately before  passing into the  United States\r\n\n(i.e., the  international space  just outside the  jurisdictional\r               \r\n\nlimit of the United States).   If one applies this reading to the\r\n\nsame phrase  in clause 1, it  is impossible to violate  clause 1.\r\n\nIn  other  words,  there  is  no  \"place\"  just  outside  of  the\r\n\njurisdictional  limits of  the  customs territory  of the  United\r\n\nStates, that is also within the United States.  Any place that is\r\n\njust  outside  the customs  territory  of  the United  States  is\r\n\ninternational waters.   Thus,  arguably no individual  could ever\r\n\nviolate clause 1  because no one could  ship from a place  within\r\n\nthe United  States (but  outside the customs  territory) directly\r\n\ninto  the customs territory of the United States:  the individual\r\n\nwould always be directly shipping from  international waters.  If\r\n\na prosecutor attempted to  charge a defendant under clause  1 for\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nshipping drugs  from the U.S. Virgin Islands  to Florida (conduct\r\n\nclearly  meant to be proscribed by clause 1), the defendant could\r\n\nargue that  he  or she  did not  violate the  clause because  the\r\n\n\"place\"  from  which the  drugs were  imported  was not  the U.S.\r\n\nVirgin  Islands  but  the  international space  just  outside  of\r\n\nFlorida.   Although the prosecutor  could argue that  the \"place\"\r\n\nreferred to by the statute included  both the international space\r\n\nand  the U.S. Virgin  Islands, such a  reading  would  be hard to\r\n\nsquare with the  gloss the  government puts on  the phrase  under\r\n\nclause 2.7\r\n\n          Third, and perhaps most convincing, a close analysis of\r\n\nclause  1  reveals  that  Congress contemplated  whether  or  not\r\n\nillegal  drugs shipped from one part of the United States through\r\n\ninternational  waters and back  into the United  States should be\r\n\nprohibited under 21 U.S.C.   952.  Specifically, clause 1 evinces\r\n\nCongress'  intent  to  proscribe  such  conduct  in  the  certain\r\n\ninstances  in which drugs are imported into the customs territory\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   One  could quibble here  because national  territorial waters\r\nextend farther  than state territorial waters off any one state's\r\ncoast.  Thus,  it is possible  to argue that an  individual could\r\nviolate clause 1 by importing from the national waters (arguably,\r\noutside the customs territory, but inside the United States) into\r\nthe  state  waters.   However, the  point  fails to  undercut our\r\nanalysis  in  any  significant way.    In  other  words, even  if\r\n\"states\" in the  definition of customs territory  extends only to\r\nthe  state  jurisdictional  waters  (a  point  which  we  do  not\r\nnecessarily concede),  it seems unlikely that  in enacting clause\r\n1,  Congress was aiming only at drugs  shipped from one state out\r\ninto  national waters  and back  into that  or another  state (as\r\neverything else that would violate clause 1 would fall within the\r\ngovernment's broad interpretation of clause 2).  Moreover, such a\r\nreading  would be inconsistent with the general usage of the term\r\n\"customs territory\" in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nof the  United  States from  a  point in  the  United States  but\r\n\noutside the customs territory.  Clearly, Congress could have gone\r\n\nfurther and  proscribed any shipment of  drugs originating inside\r\n\nthe United  States that  passed through international  waters and\r\n\nentered  back  into the  United  States,  but  it  did not.    By\r\n\nexplicitly  limiting the  statute  to the  conduct proscribed  by\r\n\nclause 1, it  is fair to  infer that Congress  did not intend  to\r\n\nproscribe  the additional  conduct at  issue in  this case.   The\r\n\nreason  for this  is  clear.   In  enacting   952,  Congress  was\r\n\nattacking  classic  cases of  importation,  meaning international\r\n\nimportation, not domestic transportation, of drugs.8\r\n\n          Thus,    unlike    the   government's    reading,   the\r\n\ninterpretation adopted by the en banc court both accords with the\r                                               \r\n\nplain language of the statute and gives meaning to section 952 as\r\n\na  whole act.   However,  even  if such  were not  the case,  the\r\n\nconfusion that is patent even from the government's discussion of\r\n\nthe statute brings into play the rule of lenity,  and requires us\r\n\nto  give defendants  the  benefit of  the  doubt on  this  issue.\r\n\nRatzlaf v.

In this case this old\r\n\nadage is not simply poetic expression, for  the interpretation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C.   952(a) promoted  by the government is most  certainly\r\n\nat odds  with the  government's past enforcement  practices under\r\n\nthis statute throughout its long life.\r\n\n          It is  difficult to  accept that Congress  intended the\r\n\ngovernment's reading  of   952(a), considering  that this reading\r\n\nof the statute has somehow lain lifeless for 25 years until given\r\n\nbreath in this  case by  the prosecution.   The government  would\r\n\nhave us believe that  throughout the life of this  statute, which\r\n\nhas been on the books in practically the same form since 1970, in\r\n\nevery  direct flight,  commercial or  private, between,  say, the\r\n\nMainland and Puerto Rico,  or the Mainland and Hawaii  or Alaska,\r\n\nor vice versa, or even between Miami and New  York, or Nantucket,\r\n\nMassachusetts and Boston, etc., all of whom at some point (or, in\r\n\nfact, throughout most of  their passage) fly within international\r\n\nairspace  before returning  to domestic territory,  the occupants\r\n\nhave always  been subject to  being charged  under this  hitherto\r\n\noverlooked definition of \"importation.\"  The government's novelty\r\n\nseems   all   the   more   striking  in   this   Circuit,   where\r\n\nnotwithstanding the hundreds  (perhaps thousands)  of such  daily\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nSpanish, and that  one of the passengers had a  map of Mexico, as\r\nwell as  a match box from  a Mexico motel, was  not sufficient to\r                                                             \r\nestablish that the marihuana had been imported from Mexico!\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nflights, the  government has somehow throughout  these many years\r\n\nnever pressed such a theory of importation.  Is this attributable\r\n\nto  prosecutorial  benevolence or  incompetence?   Certainly not.\r\n\nWhat  we have is the  tacit recognition that  such acts could not\r\n\nreasonably   be   considered   \"importation\"   within     952(a).\r\n\n\"Whatever other  statutes defendants may have  violated, they did\r\n\nnot violate this one.\"  Maravilla, 907 F.2d at 223 (Breyer, C.J.)\r                                           \r\n\n(holding  that custom agents who murdered a Dominican citizen who\r\n\nwas temporarily in the United States did not violate civil rights\r\n\nstatute because the victim was not an \"inhabitant\").\r\n\n          We  have a similar  situation with water-borne traffic.\r\n\nThere  are literally thousands of  vessels of all  sizes and with\r\n\nall  kinds  of purposes  that  daily  pass through  international\r\n\nwaters as they move between domestic areas which, without picking\r\n\nup  contraband  in  international   waters  or  visiting  foreign\r\n\njurisdictions, would  be subject to this  expanded interpretation\r\n\nof    952(a).   Not  only is  there  the obvious  marine  traffic\r\n\nbetween  the Mainland  and its  outlying domestic  areas (Hawaii,\r\n\nAlaska,  Puerto  Rico,  U.S.   Virgin  Islands,  etc.),  and  the\r\n\nconsiderable coastwise traffic in the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf and\r\n\nGreat Lakes waters which as a matter of course continuously exits\r\n\nand reenters international  waters.  There  are also hundreds  of\r\n\nthousands  of commercial fishermen, as well as those who fish for\r\n\nsport,  who  on  a  daily  basis  leave  domestic  waters,  enter\r                                   \r\n\ninternational  waters,  and  return  to  domestic  waters,  again\r\n\nwithout acquiring contraband in international waters or  entering\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nforeign  jurisdictions, who  would  be subject  to the  contested\r\n\ninterpretation   of    952(a).      However,   contrary  to   the\r\n\ngovernment's assertions at oral argument, it does not  stop here.\r\n\nFor example,  a passenger  on a commercial  whale-watching vessel\r\n\nwho   left  Provincetown,  Massachusetts,   went  thirteen  miles\r\n\noffshore into international waters  to watch these behemoths, and\r\n\nthen  reentered domestic waters would  be subject to  a charge of\r\n\nimportation if he or she had drugs when he or she originally left\r\n\nProvincetown.  A maritime worker traveling to and from an oil rig\r\n\non international waters in  the Gulf of Mexico off  Louisiana, or\r\n\non George's Bank  off New England, would  be equally exposed.   A\r\n\nsailboat  tacking  up  the  coast  would  engage  in  an  act  of\r\n\n\"importation\" every  time it reentered domestic  territory, if it\r\n\nhad contraband aboard when it  tacked out of domestic  territory.\r\n\nThe height  of absurdity,12  however, is  that  according to  the\r\n\ngovernment's interpretation  as expressed  at oral  argument, the\r\n\nact   of  leaving  domestic  territory  would  in  turn  also  be\r                           \r\n\nconsidered  an  illegal  exportation  subject  to   charge  under\r                                              \r\n\n  952(a)'s companion  provision,   953(a), even  though there was\r\n\nno  intention  or act  of visiting  a  foreign territory  or off-\r\n\nloading the  exported contraband  onto a vessel  in international\r\n\nwaters.   Thus, under  this scenario,  a sailboat tacking  twenty\r\n\ntimes up  the East Coast of  the United States from  Miami to New\r\n\nYork,  which had  aboard  illegal substances  acquired in  Miami,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12  See In re Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109880\"><a href=\"/opinion/109880/trans-alaska-pipeline-rate-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643\r                                                        \r\n(1978)  (holding  that  an  absurd  result  militates  against  a\r\nproposed statutory interpretation).  \r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nwould  be  subject to  being  charged with  twenty  violations of\r\n\nexportation under   953(a), and  twenty violations of importation\r\n\nunder   952(a),  one  for each  time it  tacked out  to and  from\r\n\ninternational waters.\r\n\n          As if the above scenarios were not ludicrous enough, at\r\n\noral  argument, the government also informed us that in the above\r\n\nsituations,  since international  borders  were  crossed,  border\r\n\ncrossing  rules  are  applicable,  with  all  of  the  consequent\r\n\ndiminished Fourth Amendment implications such circumstances bring\r\n\ninto play.

In  other words, the government  can make\r\n\nout  a prima facie case of  importation, within the meaning of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.   952(a),  merely by  showing that a  ship carrying  drugs\r\n\nfrom  parts  unknown  has  cruised  international  waters  before\r\n\nentering the  United States.   Similar inferences would  apply to\r\n\nthe case of drugs off-loaded into this country from a mother ship\r\n\nlocated within international waters.  We therefore hold only that\r\n\na  defendant can  defeat an  importation charge  by demonstrating\r\n\naffirmatively by  competent evidence that the drugs came into the\r\n\nUnited States directly from another place that is also within the\r\n\nUnited States.

Whichever result Congress clearly\r\n\nchose to  require could not have  been rejected by  the courts as\r\n\nabsurd.   Moreover, in  my view the  interpretation given section\r\n\n952  by  the en  banc court  reflects  greater allegiance  to the\r                               \r\n\nordinary meaning of the statutory language Congress did use.\r\n\n                                             \"Dissenting\" follows\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\n          BOUDIN,  Circuit  Judge,  with whom  SELYA  and  LYNCH,\r                    BOUDIN,  Circuit  Judge,  with whom  SELYA  and  LYNCH,\r                                           \r\n\nCircuit Judges, join, dissenting.  Dr. Johnson once remarked that\r          Circuit Judges, join, dissenting\r                        \r\n\na man may  have a reason why 2 plus 2  equals 5 but it will still\r\n\nequal  but 4.  The majority has  an endless supply of reasons why\r\n\nthe  statute does  not mean  what it  says.   But the  majority's\r\n\nopinion defies  the plain language of the statute; it contradicts\r\n\nuniform rulings in  three other circuits;  and it undermines  the\r\n\npurpose and administration of  the drug laws.  In  the majority's\r\n\neffort, scarcely a major canon of construction escapes damage.\r\n\n          The evidence showed  that the  defendants collected  16\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine hidden  on Mona Island, an island  under the\r\n\njurisdiction  of  Puerto  Rico  but  physically  separated   from\r\n\nmainland Puerto Rico by about 39 miles of water.   Assuming a 12-\r\n\nmile  limit for  U.S. territorial  waters, at  least 15  miles of\r\n\ninternational waters  separate Mona  Island from  mainland Puerto\r\n\nRico.  Any ship traveling between Mona Island and mainland Puerto\r\n\nRico is  unquestionably  outside the  United  States for  a  good\r\n\nportion of the trip.\r\n\n          In this case, the origin of the cocaine is unknown; but\r\n\nthe ship's captain  reported that it  was part of a  larger cache\r\n\nhidden on  Mona Island.   In  all likelihood,  Mona  Island is  a\r\n\ntranshipment  point.   Being  subject to  less surveillance  than\r\n\nmainland Puerto Rico, drugs can be brought to Mona Island in bulk\r\n\nfrom foreign origins and  then smuggled in smaller quantities  to\r\n\nthe  Puerto  Rico mainland  and  then to  the  continental United\r\n\nStates.   In all events, the defendants were arrested after their\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nsmall  boat crossed  from international  waters into  U.S. waters\r\n\nsurrounding Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          The  defendants  were  convicted  of  various  offenses\r\n\nincluding violation  of 21  U.S.C.    952(a) which prohibits  the\r\n\nimportation of specified drugs into  the United States.   Neither\r\n\nat  trial nor  on  appeal did  the  defendants argue  that  their\r\n\nconduct  fell  outside section  952;  but at  oral  argument, the\r\n\nparties  were  directed  by  the  original  panel  to  brief  the\r\n\nstatutory issue.  Subsequently,  the panel by a 2-to-1  vote held\r\n\nthat section 952 did not reach the defendants' conduct.\r\n\n          The panel majority's decision conflicted with a host of\r\n\ndecisions  in  the  Fifth,  Ninth  and  Eleventh  Circuits.   Not\r\n\nsurprisingly,  the full court voted  to rehear the  case en banc.\r\n\nWhat is surprising is that,  by a 4-to-3 vote, the en  banc court\r\n\nhas  now concluded  that  section  952  does  not  apply  to  the\r\n\ndefendants'  conduct in  bringing  16 kilograms  of cocaine  from\r\n\ninternational waters  to mainland  Puerto Rico.   This result  is\r\n\nwrong, and it does not take a treatise to show why.\r\n\n          1.  \"The starting  point in statutory interpretation is\r\n\n'the language [of the statute] itself.'\"  United States v.

The  prohibited area--the\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nUnited  States--is  defined  to  mean  \"all  places  and  waters,\r\n\ncontinental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United\r\n\nStates.\"  21 U.S.C.   802(28).\r\n\n          In  this case, the  defendants brought prohibited drugs\r\n\nfrom international waters between Mona Island and mainland Puerto\r\n\nRico to  within a mile or  so of the mainland  coastline, a point\r\n\nthat is unquestionably within the United States.

If drugs were manufactured on a\r\n\nship at  sea or found floating  on a raft, and  were then brought\r\n\ninto  shore by  motorboat, that  would be  an importation  from a\r\n\nplace outside the  United States.  The  juxtaposition of \"places\"\r\n\nand \"waters\" in section 802(28) was almost surely a precautionary\r\n\nredundancy.  Adding  \"waters\" to \"places\" avoids  the chance that\r\n\nanyone might mistakenly read \"places\" to mean only dry land.\r\n\n          The majority  does not  deny that  international waters\r\n\nmay be  a  \"place\" under  the  statute:   it  assumes that  drugs\r\n\nacquired from a mother  ship at sea might  be imported under  the\r\n\nstatute;  but it says that in this case defendants first acquired\r\n\nthe  drugs within the United  States, i.e., on  Mona Island.

This\r                           \r\n\ndefinition  applies  \"whether  or  not  such  a  bringing  in  or\r\n\nintroduction constitutes an importation within the meaning of the\r\n\ntariff laws of the United States.\"  21 U.S.C.   951(a)(1).\r\n\n          In a further  language argument, the majority  suggests\r\n\nthat its reading of section  952 is supported by a  comparison of\r\n\nsubsection (a)'s  two clauses.  The main  clause, barring imports\r\n\n\"into the United  States,\" is the core  provision whose substance\r\n\ncan be  traced back to 1909.   The other clause--added  in a 1970\r\n\nrecodification  of drug  laws--covers imports  into U.S.  customs\r\n\nterritory (the states, the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico)\r\n\nfrom any U.S.  possession.   The majority contends  that, on  the\r\n\ngovernment's reading  of the  main clause, the  customs territory\r\n\nclause is superfluous and has no independent effect.\r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\n          The origin and purpose  of the customs territory clause\r\n\nare remarkably obscure  (it appeared only in  certain House bills\r\n\nand was  nowhere  explained).   But  it  is fair  to  think  that\r\n\nsmuggling from some U.S.  possessions to the states had  become a\r\n\nproblem  and  Congress  therefore  included  language  that would\r\n\nunquestionably cover such shipments.  At the time Congress had no\r\n\nknowledge of  precisely how the main clause would be read, and it\r\n\ncertainly  had no  interest in  narrowing the  scope of  the main\r\n\nclause by implication.\r\n\n          In any event, the customs clause is neither superfluous\r\n\nnor without substantial independent application.   It is far from\r\n\nclear whether carrying drugs  aboard a scheduled non-stop airline\r\n\nflight  between  two   U.S.  points  could  ever  be  treated  as\r\n\nimportation under  the main  clause; a defendant  would certainly\r\n\nargue that for all practical purposes, drugs on such a flight are\r\n\nnever  outside the  country.    Yet such  a  flight  from a  U.S.\r\n\npossession  to  U.S. customs  territory,  say  from  Guam to  Los\r\n\nAngeles  or from  the  U.S. Virgin  Islands  to San  Juan,  could\r\n\nreadily be  prosecuted under the customs territory  clause.  That\r\n\ngeographic   content  to   the  customs  clause   eliminates  the\r\n\nmajority's superfluousness argument.\r\n\n          It is not  the government's position,  but that of  the\r\n\nmajority,  that ruptures  the superfluousness  canon.   Under the\r\n\nspecial  definition  of   import  in  section  951(b),   Congress\r\n\nenvisaged a kind of transparent curtain  around the boundaries of\r\n\nthe United States, and bringing drugs through that curtain is the\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\ncrime.    The  majority  has effectively  repealed  and  rendered\r\n\nmeaningless Congress' specialized definition, replacing it with a\r\n\nvernacular  definition  of  import  that  requires  no  statutory\r\n\ndefinition at all.\r\n\n          2.   The precedents  from other circuits,  reflecting a\r\n\npreviously  uniform application  of  the statute,  all treat  the\r                                                                \r\n\nintroduction of  drugs from international waters or international\r\n\nairspace as a  violation of the import statute.15   This has been\r\n\nthe consistent position  of the Fifth Circuit,  the Ninth Circuit\r\n\nand  the Eleventh  Circuit,  the  three  circuits whose  area  of\r\n\njurisdiction includes the  entire Pacific and Gulf  coasts of the\r\n\nUnited  States.    Until this  case,  no  circuit  has taken  the\r                                                  \r\n\ncontrary view.\r\n\n          For  example,  in affirming  a  conviction  based on  a\r\n\nshipment  intercepted in  Florida  waters, the  Fifth Circuit  in\r\n\nPeabody stated:\r                 \r\n\n          Had their cargo or contraband  originated in,\r\n          say,  Texas, that  would not  alter  the fact\r\n          that  it  was  meant  to  reenter the  United\r\n          States  from international  waters.   That is\r\n          enough.\r\n\n626 F.2d at 1301.

This circuit in Nueva,\r                                                                          \r\n\nquoting Goggin,  ruled that \"importation\" into  the United States\r                        \r\n\nunder section 952 \"requires  proof that the 'defendant [conspired\r\n\nto  bring] cocaine into the  country from international waters or\r\n\nairspace in excess of twelve geographical miles  outward from the\r\n\ncoastline.'\"  Id. at 884.\r                           \r\n\n          The majority's answer to all of these cases is that the\r\n\ndecisions of other circuits are ill-reasoned, or that their plain\r\n\nlanguage--adverse to the dissent--was  unnecessary, or both.  But\r\n\nnone  of  the many  different  judges who  participated  in these\r\n\ndecisions apparently  thought the statute  should be read  as the\r\n\nmajority reads it.   As of today, a  major criminal statute means\r\n\none  thing in  the 15  states of  the Fifth,  Ninth  and Eleventh\r\n\nCircuits; and it means  something eccentrically different in four\r\n\nNortheastern states and Puerto Rico.\r\n\n          This parade  of appellate cases from  other circuits is\r\n\nsurely  only a  sample of  similar prosecutions  and convictions;\r\n\nthere must  certainly be  others where,  as here,  the defendants\r\n\nwere convicted for importing  drugs from international waters and\r\n\nthen did not choose to  dispute the import charge on appeal.   By\r\n\nthemselves,  the  authorities  from  three  circuits  refute  the\r\n\nmajority's claim that  the government's reading of the statute is\r\n\nnewly minted or  at odds  with enforcement practices.   The  only\r\n\nnovelty in this case is the majority's decision.\r\n\n          3.  A final test of statutory meaning is the underlying\r\n\npurpose of the statute.   Borella v.

Congress'\r                                         \r\n\ninterest in protecting U.S. borders echoes through the history of\r                                             \r\n\nthe  statute.   In  proposing  the  legislation, the  President's\r\n\nspecial message said that the import provisions were intended \"to\r\n\nintercept [drugs] at their point of illegal entry into the United\r\n\nStates,\" and  there are  numerous  references--by the  President,\r\n\nfrom law enforcement witnesses,  and by legislators--to  guarding\r\n\nthe nation's \"borders\" against drugs.16\r\n\n          The legislators had no reason  to care one whit whether\r\n\nthe  drugs were  brought  from  international  waters or  from  a\r\n\nforeign land, so long as they crossed the U.S. boundary.  Indeed,\r\n\nCongress' indifference to origins  is reflected three times over:\r\n\nin  its  expressed purpose  to  protect  our  \"borders,\"  in  the\r\n\nexpansive phrase  \"from  any place  outside  thereof,\" and  in  a\r\n\ncompanion  statute  making  it  unlawful for  anyone  to  possess\r\n\nprohibited  drugs  on board  a  vessel \"arriving\"  in  the United\r\n\nStates unless  manifested  as cargo  or  official supplies.    21\r\n\nU.S.C.   955.\r\n\n          It  was irrelevant  to  Congress' purpose  whether  the\r\n\ndrugs were originally produced within the United States, as might\r\n\nmatter under  a tariff statute  designed to protect  U.S. markets\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n16  1969 Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States 513\r                                                                       \r\n(Presidential  message);  Hearings  on  Legislation  to  Regulate\r                                                                           \r\nControlled Dangerous Substances and Amend Narcotics and Drug Laws\r                                                                           \r\nBefore the House Ways  and Means Committee, 91st Cong.,  2d Sess.\r                                                    \r\n205  (1970) (statement of the Director of the Bureau of Narcotics\r\nand  Dangerous Drugs);  id. at  322 (statement  of Representative\r                                     \r\nPepper).\r\n\n                               -46-\r\r\n\nfrom  foreign competition  and  to  favor  local producers.    In\r\n\nenacting section 952, Congress was using the border crossing as a\r\n\nconvenient  jurisdictional  hook on  which to  catch traffickers.\r\n\nSee Peabody,  626 F.2d at  1301.  Thus,  the statute is  violated\r                     \r\n\nwhere drugs are produced  within the United States, carried  to a\r\n\nforeign country  and then reintroduced into this country.

Hearings,  supra, at  205\r                                                                  \r\n\n(reintroduction of drugs after export).\r\n\n          In   smuggling   operations   a  boat   arriving   from\r\n\ninternational  waters,  or  a  small   plane  from  international\r\n\nairspace, often comes  from an unknown point  of origin.  If  one\r\n\nadded  to the government's burden of proof the obligation to show\r\n\nthe point of origin, time would be spent by courts and parties on\r\n\nan issue wholly irrelevant to Congress' concern to exclude drugs.\r\n\nIn many cases, the  government would win; in some  it might lose.\r\n\nSuch proof serves no  purpose except to waste time,  squander law\r\n\nenforcement and judicial resources, and  cause occasional erratic\r\n\nacquittals of drug importers.\r\n\n          To suggest  that Congress  could not have  intended the\r\n\nstatute  to apply,  the majority  summons up  visions of  federal\r\n\nagents  arresting day  sailors or  airline  passengers transiting\r\n\nfrom one U.S. point to another with a few joints  of marijuana on\r\n\nboard.   But such dubious  results are not  avoided by distorting\r\n\nthe statute: a  day hiker with a few joints  who strayed over the\r\n\nborder  to Canada  and then back  again or  a tourist  with a few\r\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\njoints returning from London  by plane would be importing  by any\r\n\ndefinition.\r\n\n          More to the point, there is no record  of prosecutorial\r\n\nabuse of section 952.  Indeed, the majority twists this fact into\r\n\na claim that the government's interpretation must  therefore be a\r\n\nradical  change in  position, but  the majority has  confused two\r\n\ndifferent points.  The  government has not abused the  statute by\r\n\napplying  it  to trivial  amounts for  personal  use; but  it has\r\n\napplied it  to major  drug shipments arriving  from international\r\n\nwaters  or international air space.   As the  precedents show, it\r\n\nhas been upheld in every reported case.\r\n\n          The courts  are capable of warding  off unjust results,\r\n\nif and when they arise.  E.g., United States v.  Aversa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599121\"><a href=\"/opinion/599121/united-states-v-daniel-f-aversa-united-states-of-america-v-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r                                                                 \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st  Cir. 1993), vacated, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994).   But such\r                                       \r\n\nsurgery is properly done  with a scalpel rather than  an axe, and\r\n\nthere  is no  cause for any  surgery here.     In this  case, the\r                                                                \r\n\ndefendants  were not day sailors or tourists; they were importing\r\n\n16 kilograms of cocaine into Puerto Rico after a substantial trip\r\n\nthrough  international waters.    They fall  squarely within  the\r\n\npurpose, as well as the plain language, of section 952.  The rule\r\n\nof lenity has nothing to do with such a case.\r\n\n          To  conclude:   The majority  opinion is  not  short of\r\n\n\"reasons\" for  its  result; after  many  pages of  argument,  one\r\n\nemerges  half-dazed  from the  labyrinth  of  explanations.   But\r\n\nnothing the majority  says can  overcome a single  phrase in  the\r\n\nstatute--section 951(b)'s definition of \"import\" as \"any bringing\r\n\n                               -48-\r\r\n\nin  or introduction\" of  drugs into the  United States.   That is\r\n\nwhat  the defendants  did in  this case,  and that  is  why their\r\n\nconvictions under section 952 should be affirmed.\r\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n</pre>",
