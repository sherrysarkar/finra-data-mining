Evelyn Lherisson  was  convicted of  one\r                    Per  Curiam.\r                               \r\n\ncount of bank  fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1344, and three\r\n\ncounts   of  making  false  statements  to  a  federally  insured\r\n\nfinancial  institution, in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1014.   On\r\n\nappeal she  argues that (1)  the government engaged  in selective\r\n\nprosecution   in  prosecuting  her  but  not  the  more  culpable\r\n\nprincipal  of  the  fraud,  (2)  that  she  received  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of counsel,  and  (3)  that  there  was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to support the jury s  findings of guilt  on any of the\r\n\nfour  counts of  which she  was convicted.   Because  we find  no\r\n\nreversible error, we affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n            In July  of 1988, Evelyn  Lherisson, who  represented\r\n\nherself as the  trustee of a substantial family  trust located in\r\n\nthe Cayman Islands (the \"LPH trust\"), was introduced to Mary Anne\r\n\nKrupsak, a  partner in the Albany office of  a New York law firm.\r\n\nAt the time, Krupsak was a shareholder in Valyte International, a\r\n\nsmall  corporation  that  was  undergoing  financial  difficulty.\r\n\nLherisson  told Krupsak  that  she was  interested  in using  her\r\n\nfamily trust s assets to help small businesses such as Valyte and\r\n\ngave Krupsak various  documents that purported to confirm some of\r\n\nthe trust s assets.\r\n\n          In the  fall of  1988, Valyte  began negotiations  with\r\n\nHeritage  NIS-Bank  for  Savings concerning  a  $350,000  line of\r\n\ncredit Heritage had extended to Valyte.  Valyte had drawn heavily\r\n\non the line  of credit and Heritage  had lost some  confidence in\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nValyte s ability to pay its debts.  On December 27, 1988, Krupsak\r\n\nand  the other  shareholders met  with  Heritage officer  Michael\r\n\nAudette  and  Heritage  attorney  Steven  Weiss  to  discuss  the\r\n\npossibility   of   individual   Valyte   shareholders   providing\r\n\nadditional collateral  for the loans in exchange for Heritage not\r\n\ncalling  in  Valyte s  obligations.    At  that  meeting  Krupsak\r\n\ninformed Audette and Weiss that Evelyn Lherisson might be able to\r\n\nassist  in  providing  collateral  for  Valyte s  obligations  to\r\n\nHeritage.   Audette then spoke  on the phone with  Lherisson, who\r\n\nadvised  him that  she would  obtain a  letter of  credit for  $1\r\n\nmillion as additional collateral for the Valyte loan.\r\n\n          On December  29, 1988,  a $1  million letter of  credit\r\n\nmade out  to Krupsak and  drawn on  the First Investment  Bank of\r\n\nGarland,  Texas, was  faxed to  Heritage.  Heritage  told Krupsak\r\n\nthat  it  wanted  the   letter  modified  to  name   Heritage  as\r\n\nbeneficiary  instead  of  Krupsak.   Krupsak  testified  that she\r\n\nrelated  this request, along with other proposed modifications to\r\n\nthe December 29, 1988 letter of credit, to Lherisson, who replied\r\n\nthat she would  not modify the letter  but that she would  send a\r\n\nnew letter  of credit to  replace it.   Krupsak told Heritage  of\r\n\nLherisson s  plan to  send  a new  letter of  credit  and, as  an\r\n\ninterim measure, assigned her interest  in the December 29,  1988\r\n\nletter of credit to Heritage.\r\n\n          On  March  24,  1989,  Heritage  received  a  document,\r\n\nbearing the signature  of Lherisson as trustee of  the LPH trust,\r\n\nconstituting  a  $1   million  letter  of  credit   to  Heritage.\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nThereafter,  Lherisson and  Krupsak  commenced negotiations  with\r\n\nHeritage for a  $4 million loan to Valyte to be secured by assets\r\n\nof  the LPH  trust.  On  April 29,  1989, in support  of the loan\r\n\napplication,  Krupsak faxed  a  copy  of  an  \"Irrevocable  Trust\r\n\nAgreement\"  and a  separate specimen  \"Trust  Agreement\" both  of\r\n\nwhich  were  signed by  Lherisson.    On  May 8,  1989,  Heritage\r\n\nreceived a  letter, signed  by Krupsak s secretary  on behalf  of\r\n\nLherisson, which stated  that the proposed $4  million loan would\r\n\nbe collateralized by United States Treasury notes.\r\n\n          At  trial,  the  government  introduced  evidence  that\r\n\nneither the  First Investment Bank  of Garland nor the  LPH trust\r\n\never existed.   The tax identification  number used by  Lherisson\r\n\nfor the LPH trust was not assigned to any person or  business and\r\n\nthe registrar of the Cayman  Islands testified that no such trust\r\n\nwas registered with his  office.  A handwriting  expert testified\r\n\nthat the signature on the March 24, 1989 letter of credit  was in\r\n\nfact  Lherisson s, and  Krupsak s  secretary  testified that  she\r\n\nnever signed or  sent any correspondence  on behalf of  Lherisson\r\n\nwithout being directed to do so by Lherisson herself.\r\n\n          The jury  found Lherisson guilty  of one count  of bank\r\n\nfraud, in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1344,  and three  counts of\r\n\nmaking  false  statements  to   a  federally  insured   financial\r\n\ninstitution,  in  violation of  18  U.S.C.     1014.   The  false\r\n\nstatement counts were  based on:  1) the $1  million December 29,\r\n\n1988 letter of credit; 2) the $1 million March 24, 1989 letter of\r\n\ncredit; and 3) the May 8, 1989 letter.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n          Post-trial,   Lherisson    underwent   a    psychiatric\r\n\nexamination.   At sentencing, Lherisson s attorney  asserted that\r\n\nLherisson   suffered  from  delusions  and  was  operating  in  a\r\n\ndiminished mental  state during  the time  she was  communicating\r\n\nwith   Krupsak  and  Heritage.    The  district  court  sentenced\r\n\nLherisson to 15  months imprisonment and three  years  supervised\r\n\nrelease.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Lherisson  advances  three  arguments  in this  appeal.\r\n\nFirst, Lherisson argues that her convictions arose from selective\r\n\nprosecution  because the government  chose to prosecute  her (\"an\r\n\nindigent  black  woman who  was  suffering from  a  severe mental\r\n\ndisability\")  and not Mary  Anne Krupsak (a  \"white, non-disabled\r\n\nperson\" with \"political and financial clout\").  Second, Lherisson\r\n\nclaims  that she  received  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.\r\n\nThird, Lherisson claims  that there was insufficient  evidence to\r\n\nsupport the jury s verdict.\r\n\n          Lherisson did not raise her selective prosecution claim\r\n\nprior to  trial  as required  by  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.  12(b),  and\r\n\ntherefore has waived this claim, Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f), see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nTracey v. United States, 739 F.2d 679, 682 (1st Cir. 1984), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 469  U.S. 1109 (1985), unless \"exceptional circumstances\"\r                \r\n\nexist  which excuse  her failure to  raise the claim  in a timely\r\n\nfashion.  See United States v. Gary, 74 F.3d 304, 313 (1st Cir.),\r                                             \r\n\ncert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 2567 (1996).  Lherisson argues  that her\r                      \r\n\nclaim of selective  prosecution became manifest only  after trial\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwhen  the District  Court  ordered and  obtained  reports on  her\r\n\nmental condition.\r\n\n          Lherisson attributes her failure to undergo psychiatric\r\n\nevaluation (and hence her failure to raise the claim of selective\r\n\nprosecution) prior to trial  to the ineffectiveness of her  trial\r\n\ncounsel.    However,  Lherisson  did  not   raise  the  claim  of\r\n\nineffective  assistance of counsel before the district court, and\r\n\ntherefore we are  left without the factual  development necessary\r\n\nfor adequate  review.  Accordingly, we will  follow our customary\r\n\npractice  of  not  addressing claims  of  ineffective  assistance\r\n\nraised  for the  first  time on  appeal.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCarrington, 96  F.3d 1, 6 (1st  Cir. 1996), cert.  denied, 117 S.\r                                                                   \r\n\nCt. 1328 (1997).   Our declination to consider this  issue now is\r\n\nwithout prejudice to  Lherisson s entitlement to raise  the issue\r\n\nin a collateral  challenge to her conviction.   See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                 \r\n\n          In her  final claim,  Lherisson argues  that there  was\r\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury s verdict.  This  claim\r\n\ntakes two  forms.   First,  she  asserts that  she could  not  be\r\n\nconvicted  of aiding and abetting without  evidence of a culpable\r\n\nprincipal.  However,  on each count the district court instructed\r\n\nthe  jury in  conformity with  18 U.S.C.    2(b),  which provides\r\n\nthat:\r\n\n          [w]hoever willfully causes an  act to be done\r\n          which if directly performed by him or another\r\n          would  be  an   offense  against  the  United\r\n          States, is punishable as a principal.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    2(b).  Under  this section, a culpable  principal is\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nnot required.   \"[A] defendant may  be convicted as  an aider and\r\n\nabettor through proof that he caused an innocent person to commit\r\n\na criminal  offense.\"  United  States v. Tashjian, 660  F.2d 829,\r                                                           \r\n\n842  n.26  (1st Cir.)(alterations  and  internal  quotation marks\r\n\nomitted),  cert. denied,  454 U.S.  1102 (1981); see  also United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Dodd, 43 F.3d 759, 762-63 (1st Cir. 1995). \r                        \r\n\n          Lherisson  also argues that the government did not show\r\n\nthat  her statements  to Heritage  were made  with the  intent to\r\n\ndefraud.   Where  a defendant challenges  the sufficiency  of the\r\n\nevidence,  this court  must  look to  see  \"whether, drawing  all\r\n\ninferences in the government s favor, a rational jury  could find\r\n\nguilt beyond  a reasonable  doubt.\"   United States v.  Montilla-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRivera, 115 F.3d 1060, 1063 (1st  Cir. 1997).  Lherisson does not\r                \r\n\ndispute  that the  trust never  existed and  that the  letters of\r\n\nDecember 29, 1988,  March 24, 1989, and  May 8, 1989  were false.\r\n\nAudette  and Krupsak both testified that Lherisson was aware that\r\n\nValyte s  negotiations  with  Heritage were  for  the  purpose of\r\n\npreventing Heritage from  calling in Valyte s loans  or obtaining\r\n\nnew loans for Valyte.  A jury could have reasonably inferred that\r\n\nLherisson  knew the  trust  did  not exist  and  that, in  making\r\n\nstatements  about the  trust to  Krupsak  and representatives  of\r\n\nHeritage at  a time she knew that they  believed she was going to\r\n\nuse the  trust s assets to  help Valyte in its  negotiations with\r\n\nHeritage, Lherisson  intended to  defraud Heritage.   The  jury s\r\n\nverdict is therefore supported by sufficient evidence.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt is affirmed.\r\n\n                               -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n",

Evelyn Lherisson  was  convicted of  one\r                    Per  Curiam.\r                               \r\n\ncount of bank  fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1344, and three\r\n\ncounts   of  making  false  statements  to  a  federally  insured\r\n\nfinancial  institution, in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1014.   On\r\n\nappeal she  argues that (1)  the government engaged  in selective\r\n\nprosecution   in  prosecuting  her  but  not  the  more  culpable\r\n\nprincipal  of  the  fraud,  (2)  that  she  received  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of counsel,  and  (3)  that  there  was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to support the jury s  findings of guilt  on any of the\r\n\nfour  counts of  which she  was convicted.   Because  we find  no\r\n\nreversible error, we affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n            In July  of 1988, Evelyn  Lherisson, who  represented\r\n\nherself as the  trustee of a substantial family  trust located in\r\n\nthe Cayman Islands (the \"LPH trust\"), was introduced to Mary Anne\r\n\nKrupsak, a  partner in the Albany office of  a New York law firm.\r\n\nAt the time, Krupsak was a shareholder in Valyte International, a\r\n\nsmall  corporation  that  was  undergoing  financial  difficulty.\r\n\nLherisson  told Krupsak  that  she was  interested  in using  her\r\n\nfamily trust s assets to help small businesses such as Valyte and\r\n\ngave Krupsak various  documents that purported to confirm some of\r\n\nthe trust s assets.\r\n\n          In the  fall of  1988, Valyte  began negotiations  with\r\n\nHeritage  NIS-Bank  for  Savings concerning  a  $350,000  line of\r\n\ncredit Heritage had extended to Valyte.  Valyte had drawn heavily\r\n\non the line  of credit and Heritage  had lost some  confidence in\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nValyte s ability to pay its debts.  On December 27, 1988, Krupsak\r\n\nand  the other  shareholders met  with  Heritage officer  Michael\r\n\nAudette  and  Heritage  attorney  Steven  Weiss  to  discuss  the\r\n\npossibility   of   individual   Valyte   shareholders   providing\r\n\nadditional collateral  for the loans in exchange for Heritage not\r\n\ncalling  in  Valyte s  obligations.    At  that  meeting  Krupsak\r\n\ninformed Audette and Weiss that Evelyn Lherisson might be able to\r\n\nassist  in  providing  collateral  for  Valyte s  obligations  to\r\n\nHeritage.   Audette then spoke  on the phone with  Lherisson, who\r\n\nadvised  him that  she would  obtain a  letter of  credit for  $1\r\n\nmillion as additional collateral for the Valyte loan.\r\n\n          On December  29, 1988,  a $1  million letter of  credit\r\n\nmade out  to Krupsak and  drawn on  the First Investment  Bank of\r\n\nGarland,  Texas, was  faxed to  Heritage.  Heritage  told Krupsak\r\n\nthat  it  wanted  the   letter  modified  to  name   Heritage  as\r\n\nbeneficiary  instead  of  Krupsak.   Krupsak  testified  that she\r\n\nrelated  this request, along with other proposed modifications to\r\n\nthe December 29, 1988 letter of credit, to Lherisson, who replied\r\n\nthat she would  not modify the letter  but that she would  send a\r\n\nnew letter  of credit to  replace it.   Krupsak told Heritage  of\r\n\nLherisson s  plan to  send  a new  letter of  credit  and, as  an\r\n\ninterim measure, assigned her interest  in the December 29,  1988\r\n\nletter of credit to Heritage.\r\n\n          On  March  24,  1989,  Heritage  received  a  document,\r\n\nbearing the signature  of Lherisson as trustee of  the LPH trust,\r\n\nconstituting  a  $1   million  letter  of  credit   to  Heritage.\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nThereafter,  Lherisson and  Krupsak  commenced negotiations  with\r\n\nHeritage for a  $4 million loan to Valyte to be secured by assets\r\n\nof  the LPH  trust.  On  April 29,  1989, in support  of the loan\r\n\napplication,  Krupsak faxed  a  copy  of  an  \"Irrevocable  Trust\r\n\nAgreement\"  and a  separate specimen  \"Trust  Agreement\" both  of\r\n\nwhich  were  signed by  Lherisson.    On  May 8,  1989,  Heritage\r\n\nreceived a  letter, signed  by Krupsak s secretary  on behalf  of\r\n\nLherisson, which stated  that the proposed $4  million loan would\r\n\nbe collateralized by United States Treasury notes.\r\n\n          At  trial,  the  government  introduced  evidence  that\r\n\nneither the  First Investment Bank  of Garland nor the  LPH trust\r\n\never existed.   The tax identification  number used by  Lherisson\r\n\nfor the LPH trust was not assigned to any person or  business and\r\n\nthe registrar of the Cayman  Islands testified that no such trust\r\n\nwas registered with his  office.  A handwriting  expert testified\r\n\nthat the signature on the March 24, 1989 letter of credit  was in\r\n\nfact  Lherisson s, and  Krupsak s  secretary  testified that  she\r\n\nnever signed or  sent any correspondence  on behalf of  Lherisson\r\n\nwithout being directed to do so by Lherisson herself.\r\n\n          The jury  found Lherisson guilty  of one count  of bank\r\n\nfraud, in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    1344,  and three  counts of\r\n\nmaking  false  statements  to   a  federally  insured   financial\r\n\ninstitution,  in  violation of  18  U.S.C.     1014.   The  false\r\n\nstatement counts were  based on:  1) the $1  million December 29,\r\n\n1988 letter of credit; 2) the $1 million March 24, 1989 letter of\r\n\ncredit; and 3) the May 8, 1989 letter.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n          Post-trial,   Lherisson    underwent   a    psychiatric\r\n\nexamination.   At sentencing, Lherisson s attorney  asserted that\r\n\nLherisson   suffered  from  delusions  and  was  operating  in  a\r\n\ndiminished mental  state during  the time  she was  communicating\r\n\nwith   Krupsak  and  Heritage.    The  district  court  sentenced\r\n\nLherisson to 15  months imprisonment and three  years  supervised\r\n\nrelease.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Lherisson  advances  three  arguments  in this  appeal.\r\n\nFirst, Lherisson argues that her convictions arose from selective\r\n\nprosecution  because the government  chose to prosecute  her (\"an\r\n\nindigent  black  woman who  was  suffering from  a  severe mental\r\n\ndisability\")  and not Mary  Anne Krupsak (a  \"white, non-disabled\r\n\nperson\" with \"political and financial clout\").  Second, Lherisson\r\n\nclaims  that she  received  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.\r\n\nThird, Lherisson claims  that there was insufficient  evidence to\r\n\nsupport the jury s verdict.\r\n\n          Lherisson did not raise her selective prosecution claim\r\n\nprior to  trial  as required  by  Fed.  R. Crim.  P.  12(b),  and\r\n\ntherefore has waived this claim, Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f), see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nTracey v.

Lherisson argues  that her\r                      \r\n\nclaim of selective  prosecution became manifest only  after trial\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwhen  the District  Court  ordered and  obtained  reports on  her\r\n\nmental condition.\r\n\n          Lherisson attributes her failure to undergo psychiatric\r\n\nevaluation (and hence her failure to raise the claim of selective\r\n\nprosecution) prior to trial  to the ineffectiveness of her  trial\r\n\ncounsel.    However,  Lherisson  did  not   raise  the  claim  of\r\n\nineffective  assistance of counsel before the district court, and\r\n\ntherefore we are  left without the factual  development necessary\r\n\nfor adequate  review.  Accordingly, we will  follow our customary\r\n\npractice  of  not  addressing claims  of  ineffective  assistance\r\n\nraised  for the  first  time on  appeal.

This  claim\r\n\ntakes two  forms.   First,  she  asserts that  she could  not  be\r\n\nconvicted  of aiding and abetting without  evidence of a culpable\r\n\nprincipal.  However,  on each count the district court instructed\r\n\nthe  jury in  conformity with  18 U.S.C.    2(b),  which provides\r\n\nthat:\r\n\n          [w]hoever willfully causes an  act to be done\r\n          which if directly performed by him or another\r\n          would  be  an   offense  against  the  United\r\n          States, is punishable as a principal.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.    2(b).

Where  a defendant challenges  the sufficiency  of the\r\n\nevidence,  this court  must  look to  see  \"whether, drawing  all\r\n\ninferences in the government s favor, a rational jury  could find\r\n\nguilt beyond  a reasonable  doubt.\"   United States v.

A jury could have reasonably inferred that\r\n\nLherisson  knew the  trust  did  not exist  and  that, in  making\r\n\nstatements  about the  trust to  Krupsak  and representatives  of\r\n\nHeritage at  a time she knew that they  believed she was going to\r\n\nuse the  trust s assets to  help Valyte in its  negotiations with\r\n\nHeritage, Lherisson  intended to  defraud Heritage.
