Stay of Discovery\r\n\n     Appellants \r                           argue that their ability to oppose the summary\r\n\njudgment motion was hampered by the order staying  discovery.\r\n\n   2  Appellants argue that they provided factual support in\r\nthe form of references to a transcript of a Rhode Island\r\nFamily Court proceeding.  As appellants concede, however,\r\nthat transcript was not submitted to the district court (nor\r\nhas it been submitted to this court) and, therefore, the\r\nreferences thereto are mere \"unsupported factual allegations\"\r\nwhich were properly disregarded by the district court. \r\nAyala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n\"It is well settled that the trial judge has broad discretion\r\n\nin ruling on pre-trial management matters, and we review  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of  discovery  for  abuse  of  its\r\n\nconsiderable  discretion.\"   Ayala-Gerena,  95  F.3d  at  91.\r\n\nAppellants' opposition to  summary judgment was  \"deafeningly\r\n\nsilent \r                  as \r                     to \r                        their inability to oppose summary judgment due to\r\n\nincomplete discovery.\"  Id. at 92.  Appellants still have not\r\n\nidentified how their opposition was hampered by the  district\r\n\ncourt's order staying discovery.  Under these  circumstances,\r\n\nappellants' argument that  summary judgment was premature  in\r\n\nthis case is without merit.  See R.W. Intern. Corp. v.  Welch\r\n\nFood, Inc., 13 F.3d 478, 488 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n     The district court  judgment is affirmed.   See Loc.  R.\r\n\n27.1.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\n",

As appellants concede, however,\r\nthat transcript was not submitted to the district court (nor\r\nhas it been submitted to this court) and, therefore, the\r\nreferences thereto are mere \"unsupported factual allegations\"\r\nwhich were properly disregarded by the district court. \r\nAyala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 95.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n\"It is well settled that the trial judge has broad discretion\r\n\nin ruling on pre-trial management matters, and we review  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of  discovery  for  abuse  of  its\r\n\nconsiderable  discretion.\"   Ayala-Gerena,  95  F.3d  at  91.\r\n\nAppellants' opposition to  summary judgment was  \"deafeningly\r\n\nsilent \r                  as \r                     to \r                        their inability to oppose summary judgment due to\r\n\nincomplete discovery.\"  Id. at 92.
