This case is part of the aftermath of\r\n\nthat financial crisis.  At  issue is whether the Commonwealth\r\n\nof  Massachusetts,   acting  under  its   abandoned  property\r\n\nstatute,  may obtain  either  the  federal deposit  insurance\r\n\nproceeds  or  the  pro  rata   distributions  from  abandoned\r\n\naccounts  in failed Massachusetts  banks.   Considerable sums\r\n\nare at stake.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The  Federal  Deposit  Insurance   Corporation  was\r\n\ncreated  by the Banking Act of 1933,  Pub. L. No. 73-66,   8,\r\n\n48 Stat. 162, to alleviate hardships caused by bank failures.\r\n\nSee S.  Rep.

Participating banks and thrifts pay\r\n\npremiums  to the FDIC.   Those premiums are  used to maintain\r\n\ntwo  insurance funds, the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings\r\n\nAssociation Insurance Fund.   Id.   1821(a)(5), (6).

No. 63-43,  38 Stat. 251 (1913).   Congress revisited\r\nthe deposit insurance provisions in 1935,  and again in 1950,\r\nwhen  these provisions  were  amended and  made  part of  the\r\nFederal  Deposit Insurance Act (\"FDIA\"), Pub. L. No. 81-97,  \r\n2(1), 64 Stat. 873.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nbank  fails, FDIC-Corporate  draws  money from  one of  these\r\n\nfunds  and either  pays  the insurance  proceeds directly  to\r\n\ndepositors  as an insured deposit or transfers the money to a\r\n\nnew bank as a transferred deposit, using whichever method  is\r\n\nmore cost effective.   Id.    1821(f).  Upon  payment to  the\r                                      \r\n\ndepositors,   FDIC-Corporate   becomes   subrogated  to   the\r\n\ndepositors'  rights   against  the  failed  banks.     Id.   \r                                                                      \r\n\n1821(g)(1).\r\n\n          The  FDIC acting  as  a receiver  (\"FDIC-Receiver\")\r\n\nwinds  up  the affairs  of failed  banks and  distributes any\r\n\nremaining  assets pro rata to  the bank's creditors.

FDIC-\r\n\nReceiver continues  to permit  states that file timely claims\r\n\npursuant to the provisions governing general creditors of the\r\n\nreceivership estate to act on behalf of absent depositors and\r\n\nto claim those depositors' pro rata shares of any distributed\r\n\nliquidated  assets.

However, after  1988, FDIC-\r\n\nCorporate began  declining to pay states the insured value of\r\n\nabandoned accounts.   Id. at 97-98.   FDIC-Corporate asserted\r                                     \r\n\nthat  its original  policy  was inconsistent  with the  plain\r\n\nlanguage  of the  pre-1993 version  of 12  U.S.C.    1822(e),\r\n\nwhich  provided  that  insurance   funds  not  claimed  by  a\r\n\ndepositor  within eighteen  months  of the  appointment of  a\r\n\nreceiver reverted back to the FDIC.  Id; see also 12 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n1822(e) (1989) (current version enacted 1993).\r\n\n          The states,  with  Massachusetts in  the  vanguard,\r\n\nfought back.  They lobbied Congress, leading to the enactment\r\n\nof  compromise legislation, the Unclaimed Deposits Amendments\r\n\nAct  of  1993 (\"UDAA\"),  Pub. L.  No.  103-44, 107  Stat. 220\r\n\n(1993), under which  the states receive the  insured value of\r\n\nabandoned deposits  for a  10-year  period.   If a  depositor\r\n\nfails  to  make  a  claim during  this  time,  the  insurance\r\n\nproceeds on  the abandoned account  must be  returned to  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nFDIC  and all rights of  the depositor are  extinguished.  12\r\n\nU.S.C.   1822(e)(5); see infra note 7.\r                                          \r\n\n          However, the UDAA expressly made the former version\r\n\nof     1822(e) applicable  to  banks  placed in  receivership\r\n\nbetween  January  1,  1989  and   June  28,  1993,  with  one\r\n\nadditional  proviso.   Claims by  insured depositors  at such\r\n\nbanks  made  prior to  the  termination  of the  receivership\r\n\nestate  are  not time-barred.   Pub.  L.  No. 103-44,    2(b)\r\n\n(1993).   Thus,  depositors at  banks placed  in receivership\r\n\nbetween  January 1, 1989 and June 28, 1993 have the longer of\r\n\neighteen months or until  the termination of the receivership\r\n\nestate  to file  claims with  FDIC-Corporate for  the insured\r\n\nvalue of their accounts.  Id.\r                                         \r\n\n          Massachusetts  also turned to  the federal judicial\r\n\nsystem for redress, claiming it is entitled to  the insurance\r\n\nproceeds  and  the  pro  rata  distributions  from  abandoned\r\n\ndeposits   in  thirty-three  failed Massachusetts  banks  for\r\n\nwhich the  FDIC was appointed  receiver between May  1990 and\r\n\nDecember 1992.3\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The  Commonwealth has  its own  comprehensive legal\r\n\nframework,   the     Massachusetts  Abandoned   Property  Act\r\n\n(\"MAPA\"), Mass.

The federal government has  a similarly intricate\r\n\nstatutory  and regulatory scheme  relating to  bank failures.\r\n\nThe dispute  between the  Commonwealth and the  FDIC involves\r\n\nthe intersection of these two bodies of law.\r\n\n          The MAPA was enacted both  to protect the rights of\r\n\ntrue owners when and  if they appear and to  bring additional\r\n\nrevenues  to  the  Commonwealth's   treasury.

It  creates  a presumption  that\r\n\ndeposits are abandoned unless the owner  has, during the past\r\n\nthree  years,  either communicated with the deposit holder or\r\n\nengaged in certain other activities.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 200A,\r\n\n   3.   Deposit  holders,  including banks,  are  required to\r\n\nsubmit  annual reports  to  the State  Treasurer listing  the\r\n\nnames and  addresses of  depositors deemed to  have abandoned\r\n\naccounts valued at more  than $100.  Id.   7.  The banks must\r                                                    \r\n\nsend  letters to the owners  of such accounts  at least sixty\r\n\ndays  before  filing  the  report,  giving  notice  that  the\r\n\ndeposits  are about to be  surrendered to the  custody of the\r\n\nCommonwealth.  Id.   7(A).\r                              \r\n\n          Unless a depositor claims an abandoned account, the\r\n\nbank must deliver  the funds  into the custody  of the  State\r\n\nTreasurer,  who  publishes a  notice  that  the accounts  are\r\n\ndeemed abandoned.

In  March  1994,  Massachusetts   also  filed  an\r\n\nadministrative  claim  with  FDIC-Corporate for  the  insured\r\n\nvalue of the unclaimed deposits, arguing that it was entitled\r\n\nto these funds under the MAPA.6\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.

This   dispute   initially   involved  both   pre-closing\r\ndeposits, deposits  abandoned before the banks  were put into\r\nreceivership, and post-closing  deposits, deposits  abandoned\r\nafter  the  banks  were  put  into  receivership.    However,\r\nMassachusetts has since conceded that  it is not entitled  to\r\nthe  post-closing  deposits, Massachusetts  v.  FDIC, 916  F.\r                                                                \r\nSupp. 54, 57 (D. Mass. 1996), and so the term \"deposits\" here\r\nrefers to pre-closing deposits only.\r\n\n6.  The Commonwealth  is not  attempting to recover  the same\r\nmoney  twice: it only seeks  the uninsured value  of the pre-\r\nclosing  deposits from  FDIC-Receiver to  the extent  that it\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          FDIC-Corporate rejected the claim, stating that the\r\n\nMAPA  was pre-empted by  12 U.S.C.    1822(e) (1989) (current\r\n\nversion enacted 1993).7  Massachusetts petitioned this  court\r\n\ndirectly for review of the administrative claim.

We affirm.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          The  Commonwealth argues  two bases  for  its claim\r\n\nagainst  FDIC-Corporate for  the  insured  value of  deposits\r\n\nabandoned   in  failed  Massachusetts  banks:  its  abandoned\r\n\nproperty  statute and  FDIC  regulations.   The claim  raises\r\n\ncertain issues.  The  first is how properly to  interpret the\r\n\nrelevant  version  of 12  U.S.C.    1822(e).   The  second is\r\n\nwhether this federal statute pre-empts the MAPA.  If it does,\r\n\nthe question  becomes whether the Commonwealth is nonetheless\r\n\nentitled to the insurance  proceeds under any other provision\r\n\nof federal law.\r\n\n          A. Statutory Construction\r                                               \r\n\n          The Supreme  Court  has instructed  that the  first\r\n\ntask in  statutory construction is to  separate \"the question\r\n\nof the substantive (as  opposed to pre-emptive) meaning of  a\r\n\nstatute  [from]  the question  of whether  a statute  is pre-\r\n\nemptive.\"   Smiley v. Citibank, 116 S. Ct. 1730, 1735 (1996).\r                                          \r\n\nFDIC-Corporate's  primary  argument  is that  the  applicable\r\n\nversion of    1822(e)  reflects a clear  congressional intent\r\n\nthat insurance proceeds for  abandoned accounts revert to one\r\n\nof  the FDIC  insurance funds.   FDIC-Corporate  also asserts\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n(citing Fed. R. Civ.

Natural Resources Defense Council,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).\r                \r\n\n          The Commonwealth counters that   1822(e) can hardly\r\n\nbe read  as demonstrating  a clear congressional  intent that\r\n\nthe  insurance  recoveries  referable to  abandoned  accounts\r\n\nrevert  to the FDIC when the agency itself applied a contrary\r\n\ninterpretation between 1950 and 1988.   Massachusetts further\r\n\nargues that,  in this context, the new FDIC interpretation is\r\n\nnot  entitled  to  full  Chevron  deference.   FDIC-Corporate\r                                            \r\n\nconcedes  that before  1988 it  did not  consistently require\r\n\ndeposit insurance on abandoned accounts to be returned to the\r\n\nfederal government  rather than  turned over to  the states.9\r\n\nIt asserts, however, that, when the inconsistency was brought\r\n\nto its attention in  late 1988, it determined that    1822(e)\r\n\nrequired  these funds to revert to the FDIC.  Hearing, supra,\r                                                                        \r\n\nat 97-98  (Testimony of  Alfred J.T.

This inconsistency may have  resulted from the FDIC's use\r\nof three different  responses to bank failures,  one of which\r\nwas  known as a  purchase and assumption  transaction and did\r\nnot  involve either insured deposits or transferred deposits,\r\nand  thus did not implicate   1822(e).  In mid-1989, the FDIC\r\nmodified  the   structure  of  its  purchase  and  assumption\r\ntransactions so  that they made use  of transferred deposits,\r\nthus eliminating  this source of confusion.   Hearing, supra,\r                                                                        \r\nat 97-98  (Testimony of  Alfred J.T.

Here, the parties frame\r                             \r\n\nthe issue as   whether  a state, acting  under its  abandoned\r\n\nproperty statute, may \"claim\"  the insured value of abandoned\r\n\ndeposits  held  in failed  banks.   The  crux of  the matter,\r\n\nhowever,  is  whether  a  state acting  on  behalf  of absent\r\n\ndepositors may itself qualify as a depositor under   1822(e).\r\n\nWe do not  believe the  plain language of    1822(e)  answers\r\n\nthis question.  That the FDIC apparently viewed the matter in\r\n\ninconsistent ways  reinforces this conclusion.  Other indicia\r\n\nof   the  statute's  meaning,  particularly  the  legislative\r\n\nhistory,  thus come into play.   Wilson v.  Bradlees, 96 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n552, 555 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          The Commonwealth's claim arises not under   1822(e)\r\n\nas  it was originally enacted  in the 1935  amendments to the\r\n\nBanking Act of 1933, but under the \"reenactment\" of   1822(e)\r\n\nin  1993  as  part of  the  UDAA.10    Consequently, we  must\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  We use the term \"reenactment\" as a convenient shorthand.\r\nSection 2(b) of the UDAA states:\r\n\n          Special   rule   for   receiverships   in\r                                                               \r\n          progress.--Section  12(e) of  the Federal\r                              \r\n          Deposit  Insurance  Act  [subsec.

However, the  proceedings  leading to  the\r\n\nenactment of the  UDAA do shed some light on  the matter.  At\r\n\nthe  congressional hearings  on the  UDAA, two  senior agency\r\n\nofficials   testified   as   to   the    agency's   post-1988\r\n\ninterpretation of    1822(e).   Congress  did  not,  however,\r\n\ncause the new version  of   1822(e) to apply  to banks placed\r\n\nin  receivership between January  1, 1989 and  June 28, 1993,\r\n\ndespite lobbying by the states.\r\n\n          Congress  is  often  deemed   to  have  adopted  an\r\n\nagency's  interpretation of  a statute  when, knowing  of the\r\n\nagency  interpretation,  it   reenacts  the  statute  without\r\n\nsignificant  change.   FDIC v.  Philadelphia Gear  Corp., 476\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 426, 437 (1986).  The legislative  history thus suggests\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          was first appointed  receiver during  the\r\n          period  between January  1, 1989  and the\r\n          date of enactment  of this Act [June  28,\r\n          1993],  except  that  such section  12(e)\r\n          [subsec.  (e) of this  section] shall not\r\n          bar   any   claim   made    against   the\r\n          Corporation by an  insured depositor  for\r\n          an  insured  or  transferred deposit,  so\r\n          long as  such claim is made  prior to the\r\n          termination of the receivership.\r\n\nTechnically, then,  Congress  did not  reenact  the  pre-1993\r\nversion of   1822(e), but rather caused it to apply  to banks\r\nplaced into receivership between January 1, 1989 and June 28,\r\n1993.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nthat Congress wanted unclaimed  deposits in banks placed into\r\n\nreceivership  during the  relevant  period to  revert to  the\r\n\nFDIC.  But FDIC-Corporate's  argument that \"[b]y enacting the\r\n\nUDAA,  Congress  has  erased  any  question  that     1822(e)\r\n\nrequires unclaimed  insurance benefits to be  returned to the\r\n\nFDIC\"  overstates the case.  Congress  may simply have chosen\r\n\nnot to enter the fray as to the past.   While the legislative\r\n\nhistory  of the UDAA  is instructive, it  is not dispositive.\r\n\nCongress'  intent   remains  ambiguous.     Accordingly,  the\r\n\nquestion of  how much deference to  accord the interpretation\r\n\nadvanced by FDIC-Corporate must be considered.\r\n\n          An  agency's  formal   interpretation,  through   a\r\n\nrulemaking or  an adjudication, of a  statute it administers,\r\n\nis accorded what has  come to be known as  Chevron deference.\r                                                              \r\n\nDavis &amp; Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise   3.5, at 119 (3d\r                                                       \r\n\ned.  1994);  see also  Chevron, 467  U.S.  at 842-43.

Contrary to  the\r                                \r\n\nCommonwealth's argument,  an agency  certainly does  not lose\r\n\nits entitlement to  deference by changing  its position on  a\r\n\nmatter  entrusted to it by  Congress.

This  case in  the end\r\ninvolves  a dispute  between  a state  and an  administrative\r\nagency  of the  federal  government and,  as well,  questions\r\nabout  the  role Congress  intended state  law  to play  in a\r\nfederal scheme.   Congress should  not be lightly  thought to\r\nhave wished  such sensitive  questions to be  handled through\r\ninformal and  unexplained \"policies\"  of an  executive branch\r\nagency.   The  FDIC  may, of  course,  choose to  solve  this\r\ndifficulty by engaging in more formal processes.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nCorporate  then proceeded  to deny  states' proofs  of claim.\r\n\nThe  agency  did not  even issue  a  formal statement  of its\r\n\nreasons for the change.\r\n\n          This is not  to say that  FDIC-Corporate's position\r\n\nwould  be   entitled  to   no  deference.

FDIC-Corporate's   reading  of  the  provision\r\n\ncomports  with  the  intent,  suggested  by  the  legislative\r\n\nhistory of  the  UDAA, that  the insured  value of  abandoned\r\n\naccounts  revert to  the  FDIC insurance  funds, where  these\r\n\nresources  can be  used to  defray the  costs of  future bank\r\n\nfailures.  The states themselves pay nothing into the fund to\r\n\nsecure  insurance for their citizens.  Any payment to a state\r\n\nis thus  a windfall, a result  at least in part  at odds with\r\n\nthe purpose of  the insurance system.12   The FDIC's position\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

Congress may  signal such intent  by an express\r\n\nstatement of  pre-emption or  by pervasive regulation  of the\r\n\narea.

In light of the  reasonableness of the\r\n\ndetermination that  states  acting under  abandoned  property\r\n\nstatutes do  not qualify  as depositors under    1822(e), any\r\n\nstate law conferring on  Massachusetts the right to act  as a\r\n\ndepositor necessarily conflicts directly with federal law.\r\n\n          Another  fundamental inconsistency  between federal\r\n\nand state law concerns  the ultimate disposition of insurance\r\n\nproceeds  for abandoned  accounts.

In other areas, where  Congress has intended to pre-empt\r\nstate abandoned property statutes, it has done so explicitly.\r\nCf.  31 U.S.C.     1322(c)(1) (certain  sums  to be  held  in\r               \r\nTreasury  account  notwithstanding  state abandoned  property\r\nlaws).

Pub.  L. No.\r\n\n103-44,   2(b) (1993).\r\n\n          And  there is   conflict,  not congruence,  between\r\n\nother  portions  of  the  statutory  schemes  as well.    For\r\n\nexample, state and federal  law conflict over the time  frame\r\n\nin which a  depositor may  claim an abandoned  deposit.   The\r\n\nrelevant   version  of   the  federal   provision  eventually\r\n\nextinguished  a depositor's  right to  an  unclaimed deposit,\r\n\nwhile  the MAPA  extends the right  of a depositor  to make a\r\n\nclaim in  perpetuity.14  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 200A,   10(a).  We\r\n\nconclude that    1822(e) pre-empts  the MAPA with  respect to\r\n\nthe  federal  scheme  for  deposits that  are  abandoned  and\r\n\ntherefore  that  the  Commonwealth  is not  entitled  to  the\r\n\nclaimed insurance proceeds.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  There  are other differences as well.   Section  1822(e)\r\nrequires FDIC-Corporate  to  mail two  notices regarding  any\r\nunclaimed deposit, whatever its amount, the first thirty days\r\nafter  insurance  payments  are  inititated  and  the  second\r\nfifteen  months   later,  to the  last  known address  of the\r\ndepositor.  The MAPA would require FDIC-Corporate to send out\r\nadditional  information:  a  report  to the  State  Treasurer\r\ndescribing  any  property abandoned  under  the  MAPA, and  a\r\nnotice to the owner of any account containing more than $100.\r\nMass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  200A,      7,  7(A).    However,  while\r\ndifferent, these notice requirements do not actually conflict\r\nwith each other.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          Massachusetts  makes  a final  argument that  it is\r\n\nentitled  to the insurance  proceeds because, as  a matter of\r\n\nfederal  law, it  is  a fiduciary  for  depositors.   Federal\r\n\nregulations  acknowledge that  there may be  \"fiduciaries\" or\r\n\n\"custodians\"  whose status  is  apparent from  the books  and\r\n\nrecords of the  failed bank and who,  as a matter of  federal\r\n\nlaw,  are permitted to stand  in the shoes  of the depositors\r\n\nfor some purposes.   12 C.F.R.    330.4,  330.6 (1996).   The\r\n\nCommonwealth argues  that it  qualifies as a  fiduciary whose\r\n\nstatus is  apparent from  the banks' deposit  account records\r\n\nand  that   it  therefore  is  entitled   under  the  federal\r\n\nregulations to the insured value of abandoned deposits.  This\r\n\nargument fails because the Commonwealth locates the source of\r\n\nits fiduciary  status in state  law provisions that  are pre-\r\n\nempted by the applicable version of   1822(e).15\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Additionally,  the district  court correctly  ruled that\r\nthe Commonwealth's  claimed fiduciary status  is not  readily\r\napparent from  the face of the banks' deposit account records\r\nas required by  the regulations.

Massachusetts argues  that  the  district\r\ncourt's cramped interpretation of  the term \"deposit  account\r\nrecords\"  is at odds with the more expansive approach of FDIC\r                                                                         \r\nv.

The  district court lacks\r\n\nsubject  matter  jurisdiction over  any  claim  not filed  in\r\n\naccordance   with   these   requirements.     12   U.S.C.    \r\n\n1821(d)(13)(D).   Accordingly,  the district  court dismissed\r\n\nthe action.  That dismissal was correct.\r\n\n          Creditors must file their claims with FDIC-Receiver\r\n\nby the date  specified in  a published notice.16   This  date\r\n\nmust be at  least ninety  days after the  publication of  the\r\n\nnotice.  12 U.S.C.    1821(d)(3)(B)(i).  Claims not  filed by\r\n\nthe specified date are time-barred.   Id. (5)(C)(i); Simon v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFDIC, 48 F.3d  53, 56 (1st  Cir. 1995); Marquis v.  FDIC, 965\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1148, 1152 (1st Cir. 1992).  The one statutory exception\r\n\nto the claims bar is for creditors who did not receive notice\r\n\nof the appointment of the receiver in time to comply with the\r\n\nfiling date, but  who did  file the claim  in time to  permit\r\n\npayment.  12 U.S.C.   1821(d)(5)(C)(ii).\r\n\n          Massachusetts did not meet  the filing deadline for\r\n\ncreditors.   Nor did  its  claims fall  within the  statutory\r\n\nexception:   the  Commonwealth  had   prompt  notice  of  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.  This notice is also mailed to all creditors shown on the\r\ninstitution's books.  Id.   1821(d)(3)(C).\r                                     \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nappointment of receivers for  the failed bank.  Massachusetts\r\n\npresents two  basic arguments  why it should  receive a  more\r\n\ngenerous  filing period: that it  is not just  a creditor but\r\n\nstands  in  the  shoes  of  depositors  as  a  fiduciary   or\r\n\nconservator, and that the  FDIC in the past had  permitted it\r\n\nto  do  so  and   is  now  bound  by  that   prior  position.\r\n\nMassachusetts' theory appears  to be that  as a fiduciary  of\r\n\nthe depositors, it had no claim against FDIC-Receiver for the\r\n\npro rata value of the abandoned deposits until the expiration\r\n\nof depositors' rights  to claim  the insured  value of  their\r\n\naccounts.   According to the Commonwealth,  its 90-day filing\r\n\nperiod17  for  claims  against the  receivership  estate only\r\n\nbegan  to  run eighteen  months  after the  appointment  of a\r\n\nreceiver for  the failed  banks, effectively creating  a time\r\n\nlimit of eighteen months plus ninety days.18\r\n\n          FDIC-Receiver's  position  is that  states  are not\r\n\nentitled  to  the  more  lenient time  limits  applicable  to\r\n\ndepositors filing as creditors.  This position has the virtue\r\n\nof  being  largely consistent  with the  view taken  by FDIC-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  The statute  says that the  FDIC may specify  any period\r\nninety days  or longer.   In this  case, as  in most  others,\r\nFDIC-Receiver set a 90-day filing period.\r\n\n18.  The  premise   on  which  this  argument   is  based  is\r\nincorrect:  since the enactment of the UDAA, depositors  have\r\nthe longer of 18 months or until the end of  the receivership\r\nestate  to file insurance claims.  Pub. L. No. 103-44,   2(b)\r\n(1993).\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nCorporate.19    Further, this  decision  is  not economically\r\n\nirrational.   It protects  the federal insurance  funds to  a\r\n\ncertain  extent,  thereby reducing  the  cost  of the  thrift\r\n\nclean-up  to the  taxpayer.  FDIC-Receiver  pays out  what is\r\n\nleft of  deposits pro rata  to creditors.   FDIC-Corporate is\r\n\nitself a  creditor of the  receivership estate to  the extent\r\n\nthat  it   has  paid  insurance  and   became  subrogated  to\r\n\ndepositors' rights.   12  U.S.C.   1821(g).   FDIC-Receiver's\r\n\npolicy gives creditors a small window to assert their claims,\r\n\nwhich benefits all timely claimants, including FDIC-Corporate\r\n\nas subrogee.\r\n\n          The  Commonwealth's  claim  that it  stands  in the\r\n\nshoes of depositors fails.  The claim is based on the premise\r\n\nthat Massachusetts  can be  a depositor  under    1822(e) and\r\n\nalso requires that   1822(e) be read together with   1821(d),\r\n\nthe   statutory  provision  setting   forth  the  bar  dates.\r\n\nHowever, nothing in the language of these provisions suggests\r\n\nthat they should be read together.  Moreover, for the reasons\r\n\noutlined  earlier,  FDIC-Corporate's  determination that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth does not stand  in the shoes of depositors  is a\r\n\nreasonable one.  Because the Commonwealth cannot stand in the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  FDIC-Receiver  has   apparently  chosen  to   treat  the\r\nCommonwealth acting under the MAPA  as a general creditor for\r\nthe purposes  of the claims bar  statute, notwithstanding the\r\nFDIC's  determination  that  the  MAPA does  not  render  the\r\nCommonwealth  a depositor  for purposes  of    1822(e).   The\r\nbasis for this choice is not before us.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nshoes  of  depositors, its  argument that  its claim  did not\r\n\narise until  the  end  of  the  18-month  period  for  filing\r\n\ninsurance claims with FDIC-Corporate is unavailing.20\r\n\n          The argument that  Massachusetts should be  allowed\r\n\nthe more generous  filing period because it  had been allowed\r\n\nthat time period  in the past also fails.   The language of  \r\n\n1821(d) itself is clear.  The receiver must \"promptly publish\r\n\na notice to the depository institution's creditors to present\r\n\ntheir  claims, together with proof, to the receiver by a date\r\n\nspecified  in the notice which shall not be less than 90 days\r\n\nafter  the   publication  of   such  notice,\"  12   U.S.C.   \r\n\n1821(d)(3)(B)(i), and  \"claims filed after the date specified\r\n\nin the  notice published  under paragraph (3)(B)(i)  shall be\r\n\ndisallowed  and  such disallowance  shall  be  final,\" id.   \r                                                                      \r\n\n1821(d)(5)(C)(i).    FDIC-Receiver's  interpretation  of  the\r\n\nstatute,  that  a state  must  file  its  claim  against  the\r\n\nreceivership within ninety days  of receiving notice from the\r\n\nFDIC  or be barred  from doing so  in the future,  tracks the\r\n\nplain statutory  language.   The statutory language  does not\r\n\nadmit  the distinction  the  Commonwealth  urges between  so-\r\n\ncalled \"deposit\" creditors and  \"trade\" creditors.  Even were\r\n\nthere some  ambiguity about whether   1821(d)  should be read\r\n\nin light of   1822(e), reading the two sections together does\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n20.  While it is true that a claimant may not file  until his\r\nclaim  comes  into being,  Heno, 20  F.3d  at 1209,  here the\r                                           \r\nclaims arose, if at all, before the banks failed.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nnot  extend  the  claims  bar  date   for  creditors  of  the\r\n\nreceivership estate.\r\n\n          Further, it is  far from clear that  there has been\r\n\nany reversal  of \"policy\" by the agency  on this point.  Even\r\n\nviewing  the evidence  in  the light  most  favorable to  the\r\n\nCommonwealth, as  required in reviewing the  district court's\r\n\ngrant of summary  judgment, Hodgkins v. New England Tel. Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n82  F.3d 1226, 1229 (1st Cir. 1996),  there is no support for\r\n\nthe argument  that FDIC-Receiver  had a consistent  policy of\r\n\nhonoring  states' claims  filed  within eighteen  months plus\r\n\nninety days  of receiving  notice of the  receivership.   The\r\n\nCommonwealth's case rests on two  pieces of evidence.  First,\r\n\nFDIC-Receiver sent  a letter to the  Commonwealth, dated July\r\n\n1993,   containing  language  that   Massachusetts  views  as\r\n\nconfirming the  alleged policy.   This interpretation  is not\r\n\nsupported  by  the language  of  the letter.    Second, FDIC-\r\n\nReceiver  honored  an  untimely  claim  by  Massachusetts for\r\n\nabandoned  deposits held  in  one of  the  banks that  failed\r\n\naround  the same  time as  the other  banks involved  in this\r\n\nlitigation.  An isolated  settlement decision is not evidence\r\n\nof a prior policy.\r\n\n                              V.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  No\r                                                                    \r\n\ncosts are awarded.\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n",

This case is part of the aftermath of\r\n\nthat financial crisis.  At  issue is whether the Commonwealth\r\n\nof  Massachusetts,   acting  under  its   abandoned  property\r\n\nstatute,  may obtain  either  the  federal deposit  insurance\r\n\nproceeds  or  the  pro  rata   distributions  from  abandoned\r\n\naccounts  in failed Massachusetts  banks.

In  March  1994,  Massachusetts   also  filed  an\r\n\nadministrative  claim  with  FDIC-Corporate for  the  insured\r\n\nvalue of the unclaimed deposits, arguing that it was entitled\r\n\nto these funds under the MAPA.6\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  This interest cannot exceed  five-twelfths of one percent\r\nper month.  Id.\r                           \r\n\n5.  This   dispute   initially   involved  both   pre-closing\r\ndeposits, deposits  abandoned before the banks  were put into\r\nreceivership, and post-closing  deposits, deposits  abandoned\r\nafter  the  banks  were  put  into  receivership.    However,\r\nMassachusetts has since conceded that  it is not entitled  to\r\nthe  post-closing  deposits, Massachusetts  v.

Massachusetts further\r\n\nargues that,  in this context, the new FDIC interpretation is\r\n\nnot  entitled  to  full  Chevron  deference.   FDIC-Corporate\r                                            \r\n\nconcedes  that before  1988 it  did not  consistently require\r\n\ndeposit insurance on abandoned accounts to be returned to the\r\n\nfederal government  rather than  turned over to  the states.9\r\n\nIt asserts, however, that, when the inconsistency was brought\r\n\nto its attention in  late 1988, it determined that    1822(e)\r\n\nrequired  these funds to revert to the FDIC.

This inconsistency may have  resulted from the FDIC's use\r\nof three different  responses to bank failures,  one of which\r\nwas  known as a  purchase and assumption  transaction and did\r\nnot  involve either insured deposits or transferred deposits,\r\nand  thus did not implicate   1822(e).  In mid-1989, the FDIC\r\nmodified  the   structure  of  its  purchase  and  assumption\r\ntransactions so  that they made use  of transferred deposits,\r\nthus eliminating  this source of confusion.

Here, the parties frame\r                             \r\n\nthe issue as   whether  a state, acting  under its  abandoned\r\n\nproperty statute, may \"claim\"  the insured value of abandoned\r\n\ndeposits  held  in failed  banks.   The  crux of  the matter,\r\n\nhowever,  is  whether  a  state acting  on  behalf  of absent\r\n\ndepositors may itself qualify as a depositor under   1822(e).\r\n\nWe do not  believe the  plain language of    1822(e)  answers\r\n\nthis question.  That the FDIC apparently viewed the matter in\r\n\ninconsistent ways  reinforces this conclusion.

In light of the  reasonableness of the\r\n\ndetermination that  states  acting under  abandoned  property\r\n\nstatutes do  not qualify  as depositors under    1822(e), any\r\n\nstate law conferring on  Massachusetts the right to act  as a\r\n\ndepositor necessarily conflicts directly with federal law.\r\n\n          Another  fundamental inconsistency  between federal\r\n\nand state law concerns  the ultimate disposition of insurance\r\n\nproceeds  for abandoned  accounts.

For\r\n\nexample, state and federal  law conflict over the time  frame\r\n\nin which a  depositor may  claim an abandoned  deposit.   The\r\n\nrelevant   version  of   the  federal   provision  eventually\r\n\nextinguished  a depositor's  right to  an  unclaimed deposit,\r\n\nwhile  the MAPA  extends the right  of a depositor  to make a\r\n\nclaim in  perpetuity.14  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 200A,   10(a).  We\r\n\nconclude that    1822(e) pre-empts  the MAPA with  respect to\r\n\nthe  federal  scheme  for  deposits that  are  abandoned  and\r\n\ntherefore  that  the  Commonwealth  is not  entitled  to  the\r\n\nclaimed insurance proceeds.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  There  are other differences as well.   Section  1822(e)\r\nrequires FDIC-Corporate  to  mail two  notices regarding  any\r\nunclaimed deposit, whatever its amount, the first thirty days\r\nafter  insurance  payments  are  inititated  and  the  second\r\nfifteen  months   later,  to the  last  known address  of the\r\ndepositor.  The MAPA would require FDIC-Corporate to send out\r\nadditional  information:  a  report  to the  State  Treasurer\r\ndescribing  any  property abandoned  under  the  MAPA, and  a\r\nnotice to the owner of any account containing more than $100.\r\nMass.  Gen.  L.  ch.  200A,      7,  7(A).    However,  while\r\ndifferent, these notice requirements do not actually conflict\r\nwith each other.\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n          Massachusetts  makes  a final  argument that  it is\r\n\nentitled  to the insurance  proceeds because, as  a matter of\r\n\nfederal  law, it  is  a fiduciary  for  depositors.   Federal\r\n\nregulations  acknowledge that  there may be  \"fiduciaries\" or\r\n\n\"custodians\"  whose status  is  apparent from  the books  and\r\n\nrecords of the  failed bank and who,  as a matter of  federal\r\n\nlaw,  are permitted to stand  in the shoes  of the depositors\r\n\nfor some purposes.   12 C.F.R.    330.4,  330.6 (1996).   The\r\n\nCommonwealth argues  that it  qualifies as a  fiduciary whose\r\n\nstatus is  apparent from  the banks' deposit  account records\r\n\nand  that   it  therefore  is  entitled   under  the  federal\r\n\nregulations to the insured value of abandoned deposits.  This\r\n\nargument fails because the Commonwealth locates the source of\r\n\nits fiduciary  status in state  law provisions that  are pre-\r\n\nempted by the applicable version of   1822(e).15\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Additionally,  the district  court correctly  ruled that\r\nthe Commonwealth's  claimed fiduciary status  is not  readily\r\napparent from  the face of the banks' deposit account records\r\nas required by  the regulations.

The  district court lacks\r\n\nsubject  matter  jurisdiction over  any  claim  not filed  in\r\n\naccordance   with   these   requirements.     12   U.S.C.    \r\n\n1821(d)(13)(D).   Accordingly,  the district  court dismissed\r\n\nthe action.

Massachusetts\r\n\npresents two  basic arguments  why it should  receive a  more\r\n\ngenerous  filing period: that it  is not just  a creditor but\r\n\nstands  in  the  shoes  of  depositors  as  a  fiduciary   or\r\n\nconservator, and that the  FDIC in the past had  permitted it\r\n\nto  do  so  and   is  now  bound  by  that   prior  position.\r\n\nMassachusetts' theory appears  to be that  as a fiduciary  of\r\n\nthe depositors, it had no claim against FDIC-Receiver for the\r\n\npro rata value of the abandoned deposits until the expiration\r\n\nof depositors' rights  to claim  the insured  value of  their\r\n\naccounts.   According to the Commonwealth,  its 90-day filing\r\n\nperiod17  for  claims  against the  receivership  estate only\r\n\nbegan  to  run eighteen  months  after the  appointment  of a\r\n\nreceiver for  the failed  banks, effectively creating  a time\r\n\nlimit of eighteen months plus ninety days.18\r\n\n          FDIC-Receiver's  position  is that  states  are not\r\n\nentitled  to  the  more  lenient time  limits  applicable  to\r\n\ndepositors filing as creditors.  This position has the virtue\r\n\nof  being  largely consistent  with the  view taken  by FDIC-\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  The statute  says that the  FDIC may specify  any period\r\nninety days  or longer.   In this  case, as  in most  others,\r\nFDIC-Receiver set a 90-day filing period.\r\n\n18.  The  premise   on  which  this  argument   is  based  is\r\nincorrect:  since the enactment of the UDAA, depositors  have\r\nthe longer of 18 months or until the end of  the receivership\r\nestate  to file insurance claims.  Pub. L. No. 103-44,   2(b)\r\n(1993).\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nCorporate.19    Further, this  decision  is  not economically\r\n\nirrational.   It protects  the federal insurance  funds to  a\r\n\ncertain  extent,  thereby reducing  the  cost  of the  thrift\r\n\nclean-up  to the  taxpayer.  FDIC-Receiver  pays out  what is\r\n\nleft of  deposits pro rata  to creditors.   FDIC-Corporate is\r\n\nitself a  creditor of the  receivership estate to  the extent\r\n\nthat  it   has  paid  insurance  and   became  subrogated  to\r\n\ndepositors' rights.   12  U.S.C.   1821(g).   FDIC-Receiver's\r\n\npolicy gives creditors a small window to assert their claims,\r\n\nwhich benefits all timely claimants, including FDIC-Corporate\r\n\nas subrogee.\r\n\n          The  Commonwealth's  claim  that it  stands  in the\r\n\nshoes of depositors fails.  The claim is based on the premise\r\n\nthat Massachusetts  can be  a depositor  under    1822(e) and\r\n\nalso requires that   1822(e) be read together with   1821(d),\r\n\nthe   statutory  provision  setting   forth  the  bar  dates.\r\n\nHowever, nothing in the language of these provisions suggests\r\n\nthat they should be read together.  Moreover, for the reasons\r\n\noutlined  earlier,  FDIC-Corporate's  determination that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth does not stand  in the shoes of depositors  is a\r\n\nreasonable one.  Because the Commonwealth cannot stand in the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  FDIC-Receiver  has   apparently  chosen  to   treat  the\r\nCommonwealth acting under the MAPA  as a general creditor for\r\nthe purposes  of the claims bar  statute, notwithstanding the\r\nFDIC's  determination  that  the  MAPA does  not  render  the\r\nCommonwealth  a depositor  for purposes  of    1822(e).   The\r\nbasis for this choice is not before us.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nshoes  of  depositors, its  argument that  its claim  did not\r\n\narise until  the  end  of  the  18-month  period  for  filing\r\n\ninsurance claims with FDIC-Corporate is unavailing.20\r\n\n          The argument that  Massachusetts should be  allowed\r\n\nthe more generous  filing period because it  had been allowed\r\n\nthat time period  in the past also fails.   The language of  \r\n\n1821(d) itself is clear.  The receiver must \"promptly publish\r\n\na notice to the depository institution's creditors to present\r\n\ntheir  claims, together with proof, to the receiver by a date\r\n\nspecified  in the notice which shall not be less than 90 days\r\n\nafter  the   publication  of   such  notice,\"  12   U.S.C.   \r\n\n1821(d)(3)(B)(i), and  \"claims filed after the date specified\r\n\nin the  notice published  under paragraph (3)(B)(i)  shall be\r\n\ndisallowed  and  such disallowance  shall  be  final,\" id.   \r                                                                      \r\n\n1821(d)(5)(C)(i).    FDIC-Receiver's  interpretation  of  the\r\n\nstatute,  that  a state  must  file  its  claim  against  the\r\n\nreceivership within ninety days  of receiving notice from the\r\n\nFDIC  or be barred  from doing so  in the future,  tracks the\r\n\nplain statutory  language.   The statutory language  does not\r\n\nadmit  the distinction  the  Commonwealth  urges between  so-\r\n\ncalled \"deposit\" creditors and  \"trade\" creditors.  Even were\r\n\nthere some  ambiguity about whether   1821(d)  should be read\r\n\nin light of   1822(e), reading the two sections together does\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n20.  While it is true that a claimant may not file  until his\r\nclaim  comes  into being,  Heno, 20  F.3d  at 1209,  here the\r                                           \r\nclaims arose, if at all, before the banks failed.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nnot  extend  the  claims  bar  date   for  creditors  of  the\r\n\nreceivership estate.\r\n\n          Further, it is  far from clear that  there has been\r\n\nany reversal  of \"policy\" by the agency  on this point.  Even\r\n\nviewing  the evidence  in  the light  most  favorable to  the\r\n\nCommonwealth, as  required in reviewing the  district court's\r\n\ngrant of summary  judgment, Hodgkins v. New England Tel. Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196752\"><a href=\"/opinion/196752/hodgkins-v-new-england-telephon/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229 (1st Cir. 1996),  there is no support for\r\n\nthe argument  that FDIC-Receiver  had a consistent  policy of\r\n\nhonoring  states' claims  filed  within eighteen  months plus\r\n\nninety days  of receiving  notice of the  receivership.   The\r\n\nCommonwealth's case rests on two  pieces of evidence.  First,\r\n\nFDIC-Receiver sent  a letter to the  Commonwealth, dated July\r\n\n1993,   containing  language  that   Massachusetts  views  as\r\n\nconfirming the  alleged policy.   This interpretation  is not\r\n\nsupported  by  the language  of  the letter.    Second, FDIC-\r\n\nReceiver  honored  an  untimely  claim  by  Massachusetts for\r\n\nabandoned  deposits held  in  one of  the  banks that  failed\r\n\naround  the same  time as  the other  banks involved  in this\r\n\nlitigation.  An isolated  settlement decision is not evidence\r\n\nof a prior policy.\r\n\n                              V.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  No\r                                                                    \r\n\ncosts are awarded.\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n</pre>",
