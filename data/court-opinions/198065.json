Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                   \r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n       Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n          and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                   \r\n\nRoberto Lefranc Romero, with whom Martinez Alvarez, Menendez\r\nCortada &amp; Lefranc Romero was on brief, for appellants Hoyos and\r\nRivera-Gonzalez.\r\nJohn F.

After suffering indignities at the\r\nhands of an unstable police officer, plaintiff-appellee Grancid\r\nCamilo-Robles sued an array of defendants under 42 U.S.C.  1983\r\n(1994). In due season, five such defendants, appellants here,\r\nmoved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. \r\nThe district court rejected their motions (in some instances\r\nwithout waiting for an opposition).  Although the timing of the\r\ndistrict court's ruling and the lack of any authoritative insight\r\ninto the court's reasoning complicate our task, we affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nParking privileges denote special status in our motorized\r\nsociety, and emotions often run high when a parking space is at\r\nstake.  This case vividly illustrates that verity.\r\nOn May 13, 1994, Miguel Diaz-Martinez, a police officer\r\nassigned to the Bayamon Criminal Investigation Corps (CIC), sought\r\nto park in an area reserved for judges at the Bayamon Judicial\r\nCenter.  Camilo-Robles, a security guard sworn to protect that\r\nhallowed ground, told Diaz-Martinez that he could not park there. \r\nIn response to this perceived affront, Diaz-Martinez placed his\r\nhand on his gun, arrested Camilo-Robles, handcuffed him, shoved the\r\nprisoner into his (Diaz-Martinez's) police cruiser, and drove to\r\nthe station house (pausing to punch Camilo-Robles in the stomach\r\nand slap him in the face).  Upon their arrival, Diaz-Martinez\r\nforced the plaintiff to remove his belt and shoes and placed him in\r\na cell with other detainees.  Cooler heads prevailed, and Diaz-\r\nMartinez's prey was released, uncharged, some three hours later.\r\nCamilo-Robles sued Gilberto Diaz-Pagan (director of the\r\nBayamon CIC), Pablo Santiago-Gonzalez (Bayamon area commander), and\r\nPedro A. Toledo-Davila (superintendent of police).  In addition to\r\nthese high-ranking police officials, Camilo-Robles named a host of\r\nother defendants including inter alia two psychiatrists who worked\r\nfor the police department, Drs. Guillermo Hoyos and Hector O.\r\nRivera-Gonzalez.  Invoking section 1983, Camilo-Robles alleged that\r\nthese five named defendants (collectively, \"the appellants\") had\r\ndeprived him of his civil rights by their deliberate indifference\r\nin carrying out their supervisory responsibilities (with the result\r\nthat Diaz-Martinez, a demonstrably unstable officer, was allowed to\r\nremain on active duty).\r\nThe district court issued its scheduling order on\r\nFebruary 21, 1996.  In December of that year, the appellants filed\r\nsummary judgment motions.  Camilo-Robles responded on the merits to\r\nthe psychiatrists' summary judgment motion, but served a cross-\r\nmotion seeking additional time in which to oppose the police\r\nofficials' motions, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), explaining that they\r\nhad stonewalled during pretrial discovery.  The district court\r\ngranted this cross-motion without limit of time and referred all\r\npending discovery matters to a magistrate judge.  Lassitude set in,\r\nand the magistrate made no rulings until August 26, 1997.  Two days\r\nlater, the district court denied the appellants' summary judgment\r\nmotions in a curt, two-page order.  These appeals followed. \r\nII.  A CAREER TO MAKE ST. SEBASTIAN WEEP\r\nBecause the allegations of liability and the defenses\r\nthereto hinge upon what actions the various defendants took (or\r\nshould have taken) in light of Diaz-Martinez's flagitious history\r\nof violence, the latter's career is of great relevance.  We extract\r\nthe facts from the summary judgment record, resolving all conflicts\r\nin favor of the plaintiff.  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895\r\nF.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\nDiaz-Martinez joined the police force as a cadet in March\r\n1984.  That December, he was suspended for an assault.  Despite the\r\nsuspension, he became a regular officer and served as such for the\r\nnext five years.  His record reflects numerous disciplinary\r\ninfractions involving violent and/or threatening behavior   we\r\ncount at least eighteen   many of which entailed unwarranted\r\nbrandishing of his weapon.  The denouement occurred in August 1989\r\nwhen, after assaulting his wife, Diaz-Martinez entered the Catano\r\npolice station, seized a shotgun, and held several gendarmes\r\n(including the acting police superintendent) hostage for several\r\nhours.\r\nSubsequent to this bizarre display, Diaz-Martinez was\r\ncommitted involuntarily to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed as\r\nschizophrenic.  The hospital discharged him and three months later\r\na police psychiatrist, Dr. Pagan-Davis, recommended that he be\r\nseparated from the force and given a civilian position.  The police\r\ndepartment suspended Diaz-Martinez in 1990 and formally expelled\r\nhim in 1991.\r\nJustice sometimes moves in mysterious ways.  Diaz-\r\nMartinez successfully appealed his expulsion and the police\r\ndepartment reinstated him in May 1993.  While on desk duty, he\r\nassaulted a civilian.  Nevertheless, Drs. Hoyos and Rivera-Gonzalez\r\nfound Diaz-Martinez free from mental illness and fit for active\r\nduty (with no restrictions) when they examined him in August.  The\r\ndepartment promptly rearmed him and assigned him to work in a high-\r\ntension neighborhood.  On September 8, 1993 (the day following his\r\nreturn to active duty), Diaz-Martinez engaged in an altercation\r\nwith two unarmed, law-abiding neighborhood residents.  In the\r\ncourse of this fracas, he shot both of them, wounding one and\r\nkilling the other.  See Diaz v. Diaz Martinez, 112 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (summarizing the facts of that episode).  The police\r\ndepartment immediately confiscated his weapon.\r\nAfter a self-imposed exile, Diaz-Martinez returned to\r\ndesk duty in November 1993.  On January 20, 1994, while still\r\nunarmed, Diaz-Martinez threatened to kill a fellow officer at the\r\nBayamon Radio Center.  Six days later, he was transferred to the\r\nBayamon CIC.  On February 28, 1994, Drs. Hoyos and Rivera-Gonzalez\r\nagain examined Diaz-Martinez and again declared him ready for\r\nunrestricted active duty and fit to carry a weapon.  The police\r\ndepartment rearmed him forthwith.\r\nThe incident that sparked this suit occurred in May of\r\n1994.  The police department again expelled Diaz-Martinez that\r\nAugust.  He eventually pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter in\r\nconnection with the September 1993 shootings and was sentenced to\r\nserve a prison term.\r\nIII.  THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\r\nBefore tackling the vagaries of each defendant's appeal,\r\nwe first must map the crossroads at which the qualified immunity\r\ndoctrine and principles of supervisory liability under section 1983\r\nintersect.  We then discuss pertinent questions of appellate\r\njurisdiction and pause to note the somewhat tentative nature of\r\norders denying summary judgment in the qualified immunity context.\r\nA.  Qualified Immunity and Supervisory Liability.\r\nFederal law provides a cause of action when an\r\nindividual, acting under color of state law, deprives a person of\r\nfederally assured rights.   See 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Public officials\r\nwho stand accused of civil rights violations under section 1983\r\nnonetheless can avoid liability for money damages by showing either\r\nthat they did not violate a right clearly established under federal\r\nlaw or that they acted with objective legal reasonableness.  SeeHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 819 (1982); Buenrostro v.\r\nCollazo, 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that a section 1983\r\nplaintiff must allege a violation of a clearly established right\r\nsecured either by the Constitution or by some other federal law. \r\nSee County of Sacramento v. Lewis,     S. Ct.    ,     n.5 (1998)\r\n[1998 WL 259980 at *4 n.5].  Here, the plaintiff vaults this hurdle\r\nwith room to spare.  The right to be free from unreasonable seizure\r\n(and, by extension, unjustified arrest and detention) is clearly\r\nestablished in the jurisprudence of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n(through which the Fourth Amendment constrains state action).  The\r\nright to due process of law (and, by extension, to be free from\r\npolice brutality) is likewise clearly established under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment (through which the Fifth Amendment constrains\r\nstate action).\r\nWe have not had occasion to address the question whether,\r\nto be liable under section 1983, a supervisor must have violated an\r\nindependent, \"clearly established\" right, or whether a supervisor\r\nmay be liable based only on his proximity to a subordinate's\r\nviolation of a \"clearly established\" right.  Other circuits,\r\nhowever, have addressed this interplay between the \"clearly\r\nestablished\" requirement and supervisory liability.  We follow\r\ntheir lead and adopt an approach that comports with the core\r\nprinciple of qualified immunity by protecting supervisory officials\r\nfrom suit when they could not reasonably anticipate liability.\r\nWhen a supervisor seeks qualified immunity in a section\r\n1983 action, the \"clearly established\" prong of the qualified\r\nimmunity inquiry is satisfied when (1) the subordinate's actions\r\nviolated a clearly established constitutional right, and (2) it was\r\nclearly established that a supervisor would be liable for\r\nconstitutional violations perpetrated by his subordinates in that\r\ncontext.  See Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., 15 F.3d 443, 456\r\n(5th Cir. 1994); Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 801 (4th Cir. 1994). \r\nIn other words, for a supervisor to be liable there must be a\r\nbifurcated \"clearly established\" inquiry   one branch probing the\r\nunderlying violation, and the other probing the supervisor's\r\npotential liability.\r\nHere, both elements are satisfied.  We already have noted\r\nthat the plaintiff's clearly established rights were violated, seesupra Part III(A), and it is equally well settled that a\r\ndeliberately indifferent police supervisor may be held liable for\r\nthe constitutional violations of his subordinates.  See Diaz, 112\r\nF.3d at 4.\r\nThe question, then, reduces to the test of objective\r\nlegal reasonableness.  This test does not serve as a proxy for\r\nliability, because even state actors who commit constitutional\r\nviolations may be entitled to qualified immunity.  See, e.g.,\r\nRinguette v. City of Fall River,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n[No. 96-1107, slip op. at 10]; Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888 F.2d 189,\r\n194 (1st Cir. 1989).  Instead, the test's utility is restricted to\r\nthe qualified immunity inquiry.  In that milieu, the test provides\r\na method for determining whether, in relation to a clearly\r\nestablished right, a defendant's conduct was (or was not)\r\nreasonable.  Withal, objective legal reasonableness is a concept\r\nthat grew up in the prototypical section 1983 context   a context\r\nin which a state actor (\"A\") inflicts injury directly on a victim\r\n(\"V\") in derogation of V's constitutionally-protected rights. \r\nWhere the context shifts   as where A is not a direct actor (i.e.,\r\nhe himself did not perpetrate the seizure, detention, or assault of\r\nwhich V complains), but, rather, stands accused of permitting a\r\nthird person (\"B\"), also a state actor, to violate V's rights   the\r\ntest remains intact, but its focus shifts.  In this tri-cornered\r\nsituation, objective legal reasonableness (and, hence, qualified\r\nimmunity) necessarily depends upon the relationship between A's\r\nacts or omissions and B's conduct.\r\nThis brings us to the doctrine of supervisory liability,\r\nwhich holds that a supervisor (defined loosely to encompass a wide\r\nrange of officials who are themselves removed from the perpetration\r\nof the rights-violating behavior) may be liable under section 1983\r\nif he formulates a policy or engages in a practice that leads to a\r\ncivil rights violation committed by another.  See City of Oklahoma\r\nCity v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823-24 (1985).  Notice is a salient\r\nconsideration in determining the existence of supervisory\r\nliability.  See Febus-Rodriguez v. Betancourt-Lebron, 14 F.3d 87,\r\n93 (1st Cir. 1994) (treating as \"[a]n important factor . . .\r\nwhether [the supervisor] was put on notice of behavior which was\r\nlikely to result in the violation of . . . constitutional rights\"). \r\nNonetheless, supervisory liability does not require a showing that\r\nthe supervisor had actual knowledge of the offending behavior; he\r\n\"may be liable for the foreseeable consequences of such conduct if\r\nhe would have known of it but for his deliberate indifference or\r\nwillful blindness.\"  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d\r\n576, 582 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nTo demonstrate deliberate indifference a plaintiff must\r\nshow (1) a grave risk of harm, (2) the defendant's actual or\r\nconstructive knowledge of that risk, and (3) his failure to take\r\neasily available measures to address the risk.  See Manarite v.\r\nCity of Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 956 (1st Cir. 1992).  This\r\nformulation correctly implies that deliberate indifference alone\r\ndoes not equate with supervisory liability; a suitor also must show\r\ncausation.  See Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 582 (explaining that\r\nthe supervisor must have \"had the power and authority to alleviate\r\n[the violation]\").  In other words, the plaintiff must\r\n\"affirmatively connect the supervisor's conduct to the\r\nsubordinate's violative act or omission.\"  Id.  This affirmative\r\nconnection need not take the form of knowing sanction, but may\r\ninclude tacit approval of, acquiescence in, or purposeful disregard\r\nof, rights-violating conduct.  See id. \r\nThis returns us to the point of our beginning:  the\r\nrelationship between qualified immunity and supervisory liability. \r\nBy definition, a defendant who claims qualified immunity must do so\r\neither on the theory that the asserted right is not clearly\r\nestablished or on the theory that the conduct attributed to him\r\nsatisfies the test of objective legal reasonableness.  See Harlow,\r\n457 U.S. at 819.  Because the constitutional rights and supervisory\r\nliability doctrine that underlie Camilo-Robles's claim are clearly\r\nestablished, the qualified immunity analysis here turns on whether,\r\nin the particular circumstances confronted by each appellant, that\r\nappellant should reasonably have understood that his conduct\r\njeopardized these rights.  See Ringuette,     F.3d at     [slip op.\r\nat 10]; Berthiaume v. Caron,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998) [No.\r\n97-1958, slip op. at 7].\r\nThe inquiry into qualified immunity is separate and\r\ndistinct from the inquiry into the merits.  Consequently, courts\r\nare well-advised to separate \"qualified immunity\" analysis from\r\n\"merits\" analysis whenever practicable.  In some circumstances,\r\nhowever, these inquiries overlap.  So it is here:  the appellants\r\nstand accused of culpable conduct in a setting that requires an\r\ninquiry into deliberate indifference (which is customarily a\r\nmerits-related topic).\r\nGiven this setting, discerning whether a particular\r\nappellant's behavior passes the context-specific test of objective\r\nlegal reasonableness to some extent collapses the separate\r\n\"qualified immunity\" and \"merits\" inquiries into a single analytic\r\nunit.  Such an approach is unusual, but we occasionally have\r\nengaged in precisely this sort of merits-centric analysis in the\r\ncourse of deciding questions of qualified immunity.  See, e.g.,\r\nMorales v. Ramirez, 906 F.2d 784, 787 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining\r\n\"that, in certain cases, some aspect of the merits may be\r\ninexorably intertwined with the issue of qualified immunity\")\r\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Amsden v. Moran,\r\n904 F.2d 748, 753-58 (1st Cir. 1990) (examining the substance of\r\nthe plaintiff's due process claims to determine the defendants'\r\neligibility for qualified immunity).\r\nWe weave these strands together into a thread that binds\r\nthese appeals.  The plaintiff alleges a violation of clearly\r\nestablished constitutional rights and asserts that several\r\ndefendants bear supervisory liability for that violation. \r\nResponding to these allegations, each defendant claims qualified\r\nimmunity and, because both the rights in question and each\r\ndefendant's susceptibility to supervisory liability are clearly\r\nestablished, these qualified immunity claims hinge on whether that\r\ndefendant's conduct was objectively reasonable.  Since our inquiry\r\ninto objective legal reasonableness involves deliberate\r\nindifference, however, we are compelled to engage the merits to a\r\ngreater extent than is usual.\r\nB.  Considerations Affecting Appellate Jurisdiction.\r\nWere we reviewing a district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment based on qualified immunity, our course would be clear: \r\nwe would determine de novo whether the affected defendant was\r\nentitled to a favorable judgment as a matter of law.  Here,\r\nhowever, the summary judgment motions were denied, not granted, and\r\nthis fact complicates our analysis.  In the qualified immunity\r\nrealm, the dividing line between appealable and non-appealable\r\ndenials of summary judgment is blurred.\r\nCases are clear enough at the extremes.  We know, for\r\ninstance, that when a motion for summary judgment that asserts\r\nqualified immunity is rejected, the denial cannot ground an\r\ninterlocutory appeal if the operative question is \"whether or not\r\nthe pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.\" \r\nJohnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 320 (1995).  Similarly, we know\r\nthat the denial of such a motion is immediately appealable if the\r\noperative question is purely legal in nature.  See id. at 319.  In\r\nfine, \"a summary judgment order which determines that the pretrial\r\nrecord sets forth a genuine issue of fact, as distinguished from an\r\norder that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate,\r\nunder clearly established law, a violation of some federally\r\nprotected right, is not reviewable on demand.\"  Stella v. Kelley,\r\n63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995); accord Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\r\nU.S. 299, 306 (1996).\r\nDetermining the existence vel non of appellate\r\njurisdiction in cases closer to the equator is more difficult. \r\nSome examples may be useful.  In Diaz, we determined that we lacked\r\njurisdiction to entertain an interlocutory appeal from a pretrial\r\ndecision denying qualified immunity because the decision turned on\r\nthe existence of a factual conflict or on what the lower court\r\nperceived to be a factual conflict.  112 F.3d at 4-5.   This\r\ncontrasts with situations in which the district court assumes a set\r\nof facts and decides, as a matter of law, that those facts will not\r\nsupport a qualified immunity defense   in which event jurisdiction\r\nexists to entertain an immediate appeal.  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at\r\n313.\r\nIf this were not complex enough, the district judge is\r\nnot legally obliged to explain the basis on which a denial of\r\nsummary judgment rests.  See Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319\r\n(acknowledging that \"[d]istrict judges may simply deny summary\r\njudgment motions without indicating their reasons for doing so\");\r\nDomegan v. Fair, 859 F.2d 1059, 1065-66 (1st Cir. 1988) (similar). \r\nWhen the district court's order is unilluminating, the appellate\r\ncourt must fend for itself.  Anticipating the dilemma that such an\r\ninscrutable order may pose in the qualified immunity context, the\r\nCourt prophesied \"that a court of appeals may have to undertake a\r\ncumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the\r\ndistrict court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\r\nlikely assumed.\"  Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319.  Hence, we must perform\r\nthe equivalent of an archeological dig and endeavor to reconstruct\r\nthe probable basis for the district court's decision.\r\nHere, the district court denied the appellants' motions\r\nfor summary judgment before the plaintiff filed oppositions to\r\nseveral of those motions.  As a result of this hastiness, the data\r\nbefore the court were limited   and limited further by the\r\nappellants' apparent intransigence in furnishing discovery. \r\nWithal, the district court had before it a great deal of\r\ninformation from sources such as the psychiatrists' summary\r\njudgment papers, the plaintiff's opposition to the psychiatrists'\r\nmotion, and evidentiary materials submitted by a former codefendant\r\nin connection with an earlier summary judgment motion.  The court\r\nalso had before it all the appellants' moving papers (which contain\r\nmore than a smidgen of intramural fingerpointing).  The court was\r\nat liberty to consult all these sources, and we, too, can consult\r\nthem in endeavoring to determine whether the court below based its\r\ndecision on contested facts as opposed to a quintessentially legal\r\njudgment.\r\n            C.  A Note of Caution.\r\nHaving performed the exercise described in Part III(B),\r\nsupra, we conclude, for reasons made manifest in our subsequent\r\ndiscussion of the appellants' claims, that we have jurisdiction\r\nover all these appeals and that the lower court appropriately\r\ndenied all four summary judgment motions.  We note, however, that\r\nthis endorsement of the district court's ruling has a somewhat\r\ntentative cast.  We offer three pertinent observations.\r\nFirst, our approach assumes, despite the awkwardness of\r\nthe conceptual fit, that deliberate indifference cases are amenable\r\nto standard qualified immunity analysis   a proposition that\r\nlogically may be debatable, but that nevertheless follows from the\r\nSupreme Court's broad pronouncements.  See, e.g., Harlow, 457 U.S.\r\nat 819.  Second, a pretrial refusal to grant qualified immunity is\r\nonly a way station in the travel of a case.  When a defendant fails\r\non a pretrial qualified immunity claim, he nonetheless can plead\r\nqualified immunity as an affirmative defense and resurrect the\r\nclaim at trial.  See Ringuette,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 6];\r\nKing v. Macri, 993 F.2d 294, 299 (2d Cir. 1993); Vazquez Rios v.\r\nHernandez-Colon, 819 F.2d 319, 329 (1st Cir. 1987).  Third,\r\nnotwithstanding a pretrial rejection of qualified immunity, the\r\nmerits remain open.\r\nIV.  THE PSYCHIATRISTS\r\nThe plaintiff alleges that the psychiatrists, Drs. Hoyos\r\nand Rivera-Gonzalez, evaluated Diaz-Martinez on February 28, 1994,\r\nwith complete indifference to the constitutional rights of others\r\nand recklessly declared him fit for duty and able to carry a\r\nweapon.  The psychiatrists' joint summary judgment motion addressed\r\nthis claim on two levels, positing that they enjoy (1) absolute\r\nimmunity from suit under Puerto Rico law, and (2) qualified\r\nimmunity from suit under federal law because their performance was\r\nobjectively reasonable and, in any event, had no direct bearing on\r\nthe decision to restore an armed Diaz-Martinez to active duty.  We\r\ngrapple with these asseverations in sequence.\r\n\n            A.  Absolute Immunity.\r\nA district court's refusal to grant summary judgment on\r\nan absolute immunity claim is, generally speaking, within the scope\r\nof our appellate jurisdiction on interlocutory appeal.  SeeAcevedo-Cordero v. Cordero-Santiago, 958 F.2d 20, 21 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  In this instance, it invokes the Puerto Rico Medico-\r\nHospital Professional Liability Insurance Act, which provides in\r\npertinent part:\r\nNo health service professional may be included\r\nas a defendant in a civil suit for damages due\r\nto malpractice caused in the performance of\r\nhis/her profession while said health service\r\nprofessional acts in compliance with his\r\nduties and functions as an employee of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, its dependencies,\r\ninstrumentalities and municipalities.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,  4105 (1994).  The psychiatrists contend\r\nthat this statute immunizes them because they examined Diaz-\r\nMartinez pursuant to the terms of a contract purporting to free\r\nthem from liability under section 4105 (incorrectly identified as\r\nsection 5105).  We do not agree.\r\nIn the first place, the statute on its face applies to\r\n\"employees.\"  The contract states that the psychiatrists are\r\nindependent contractors, not employees, and the record at the very\r\nleast raises unanswered factual questions anent the statute's\r\napplicability.  See, e.g., Flores Roman v. Ramos-Gonzalez, 127 P.R.\r\nDec. 601, 608-09 (P.R. 1990) (examining the relevant contract to\r\ndetermine whether a given defendant is an employee or independent\r\ncontractor); see also Nieves v. University of P.R., 7 F.3d 270, 273\r\n(1st Cir. 1993) (discussing section 4105).\r\nIn the second place, even if section 4105 applies, it at\r\nmost gives government-employed physicians immunity from claims\r\nbrought under Puerto Rico law.  A state-conferred immunity cannot\r\nshield a state actor from liability under section 1983.  SeeMartinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 284 n.8 (1980) (\"Conduct by\r\npersons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42\r\nU.S.C.  1983 . . . cannot be immunized by state law.\") (quoting\r\nHampton v. City of Chicago, 484 F.2d 602, 607 (7th Cir. 1973)). \r\nIndeed, a regime that allowed a state immunity defense to trump the\r\nimposition of liability under section 1983 would emasculate the\r\nfederal statute.  See id.  We therefore reject the proposition that\r\nabsolute immunity entitled the psychiatrists to summary judgment.\r\n           B.  Qualified Immunity.\r\nBefore confronting the psychiatrists' qualified immunity\r\ndefense, we make a preliminary point.  The psychiatrists are\r\nprivate practitioners, not government employees in the traditional\r\nsense.  Consequently, one might wonder whether they could be liable\r\nat all under section 1983, or, if so, whether they would be\r\nentitled to qualified immunity even on a \"best case\" scenario.  The\r\nanswer to both questions is in the affirmative.\r\nA private party's conduct is attributable to the state if\r\nthe state \"has so far insinuated itself into a position of\r\ninterdependence with [the private party] that it must be recognized\r\nas a joint participant in the challenged activity.\"  Barrios-\r\nVelazquez v. Asociacin de Empleados del Estado Libre Asociado, 84\r\nF.3d 487, 494 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted; alteration in the original).  Here, the\r\npsychiatrists acted under contract with the police department to\r\nassist in a necessary departmental function:  the evaluation of\r\nofficers.  Hence, the psychiatrists, virtually by their own\r\nadmission (see supra Part IV(A)), are for purposes of this case\r\nstate actors performing in concert with the department.  As such,\r\nthey are both subject to suit under section 1983 and eligible for\r\nthe balm of qualified immunity.  See Rodriques v. Furtado, 950 F.2d\r\n805, 814 (1st Cir. 1991) (extending qualified immunity to a\r\nphysician who agreed to assist the police in a body cavity search).\r\nThat said, the psychiatrists' pretrial case for qualified\r\nimmunity lacks force.  First, perscrutation of the record discloses\r\nuncontested facts sufficient to permit us to exercise jurisdiction\r\nover their appeal.  Second, those facts, construed favorably to\r\nCamilo-Robles, adequately ground a tripartite conclusion (1) that\r\nDiaz-Martinez posed an unusually serious risk of harm, (2) that the\r\npsychiatrists had actual knowledge of the risk, and (3) that they\r\nfailed to take readily apparent steps to alleviate that risk. \r\nThird, the assumed set of facts presented here reveals a reckless\r\ndisregard for the rights of others that outstrips any band of\r\nprotection afforded by the doctrine of qualified immunity in cases\r\nof deliberately indifferent conduct.\r\nWe see no need to differentiate between the two\r\npsychiatrists for present purposes; after all, they themselves have\r\nabjured such a course and presented a united front both below and\r\non appeal.  By like token, it seems unnecessary to rehearse all the\r\nfacts that contribute to our conclusions.  Instead, we offer a\r\nsampling.\r\nThe psychiatrists approached the February\r\n1994 evaluation with abundant\r\nforeknowledge of Diaz-Martinez's case,\r\ngleaned from their August 1993 evaluation\r\nof him and their ensuing certification\r\nthat he was fit for active duty at that\r\ntime.\r\n\nOn September 1, 1993, a few days after\r\nthey  issued the August 1993\r\ncertification, the psychiatrists received\r\na psychologist's report (the Sedra\r\nReport), dated July 14, 1993, which noted\r\nthat Diaz-Martinez denied reality, that\r\nhe was immature, impulsive, and anxious,\r\nand that \"his tension level could make\r\nhim . . . act[] out.\"  Dr. Sedra later\r\ndescribed this last observation as\r\nequivalent to saying that  Diaz-Martinez\r\n\"could explode at any time.\"  Despite\r\nreceiving this report, the psychiatrists\r\ndid not revisit their original\r\ncertification of Diaz-Martinez as fit for\r\nduty, and seem to have ignored the Sedra\r\nReport during the February 1994\r\nexamination.\r\n\nOn September 8, 1993, Diaz-Martinez shot\r\ntwo innocent civilians, thus confirming\r\nDr. Sedra's warnings.  Still, the\r\npsychiatrists (both of whom knew of that\r\nincident) nonetheless recertified Diaz\r\nMartinez for rearming and active duty in\r\nFebruary 1994 without an intervening\r\npsychological evaluation.\r\n\nTo administer their government contract,\r\nthe psychiatrists set up a system whereby\r\neach doctor would independently interview\r\neach referred officer, thus ensuring two\r\ndetached opinions.  Although the\r\npsychiatrists knew Diaz-Martinez's\r\nstunning history of violence, they \r\nnonetheless deviated from this protocol\r\nin their February 1994 evaluation. \r\nIndeed, their entire examination\r\nconsisted of one joint interview.\r\n\nAfter conducting their joint interview,\r\nthe psychiatrists declared Diaz-Martinez\r\n\"fit to engage in all of the duties\r\ninherent to a law enforcement agent . . .\r\n(including the use of a regulation\r\nweapon),\" without carrying out any\r\nfurther investigation.\r\n\nBy his own admission, Dr. Hoyos neglected\r\nto read the Caldern Report (which\r\ndetailed numerous instances of Diaz-\r\nMartinez's aberrant behavior) before\r\nsigning off on Diaz-Martinez's status. \r\nDr. Rivera-Gonzalez, who did read the\r\nCaldern Report, brushed it aside as\r\ninsufficient to warrant further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the\r\npsychiatrists  requested or consulted\r\nDiaz-Martinez's current complaint history\r\nbefore they gave him a clean bill of\r\nhealth in February 1994.\r\n\nThe presence of these essentially uncontested facts\r\nstrongly suggests that the district court denied the psychiatrists'\r\nmotion for summary judgment as a matter of law.  We therefore have\r\nappellate jurisdiction.  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at 313.\r\nExercising that jurisdiction and reviewing the district\r\ncourt's decision de novo, we believe that under at least one\r\nplausible scenario depicted by these assumed facts   in which the\r\npsychiatrists did not comply with their own evaluation protocol,\r\nfailed to credit or take seriously the psychologist's report, made\r\nonly a cursory effort to gather relevant data, and virtually\r\nignored the information that did come to their attention   the\r\npsychiatrists carried out an objectively unreasonable course of\r\nconduct.\r\nOf course, the psychiatrists have a fallback position: \r\nthey maintain that their conduct (whether or not objectively\r\nreasonable) did not cause harm to Camilo-Robles because they\r\nfunctioned merely as advisors and did not themselves make the\r\ndecision to return a fully armed Diaz-Martinez to the streets. \r\nThis contention is better suited to a discussion of the merits, but\r\nto the extent that some causal connection is necessary to find that\r\na state actor has failed the test of objective legal\r\nreasonableness, that nexus exists here.\r\nTo be sure, the psychiatrists did not have official\r\nauthority to rearm Diaz-Martinez and restore him to active duty. \r\nNonetheless, the summary judgment record makes it pellucid that the\r\npsychiatrists knew that their certification of Diaz-Martinez would,\r\nin Dr. Hoyos's phrase, \"most probably\" result in the officer's\r\nimmediate rearming and return to active duty   as it had in every\r\nother previous instance.  The police superintendent likewise\r\nattested to the significance of the psychiatrists' role.  According\r\nto him, once the examining psychiatrist \"certifies in writing that\r\n[an officer] is authorized to bear arms . . . we proceed to give\r\nback the weapon.\"  Then, too, the director of the Bayamon CIC\r\nstated that the psychiatrists   not the police hierarchy   made the\r\ndecision to rearm Diaz-Martinez.  Finally, the record permits a\r\nreasonable inference that the psychiatrists eschewed easily\r\naccessible steps to forestall the rearming of Diaz-Martinez and\r\ninstead certified his fitness for unrestricted active duty. \r\nBecause this is an adequate showing of causation to support a\r\ndenial of qualified immunity, the psychiatrists' fallback position\r\navails them naught.\r\nV.  THE REMAINING APPELLANTS\r\nThe plaintiff alleges that the remaining three appellants\r\nhave supervisory liability under section 1983 for their individual\r\nfailures to keep Diaz-Martinez unarmed and away from the public. \r\nThe affected appellants unanimously deny this averment.  Their\r\nseparate summary judgment motions maintain that, at the least,\r\nqualified immunity attaches.  Consequently, we troll the record in\r\nsearch of facts bearing on the putative immunity of each appellant. \r\nWe then examine those collected facts to determine the basis of the\r\ndistrict court's decision (and, thus, the existence vel non of\r\nappellate jurisdiction).  Lastly, we proceed to determine whether\r\nthe district court erred in rejecting the qualified immunity\r\ndefense.\r\n               A.  Diaz-Pagan.\r\nThe summary judgment record reveals the following\r\nuncontested facts concerning Diaz-Pagan.\r\nIn January 1994, Diaz-Martinez joined the\r\nBayamon CIC.  Throughout his tenure\r\nthere, Diaz-Pagan served as the unit's\r\ndirector.\r\n\nAs director, Diaz-Pagan had the authority\r\nto oversee and countermand his\r\nsubordinates' staffing decisions and/or\r\nto dispatch police officers for special\r\nhuman relations training to minimize the\r\nlikelihood of future outbursts.\r\n\nDiaz-Pagan also possessed the authority\r\nto ensure that Diaz-Martinez would remain\r\nin an administrative position, removed\r\nfrom public contact.\r\n\nBy early 1994, Diaz-Pagan had read the\r\nCaldern Report and was aware of Diaz-\r\nMartinez's extensive history of violence,\r\nincluding the 1989 hostage-taking\r\nincident, a 1993 death threat against\r\nDiaz-Martinez's landlord, the September\r\n1993 shootings, and a very recent death\r\nthreat against a fellow officer.  This\r\ncompendium of incidents led Diaz-Pagan to\r\nadvise the area commander, Col. Pablo\r\nSantiago-Gonzalez, that Diaz-Martinez\r\n\"displays a pattern of behavior which\r\nrequires special attention.\"\r\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Diaz-Pagan\r\nneither recommended Diaz-Martinez for\r\nspecial human relations training nor\r\nintervened to assure that Diaz-Martinez's\r\nassignments would insulate him from\r\npublic contact.\r\n\nDiaz-Pagan did not alert his subordinates\r\nwho were in charge of day-to-day\r\noperations to the risk that he himself\r\nforesaw.\r\n\nDespite his foreknowledge of the imminent\r\ndanger that rearming Diaz-Martinez\r\nentailed, Diaz-Pagan did not take any\r\nmeasures to influence whether Diaz-\r\nMartinez would be rearmed.\r\n\nAlthough he professed \"surprise[]\" when\r\nhe learned (prior to the incident\r\ninvolving Camilo-Robles) that Diaz-\r\nMartinez's weapon had been restored,\r\nDiaz-Pagan acquiesced in that action and\r\ndid not attempt to rescind it.\r\n\nWhen Diaz-Pagan left for vacation on\r\nApril 18, 1994, he neglected to inform\r\nhis temporary replacement, Capt. Jorge\r\nHernandez-Colon, of Diaz-Martinez's\r\ndisciplinary record.\r\n\n            B.  Santiago-Gonzalez.\r\n\nThe summary judgment record reveals the following\r\nuncontested facts concerning Santiago-Gonzalez.\r\nSantiago-Gonzalez served as Bayamon area\r\ncommander during the time in question.\r\n\nSantiago-Gonzalez knew of Diaz-Martinez's\r\nviolent history.  He had received the\r\nCaldern Report and had personally\r\noverseen the efforts to calm the affected\r\nneighborhood in the wake of the 1993\r\ndouble shooting.\r\n\nDiaz-Pagan identified Santiago-Gonzalez\r\nas his \"boss\" and as \"the person who has\r\ncontrol of the Area.\"  Thus, the chain-\r\nof-command observations set forth as to\r\nDiaz-Pagan apply with at least equal\r\nforce to Santiago-Gonzalez.\r\n\nThe superintendent of police testified\r\nthat: \"It is the discretion of the Area\r\nCommander [Santiago-Gonzalez] to assign\r\n[officers] to the different units.\"\r\n\nSantiago-Gonzalez enjoyed the discretion\r\nto assign Diaz-Martinez to desk duty or\r\nother administrative work, yet failed to\r\nuse this power to make certain that the\r\nrogue officer would not come in contact\r\nwith the public.\r\n\n              C.  Toledo-Davila.\r\n\nThe summary judgment record reveals the following\r\nuncontested facts concerning Toledo-Davila.\r\nToledo-Davila served as police\r\nsuperintendent throughout the time in\r\nquestion.\r\n\nThe police superintendent is the only\r\nperson empowered to assign a regulation\r\nweapon to a member of the police force,\r\nand has plenary discretion to withhold or\r\nconfiscate a weapon in those cases in\r\nwhich he deems such action appropriate. \r\nSee Puerto Rico Police Department\r\nPersonnel Reg.  9.3(1)(a), (d).\r\n\nToledo-Davila knew the details of Diaz-\r\nMartinez's violent record.  He also knew\r\nthat the Puerto Rico Department of\r\nJustice had assumed control of the\r\ninvestigation into the September\r\nshootings, and that as of February 1994\r\nits investigation was ongoing.\r\n\nToledo-Davila abdicated his duty to\r\nexercise  independent judgment in\r\ndetermining which officers should bear\r\narms.  In that respect, he stated that\r\nonce a psychiatrist certifies an officer\r\nas fit for duty, \"the superiors are\r\nnotified . . . [a]nd then we proceed to\r\ngive back the weapon.\"\r\n\n         D.  Appellate Jurisdiction.\r\n\nAfter full consideration of the record, we believe that\r\nthe district court supportably assumed a set of documented facts\r\nfrom which it denied the supervisors' motions for summary judgment\r\nas a matter of law. Consequently, we have jurisdiction to review\r\nthe district court's decision.\r\nOur rationale is straightforward.  On the record as it\r\nstands, the facts as to these appellants' powers, functions,\r\nconduct, and omissions are not seriously disputed, nor are the\r\nfacts as to what corrective measures were available to them.  This\r\nmakes it very likely that the district court assumed the facts to\r\nbe as stated.  That the district court did not wait for the\r\nplaintiff's opposition   a practice that we do not commend  \r\nbuttresses this conclusion and suggests that the court did not\r\nbelieve it necessary for the plaintiff to adduce additional facts\r\nbecause the facts that already were in the record, assumed as true\r\nand interpreted favorably to the plaintiff, were insufficient as a\r\nmatter of law to warrant the application of qualified immunity. \r\nThus, we turn to the correctness of that conclusion, again taking\r\nthe supervisors one by one.\r\n     E.  Qualified Immunity   Diaz-Pagan.\r\nDiaz-Pagan trumpets that Diaz-Martinez was not under his\r\ndirect command, and that, in all events, he was on vacation when\r\nDiaz-Martinez allegedly assaulted Camilo-Robles.  Based largely on\r\nthese undisputed facts, Diaz-Pagan maintains that he deserves\r\nqualified immunity because there is no causal link between his\r\nconduct and the assault on Camilo-Robles.\r\nThis argument speaks less to qualified immunity and more\r\nto the merits   and a denial of summary judgment on the merits,\r\neven in a section 1983 case, is not immediately appealable.  SeeDomegan, 859 F.2d at 1061.  Still, a plausible causal chain is\r\nrelevant to the objective legal reasonableness of a state actor's\r\nconduct and, viewed in that light, Diaz-Pagan's contentions are not\r\nentirely off base.  At any rate, on the assumed set of facts the\r\ncourt supportably could have concluded that Diaz-Martinez presented\r\na serious risk of harm and that Diaz-Pagan knew as much; put\r\nanother way, Diaz-Pagan \"was put on notice of behavior which was\r\nlikely to result in the violation of the constitutional rights of\r\ncitizens.\"  Febus-Rodriguez, 14 F.3d at 93.  The court likewise\r\ncould have concluded that Diaz-Pagan had the authority to prevent\r\nrecurrences of Diaz-Martinez's erratic behavior, but nevertheless\r\nfailed to take obvious steps within his power to reduce or\r\neliminate that risk.  Similarly, the court could have found the\r\nrequisite causal connection.  Finally, the court could have\r\nconcluded that Diaz-Pagan's omission was outside the range of\r\nmistaken judgments that the qualified immunity doctrine protects. \r\nSeen in that light, Diaz-Pagan's conduct was not objectively\r\nreasonable and, thus, qualified immunity does not attach.\r\nF.  Qualified Immunity   Santiago-Gonzalez.  \r\nSantiago-Gonzalez similarly claims qualified immunity on\r\nthe ground that the causal connection between his functions and\r\nDiaz-Martinez's transgressions is too attenuated to justify the\r\nimposition of section 1983 liability.  As above, we examine\r\ncausation insofar as it bears on qualified immunity (i.e., as an\r\nelement of objective legal reasonableness).\r\nOn the facts proffered by Santiago-Gonzalez and amplified\r\nelsewhere in the record, it is plain that Santiago-Gonzalez knew\r\nthat Diaz-Martinez was a ticking time bomb and also knew (or should\r\nhave known) that Diaz-Martinez, if restored to active duty, was\r\nlikely to commit acts that would violate the constitutional rights\r\nof others.  As was true of Diaz-Pagan, Santiago-Gonzalez had both\r\nthe authority and the opportunity to prevent Diaz-Martinez from\r\ninteracting with the public, yet failed to intervene.  Accordingly,\r\nhis indifference and the assault on Camilo-Robles were causally\r\nlinked.  In a nutshell, on the assumed set of facts revealed by the\r\nsummary judgment record the district court supportably could\r\nconclude that Santiago-Gonzalez acted in an objectively\r\nunreasonable fashion, thus exempting his conduct from the\r\nprophylaxis of qualified immunity.\r\n   G.  Qualified Immunity   Toledo-Davila.\r\nAt the end of the day, Toledo-Davila maintains that he\r\nand the officers under his command followed proper police\r\nprocedures when rearming Diaz-Martinez.  He adds that in all events\r\nhe acted in good faith   and qualified immunity protects officers\r\nwho make good-faith mistakes.  See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641. \r\nAlthough we find no evidence to suggest that Toledo-Davila (or the\r\nother appellants, for that matter) acted in bad faith, we\r\nnonetheless conclude that Toledo-Davila cannot wrap himself in the\r\nmantle of qualified immunity.\r\nThe extant record eloquently refutes Toledo-Davila's\r\nassertion that his conduct was, as a matter of law, objectively\r\nreasonable.  Toledo-Davila knew of Diaz-Martinez's vicious\r\npropensities and the peril presented; he had the sole de jure\r\nresponsibility to authorize rearming; and yet he treated Diaz-\r\nMartinez not as a dangerous sociopath, but as any other officer. \r\nTo cinch matters, a causal relationship existed between Toledo-\r\nDavila's conduct and the incident at the Bayamon Judicial Center. \r\nWe think that the police superintendent's latitudinarian approach\r\nin the face of Diaz-Martinez's patent instability was so far\r\noutside the realm of reasonableness that it rendered him ineligible\r\nfor protection under the qualified immunity doctrine.\r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe add an eschatocol of sorts.  This is a hard case, for\r\nit does not readily fit the mold cast by the Court's precedents. \r\nWe believe it is possible that the Court, when confronted with a\r\nclaim of qualified immunity in a deliberate indifference case, may\r\nrecognize the awkwardness of the fit and formulate a special set of\r\nrules to cover such situations.  Until further guidance emerges,\r\nhowever, we have little choice but to apply the existing qualified\r\nimmunity paradigm across the board.  We have endeavored to do so\r\nhere.\r\nWe need go no further.  Qualified immunity protects \"all\r\nbut the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\r\nlaw.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).  In this case,\r\nnone of the appellants consciously chose to violate the law.  If\r\nthe assumed facts indicated that they were merely inattentive or\r\ncareless, then qualified immunity would shield them despite the\r\nfact that Diaz-Martinez violated the plaintiff's clearly\r\nestablished rights.  See, e.g., Ringuette,     F.3d at     [slip\r\nop. at 12]; Brennan, 888 F.2d at 194.  Here, however, indulging\r\nreasonable pro-plaintiff inferences, the record shows conduct on\r\nthe appellants' part that can best be described as reckless and\r\nwanton   conduct that is emblematic of the plain incompetency to\r\nwhich the Malley Court alluded.  The appellants' behavior is,\r\ntherefore, outside the wide band of mistaken police judgments that\r\nthe qualified immunity doctrine is intended to shield and the\r\nappellants, to a man, are not entitled to summary judgment.\r\n\nAffirmed.  Costs in favor of appellee.\n",

After suffering indignities at the\r\nhands of an unstable police officer, plaintiff-appellee Grancid\r\nCamilo-Robles sued an array of defendants under 42 U.S.C.  1983\r\n(1994). In due season, five such defendants, appellants here,\r\nmoved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity. \r\nThe district court rejected their motions (in some instances\r\nwithout waiting for an opposition).  Although the timing of the\r\ndistrict court's ruling and the lack of any authoritative insight\r\ninto the court's reasoning complicate our task, we affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nParking privileges denote special status in our motorized\r\nsociety, and emotions often run high when a parking space is at\r\nstake.  This case vividly illustrates that verity.\r\nOn May 13, 1994, Miguel Diaz-Martinez, a police officer\r\nassigned to the Bayamon Criminal Investigation Corps (CIC), sought\r\nto park in an area reserved for judges at the Bayamon Judicial\r\nCenter.  Camilo-Robles, a security guard sworn to protect that\r\nhallowed ground, told Diaz-Martinez that he could not park there. \r\nIn response to this perceived affront, Diaz-Martinez placed his\r\nhand on his gun, arrested Camilo-Robles, handcuffed him, shoved the\r\nprisoner into his (Diaz-Martinez's) police cruiser, and drove to\r\nthe station house (pausing to punch Camilo-Robles in the stomach\r\nand slap him in the face).  Upon their arrival, Diaz-Martinez\r\nforced the plaintiff to remove his belt and shoes and placed him in\r\na cell with other detainees.  Cooler heads prevailed, and Diaz-\r\nMartinez's prey was released, uncharged, some three hours later.\r\nCamilo-Robles sued Gilberto Diaz-Pagan (director of the\r\nBayamon CIC), Pablo Santiago-Gonzalez (Bayamon area commander), and\r\nPedro A. Toledo-Davila (superintendent of police).  In addition to\r\nthese high-ranking police officials, Camilo-Robles named a host of\r\nother defendants including inter alia two psychiatrists who worked\r\nfor the police department, Drs. Guillermo Hoyos and Hector O.\r\nRivera-Gonzalez.  Invoking section 1983, Camilo-Robles alleged that\r\nthese five named defendants (collectively, \"the appellants\") had\r\ndeprived him of his civil rights by their deliberate indifference\r\nin carrying out their supervisory responsibilities (with the result\r\nthat Diaz-Martinez, a demonstrably unstable officer, was allowed to\r\nremain on active duty).\r\nThe district court issued its scheduling order on\r\nFebruary 21, 1996.  In December of that year, the appellants filed\r\nsummary judgment motions.  Camilo-Robles responded on the merits to\r\nthe psychiatrists' summary judgment motion, but served a cross-\r\nmotion seeking additional time in which to oppose the police\r\nofficials' motions, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), explaining that they\r\nhad stonewalled during pretrial discovery.  The district court\r\ngranted this cross-motion without limit of time and referred all\r\npending discovery matters to a magistrate judge.  Lassitude set in,\r\nand the magistrate made no rulings until August 26, 1997.  Two days\r\nlater, the district court denied the appellants' summary judgment\r\nmotions in a curt, two-page order.  These appeals followed. \r\nII.  A CAREER TO MAKE ST. SEBASTIAN WEEP\r\nBecause the allegations of liability and the defenses\r\nthereto hinge upon what actions the various defendants took (or\r\nshould have taken) in light of Diaz-Martinez's flagitious history\r\nof violence, the latter's career is of great relevance.  We extract\r\nthe facts from the summary judgment record, resolving all conflicts\r\nin favor of the plaintiff.  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\nDiaz-Martinez joined the police force as a cadet in March\r\n1984.  That December, he was suspended for an assault.  Despite the\r\nsuspension, he became a regular officer and served as such for the\r\nnext five years.  His record reflects numerous disciplinary\r\ninfractions involving violent and/or threatening behavior   we\r\ncount at least eighteen   many of which entailed unwarranted\r\nbrandishing of his weapon.  The denouement occurred in August 1989\r\nwhen, after assaulting his wife, Diaz-Martinez entered the Catano\r\npolice station, seized a shotgun, and held several gendarmes\r\n(including the acting police superintendent) hostage for several\r\nhours.\r\nSubsequent to this bizarre display, Diaz-Martinez was\r\ncommitted involuntarily to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed as\r\nschizophrenic.  The hospital discharged him and three months later\r\na police psychiatrist, Dr. Pagan-Davis, recommended that he be\r\nseparated from the force and given a civilian position.  The police\r\ndepartment suspended Diaz-Martinez in 1990 and formally expelled\r\nhim in 1991.\r\nJustice sometimes moves in mysterious ways.  Diaz-\r\nMartinez successfully appealed his expulsion and the police\r\ndepartment reinstated him in May 1993.  While on desk duty, he\r\nassaulted a civilian.  Nevertheless, Drs. Hoyos and Rivera-Gonzalez\r\nfound Diaz-Martinez free from mental illness and fit for active\r\nduty (with no restrictions) when they examined him in August.  The\r\ndepartment promptly rearmed him and assigned him to work in a high-\r\ntension neighborhood.  On September 8, 1993 (the day following his\r\nreturn to active duty), Diaz-Martinez engaged in an altercation\r\nwith two unarmed, law-abiding neighborhood residents.  In the\r\ncourse of this fracas, he shot both of them, wounding one and\r\nkilling the other.  See Diaz v. Diaz Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197322\"><a href=\"/opinion/197322/rosario-diaz-v-diaz-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (summarizing the facts of that episode).  The police\r\ndepartment immediately confiscated his weapon.\r\nAfter a self-imposed exile, Diaz-Martinez returned to\r\ndesk duty in November 1993.  On January 20, 1994, while still\r\nunarmed, Diaz-Martinez threatened to kill a fellow officer at the\r\nBayamon Radio Center.  Six days later, he was transferred to the\r\nBayamon CIC.  On February 28, 1994, Drs. Hoyos and Rivera-Gonzalez\r\nagain examined Diaz-Martinez and again declared him ready for\r\nunrestricted active duty and fit to carry a weapon.  The police\r\ndepartment rearmed him forthwith.\r\nThe incident that sparked this suit occurred in May of\r\n1994.  The police department again expelled Diaz-Martinez that\r\nAugust.  He eventually pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter in\r\nconnection with the September 1993 shootings and was sentenced to\r\nserve a prison term.\r\nIII.  THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\r\nBefore tackling the vagaries of each defendant's appeal,\r\nwe first must map the crossroads at which the qualified immunity\r\ndoctrine and principles of supervisory liability under section 1983\r\nintersect.  We then discuss pertinent questions of appellate\r\njurisdiction and pause to note the somewhat tentative nature of\r\norders denying summary judgment in the qualified immunity context.\r\nA.  Qualified Immunity and Supervisory Liability.\r\nFederal law provides a cause of action when an\r\nindividual, acting under color of state law, deprives a person of\r\nfederally assured rights.   See 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Public officials\r\nwho stand accused of civil rights violations under section 1983\r\nnonetheless can avoid liability for money damages by showing either\r\nthat they did not violate a right clearly established under federal\r\nlaw or that they acted with objective legal reasonableness.  SeeHarlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819 (1982); Buenrostro v.\r\nCollazo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589648\"><a href=\"/opinion/589648/leonel-buenrostro-v-pablo-collazo-aka-pablo-collazo-marrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that a section 1983\r\nplaintiff must allege a violation of a clearly established right\r\nsecured either by the Constitution or by some other federal law. \r\nSee County of Sacramento v. Lewis,     S. Ct.    ,     n.5 (1998)\r\n[</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">259980</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *4 n.5].  Here, the plaintiff vaults this hurdle\r\nwith room to spare.  The right to be free from unreasonable seizure\r\n(and, by extension, unjustified arrest and detention) is clearly\r\nestablished in the jurisprudence of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n(through which the Fourth Amendment constrains state action).  The\r\nright to due process of law (and, by extension, to be free from\r\npolice brutality) is likewise clearly established under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment (through which the Fifth Amendment constrains\r\nstate action).\r\nWe have not had occasion to address the question whether,\r\nto be liable under section 1983, a supervisor must have violated an\r\nindependent, \"clearly established\" right, or whether a supervisor\r\nmay be liable based only on his proximity to a subordinate's\r\nviolation of a \"clearly established\" right.  Other circuits,\r\nhowever, have addressed this interplay between the \"clearly\r\nestablished\" requirement and supervisory liability.  We follow\r\ntheir lead and adopt an approach that comports with the core\r\nprinciple of qualified immunity by protecting supervisory officials\r\nfrom suit when they could not reasonably anticipate liability.\r\nWhen a supervisor seeks qualified immunity in a section\r\n1983 action, the \"clearly established\" prong of the qualified\r\nimmunity inquiry is satisfied when (1) the subordinate's actions\r\nviolated a clearly established constitutional right, and (2) it was\r\nclearly established that a supervisor would be liable for\r\nconstitutional violations perpetrated by his subordinates in that\r\ncontext.  See Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661734\"><a href=\"/opinion/661734/jane-doe-v-taylor-independent-school-district-mike-caplinger-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456\r\n(5th Cir. 1994); Shaw v. Stroud, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660200\"><a href=\"/opinion/660200/deborah-shaw-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-sidney-bowen-deceased-nancy/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801 (4th Cir. 1994). \r\nIn other words, for a supervisor to be liable there must be a\r\nbifurcated \"clearly established\" inquiry   one branch probing the\r\nunderlying violation, and the other probing the supervisor's\r\npotential liability.\r\nHere, both elements are satisfied.  We already have noted\r\nthat the plaintiff's clearly established rights were violated, seesupra Part III(A), and it is equally well settled that a\r\ndeliberately indifferent police supervisor may be held liable for\r\nthe constitutional violations of his subordinates.  See Diaz, 112\r\nF.3d at 4.\r\nThe question, then, reduces to the test of objective\r\nlegal reasonableness.  This test does not serve as a proxy for\r\nliability, because even state actors who commit constitutional\r\nviolations may be entitled to qualified immunity.  See, e.g.,\r\nRinguette v. City of Fall River,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n[No. 96-1107, slip op. at 10]; Brennan v. Hendrigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531204\"><a href=\"/opinion/531204/robert-brennan-v-roderick-hendrigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n194 (1st Cir. 1989).  Instead, the test's utility is restricted to\r\nthe qualified immunity inquiry.  In that milieu, the test provides\r\na method for determining whether, in relation to a clearly\r\nestablished right, a defendant's conduct was (or was not)\r\nreasonable.  Withal, objective legal reasonableness is a concept\r\nthat grew up in the prototypical section 1983 context   a context\r\nin which a state actor (\"A\") inflicts injury directly on a victim\r\n(\"V\") in derogation of V's constitutionally-protected rights. \r\nWhere the context shifts   as where A is not a direct actor (i.e.,\r\nhe himself did not perpetrate the seizure, detention, or assault of\r\nwhich V complains), but, rather, stands accused of permitting a\r\nthird person (\"B\"), also a state actor, to violate V's rights   the\r\ntest remains intact, but its focus shifts.  In this tri-cornered\r\nsituation, objective legal reasonableness (and, hence, qualified\r\nimmunity) necessarily depends upon the relationship between A's\r\nacts or omissions and B's conduct.\r\nThis brings us to the doctrine of supervisory liability,\r\nwhich holds that a supervisor (defined loosely to encompass a wide\r\nrange of officials who are themselves removed from the perpetration\r\nof the rights-violating behavior) may be liable under section 1983\r\nif he formulates a policy or engages in a practice that leads to a\r\ncivil rights violation committed by another.  See City of Oklahoma\r\nCity v. Tuttle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111441\"><a href=\"/opinion/111441/oklahoma-city-v-tuttle/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823-24 (1985).  Notice is a salient\r\nconsideration in determining the existence of supervisory\r\nliability.  See Febus-Rodriguez v. Betancourt-Lebron, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195148\"><a href=\"/opinion/195148/rodriguez-v-lebron/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n93 (1st Cir. 1994) (treating as \"[a]n important factor . . .\r\nwhether [the supervisor] was put on notice of behavior which was\r\nlikely to result in the violation of . . . constitutional rights\"). \r\nNonetheless, supervisory liability does not require a showing that\r\nthe supervisor had actual knowledge of the offending behavior; he\r\n\"may be liable for the foreseeable consequences of such conduct if\r\nhe would have known of it but for his deliberate indifference or\r\nwillful blindness.\"  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nTo demonstrate deliberate indifference a plaintiff must\r\nshow (1) a grave risk of harm, (2) the defendant's actual or\r\nconstructive knowledge of that risk, and (3) his failure to take\r\neasily available measures to address the risk.  See Manarite v.\r\nCity of Springfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578608\"><a href=\"/opinion/578608/jessica-a-manarite-by-and-through-her-next-friend-carla-manarite-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956 (1st Cir. 1992).  This\r\nformulation correctly implies that deliberate indifference alone\r\ndoes not equate with supervisory liability; a suitor also must show\r\ncausation.  See Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 582 (explaining that\r\nthe supervisor must have \"had the power and authority to alleviate\r\n[the violation]\").  In other words, the plaintiff must\r\n\"affirmatively connect the supervisor's conduct to the\r\nsubordinate's violative act or omission.\"  Id.  This affirmative\r\nconnection need not take the form of knowing sanction, but may\r\ninclude tacit approval of, acquiescence in, or purposeful disregard\r\nof, rights-violating conduct.  See id. \r\nThis returns us to the point of our beginning:  the\r\nrelationship between qualified immunity and supervisory liability. \r\nBy definition, a defendant who claims qualified immunity must do so\r\neither on the theory that the asserted right is not clearly\r\nestablished or on the theory that the conduct attributed to him\r\nsatisfies the test of objective legal reasonableness.  See Harlow,\r\n457 U.S. at 819.  Because the constitutional rights and supervisory\r\nliability doctrine that underlie Camilo-Robles's claim are clearly\r\nestablished, the qualified immunity analysis here turns on whether,\r\nin the particular circumstances confronted by each appellant, that\r\nappellant should reasonably have understood that his conduct\r\njeopardized these rights.  See Ringuette,     F.3d at     [slip op.\r\nat 10]; Berthiaume v. Caron,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1998) [No.\r\n97-1958, slip op. at 7].\r\nThe inquiry into qualified immunity is separate and\r\ndistinct from the inquiry into the merits.  Consequently, courts\r\nare well-advised to separate \"qualified immunity\" analysis from\r\n\"merits\" analysis whenever practicable.  In some circumstances,\r\nhowever, these inquiries overlap.  So it is here:  the appellants\r\nstand accused of culpable conduct in a setting that requires an\r\ninquiry into deliberate indifference (which is customarily a\r\nmerits-related topic).\r\nGiven this setting, discerning whether a particular\r\nappellant's behavior passes the context-specific test of objective\r\nlegal reasonableness to some extent collapses the separate\r\n\"qualified immunity\" and \"merits\" inquiries into a single analytic\r\nunit.  Such an approach is unusual, but we occasionally have\r\nengaged in precisely this sort of merits-centric analysis in the\r\ncourse of deciding questions of qualified immunity.  See, e.g.,\r\nMorales v. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543721\"><a href=\"/opinion/543721/awilda-morales-v-sylvia-o-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 787 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining\r\n\"that, in certain cases, some aspect of the merits may be\r\ninexorably intertwined with the issue of qualified immunity\")\r\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Amsden v. Moran,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542853\"><a href=\"/opinion/542853/henry-h-amsden-v-thomas-f-moran-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753-58 (1st Cir. 1990) (examining the substance of\r\nthe plaintiff's due process claims to determine the defendants'\r\neligibility for qualified immunity).\r\nWe weave these strands together into a thread that binds\r\nthese appeals.  The plaintiff alleges a violation of clearly\r\nestablished constitutional rights and asserts that several\r\ndefendants bear supervisory liability for that violation. \r\nResponding to these allegations, each defendant claims qualified\r\nimmunity and, because both the rights in question and each\r\ndefendant's susceptibility to supervisory liability are clearly\r\nestablished, these qualified immunity claims hinge on whether that\r\ndefendant's conduct was objectively reasonable.  Since our inquiry\r\ninto objective legal reasonableness involves deliberate\r\nindifference, however, we are compelled to engage the merits to a\r\ngreater extent than is usual.\r\nB.  Considerations Affecting Appellate Jurisdiction.\r\nWere we reviewing a district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment based on qualified immunity, our course would be clear: \r\nwe would determine de novo whether the affected defendant was\r\nentitled to a favorable judgment as a matter of law.  Here,\r\nhowever, the summary judgment motions were denied, not granted, and\r\nthis fact complicates our analysis.  In the qualified immunity\r\nrealm, the dividing line between appealable and non-appealable\r\ndenials of summary judgment is blurred.\r\nCases are clear enough at the extremes.  We know, for\r\ninstance, that when a motion for summary judgment that asserts\r\nqualified immunity is rejected, the denial cannot ground an\r\ninterlocutory appeal if the operative question is \"whether or not\r\nthe pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.\" \r\nJohnson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (1995).  Similarly, we know\r\nthat the denial of such a motion is immediately appealable if the\r\noperative question is purely legal in nature.  See id. at 319.  In\r\nfine, \"a summary judgment order which determines that the pretrial\r\nrecord sets forth a genuine issue of fact, as distinguished from an\r\norder that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate,\r\nunder clearly established law, a violation of some federally\r\nprotected right, is not reviewable on demand.\"  Stella v. Kelley,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196256\"><a href=\"/opinion/196256/stella-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (1st Cir. 1995); accord Behrens v. Pelletier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306 (1996).\r\nDetermining the existence vel non of appellate\r\njurisdiction in cases closer to the equator is more difficult. \r\nSome examples may be useful.  In Diaz, we determined that we lacked\r\njurisdiction to entertain an interlocutory appeal from a pretrial\r\ndecision denying qualified immunity because the decision turned on\r\nthe existence of a factual conflict or on what the lower court\r\nperceived to be a factual conflict.  112 F.3d at 4-5.   This\r\ncontrasts with situations in which the district court assumes a set\r\nof facts and decides, as a matter of law, that those facts will not\r\nsupport a qualified immunity defense   in which event jurisdiction\r\nexists to entertain an immediate appeal.  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at\r\n313.\r\nIf this were not complex enough, the district judge is\r\nnot legally obliged to explain the basis on which a denial of\r\nsummary judgment rests.  See Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319\r\n(acknowledging that \"[d]istrict judges may simply deny summary\r\njudgment motions without indicating their reasons for doing so\");\r\nDomegan v. Fair, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513189\"><a href=\"/opinion/513189/dennis-j-domegan-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1065-66 (1st Cir. 1988) (similar). \r\nWhen the district court's order is unilluminating, the appellate\r\ncourt must fend for itself.  Anticipating the dilemma that such an\r\ninscrutable order may pose in the qualified immunity context, the\r\nCourt prophesied \"that a court of appeals may have to undertake a\r\ncumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the\r\ndistrict court, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\r\nlikely assumed.\"  Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319.  Hence, we must perform\r\nthe equivalent of an archeological dig and endeavor to reconstruct\r\nthe probable basis for the district court's decision.\r\nHere, the district court denied the appellants' motions\r\nfor summary judgment before the plaintiff filed oppositions to\r\nseveral of those motions.  As a result of this hastiness, the data\r\nbefore the court were limited   and limited further by the\r\nappellants' apparent intransigence in furnishing discovery. \r\nWithal, the district court had before it a great deal of\r\ninformation from sources such as the psychiatrists' summary\r\njudgment papers, the plaintiff's opposition to the psychiatrists'\r\nmotion, and evidentiary materials submitted by a former codefendant\r\nin connection with an earlier summary judgment motion.  The court\r\nalso had before it all the appellants' moving papers (which contain\r\nmore than a smidgen of intramural fingerpointing).  The court was\r\nat liberty to consult all these sources, and we, too, can consult\r\nthem in endeavoring to determine whether the court below based its\r\ndecision on contested facts as opposed to a quintessentially legal\r\njudgment.\r\n            C.  A Note of Caution.\r\nHaving performed the exercise described in Part III(B),\r\nsupra, we conclude, for reasons made manifest in our subsequent\r\ndiscussion of the appellants' claims, that we have jurisdiction\r\nover all these appeals and that the lower court appropriately\r\ndenied all four summary judgment motions.  We note, however, that\r\nthis endorsement of the district court's ruling has a somewhat\r\ntentative cast.  We offer three pertinent observations.\r\nFirst, our approach assumes, despite the awkwardness of\r\nthe conceptual fit, that deliberate indifference cases are amenable\r\nto standard qualified immunity analysis   a proposition that\r\nlogically may be debatable, but that nevertheless follows from the\r\nSupreme Court's broad pronouncements.  See, e.g., Harlow, 457 U.S.\r\nat 819.  Second, a pretrial refusal to grant qualified immunity is\r\nonly a way station in the travel of a case.  When a defendant fails\r\non a pretrial qualified immunity claim, he nonetheless can plead\r\nqualified immunity as an affirmative defense and resurrect the\r\nclaim at trial.

Macri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606665\"><a href=\"/opinion/606665/edward-king-also-known-as-edward-kerr-v-michael-macri-edward-kondek/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (2d Cir. 1993); Vazquez Rios v.\r\nHernandez-Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488725\"><a href=\"/opinion/488725/aurea-e-vazquez-rios-v-rafael-hernandez-colon-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329 (1st Cir. 1987).  Third,\r\nnotwithstanding a pretrial rejection of qualified immunity, the\r\nmerits remain open.\r\nIV.  THE PSYCHIATRISTS\r\nThe plaintiff alleges that the psychiatrists, Drs. Hoyos\r\nand Rivera-Gonzalez, evaluated Diaz-Martinez on February 28, 1994,\r\nwith complete indifference to the constitutional rights of others\r\nand recklessly declared him fit for duty and able to carry a\r\nweapon.  The psychiatrists' joint summary judgment motion addressed\r\nthis claim on two levels, positing that they enjoy (1) absolute\r\nimmunity from suit under Puerto Rico law, and (2) qualified\r\nimmunity from suit under federal law because their performance was\r\nobjectively reasonable and, in any event, had no direct bearing on\r\nthe decision to restore an armed Diaz-Martinez to active duty.  We\r\ngrapple with these asseverations in sequence.\r\n\n            A.  Absolute Immunity.\r\nA district court's refusal to grant summary judgment on\r\nan absolute immunity claim is, generally speaking, within the scope\r\nof our appellate jurisdiction on interlocutory appeal.  SeeAcevedo-Cordero v. Cordero-Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578673\"><a href=\"/opinion/578673/manuel-acevedo-cordero-v-rafael-cordero-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  In this instance, it invokes the Puerto Rico Medico-\r\nHospital Professional Liability Insurance Act, which provides in\r\npertinent part:\r\nNo health service professional may be included\r\nas a defendant in a civil suit for damages due\r\nto malpractice caused in the performance of\r\nhis/her profession while said health service\r\nprofessional acts in compliance with his\r\nduties and functions as an employee of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, its dependencies,\r\ninstrumentalities and municipalities.\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,  4105 (1994).  The psychiatrists contend\r\nthat this statute immunizes them because they examined Diaz-\r\nMartinez pursuant to the terms of a contract purporting to free\r\nthem from liability under section 4105 (incorrectly identified as\r\nsection 5105).  We do not agree.\r\nIn the first place, the statute on its face applies to\r\n\"employees.\"  The contract states that the psychiatrists are\r\nindependent contractors, not employees, and the record at the very\r\nleast raises unanswered factual questions anent the statute's\r\napplicability.  See, e.g., Flores Roman v. Ramos-Gonzalez, 127 P.R.\r\nDec. 601, 608-09 (P.R. 1990) (examining the relevant contract to\r\ndetermine whether a given defendant is an employee or independent\r\ncontractor); see also Nieves v. University of P.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194980\"><a href=\"/opinion/194980/marta-v-u-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273\r\n(1st Cir. 1993) (discussing section 4105).\r\nIn the second place, even if section 4105 applies, it at\r\nmost gives government-employed physicians immunity from claims\r\nbrought under Puerto Rico law.  A state-conferred immunity cannot\r\nshield a state actor from liability under section 1983.  SeeMartinez v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110169\"><a href=\"/opinion/110169/martinez-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284 n.8 (1980) (\"Conduct by\r\npersons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42\r\nU.S.C.  1983 . . . cannot be immunized by state law.\") (quoting\r\nHampton v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"313408\"><a href=\"/opinion/313408/iberia-hampton-administratrix-etc-verlina-brewer-etc-and-deborah/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (7th Cir. 1973)). \r\nIndeed, a regime that allowed a state immunity defense to trump the\r\nimposition of liability under section 1983 would emasculate the\r\nfederal statute.  See id.  We therefore reject the proposition that\r\nabsolute immunity entitled the psychiatrists to summary judgment.\r\n           B.  Qualified Immunity.\r\nBefore confronting the psychiatrists' qualified immunity\r\ndefense, we make a preliminary point.  The psychiatrists are\r\nprivate practitioners, not government employees in the traditional\r\nsense.  Consequently, one might wonder whether they could be liable\r\nat all under section 1983, or, if so, whether they would be\r\nentitled to qualified immunity even on a \"best case\" scenario.  The\r\nanswer to both questions is in the affirmative.\r\nA private party's conduct is attributable to the state if\r\nthe state \"has so far insinuated itself into a position of\r\ninterdependence with [the private party] that it must be recognized\r\nas a joint participant in the challenged activity.\"  Barrios-\r\nVelazquez v. Asociacin de Empleados del Estado Libre Asociado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196780\"><a href=\"/opinion/196780/barrios-velazquez-v-asociacion-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted; alteration in the original).  Here, the\r\npsychiatrists acted under contract with the police department to\r\nassist in a necessary departmental function:  the evaluation of\r\nofficers.  Hence, the psychiatrists, virtually by their own\r\nadmission (see supra Part IV(A)), are for purposes of this case\r\nstate actors performing in concert with the department.  As such,\r\nthey are both subject to suit under section 1983 and eligible for\r\nthe balm of qualified immunity.  See Rodriques v. Furtado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573067\"><a href=\"/opinion/573067/shirley-mello-rodriques-v-joseph-furtado/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814 (1st Cir. 1991) (extending qualified immunity to a\r\nphysician who agreed to assist the police in a body cavity search).\r\nThat said, the psychiatrists' pretrial case for qualified\r\nimmunity lacks force.  First, perscrutation of the record discloses\r\nuncontested facts sufficient to permit us to exercise jurisdiction\r\nover their appeal.  Second, those facts, construed favorably to\r\nCamilo-Robles, adequately ground a tripartite conclusion (1) that\r\nDiaz-Martinez posed an unusually serious risk of harm, (2) that the\r\npsychiatrists had actual knowledge of the risk, and (3) that they\r\nfailed to take readily apparent steps to alleviate that risk. \r\nThird, the assumed set of facts presented here reveals a reckless\r\ndisregard for the rights of others that outstrips any band of\r\nprotection afforded by the doctrine of qualified immunity in cases\r\nof deliberately indifferent conduct.\r\nWe see no need to differentiate between the two\r\npsychiatrists for present purposes; after all, they themselves have\r\nabjured such a course and presented a united front both below and\r\non appeal.  By like token, it seems unnecessary to rehearse all the\r\nfacts that contribute to our conclusions.  Instead, we offer a\r\nsampling.\r\nThe psychiatrists approached the February\r\n1994 evaluation with abundant\r\nforeknowledge of Diaz-Martinez's case,\r\ngleaned from their August 1993 evaluation\r\nof him and their ensuing certification\r\nthat he was fit for active duty at that\r\ntime.\r\n\nOn September 1, 1993, a few days after\r\nthey  issued the August 1993\r\ncertification, the psychiatrists received\r\na psychologist's report (the Sedra\r\nReport), dated July 14, 1993, which noted\r\nthat Diaz-Martinez denied reality, that\r\nhe was immature, impulsive, and anxious,\r\nand that \"his tension level could make\r\nhim . . . act[] out.\"  Dr. Sedra later\r\ndescribed this last observation as\r\nequivalent to saying that  Diaz-Martinez\r\n\"could explode at any time.\"  Despite\r\nreceiving this report, the psychiatrists\r\ndid not revisit their original\r\ncertification of Diaz-Martinez as fit for\r\nduty, and seem to have ignored the Sedra\r\nReport during the February 1994\r\nexamination.\r\n\nOn September 8, 1993, Diaz-Martinez shot\r\ntwo innocent civilians, thus confirming\r\nDr. Sedra's warnings.  Still, the\r\npsychiatrists (both of whom knew of that\r\nincident) nonetheless recertified Diaz\r\nMartinez for rearming and active duty in\r\nFebruary 1994 without an intervening\r\npsychological evaluation.\r\n\nTo administer their government contract,\r\nthe psychiatrists set up a system whereby\r\neach doctor would independently interview\r\neach referred officer, thus ensuring two\r\ndetached opinions.  Although the\r\npsychiatrists knew Diaz-Martinez's\r\nstunning history of violence, they \r\nnonetheless deviated from this protocol\r\nin their February 1994 evaluation. \r\nIndeed, their entire examination\r\nconsisted of one joint interview.\r\n\nAfter conducting their joint interview,\r\nthe psychiatrists declared Diaz-Martinez\r\n\"fit to engage in all of the duties\r\ninherent to a law enforcement agent . . .\r\n(including the use of a regulation\r\nweapon),\" without carrying out any\r\nfurther investigation.\r\n\nBy his own admission, Dr. Hoyos neglected\r\nto read the Caldern Report (which\r\ndetailed numerous instances of Diaz-\r\nMartinez's aberrant behavior) before\r\nsigning off on Diaz-Martinez's status. \r\nDr. Rivera-Gonzalez, who did read the\r\nCaldern Report, brushed it aside as\r\ninsufficient to warrant further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the\r\npsychiatrists  requested or consulted\r\nDiaz-Martinez's current complaint history\r\nbefore they gave him a clean bill of\r\nhealth in February 1994.\r\n\nThe presence of these essentially uncontested facts\r\nstrongly suggests that the district court denied the psychiatrists'\r\nmotion for summary judgment as a matter of law.  We therefore have\r\nappellate jurisdiction.  See Behrens, 516 U.S. at 313.\r\nExercising that jurisdiction and reviewing the district\r\ncourt's decision de novo, we believe that under at least one\r\nplausible scenario depicted by these assumed facts   in which the\r\npsychiatrists did not comply with their own evaluation protocol,\r\nfailed to credit or take seriously the psychologist's report, made\r\nonly a cursory effort to gather relevant data, and virtually\r\nignored the information that did come to their attention   the\r\npsychiatrists carried out an objectively unreasonable course of\r\nconduct.\r\nOf course, the psychiatrists have a fallback position: \r\nthey maintain that their conduct (whether or not objectively\r\nreasonable) did not cause harm to Camilo-Robles because they\r\nfunctioned merely as advisors and did not themselves make the\r\ndecision to return a fully armed Diaz-Martinez to the streets. \r\nThis contention is better suited to a discussion of the merits, but\r\nto the extent that some causal connection is necessary to find that\r\na state actor has failed the test of objective legal\r\nreasonableness, that nexus exists here.\r\nTo be sure, the psychiatrists did not have official\r\nauthority to rearm Diaz-Martinez and restore him to active duty. \r\nNonetheless, the summary judgment record makes it pellucid that the\r\npsychiatrists knew that their certification of Diaz-Martinez would,\r\nin Dr. Hoyos's phrase, \"most probably\" result in the officer's\r\nimmediate rearming and return to active duty   as it had in every\r\nother previous instance.  The police superintendent likewise\r\nattested to the significance of the psychiatrists' role.  According\r\nto him, once the examining psychiatrist \"certifies in writing that\r\n[an officer] is authorized to bear arms . . . we proceed to give\r\nback the weapon.\"  Then, too, the director of the Bayamon CIC\r\nstated that the psychiatrists   not the police hierarchy   made the\r\ndecision to rearm Diaz-Martinez.  Finally, the record permits a\r\nreasonable inference that the psychiatrists eschewed easily\r\naccessible steps to forestall the rearming of Diaz-Martinez and\r\ninstead certified his fitness for unrestricted active duty. \r\nBecause this is an adequate showing of causation to support a\r\ndenial of qualified immunity, the psychiatrists' fallback position\r\navails them naught.\r\nV.  THE REMAINING APPELLANTS\r\nThe plaintiff alleges that the remaining three appellants\r\nhave supervisory liability under section 1983 for their individual\r\nfailures to keep Diaz-Martinez unarmed and away from the public. \r\nThe affected appellants unanimously deny this averment.  Their\r\nseparate summary judgment motions maintain that, at the least,\r\nqualified immunity attaches.  Consequently, we troll the record in\r\nsearch of facts bearing on the putative immunity of each appellant. \r\nWe then examine those collected facts to determine the basis of the\r\ndistrict court's decision (and, thus, the existence vel non of\r\nappellate jurisdiction).  Lastly, we proceed to determine whether\r\nthe district court erred in rejecting the qualified immunity\r\ndefense.\r\n               A.  Diaz-Pagan.\r\nThe summary judgment record reveals the following\r\nuncontested facts concerning Diaz-Pagan.\r\nIn January 1994, Diaz-Martinez joined the\r\nBayamon CIC.  Throughout his tenure\r\nthere, Diaz-Pagan served as the unit's\r\ndirector.\r\n\nAs director, Diaz-Pagan had the authority\r\nto oversee and countermand his\r\nsubordinates' staffing decisions and/or\r\nto dispatch police officers for special\r\nhuman relations training to minimize the\r\nlikelihood of future outbursts.\r\n\nDiaz-Pagan also possessed the authority\r\nto ensure that Diaz-Martinez would remain\r\nin an administrative position, removed\r\nfrom public contact.\r\n\nBy early 1994, Diaz-Pagan had read the\r\nCaldern Report and was aware of Diaz-\r\nMartinez's extensive history of violence,\r\nincluding the 1989 hostage-taking\r\nincident, a 1993 death threat against\r\nDiaz-Martinez's landlord, the September\r\n1993 shootings, and a very recent death\r\nthreat against a fellow officer.  This\r\ncompendium of incidents led Diaz-Pagan to\r\nadvise the area commander, Col. Pablo\r\nSantiago-Gonzalez, that Diaz-Martinez\r\n\"displays a pattern of behavior which\r\nrequires special attention.\"\r\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Diaz-Pagan\r\nneither recommended Diaz-Martinez for\r\nspecial human relations training nor\r\nintervened to assure that Diaz-Martinez's\r\nassignments would insulate him from\r\npublic contact.\r\n\nDiaz-Pagan did not alert his subordinates\r\nwho were in charge of day-to-day\r\noperations to the risk that he himself\r\nforesaw.\r\n\nDespite his foreknowledge of the imminent\r\ndanger that rearming Diaz-Martinez\r\nentailed, Diaz-Pagan did not take any\r\nmeasures to influence whether Diaz-\r\nMartinez would be rearmed.\r\n\nAlthough he professed \"surprise[]\" when\r\nhe learned (prior to the incident\r\ninvolving Camilo-Robles) that Diaz-\r\nMartinez's weapon had been restored,\r\nDiaz-Pagan acquiesced in that action and\r\ndid not attempt to rescind it.\r\n\nWhen Diaz-Pagan left for vacation on\r\nApril 18, 1994, he neglected to inform\r\nhis temporary replacement, Capt. Jorge\r\nHernandez-Colon, of Diaz-Martinez's\r\ndisciplinary record.\r\n\n            B.  Santiago-Gonzalez.\r\n\nThe summary judgment record reveals the following\r\nuncontested facts concerning Santiago-Gonzalez.\r\nSantiago-Gonzalez served as Bayamon area\r\ncommander during the time in question.\r\n\nSantiago-Gonzalez knew of Diaz-Martinez's\r\nviolent history.  He had received the\r\nCaldern Report and had personally\r\noverseen the efforts to calm the affected\r\nneighborhood in the wake of the 1993\r\ndouble shooting.\r\n\nDiaz-Pagan identified Santiago-Gonzalez\r\nas his \"boss\" and as \"the person who has\r\ncontrol of the Area.\"  Thus, the chain-\r\nof-command observations set forth as to\r\nDiaz-Pagan apply with at least equal\r\nforce to Santiago-Gonzalez.\r\n\nThe superintendent of police testified\r\nthat: \"It is the discretion of the Area\r\nCommander [Santiago-Gonzalez] to assign\r\n[officers] to the different units.\"\r\n\nSantiago-Gonzalez enjoyed the discretion\r\nto assign Diaz-Martinez to desk duty or\r\nother administrative work, yet failed to\r\nuse this power to make certain that the\r\nrogue officer would not come in contact\r\nwith the public.\r\n\n              C.  Toledo-Davila.\r\n\nThe summary judgment record reveals the following\r\nuncontested facts concerning Toledo-Davila.\r\nToledo-Davila served as police\r\nsuperintendent throughout the time in\r\nquestion.\r\n\nThe police superintendent is the only\r\nperson empowered to assign a regulation\r\nweapon to a member of the police force,\r\nand has plenary discretion to withhold or\r\nconfiscate a weapon in those cases in\r\nwhich he deems such action appropriate. \r\nSee Puerto Rico Police Department\r\nPersonnel Reg.  9.3(1)(a), (d).\r\n\nToledo-Davila knew the details of Diaz-\r\nMartinez's violent record.  He also knew\r\nthat the Puerto Rico Department of\r\nJustice had assumed control of the\r\ninvestigation into the September\r\nshootings, and that as of February 1994\r\nits investigation was ongoing.\r\n\nToledo-Davila abdicated his duty to\r\nexercise  independent judgment in\r\ndetermining which officers should bear\r\narms.  In that respect, he stated that\r\nonce a psychiatrist certifies an officer\r\nas fit for duty, \"the superiors are\r\nnotified . . . [a]nd then we proceed to\r\ngive back the weapon.\"\r\n\n         D.  Appellate Jurisdiction.\r\n\nAfter full consideration of the record, we believe that\r\nthe district court supportably assumed a set of documented facts\r\nfrom which it denied the supervisors' motions for summary judgment\r\nas a matter of law. Consequently, we have jurisdiction to review\r\nthe district court's decision.\r\nOur rationale is straightforward.  On the record as it\r\nstands, the facts as to these appellants' powers, functions,\r\nconduct, and omissions are not seriously disputed, nor are the\r\nfacts as to what corrective measures were available to them.  This\r\nmakes it very likely that the district court assumed the facts to\r\nbe as stated.  That the district court did not wait for the\r\nplaintiff's opposition   a practice that we do not commend  \r\nbuttresses this conclusion and suggests that the court did not\r\nbelieve it necessary for the plaintiff to adduce additional facts\r\nbecause the facts that already were in the record, assumed as true\r\nand interpreted favorably to the plaintiff, were insufficient as a\r\nmatter of law to warrant the application of qualified immunity. \r\nThus, we turn to the correctness of that conclusion, again taking\r\nthe supervisors one by one.\r\n     E.  Qualified Immunity   Diaz-Pagan.\r\nDiaz-Pagan trumpets that Diaz-Martinez was not under his\r\ndirect command, and that, in all events, he was on vacation when\r\nDiaz-Martinez allegedly assaulted Camilo-Robles.  Based largely on\r\nthese undisputed facts, Diaz-Pagan maintains that he deserves\r\nqualified immunity because there is no causal link between his\r\nconduct and the assault on Camilo-Robles.\r\nThis argument speaks less to qualified immunity and more\r\nto the merits   and a denial of summary judgment on the merits,\r\neven in a section 1983 case, is not immediately appealable.  SeeDomegan, 859 F.2d at 1061.  Still, a plausible causal chain is\r\nrelevant to the objective legal reasonableness of a state actor's\r\nconduct and, viewed in that light, Diaz-Pagan's contentions are not\r\nentirely off base.  At any rate, on the assumed set of facts the\r\ncourt supportably could have concluded that Diaz-Martinez presented\r\na serious risk of harm and that Diaz-Pagan knew as much; put\r\nanother way, Diaz-Pagan \"was put on notice of behavior which was\r\nlikely to result in the violation of the constitutional rights of\r\ncitizens.\"  Febus-Rodriguez, 14 F.3d at 93.  The court likewise\r\ncould have concluded that Diaz-Pagan had the authority to prevent\r\nrecurrences of Diaz-Martinez's erratic behavior, but nevertheless\r\nfailed to take obvious steps within his power to reduce or\r\neliminate that risk.  Similarly, the court could have found the\r\nrequisite causal connection.  Finally, the court could have\r\nconcluded that Diaz-Pagan's omission was outside the range of\r\nmistaken judgments that the qualified immunity doctrine protects. \r\nSeen in that light, Diaz-Pagan's conduct was not objectively\r\nreasonable and, thus, qualified immunity does not attach.\r\nF.  Qualified Immunity   Santiago-Gonzalez.  \r\nSantiago-Gonzalez similarly claims qualified immunity on\r\nthe ground that the causal connection between his functions and\r\nDiaz-Martinez's transgressions is too attenuated to justify the\r\nimposition of section 1983 liability.  As above, we examine\r\ncausation insofar as it bears on qualified immunity (i.e., as an\r\nelement of objective legal reasonableness).\r\nOn the facts proffered by Santiago-Gonzalez and amplified\r\nelsewhere in the record, it is plain that Santiago-Gonzalez knew\r\nthat Diaz-Martinez was a ticking time bomb and also knew (or should\r\nhave known) that Diaz-Martinez, if restored to active duty, was\r\nlikely to commit acts that would violate the constitutional rights\r\nof others.  As was true of Diaz-Pagan, Santiago-Gonzalez had both\r\nthe authority and the opportunity to prevent Diaz-Martinez from\r\ninteracting with the public, yet failed to intervene.  Accordingly,\r\nhis indifference and the assault on Camilo-Robles were causally\r\nlinked.  In a nutshell, on the assumed set of facts revealed by the\r\nsummary judgment record the district court supportably could\r\nconclude that Santiago-Gonzalez acted in an objectively\r\nunreasonable fashion, thus exempting his conduct from the\r\nprophylaxis of qualified immunity.\r\n   G.  Qualified Immunity   Toledo-Davila.\r\nAt the end of the day, Toledo-Davila maintains that he\r\nand the officers under his command followed proper police\r\nprocedures when rearming Diaz-Martinez.  He adds that in all events\r\nhe acted in good faith   and qualified immunity protects officers\r\nwho make good-faith mistakes.  See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641. \r\nAlthough we find no evidence to suggest that Toledo-Davila (or the\r\nother appellants, for that matter) acted in bad faith, we\r\nnonetheless conclude that Toledo-Davila cannot wrap himself in the\r\nmantle of qualified immunity.\r\nThe extant record eloquently refutes Toledo-Davila's\r\nassertion that his conduct was, as a matter of law, objectively\r\nreasonable.  Toledo-Davila knew of Diaz-Martinez's vicious\r\npropensities and the peril presented; he had the sole de jure\r\nresponsibility to authorize rearming; and yet he treated Diaz-\r\nMartinez not as a dangerous sociopath, but as any other officer. \r\nTo cinch matters, a causal relationship existed between Toledo-\r\nDavila's conduct and the incident at the Bayamon Judicial Center. \r\nWe think that the police superintendent's latitudinarian approach\r\nin the face of Diaz-Martinez's patent instability was so far\r\noutside the realm of reasonableness that it rendered him ineligible\r\nfor protection under the qualified immunity doctrine.\r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe add an eschatocol of sorts.  This is a hard case, for\r\nit does not readily fit the mold cast by the Court's precedents. \r\nWe believe it is possible that the Court, when confronted with a\r\nclaim of qualified immunity in a deliberate indifference case, may\r\nrecognize the awkwardness of the fit and formulate a special set of\r\nrules to cover such situations.  Until further guidance emerges,\r\nhowever, we have little choice but to apply the existing qualified\r\nimmunity paradigm across the board.  We have endeavored to do so\r\nhere.\r\nWe need go no further.  Qualified immunity protects \"all\r\nbut the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\r\nlaw.\"  Malley v. Briggs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341 (1986).  In this case,\r\nnone of the appellants consciously chose to violate the law.  If\r\nthe assumed facts indicated that they were merely inattentive or\r\ncareless, then qualified immunity would shield them despite the\r\nfact that Diaz-Martinez violated the plaintiff's clearly\r\nestablished rights.  See, e.g., Ringuette,     F.3d at     [slip\r\nop. at 12]; Brennan, 888 F.2d at 194.  Here, however, indulging\r\nreasonable pro-plaintiff inferences, the record shows conduct on\r\nthe appellants' part that can best be described as reckless and\r\nwanton   conduct that is emblematic of the plain incompetency to\r\nwhich the Malley Court alluded.  The appellants' behavior is,\r\ntherefore, outside the wide band of mistaken police judgments that\r\nthe qualified immunity doctrine is intended to shield and the\r\nappellants, to a man, are not entitled to summary judgment.\r\n\nAffirmed.  Costs in favor of appellee.\n</pre>",
