Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Selya, Boudin, and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Pamela E. Berman, with whom Schnader Harrison Goldstein & Manello\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Donald K.\nStern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            May 3, 2001\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        John Davis argues that this is\n\none of those rare instances in which the government should have\n\nbeen compelled to file a motion warranting that a defendant had\n\nprovided substantial assistance to the government, with the\n\nconsequence that the district court could then have given Davis\n\na downward departure from the four year maximum sentence he did\n\nreceive.     See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e); U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.            It is\n\nundisputed that Davis provided assistance to the government in\n\nits investigation of other drug traffickers, although he was\n\nadmittedly reticent about a murder in Boston.            The reason the\n\ngovernment refused to file a motion, Davis argues, was to\n\nretaliate    against   him   for   the    successful   exercise   of   his\n\nconstitutional right to have a speedy trial.\n\n            Davis, in fact, was granted dismissal under the Speedy\n\nTrial Act (STA) of the first indictment against him, for\n\npossession with intent to distribute marijuana and PCP, and\n\nconspiracy to commit such crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1) and 846.     He was then indicted for a lesser offense,\n\ntransporting drugs through the mail in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n843(b).     Although in plea negotiations pertaining to the first\n\nindictment the government had made various offers to consider\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffiling a substantial assistance motion, it refused to do so in\n\nplea     negotiations   pertaining        to    the   second   indictment.\n\nNonetheless,    Davis   pled     guilty    to   the   second   indictment,\n\nreserving this sentencing issue for appeal.             If the facts were\n\nsimply as Davis has stated them, this appeal would present a\n\nvery serious matter.     But they are not, and the district court,\n\nwhich handled this matter with great skill, supportably found\n\ncontrary facts that doom Davis' appeal.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            The detailed facts may be found in the district court's\n\nopinion, United States v. Davis, 115 F. Supp. 2d 101 (D. Mass.\n\n2000).    We outline only those needed to understand this appeal.\n\n            After his arrest on the first indictment in January\n\n1998, Davis cooperated with federal authorities by providing\n\ninformation    about    buyers     and     sellers    involved    in   drug\n\ntrafficking activity and by participating in investigations. In\n\nplea   negotiations     with   Davis,     the   government     proposed   an\n\nagreement in which Davis would plead guilty to the conspiracy\n\ncount (which had a guideline range of 121-151 months) and would\n\n\"cooperate fully\" with law enforcement agents and \"provide\n\ncomplete and truthful information.\"              If Davis complied with\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthose terms, the government proposed that it would move to\n\ndepart from the statutory mandatory minimum based on substantial\n\nassistance under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.                   In\n\na   cover    letter   accompanying        the   proposed    agreement,      the\n\ngovernment    referred     to   a   debriefing    session    it    wished    to\n\nschedule between Davis and some homicide detectives.                        The\n\ngovernment believed Davis had information about a homicide.\n\nNeither party signed the agreement.                Davis did meet with\n\nhomicide detectives but refused to answer any questions.\n\n            With new counsel, Davis resumed plea negotiations.\n\nDavis   continued     to   refuse    to    cooperate   in    the    homicide\n\ninvestigation. While the government calls Davis' silence a\n\n\"major obstacle to a plea agreement,\" Davis claims that the\n\ngovernment was bound to seek a substantial assistance downward\n\ndeparture based on his assistance in the drug trafficking\n\ninvestigations.       In any event, it is undisputed that during\n\nnegotiations the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) offered to seek\n\nthe approval of the Substantial Assistance Committee to file a\n\n§ 5K1.1 motion.       The Committee is the body within the U.S.\n\nAttorney's office in Massachusetts empowered to authorize such\n\nmotions.    Still, no plea agreement was reached.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            Davis filed a STA motion in January 2000 to dismiss the\n\nindictment.       Plea     negotiations     continued      apace,    with   the\n\ngovernment repeating its offer to seek internal approval for\n\nfiling a substantial assistance motion.             Pending the outcome of\n\nDavis'     STA   motion,     the    government      obtained       the   second\n\nindictment, charging transportation of drugs through the mail,\n\nwhich carries a four-year maximum sentence.               The district court\n\ndismissed the original indictment with prejudice under the STA\n\non March 27, 2000.\n\n            The government appealed the dismissal of the first\n\nindictment and also considered presenting additional charges to\n\nthe grand jury.        During plea negotiations concerning the second\n\nindictment,      the   government    told   Davis    it    would    no   longer\n\nconsider filing a § 5K1.1 motion.                The parties eventually\n\nentered into a written agreement, in which Davis pled guilty to\n\nthe current charge. In exchange the government agreed to forego\n\nits appeal of the STA dismissal and its pursuit of additional\n\ncharges.    Because the parties disputed whether the government\n\nwas obligated to file a § 5K1.1 motion, the agreement reserved\n\nDavis' right to raise the issue.\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            Davis then moved to compel the government to file the\n\nmotion, claiming that he had provided substantial assistance and\n\nthat the government was retaliating against him for prevailing\n\non his STA motion.      The district court concluded that Davis had\n\nmade a threshold showing that the government had acted with an\n\nimpermissible motive in refusing to seek approval of the filing\n\nof a § 5K1.1 motion, and the government agreed to submit the\n\nmatter for the Committee's consideration.           The AUSA submitted\n\nhis and Davis' descriptions of the assistance rendered.             The\n\ndistrict court approved the government's submission.         To ensure\n\nthe Committee's view of the case was not tainted, the Committee\n\nwas not told of the STA dispute.\n\n            The   Committee   did   not   approve   the   filing   of   a\n\nsubstantial assistance motion, giving as its reason Davis'\n\nrefusal to cooperate in the homicide investigation.          The court\n\naccordingly denied Davis' motion to compel. Davis was sentenced\n\nto the statutory maximum of four years' imprisonment.\n\n            Particularly pertinent are four of the court's factual\n\nfindings:\n\n            1.    The AUSA made only a contingent promise to file a\n\n§ 5K1.1 motion if it was approved by the Committee.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            2.   There is no allegation or evidence that the\n\nCommittee acted in bad faith or that the stated reason for its\n\nrefusal to approve the filing of a § 5K1.1 motion is facially\n\ninadequate.1\n\n            3.   There is no evidence that Davis detrimentally\n\nrelied on the prosecutor's promise to consider filing a § 5K1.1\n\nmotion.    By the time Davis entered a plea of guilty pursuant to\n\nan agreement, the prosecution had renounced any such promise.\n\n            4. There is no evidence that the AUSA -- with whom the\n\noriginal discussions of a § 5K1.1 motion were held -- tainted\n\nthe       Committee's   decision-making     with    impermissible\n\nconsiderations.\n\n                                II.\n\n            There are two related doctrines at play in this case.\n\nThe first is that when the government enters into a plea\n\nagreement with a defendant it must undertake the obligations,\n\nincluding discretionary obligations, that it imposes on itself.\n\nThe plea agreement is analogized to a contract, Santobello v.\n\nNew York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971), and defendants may seek to\n\n\n      1    There was no request made for an evidentiary hearing\nas to the Committee's motivation.\n\n                                -7-\n\fcompel performance, see United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 6\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (\"A defendant who has entered into a plea\n\nagreement     with   the   government,    and   himself   fulfills    that\n\nagreement, is entitled to the benefit of his bargain.\"); United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, 825 F.2d 572, 578 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            The second doctrine is that the government may not use\n\nthe mechanism of declining to file a substantial assistance\n\nmotion   to    carry    out   unconstitutional     purposes,   such    as\n\nretaliating      against      a    defendant    for   exercising      his\n\nconstitutional       rights   or   unconstitutionally     discriminating\n\nagainst a defendant.          Nor may the government cloak those\n\nunconstitutional purposes from judicial scrutiny by saying that\n\nwhether it undertakes the filing of a substantial assistance\n\nmotion is committed to its discretion.            As the Supreme Court\n\nheld in Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181 (1992), a federal\n\ncourt has authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a\n\nsubstantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if the court\n\nfinds that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive\n\nor was not rationally related to some legitimate governmental\n\nend. Id. at 185-86.        \"[A] defendant would be entitled to relief\n\nif a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion,\n\n                                    -8-\n\fsay, because of the defendant's race or religion.\"     Id. at 186.\n\nThe Wade rule, unlike the first doctrine, does not depend upon\n\nthe existence of a plea agreement at all.    Indeed, in Wade there\n\nwas no plea agreement.    And so it is possible for the government\n\nto violate Wade even if the government never promised that it\n\nwould file a substantial assistance motion.     See United States\n\nv. Knights, 968 F.2d 1483, 1486 (2d Cir. 1992).\n\n         Thus, as this court said in United States v. Sandoval,\n\n204 F.3d 283, 286 (1st Cir. 2000), the law constrains the\n\ngovernment's discretion in two situations:       cases where the\n\ngovernment's failure to move is based on impermissible factors\n\nor is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental end\n\nand cases where the government has agreed to an explicit\n\nundertaking.2   The two doctrines have some common points of\n\nanalysis. Many cases discuss the level of judicial scrutiny the\n\ngovernment's decision not to file a substantial assistance\n\nmotion will undergo.     This court has said, at least where there\n\nis a plea agreement,     that the government's burden is modest,\n\n\n\n    2     Sandoval rejected an attempt to create a third category\nwhere neither of these two situations were alleged. See 204\nF.3d at 236.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fonly one of production, not of persuasion.      United States v.\n\nAlegria, 192 F.3d 179, 187 (1st Cir. 1999).          Wade itself\n\nenvisions a low threshold for the government.   Other cases turn\n\non the adequacy of the government's stated reasons and the need\n\nfor further exploration.   United States v. Rounsavall, 128 F.3d\n\n665, 667-68 (8th Cir. 1997); Knights, 968 F.2d at 1485.\n\n         This case initially, then, raises the issue under the\n\nfirst doctrine of whether the government made any promise at all\n\nto pursue a substantial assistance motion.3 There was certainly\n\nno obligation ever agreed to by the government to file a motion\n\nbefore such a filing had been approved by the Committee.     The\n\ndistrict court found that no such promise had been made, and\n\nalso that it was doubtful, given the policy of the U.S.\n\nAttorney's office involved that such matters must be approved by\n\nthe Committee, that such a promise could have been made with\n\nauthority.   The latter issue we need not resolve.\n\n\n\n    3   Because Davis says the government initially agreed to\nfile both a § 5K1.1 motion and a motion under 18 U.S.C. §\n3553(e), we do not discuss the different consequences, other\nthan to note that the combination of motions would have given\nthe district court the ability to sentence below the statutory\nmandatory minimum. See generally Melendez v. United States, 518\nU.S. 120 (1996).\n\n                              -10-\n\f              If, giving Davis the benefit of the doubt, the AUSA\n\nleft an impression that a request for approval to file a\n\nsubstantial assistance motion would at least be considered by\n\nthe Committee based on Davis' help in the drug investigation,\n\nthen that promise was kept.4           For that is exactly what happened,\n\ndue to the mechanism set up by the district court.               The district\n\ncourt also imposed parameters on the Committee's consideration\n\nthat       ensured   that    its    decision        did   not   turn    on   any\n\nunconstitutional motive.           The AUSA who had been bested on the\n\nSTA    motion     was    constrained    in    the    process,   after    Davis'\n\nprotestations that the AUSA would poison the well if he were\n\ninvolved, and any Committee members with prior knowledge of the\n\nDavis      case   were   removed   from      the    process.    Further,     the\n\nCommittee was not told of the STA motion or the dismissal of the\n\nfirst indictment and the court supervised the filing to the\n\n\n       4  In her affidavit, Davis' counsel says she understood\nthat the AUSA offered to \"recommend\" both the § 5K1.1 motion and\na 10- year sentence based on the substantial assistance Davis\nhad already provided.     That was under the first indictment\ncharges, under which Davis faced a sentencing range above 10\nyears.\n     This case illustrates the need for caution by prosecutors\nin what they say as to substantial assistance motions during\nplea negotiations. Appellate counsel for the prosecution is not\nthe attorney whose representations are at issue here.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fCommittee.    Looking at what the government \"promised\" under the\n\nfirst doctrine, Davis may well have received more than he was\n\nentitled in having the Committee consider the matter.\n\n          At oral argument Davis contended that the district\n\ncourt erred in finding that there had never been a flat promise\n\nto Davis to file a substantial assistance motion.          But the\n\nrecord amply supports the district court's conclusion.      In the\n\nparties' plea negotiations concerning the first indictment, the\n\ngovernment's proposed plea agreement left it entirely to the\n\ngovernment's discretion whether to file a substantial assistance\n\nmotion.   Davis neither accepted that agreement nor provided any\n\ninformation    at   the   subsequent   debriefing   with   homicide\n\ndetectives.    After Davis obtained new counsel and negotiations\n\nresumed, the AUSA offered to seek the approval of the Committee\n\nto file a § 5K1.1 motion, along with a recommended 10-year\n\nsentence, with respect to the charges in the first indictment.\n\nNo agreement was reached.       The government later offered a\n\nstandard plea agreement which provided that the government would\n\nconsider filing a substantial assistance motion.      Again, there\n\nwas no agreement.\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f            When, after the first indictment was dismissed, the\n\nparties   started   to    negotiate    anew   concerning       the   second\n\nindictment, the government told Davis it would not consider\n\nfiling a § 5K1.1 motion.         Nonetheless, Davis decided to plead\n\nguilty.     In turn, the government agreed to dismiss its appeal\n\nfrom the allowance of the STA motion and not to bring additional\n\ncharges against Davis.       So, at the time Davis pled guilty, it\n\nwas clear that the government would not file a substantial\n\nassistance motion.        Accordingly, under the plea as contract\n\ndoctrine, there was no reliance by Davis.5\n\n            This brings us to the question, under the second\n\ndoctrine,    whether     Davis   has   made   out   a   Wade    violation,\n\nregardless of what promises were made.              The mere giving of\n\nsubstantial assistance -- and there is no question that Davis\n\ndid assist the government -- does not itself raise an inference\n\nthat the government's failure to file a substantial assistance\n\nmotion was improperly motivated. As said in Wade, the fact that\n\na defendant provided substantial assistance does not provide\n\n\n    5   We understand the district court's finding of lack of\nreliance to be made pursuant to Davis' theory that he was\nentitled to enforcement of the promise made, and not to the\nindependent Wade theory.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fdefendant with a remedy; at most it creates a situation in which\n\nthe government is given the power, but not the duty, to file a\n\nsubstantial assistance motion.   Wade, 504 U.S. at 185.     After\n\nthe district court directed the government to submit a § 5K1.1\n\nmotion for approval to the Committee, the Committee, reviewing\n\nwhat Davis had done, decided the assistance he offered did not\n\nmerit the filing of a substantial assistance motion.      And the\n\ndistrict court, having carefully regulated the Committee's\n\ndecision process, found no evidence of improper motive in the\n\ndecision the Committee reached. Indeed, Davis' failure to\n\ncooperate in the murder investigation provides a basis for the\n\nCommittee's conclusion, whatever Davis' view that he had given\n\nenough already and should not be forced to go that far.\n\n         As to Davis' argument that the district court was\n\nindependently empowered to grant a downward departure under §\n\n5K2.0 in this situation, we rejected that argument in Alegria.\n\nAccord Sandoval, 204 F.3d at 285 (rejecting appellant's theory\n\nthat § 5K2.0 provides a separate and independent basis under\n\n\n\n\n                              -14-\n\fwhich the district court can depart downward for substantial\n\nassistance) (citing rule in Alegria, 192 F.3d at 189).6\n\n            For these reasons, the judgment and sentence are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    6  Davis' citation to United States v. Khoury, 62 F.3d 1138\n(9th Cir. 1995) is of no assistance. We understand Khoury to\nposit that the remedy for a Wade violation could be either to\ncompel the government to file a substantial assistance motion or\nto authorize the district court itself to depart downward if the\ngovernment balks. Id. at 1141-43. Even if the second were a\npermissible remedy, the condition precedent for either remedy is\nmissing here.\n\n                             -15-\n\f",

In plea negotiations with Davis, the government proposed an agreement in which Davis would plead guilty to the conspiracy count (which had a guideline range of 121-151 months) and would \"cooperate fully\" with law enforcement agents and \"provide complete and truthful information.\" If Davis complied with those terms, the government proposed that it would move to depart from the statutory mandatory minimum based on substantial assistance under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1. In a cover letter accompanying the proposed agreement, the government referred to a debriefing session it wished to schedule between Davis and some homicide detectives. The government believed Davis had information about a homicide. Neither party signed the agreement. Davis did meet with homicide detectives but refused to answer any questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With new counsel, Davis resumed plea negotiations. Davis continued to refuse to cooperate in the homicide investigation. While the government calls Davis' silence a \"major obstacle to a plea agreement,\" Davis claims that the government was bound to seek a substantial assistance downward departure based on his assistance in the drug trafficking investigations. In any event, it is undisputed that during negotiations the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) offered to seek the approval of the Substantial Assistance Committee to file a &#167; 5K1.1 motion. The Committee is the body within the U.S. Attorney's office in Massachusetts empowered to authorize such motions. Still, no plea agreement was reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis filed a STA motion in January 2000 to dismiss the indictment. Plea negotiations continued apace, with the government repeating its offer to seek internal approval for filing a substantial assistance motion. Pending the outcome of Davis' STA motion, the government obtained the second indictment, charging transportation of drugs through the mail, which carries a four-year maximum sentence. The district court dismissed the original indictment with prejudice under the STA on March 27, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appealed the dismissal of the first indictment and also considered presenting additional charges to the grand jury. During plea negotiations concerning the second indictment, the government told Davis it would no longer consider filing a &#167; 5K1.1 motion. The parties eventually entered into a written agreement, in which Davis pled guilty to the current charge. In exchange the government agreed to forego its appeal of the STA dismissal and its pursuit of additional charges. Because the parties disputed whether the government was obligated to file a &#167; 5K1.1 motion, the agreement reserved Davis' right to raise the issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davis then moved to compel the government to file the motion, claiming that he had provided substantial assistance and that the government was retaliating against him for prevailing on his STA motion. The district court concluded that Davis had made a threshold showing that the government had acted with an impermissible motive in refusing to seek approval of the filing of a &#167; 5K1.1 motion, and the government agreed to submit the matter for the Committee's consideration. The AUSA submitted his and Davis' descriptions of the assistance rendered. The district court approved the government's submission.

There is no allegation or evidence that the Committee acted in bad faith or that the stated reason for its refusal to approve the filing of a &#167; 5K1.1 motion is facially inadequate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. There is no evidence that Davis detrimentally relied on the prosecutor's promise to consider filing a &#167; 5K1.1 motion. By the time Davis entered a plea of guilty pursuant to an agreement, the prosecution had renounced any such promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. There is no evidence that the AUSA -- with whom the original discussions of a &#167; 5K1.1 motion were held -- tainted the Committee's decision-making with impermissible considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two related doctrines at play in this case. The first is that when the government enters into a plea agreement with a defendant it must undertake the obligations, including discretionary obligations, that it imposes on itself. The plea agreement is analogized to a contract, Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971), and defendants may seek to compel performance, see United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"A defendant who has entered into a plea agreement with the government, and himself fulfills that agreement, is entitled to the benefit of his bargain.\"); United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, 825 F.2d 572, 578 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second doctrine is that the government may not use the mechanism of declining to file a substantial assistance motion to carry out unconstitutional purposes, such as retaliating against a defendant for exercising his constitutional rights or unconstitutionally discriminating against a defendant. Nor may the government cloak those unconstitutional purposes from judicial scrutiny by saying that whether it undertakes the filing of a substantial assistance motion is committed to its discretion. As the Supreme Court held in Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181 (1992), a federal court has authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if the court finds that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to some legitimate governmental end. Id. at 185-86. \"[A] defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.\" Id. at 186. The Wade rule, unlike the first doctrine, does not depend upon the existence of a plea agreement at all. Indeed, in Wade there was no plea agreement. And so it is possible for the government to violate Wade even if the government never promised that it would file a substantial assistance motion. See United States v. Knights, 968 F.2d 1483, 1486 (2d Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as this court said in United States v. Sandoval, 204 F.3d 283, 286 (1st Cir. 2000), the law constrains the government's discretion in two situations: cases where the government's failure to move is based on impermissible factors or is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental end and cases where the government has agreed to an explicit undertaking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The two doctrines have some common points of analysis. Many cases discuss the level of judicial scrutiny the government's decision not to file a substantial assistance motion will undergo. This court has said, at least where there is a plea agreement, that the government's burden is modest, only one of production, not of persuasion. United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 187 (1st Cir. 1999). Wade itself envisions a low threshold for the government. Other cases turn on the adequacy of the government's stated reasons and the need for further exploration. United States v. Rounsavall, 128 F.3d 665, 667-68 (8th Cir. 1997); Knights, 968 F.2d at 1485.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case initially, then, raises the issue under the first doctrine of whether the government made any promise at all to pursue a substantial assistance motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> There was certainly no obligation ever agreed to by the government to file a motion before such a filing had been approved by the Committee. The district court found that no such promise had been made, and also that it was doubtful, given the policy of the U.S. Attorney's office involved that such matters must be approved by the Committee, that such a promise could have been made with authority. The latter issue we need not resolve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, giving Davis the benefit of the doubt, the AUSA left an impression that a request for approval to file a substantial assistance motion would at least be considered by the Committee based on Davis' help in the drug investigation, then that promise was kept.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For that is exactly what happened, due to the mechanism set up by the district court. The district court also imposed parameters on the Committee's consideration that ensured that its decision did not turn on any unconstitutional motive. The AUSA who had been bested on the STA motion was constrained in the process, after Davis' protestations that the AUSA would poison the well if he were involved, and any Committee members with prior knowledge of the Davis case were removed from the process. Further, the Committee was not told of the STA motion or the dismissal of the first indictment and the court supervised the filing to the Committee. Looking at what the government \"promised\" under the first doctrine, Davis may well have received more than he was entitled in having the Committee consider the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument Davis contended that the district court erred in finding that there had never been a flat promise to Davis to file a substantial assistance motion. But the record amply supports the district court's conclusion. In the parties' plea negotiations concerning the first indictment, the government's proposed plea agreement left it entirely to the government's discretion whether to file a substantial assistance motion. Davis neither accepted that agreement nor provided any information at the subsequent debriefing with homicide detectives. After Davis obtained new counsel and negotiations resumed, the AUSA offered to seek the approval of the Committee to file a &#167; 5K1.1 motion, along with a recommended 10-year sentence, with respect to the charges in the first indictment. No agreement was reached. The government later offered a standard plea agreement which provided that the government would consider filing a substantial assistance motion. Again, there was no agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, after the first indictment was dismissed, the parties started to negotiate anew concerning the second indictment, the government told Davis it would not consider filing a &#167; 5K1.1 motion. Nonetheless, Davis decided to plead guilty. In turn, the government agreed to dismiss its appeal from the allowance of the STA motion and not to bring additional charges against Davis. So, at the time Davis pled guilty, it was clear that the government would not file a substantial assistance motion. Accordingly, under the plea as contract doctrine, there was no reliance by Davis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question, under the second doctrine, whether Davis has made out a Wade violation, regardless of what promises were made. The mere giving of substantial assistance -- and there is no question that Davis did assist the government -- does not itself raise an inference that the government's failure to file a substantial assistance motion was improperly motivated. As said in Wade, the fact that a defendant provided substantial assistance does not provide defendant with a remedy; at most it creates a situation in which the government is given the power, but not the duty, to file a substantial assistance motion. Wade, 504 U.S. at 185. After the district court directed the government to submit a &#167; 5K1.1 motion for approval to the Committee, the Committee, reviewing what Davis had done, decided the assistance he offered did not merit the filing of a substantial assistance motion. And the district court, having carefully regulated the Committee's decision process, found no evidence of improper motive in the decision the Committee reached. Indeed, Davis' failure to cooperate in the murder investigation provides a basis for the Committee's conclusion, whatever Davis' view that he had given enough already and should not be forced to go that far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Davis' argument that the district court was independently empowered to grant a downward departure under &#167; 5K2.0 in this situation, we rejected that argument in Alegria. Accord Sandoval, 204 F.3d at 285 (rejecting appellant's theory that &#167; 5K2.0 provides a separate and independent basis under which the district court can depart downward for substantial assistance) (citing rule in Alegria, 192 F.3d at 189).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the judgment and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was no request made for an evidentiary hearing as to the Committee's motivation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sandoval rejected an attempt to create a third category where neither of these two situations were alleged.

See generally Melendez v. United States, 518 U.S. 120 (1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In her affidavit, Davis' counsel says she understood that the AUSA offered to \"recommend\" both the &#167; 5K1.1 motion and a 10- year sentence based on the substantial assistance Davis had already provided. That was under the first indictment charges, under which Davis faced a sentencing range above 10 years.</p>\n        <p>This case illustrates the need for caution by prosecutors in what they say as to substantial assistance motions during plea negotiations.

By the time Davis entered a plea of guilty pursuant to an agreement, the prosecution had renounced any such promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. There is no evidence that the AUSA -- with whom the original discussions of a &#167; 5K1.1 motion were held -- tainted the Committee's decision-making with impermissible considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two related doctrines at play in this case. The first is that when the government enters into a plea agreement with a defendant it must undertake the obligations, including discretionary obligations, that it imposes on itself. The plea agreement is analogized to a contract, Santobello v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 262 (1971), and defendants may seek to compel performance, see United States v. Saxena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199110\"><a href=\"/opinion/199110/united-states-v-saxena/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"A defendant who has entered into a plea agreement with the government, and himself fulfills that agreement, is entitled to the benefit of his bargain.\"); United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492352\"><a href=\"/opinion/492352/united-states-v-pedro-m-gonzalez-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 578 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second doctrine is that the government may not use the mechanism of declining to file a substantial assistance motion to carry out unconstitutional purposes, such as retaliating against a defendant for exercising his constitutional rights or unconstitutionally discriminating against a defendant. Nor may the government cloak those unconstitutional purposes from judicial scrutiny by saying that whether it undertakes the filing of a substantial assistance motion is committed to its discretion. As the Supreme Court held in Wade v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112734\"><a href=\"/opinion/112734/wade-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span> (1992), a federal court has authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if the court finds that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to some legitimate governmental end. Id. at 185-86. \"[A] defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.\" Id. at 186. The Wade rule, unlike the first doctrine, does not depend upon the existence of a plea agreement at all. Indeed, in Wade there was no plea agreement. And so it is possible for the government to violate Wade even if the government never promised that it would file a substantial assistance motion. See United States v. Knights, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586826\"><a href=\"/opinion/586826/united-states-v-horace-john-knights-aka-john-knights-aaron-mcadoo/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span>, 1486 (2d Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as this court said in United States v. Sandoval, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></span>, 286 (1st Cir. 2000), the law constrains the government's discretion in two situations: cases where the government's failure to move is based on impermissible factors or is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental end and cases where the government has agreed to an explicit undertaking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The two doctrines have some common points of analysis. Many cases discuss the level of judicial scrutiny the government's decision not to file a substantial assistance motion will undergo. This court has said, at least where there is a plea agreement, that the government's burden is modest, only one of production, not of persuasion. United States v. Alegria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198656\"><a href=\"/opinion/198656/united-states-v-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 187 (1st Cir. 1999). Wade itself envisions a low threshold for the government. Other cases turn on the adequacy of the government's stated reasons and the need for further exploration. United States v. Rounsavall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747670\"><a href=\"/opinion/747670/united-states-v-mary-ann-rounsavall/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span>, 667-68 (8th Cir. 1997); Knights, 968 F.2d at 1485.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case initially, then, raises the issue under the first doctrine of whether the government made any promise at all to pursue a substantial assistance motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> There was certainly no obligation ever agreed to by the government to file a motion before such a filing had been approved by the Committee. The district court found that no such promise had been made, and also that it was doubtful, given the policy of the U.S. Attorney's office involved that such matters must be approved by the Committee, that such a promise could have been made with authority. The latter issue we need not resolve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, giving Davis the benefit of the doubt, the AUSA left an impression that a request for approval to file a substantial assistance motion would at least be considered by the Committee based on Davis' help in the drug investigation, then that promise was kept.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For that is exactly what happened, due to the mechanism set up by the district court. The district court also imposed parameters on the Committee's consideration that ensured that its decision did not turn on any unconstitutional motive. The AUSA who had been bested on the STA motion was constrained in the process, after Davis' protestations that the AUSA would poison the well if he were involved, and any Committee members with prior knowledge of the Davis case were removed from the process. Further, the Committee was not told of the STA motion or the dismissal of the first indictment and the court supervised the filing to the Committee. Looking at what the government \"promised\" under the first doctrine, Davis may well have received more than he was entitled in having the Committee consider the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument Davis contended that the district court erred in finding that there had never been a flat promise to Davis to file a substantial assistance motion. But the record amply supports the district court's conclusion. In the parties' plea negotiations concerning the first indictment, the government's proposed plea agreement left it entirely to the government's discretion whether to file a substantial assistance motion. Davis neither accepted that agreement nor provided any information at the subsequent debriefing with homicide detectives. After Davis obtained new counsel and negotiations resumed, the AUSA offered to seek the approval of the Committee to file a &#167; 5K1.1 motion, along with a recommended 10-year sentence, with respect to the charges in the first indictment. No agreement was reached. The government later offered a standard plea agreement which provided that the government would consider filing a substantial assistance motion. Again, there was no agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, after the first indictment was dismissed, the parties started to negotiate anew concerning the second indictment, the government told Davis it would not consider filing a &#167; 5K1.1 motion. Nonetheless, Davis decided to plead guilty. In turn, the government agreed to dismiss its appeal from the allowance of the STA motion and not to bring additional charges against Davis. So, at the time Davis pled guilty, it was clear that the government would not file a substantial assistance motion. Accordingly, under the plea as contract doctrine, there was no reliance by Davis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question, under the second doctrine, whether Davis has made out a Wade violation, regardless of what promises were made. The mere giving of substantial assistance -- and there is no question that Davis did assist the government -- does not itself raise an inference that the government's failure to file a substantial assistance motion was improperly motivated. As said in Wade, the fact that a defendant provided substantial assistance does not provide defendant with a remedy; at most it creates a situation in which the government is given the power, but not the duty, to file a substantial assistance motion. Wade, 504 U.S. at 185. After the district court directed the government to submit a &#167; 5K1.1 motion for approval to the Committee, the Committee, reviewing what Davis had done, decided the assistance he offered did not merit the filing of a substantial assistance motion. And the district court, having carefully regulated the Committee's decision process, found no evidence of improper motive in the decision the Committee reached. Indeed, Davis' failure to cooperate in the murder investigation provides a basis for the Committee's conclusion, whatever Davis' view that he had given enough already and should not be forced to go that far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Davis' argument that the district court was independently empowered to grant a downward departure under &#167; 5K2.0 in this situation, we rejected that argument in Alegria. Accord Sandoval, 204 F.3d at 285 (rejecting appellant's theory that &#167; 5K2.0 provides a separate and independent basis under which the district court can depart downward for substantial assistance) (citing rule in Alegria, 192 F.3d at 189).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the judgment and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was no request made for an evidentiary hearing as to the Committee's motivation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sandoval rejected an attempt to create a third category where neither of these two situations were alleged. See 204 F.3d at 286.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because Davis says the government initially agreed to file both a &#167; 5K1.1 motion and a motion under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(e), we do not discuss the different consequences, other than to note that the combination of motions would have given the district court the ability to sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. See generally Melendez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118045\"><a href=\"/opinion/118045/melendez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span> (1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In her affidavit, Davis' counsel says she understood that the AUSA offered to \"recommend\" both the &#167; 5K1.1 motion and a 10- year sentence based on the substantial assistance Davis had already provided. That was under the first indictment charges, under which Davis faced a sentencing range above 10 years.</p>\n        <p>This case illustrates the need for caution by prosecutors in what they say as to substantial assistance motions during plea negotiations. Appellate counsel for the prosecution is not the attorney whose representations are at issue here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We understand the district court's finding of lack of reliance to be made pursuant to Davis' theory that he was entitled to enforcement of the promise made, and not to the independent Wade theory.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Davis' citation to United States v.

We understand Khoury to posit that the remedy for a Wade violation could be either to compel the government to file a substantial assistance motion or to authorize the district court itself to depart downward if the government balks. Id. at 1141-43. Even if the second were a permissible remedy, the condition precedent for either remedy is missing here.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
