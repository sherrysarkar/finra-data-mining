The  Trust,  having no  stake  in this  debate,  has\r\n\nprovided no  response.  Cipriano, the  beneficiary of Casco's\r\n\npolicy,  was a  named  defendant in  this  suit and  filed  a\r\n\ngeneral answer  to Casco's complaint, but  insofar as appears\r\n\nhe did not file  an opposition to Casco's motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment (which  sought  relief  on the  point)  nor  did  he\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\notherwise take part  in the proceeding  below.

Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1468277\"><a href=\"/opinion/1468277/poulos-v-aetna-cas-sur-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 365 (1977) (upholding an insurance policy clause reducing the insurer's liability by the amount paid or payable \"under any workmen's compensation law, disability benefits law or any similar law\" only to the extent such benefits represented a double recovery--thus mandating that the deduction be from the insured's total damages, not the policy's face value).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Casco included this claim in its amended complaint, in its motion for summary judgment below, and in its appeal brief.  The Trust, having no stake in this debate, has provided no response.  Cipriano, the beneficiary of Casco's policy, was a named defendant in this suit and filed a general answer to Casco's complaint, but insofar as appears he did not file an opposition to Casco's motion for summary judgment (which sought relief on the point) nor did he otherwise take part in the proceeding below.  Cipriano has neither argued nor filed any brief on appeal.  As a result, we are left to decide the matter with only Casco's arguments to guide us.  See Allgeier v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545517\"><a href=\"/opinion/545517/richard-allgeier-maria-d-boldrick-intervening-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span>, 871-72 n. 3 (6th Cir.1990) (considering an appeal solely on the brief of the appellant when the appellee failed to file a brief) (citing, inter alia, Fed.

Nor can we say that Casco has failed to do all that might be expected to pursue the issue.  We accordingly remand to the district court with directions that it issue a declaratory judgment in Casco's favor providing, in effect, that, \"The policy issued by Casco Indemnity Company provides uninsured motorist coverage which is excess to any workers' compensation benefits paid to defendant Cipriano or received by him in the future with respect to the accident of November 20, 1993.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court's sole apparent reference to the issue in its opinion was its statement, \"With regard to the Casco Policy, any coverage available to Cipriano is to be governed by the terms of the agreement between the parties.\"  Casco, 929 F.Supp. at 73</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
