At all times relevant\r\n\nto this case,  Rusco was a subcontractor to Atkinson-Kiewit Joint\r\n\nVenture  (\"Atkinson\")  on the  Jameson  Bridge  project in  Rhode\r\n\nIsland.   Plaintiff  Richard  Cosimini worked  for  Rusco on  the\r\n\nproject.  He brought  the original action against  Atkinson after\r\n\nhe was injured during the course  of his employment with Rusco on\r\n\nthe  Jamestown Bridge project.  Atkinson then filed a third party\r\n\ncomplaint against Rusco, claiming, in part, that Rusco failed  to\r\n\nprocure certain  insurance as  required by  the contract.   After\r\n\ndetermining  that  Rusco  had  in fact  procured  the  insurance,\r\n\nAtkinson  voluntarily  dismissed   the  related  counts   without\r\n\nprejudice.  Thereafter, Rusco  and Atkinson brought cross motions\r\n\nfor summary judgment on another issue related to the scope of the\r\n\ninsurance coverage.  In  an amended decision, the  district court\r\n\ngranted  Rusco  partial   summary  judgment   on  the   insurance\r\n\nprocurement  issue  that had  previously  been  dismissed.   This\r\n\nappeal ensued.\r\n\n          After  Atkinson filed  its  brief in  this appeal,  the\r\n\nparties settled their dispute  through this court's Civil Appeals\r\n\nManagement  Program  (CAMP).   Under  the  rules  of  this  court\r\n\ngoverning  CAMP,   parties  may  be  directed   to  consider  the\r\n\npossibility of settlement.   See First Circuit Rule 47.5.
