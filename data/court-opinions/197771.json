On appeal,  the  government asserts  that the\r\n\ndistrict court  abused its discretion  by finding plain  error in\r\n\nits charge and  granting a new trial.   Because we find  that the\r\n\ndistrict court  did not abuse  its discretion in  concluding that\r\n\nits charge was improper, we affirm.\r\n\n                Factual and Procedural Background\r                          Factual and Procedural Background\r                                                           \r\n\n          This  is an appeal  from an  order entered  January 15,\r\n\n1997, by the district court granting a new trial.  The government\r\n\nprosecuted the appellee, Daniel Paniagua-Ramos, for conspiracy to\r\n\npossess  400 kilograms of  cocaine with the  intent to distribute\r\n\nit, and for aiding and abetting the possession of the cocaine  in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   2 and 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1), 846.\r\n\n          The  case was  tried in  district  court from  Tuesday,\r\n\nDecember  3, 1996,  to  Friday,  December 6,  1996.   On  Friday,\r\n\nDecember 6, the jury retired to deliberate for three hours, after\r\n\nwhich they requested leave to continue on Monday, December 9.  On\r\n\nMonday  morning they  began  deliberating  at approximately  9:30\r\n\na.m.,  but at  10:30  a.m. they  forwarded a  note  to the  court\r\n\nstating:   \"We have not  reached an unanimous decision,  and will\r\n\nnot  be changed.\"   The  court  instructed the  jury to  continue\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ntrying to  decide.   After lunch,  they continued  deliberations.\r\n\nThe jury sent another note to the court at 4:16 p.m. stating: \"We\r\n\nstill don't  have a unanimous  verdict, and none wants  to change\r\n\nits decision.\"   At 4:33 p.m. the  jury sent yet another  note to\r\n\nthe court, stating:   \"We  suggest to  retire our  position as  a\r\n\njuror for the case  of Mr. Daniel Paniagua.  Due  to no unanimous\r\n\nverdict between  all jurors.\"   The  court then  gave the jury  a\r\n\ncharge  based in part  on the modified  Allen1 charge  found in a\r                                                       \r\n\ndraft  of proposed criminal  law pattern jury  instructions under\r\n\nconsideration for  use as an  aid to  the district courts  of the\r\n\nFirst Circuit.2  The court instructed the jury as follows:\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896).\r                                   \r\n\n2  The draft pattern instruction from which the court derived its\r\nAllen charge, titled  Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions  for the\r                                                                           \r\nDistrict Courts  of the  First Circuit, \"Charge  to a  Hung Jury\"\r                                                \r\nPart 6.06, provides as follows:\r\n\n            I am going  to instruct you to go  back and\r\n          resume your  deliberations.   I will  explain\r\n          why and give you further instructions.\r\n\n            In trials absolute certainty can be neither\r\n          expected nor  attained.  You  should consider\r\n          that  you are selected in the same manner and\r\n          from the same source as any future jury would\r\n          be selected.   There is no reason  to suppose\r\n          that  this case would ever be submitted to 12\r\n          men   and   women  more   intelligent,   more\r\n          impartial or more competent to decide it than\r\n          you, or that more  or clearer evidence  would\r\n          be produced in the future.  Thus, it is  your\r\n          duty   to  decide   the  case   if  you   can\r\n          conscientiously  do  so without  violence  to\r\n          your individual judgment.\r\n\n            The verdict to  which a juror agrees  must,\r\n          of course,  be his  or her  own verdict,  the\r\n          result of his or her own convictions, and not\r\n          a mere acquiescence in  the conclusion of his\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          or her fellow jurors.  Yet, in order to bring\r\n          12  minds to  a  unanimous result,  you  must\r\n          examine the questions  submitted to you  with\r\n          an  open mind and with proper regard for, and\r\n          deference  to,  the  opinion of  your  fellow\r\n          jurors.\r\n\n            In  conferring together  you  ought to  pay\r\n          proper respect to  each other's opinions  and\r\n          you ought to listen with a mind open to being\r\n          convinced by  each other's arguments.   Thus,\r\n          where there is  disagreement, jurors favoring\r\n          acquittal should consider whether a doubt  in\r\n          their  own mind is  a reasonable one  when it\r\n          makes  no impression  upon the  minds of  the\r\n          other equally  honest and  intelligent jurors\r\n          who  have heard  the same  evidence with  the\r\n          same  degree of  attention and with  the same\r\n          desire  to  arrive  at  the truth  under  the\r\n          sanction of the same oath.\r\n\n            On   the   other  hand,   jurors   favoring\r\n          conviction ought seriously  to ask themselves\r\n          whether they should  not distrust the  weight\r\n          or  sufficiency of  evidence  which fails  to\r\n          dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of their\r\n          fellow jurors.\r\n\n            Not only should jurors  in the minority re-\r\n          examine their  positions, but  jurors in  the\r\n          majority should  do so  also, to  see whether\r\n          they  have  given careful  consideration  and\r\n          sufficient weight  to the  evidence that  has\r\n          favorably    impressed    the    persons   in\r\n          disagreement with them.\r\n\n            Burden of proof is a legal tool for helping\r\n          you  decide.    The   law  imposes  upon  the\r\n          prosecution  a  high burden  of  proof.   The\r\n          prosecution has the burden to establish, with\r\n          respect to each count, each essential element\r\n          of  the  offense,   and  to  establish   that\r\n          essential element beyond  a reasonable doubt.\r\n          And if  with respect  to any  element of  any\r\n          count you  are left in reasonable  doubt, the\r\n          defendant  is entitled to the benefit of such\r\n          doubt and must be acquitted.\r\n\n            It is your duty to  decide the case, if you\r\n          can conscientiously do so without violence to\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            Members of the  jury, I have seen  your two\r\n          notes but I  want you to listen  carefully to\r\n          what I have to say and, of course, this is an\r\n          additional instruction.  I want all of you to\r\n          pay  careful  attention to  this  instruction\r\n          that I am going to give you.\r\n\n            In  trials,  such  as  this  one  that  you\r\n          participated  in,   absolute  certainty   can\r\n          neither be  expected nor attained.   And that\r\n          happens,  I would say, in the majority of the\r\n          trials.   You  should consider  that you  are\r\n          selected or you were selected in this case in\r\n          the same manner  and from the same  source as\r\n          any future jury  will be selected.   In other\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          your individual  judgment.  It  is also  your\r\n          duty to return a verdict  on any counts as to\r\n          which  all of you  agree, even if  you cannot\r\n          agree  on  all  counts.   But  if  you cannot\r\n          agree, it is your right to fail to agree.\r\n\n            I  now instruct you  to go back  and resume\r\n          your deliberations.\r\n\nPattern Criminal  Jury Instructions  Drafting Committee,  Pattern\r                                                                           \r\nCriminal Jury Instructions  for the District Courts  of the First\r                                                                           \r\nCircuit, \"Charge to  a Hung  Jury,\" Part  6.06 (discussion  draft\r                 \r\nlater adopted without significant revision).\r\n\n          This  charge  was  contained  in  a  discussion   draft\r\nprepared  by  the  Pattern Criminal  Jury  Instructions  Drafting\r\nCommittee.   At  the First  Circuit Judicial  Conference held  on\r\nOctober 1,  1997, the  federal  judges present  voted to  approve\r\npublication of the final version of the pattern instructions with\r\nthe following caveat appearing in the Preface:\r\n\n          Although   we   believe  that   the   pattern\r\n          instructions   and,   in    particular,   the\r\n          commentary  that  accompanies  them  will  be\r\n          helpful  in  crafting  a  jury  charge  in  a\r\n          particular  case, it  bears emphasis  that no\r\n          district judge is required to use the pattern\r\n          instructions, and  that the Court  of Appeals\r\n          has  not in  any way  approved the  use of  a\r\n          particular instruction.\r\n\nPattern  Criminal Jury  Instructions Drafting  Committee, Pattern\r                                                                           \r\nCriminal  Jury Instructions for the  District Courts of the First\r                                                                           \r\nCircuit,      Preface      (visited      Dec.      17,      1997)\r                 \r\n<http:>. \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          words,  the  fact  that you  have  not agreed\r\n          doesn't  mean that  this is  the  end of  the\r\n          case.   The case will have  to be tried again\r\n          if you cannot  agree.  The point I  am making\r\n          is this:   There is no reason to suppose that\r\n          this case would be ever [sic] submitted to 12\r\n          jurors  different  from  you people  who  are\r\n          either more  intelligent or  more capable  or\r\n          more impartial or more competent than  the 12\r\n          of you.  And they  are going to hear the same\r\n          evidence that you have heard.\r\n\n            The  point that I am trying to make is that\r\n          you, the 12  of you, have to make a conscious\r\n          effort to try to decide  this case if you can\r\n          do   so  without   doing  violence   to  your\r\n          individual judgment.\r\n\n            I  know  by   experience  in  dealing  with\r\n          collective decisions, because I have sat, for\r\n          example, on the  Court of Appeals many  times\r\n          and then  it is  three judges deciding,  that\r\n          the  three judges or the many judges may have\r\n          different views  on something.  But  when you\r\n          have different views you have to look  calmly\r\n          at the issues  and calmly assess them  to see\r\n          whether  there is any way of bringing about a\r\n          solution.\r\n\n            You have  to  pay respect  to each  other's\r\n          opinions.   You have  to listen  with a  mind\r\n          open  to  be  convinced   of  other  people's\r\n          arguments.       Thus,    where   there    is\r\n          disagreement,  jurors   that  are   presently\r\n          favoring acquittal should  consider whether a\r\n          doubt in their  own mind is a  reasonable one\r\n          when it makes no impression upon the minds of\r\n          the  other  equally  honest  and  intelligent\r\n          jurors who have heard the same evidence  with\r\n          the  same degree  of attention  and with  the\r\n          same  desire to arrive at the truth under the\r\n          sanction of the same oath.\r\n\n            On   the   other  hand,   jurors   favoring\r\n          conviction ought to  seriously ask themselves\r\n          whether they  should not distrust  the weight\r\n          or sufficiency of the evidence which fails to\r\n          dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of their\r\n          fellow jurors.\r\n\n            Not only should jurors in the  minority re-\r\n          examine  their positions,  but jurors  in the\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          majority  should also  do so  to  see whether\r\n          they  have  given careful  consideration  and\r\n          sufficient weight  to the  evidence that  has\r\n          favorably    impressed    the    persons   in\r\n          disagreement with them.\r\n\n            Remember that I gave you a charge on Friday\r\n          and  I gave you  this morning the  charge for\r\n          you to  have in writing.  The burden of proof\r\n          instruction is  a legal  tool that  will help\r\n          you to decide this case.\r\n\n            The law imposes upon the prosecution a high\r\n          burden  of  proof.   The prosecution  has the\r\n          burden to  establish  with  respect  to  each\r\n          count each  essential element of  the offense\r\n          and  to  establish   that  essential  element\r\n          beyond a reasonable doubt.  And with  respect\r\n          to any element of any count that you are left\r\n          in reasonable  doubt, then  the defendant  is\r\n          entitled  to  the benefit  of such  doubt and\r\n          must be acquitted.\r\n\n            It is your  duty to decide the  case if you\r\n          can  do so  without  doing violence  to  your\r\n          individual judgment.  But remember, as I said\r\n          before,  that your indecision is not going to\r\n          be the end of this.   Because in the long run\r\n          I have  to take your indecisive verdict, that\r\n          is no verdict, and I will have to  simply try\r\n          this case again, as I said, and get 12 jurors\r\n          that may be worse equipped, they are going to\r\n          hear the same evidence, and they are going to\r\n          go through the same exercise.\r\n\n            So the  point that I  am trying to  make is\r\n          that if you put all  of your 12 minds to work\r\n          and all of you  make an honest effort  not to\r\n          fight with  each other, for  example, but  to\r\n          honestly listen  to each  other, I  am pretty\r\n          sure  that you  will be  able to  agree  on a\r\n          verdict.\r\n\n            Remember something that I  said before, and\r\n          if  I did  not, I think  I did say  it in the\r\n          preliminary instructions that I gave you, you\r\n          are not parties  to this  case.   You do  not\r\n          work for the government.  You are not related\r\n          to  the defendant.  You are strangers to this\r\n          controversy  the same  way that  I  am.   Our\r\n          mission  is to try  to resolve this  case, to\r\n          decide  this   case  on  the  basis   of  the\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          instructions   and  on   the  basis   of  the\r\n          applicable law.    That is  what  the  system\r\n          requires.   That is  the only system  that we\r\n          have.\r\n\n            So with that in mind, I am going to beg you\r\n          to go  back and  give it a  try because  I am\r\n          pretty sure that you can.\r\n          No objections  to the charge were made after the charge\r\n\nwas given and before the jury retired to deliberate.

Therefore, we have  instructed district courts to include\r\n\nthree elements in the substance  of an Allen charge to ameliorate\r                                                      \r\n\nits  potentially  prejudicial  effect.

We have further  instructed trial  courts to\r                           \r\n\navoid substantive  departures from  approved formulations  of the\r\n\nAllen charge, and to avoid using language that might heighten its\r               \r\n\ncoercive  effect.

See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39-40.  At issue in this case\r                                \r\n\nis the second element.\r\n\n          The trial court  stated that agreement should  not come\r\n\nat the cost of doing  violence to a juror's independent judgment,\r\n\nand that an indecisive verdict  will require a new trial.   While\r\n\nthe court determined that  it had failed to include  in its Allen\r                                                                           \r\n\ncharge the  substance of the  jury's right  to fail to  agree, it\r\n\nindicated that implicit in the  charge given was the jury's right\r\n\nto  fail  to agree.    This  court  has refrained  from  offering\r\n\ndefinite wording for an Allen charge,  and in Vachon we held that\r                                                              \r\n\na court's  failure to include  the specific language \"a  jury has\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe right  to disagree\"  did not  necessitate a new  trial.

Here, the  language the court  used to  communicate the\r                \r\n\njury's right to fail to agree was insufficient when considered in\r\n\nthe coercive context in  which it was  given, i.e., the jury  had\r\n\nalready informed the  court on three occasions that  it could not\r\n\nreach  a  unanimous verdict.    Moreover,  any force  behind  the\r\n\nimplicitly communicated right to fail to agree was negated by the\r\n\ncourt's other  statements in  which it was  embedded.   The court\r\n\nsummarized the \"point\"  of the Allen charge given  by stating \"if\r                                              \r\n\nyou  put all of  your 12  minds to  work and all  of you  make an\r\n\nhonest effort not  to fight with each other, for  example, but to\r\n\nhonestly listen to  each other, I am pretty sure that you will be\r\n\nable to agree  on a verdict.\"  This  statement inevitably created\r\n\nan  atmosphere of coercion that minimized the significance of the\r\n\npositions held by  the individual jurors and  in effect compelled\r\n\nunanimity.   Referring to a  juror's attempts to maintain  his or\r\n\nher  individual judgment as  a \"fight\" undermined  the admonition\r\n\nthat jurors should not do violence to their  individual judgment.\r\n\nThe coercive nature of this  language was enhanced by the court's\r\n\nstatement that the \"mission\" was to \"try to resolve this case, to\r\n\ndecide this case . . . .  That is what the system requires.  That\r\n\nis the only system that we have . . . .  I am going to beg you to\r\n\ngo back and give it a try because I am pretty sure that you can.\"\r\n\nThese statements infer that it  would be reasonable, perhaps even\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nexpected, for  the jurors to come  to a decision  on the evidence\r\n\nsubmitted,  and that our system of  justice required and depended\r\n\non their  arriving at  such  a decision.   Finally,  the aura  of\r\n\ncompulsion    was   intensified    by   the    court's   implicit\r\n\ndissatisfaction with an indecisive verdict.  The court emphasized\r\n\nthat the jury's  indecision \"is no verdict\" and  \"is not going to\r\n\nbe the end of  this\" and that \"in the  long run\" \"I will have  to\r\n\nsimply try this case again.\"\r\n\n          These  statements in the  context in which  they appear\r\n\nrun counter  to our  instruction that \"in  all events,  the court\r\n\nshould  be careful to . . . avoid  language which might heighten\"\r\n\nthe coercive effect of an Allen charge.

We therefore find that the lower court's\r\n\ndetermination that its  instruction was legally insufficient  was\r\n\ncorrect under the circumstances.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n          The government fails in its attempt to characterize the\r\n\ntrial court's order for a new trial as being premised solely upon\r\n\nthe court's failure to state expressly that the jury had a \"right\r\n\nto fail to agree.\"  The trial court's order focused on  the First\r\n\nCircuit's requirement that \"the substance of the jury's right\" be\r                                                   \r\n\ncommunicated.  The court found that it had \"failed to communicate\r\n\nthe notion that the jury has a 'right' to deliver an inconclusive\r\n\nverdict,\"  and that  the  charge  lacked  \"complete  accuracy  in\r\n\ncommunicating the extent  of the jury's obligations  and rights.\"\r\n\nSecond,  given the  facts  of  this case,  we  disagree with  the\r\n\ngovernment's contention that the defendant's failure to object in\r\n\na  timely manner  indicates the  charge was  not  in error.   The\r\n\nparties  were not  provided  with  a copy  of  the draft  pattern\r\n\ncharge.  Immediately  after the jury was excused,  the court said\r\n\nto the parties \"[b]efore you say anything, let me say this . . .\"\r\n\nand informed  the  parties  that  the  instruction  given  was  a\r\n\nproposed   pattern  Allen  charge  that  the  First  Circuit  was\r                                   \r\n\nconsidering for publication.   We agree  with the district  court\r\n\nthat the failure  of the parties to object  was understandable in\r\n\nthese circumstances.\r\n\n          B.  The Clarity of the Error\r                                                \r\n\n          The second requirement of Rule 52(b) is  that the error\r\n\nbe plain  or clear.  Here,  the court's error  in its instruction\r\n\nconstituted clear error  under current  law.   We established  as\r\n\nearly  as  1973 that  the  failure to  instruct  the jury  on the\r\n\nsubstance of  the three  elements was  reversible error,  without\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nfurther  inquiry as  to  the  coerciveness of  the  charge.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAngiulo, 485  F.2d at 39-40.   The  error committed by  the trial\r                 \r\n\ncourt is therefore \"plain error\" under Rule 52(b).\r\n\n          C.  Substantial Rights Affected\r                                                   \r\n\n          Finally,  we must address the third requirement of Rule\r\n\n52(b), whether the plain  error affected substantial rights.   In\r\n\nmost instances, this requires that the error be prejudicial.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 734-735.   Here, the jury sent three notes  to\r               \r\n\nthe court  over a six  hour period indicating  that the jury  was\r\n\ndeadlocked, and ultimately suggested that  the jury be allowed to\r\n\n\"retire.\"  A reasonable inference is that the jurors were divided\r\n\nand  deeply  entrenched  in  their  opinions.    The  court  then\r\n\ninstructed  the  jury  with  the  Allen  charge at  issue,  using\r                                                 \r\n\nlanguage  that we  have found to  be coercive  in the  context in\r\n\nwhich it was given.   The jury returned its verdict approximately\r\n\nan hour  and forty  minutes later.   Its verdict  was split.   It\r\n\nacquitted  the defendant of the substantive charge, but convicted\r\n\nthe defendant of the conspiracy charge.  The district court found\r\n\nit likely  that the modified  Allen charge \"intimated  [the jury]\r                                             \r\n\ninto a  decision\" and \"tainted  this jury's  deliberation.\"   The\r\n\ntrial court's findings on the prejudicial effect of the Allen are\r                                                                       \r\n\nentitled to  deference, and we  find them to be  reasonable under\r\n\nthe circumstances.  \r\n\n          The government  argues, however,  that the  verdict was\r\n\nfree from undue  influence, and that  the charge did  not have  a\r\n\nprejudicial effect on the defendant.  It asserts that the verdict\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nwas not inconsistent, and that the court erred when it considered\r\n\nthe  inconsistency  of  the  verdict  as  evidence  of  coercion.\r\n\nAlthough  an inconsistent  verdict in  itself is  not  grounds to\r\n\nvacate  a conviction,  see Dunn  v. United  States, 284  U.S. 390\r                                                            \r\n\n(1932),  an inconsistent  verdict can  be probative of  whether a\r\n\njury was confused or coerced into rendering a compromise verdict,\r\n\nsee United States v. Washington,  No. 96-5196, 1997 WL 614568, at\r                                         \r\n\n*3  (6th Cir.  Oct. 8,  1997)  (considering alleged  inconsistent\r\n\nverdict as evidence of jury confusion); Hafner v. Brown, 983 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n570, 575 (4th  Cir. 1992) (\"If the district  judge concludes that\r\n\nan inconsistent verdict  reflects jury confusion or  uncertainty,\r\n\nhe or she has the duty to clarify the law  governing the case and\r\n\nresubmit the verdict  for a jury decision.\")   Furthermore, we do\r\n\nnot disagree  with the district  court that \"given the  nature of\r\n\nthe evidence in  this case, the logical verdicts  would have been\r\n\nthat  [the defendant] was  guilty of both  the substantive charge\r\n\nand  the  conspiracy charge  or  that  he  was innocent  of  both\r\n\ncharges.\"    To  bolster its  contentions,  the  government again\r\n\nargues that  neither party  objected to the  charge, an  issue we\r\n\nhave already addressed supra, and need not revisit.  Finally, the\r                                      \r\n\ngovernment  urges  that the  polling  of  the  jurors  failed  to\r\n\nindicate  any  coercion.    Polling  is  useful  to  indicate  an\r\n\nirregularity in  a verdict.   See Siverson  v. O'Leary,  764 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1208, 1219-1220 (7th Cir. 1985).   However, the failure of a poll\r\n\nto indicate  coercion is  not conclusive as  to whether  coercion\r\n\nactually existed.   See Manning, 79 F.3d  at 223 (in  open court,\r                                         \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nafter jury had reached verdict, asking \"juror to admit before his\r\n\nfellow jurors that  he had voted against his will  was asking too\r\n\nmuch.\").\r\n\n          D.  Miscarriage of Justice \r                                              \r\n\n          We find  that the three elements required by Rule 52(b)\r\n\nare therefore  satisfied in  this case.   However, Rule  52(b) is\r\n\ndiscretionary.   Even  when plain  error  is found  that  affects\r\n\nsubstantial  rights, a reviewing court must determine whether the\r\n\nerror  \"'seriously affect[s]  the fairness,  integrity or  public\r\n\nreputation of the  judicial proceedings'\" before exercise  of its\r\n\ndiscretion  is appropriate.    Olano, 507  U.S.  at 736  (quoting\r                                              \r\n\nUnited States v.

Under  this\r                           \r\n\nstandard, a reviewing  court should exercise its  discretion when\r\n\nfailure to take notice of the error would result in a miscarriage\r\n\nof justice.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736. \r                                \r\n\n          Here, the  government's case relied upon  the testimony\r\n\nof a cooperating witness.   The trial court found the credibility\r\n\nof this witness  to be \"substantially compromised  by impeachment\r\n\nthrough cross  examination and by  the testimony  of a  probation\r\n\nofficer.\"   The court determined that  it was likely this  led to\r\n\nthe \"severe  deadlock  broken only  by  the Allen  charge\"  which\r                                                           \r\n\n\"intimidated [the  jury] into a decision.\"  This court forewarned\r\n\nagainst this precise situation  in Angiulo when we  expressed our\r                                                    \r\n\nconcern that  an  Allen  charge  may  prejudice  a  defendant  by\r                                 \r\n\ndepriving the defendant of \"whatever  safeguard he might have had\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nin a hung jury  [or] a declaration of mistrial.\"  485 F.2d at 39.\r\n\nIn this case  the jury verdict may be attributed at least in part\r\n\nto coercion by  the court.   We agree with  the district  court's\r\n\nimplicit determination that a failure  to order a new trial would\r\n\nresult  in  a  miscarriage of  justice.

On appeal, the government asserts that the district court abused its discretion by finding plain error in its charge and granting a new trial.  Because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that its charge was improper, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from an order entered January 15, 1997, by the district court granting a new trial.  The government prosecuted the appellee, Daniel Paniagua-Ramos, for conspiracy to possess 400 kilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute it, and for aiding and abetting the possession of the cocaine in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 and 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried in district court from Tuesday, December 3, 1996, to Friday, December 6, 1996.  On Friday, December 6, the jury retired to deliberate for three hours, after which they requested leave to continue on Monday, December 9. On Monday morning they began deliberating at approximately 9:30 a.m., but at 10:30 a.m.  they forwarded a note to the court stating:  \"We have not reached an unanimous decision, and will not be changed.\"   The court instructed the jury to continue trying to decide.  After lunch, they continued deliberations.  The jury sent another note to the court at 4:16 p.m.  stating:  \"We still don't have a unanimous verdict, and none wants to change its decision.\"   At 4:33 p.m.  the jury sent yet another note to the court, stating:  \"We suggest to retire our position as a juror for the case of Mr. Daniel Paniagua.  Due to no unanimous verdict between all jurors.\"   The court then gave the jury a charge based in part on the modified Allen<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> charge found in a draft of proposed criminal law pattern jury instructions under consideration for use as an aid to the district courts of the First Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court instructed the jury as follows:Members of the jury, I have seen your two notes but I want you to listen carefully to what I have to say and, of course, this is an additional instruction.  I want all of you to pay careful attention to this instruction that I am going to give you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trials, such as this one that you participated in, absolute certainty can neither be expected nor attained.  And that happens, I would say, in the majority of the trials.  You should consider that you are selected or you were selected in this case in the same manner and from the same source as any future jury will be selected.  In other words, the fact that you have not agreed doesn't mean that this is the end of the case.  The case will have to be tried again if you cannot agree.  The point I am making is this:  There is no reason to suppose that this case would be ever [sic] submitted to 12 jurors different from you people who are either more intelligent or more capable or more impartial or more competent than the 12 of you.  And they are going to hear the same evidence that you have heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point that I am trying to make is that you, the 12 of you, have to make a conscious effort to try to decide this case if you can do so without doing violence to your individual judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know by experience in dealing with collective decisions, because I have sat, for example, on the Court of Appeals many times and then it is three judges deciding, that the three judges or the many judges may have different views on something.  But when you have different views you have to look calmly at the issues and calmly assess them to see whether there is any way of bringing about a solution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have to pay respect to each other's opinions.  You have to listen with a mind open to be convinced of other people's arguments.  Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors that are presently favoring acquittal should consider whether a doubt in their own mind is a reasonable one when it makes no impression upon the minds of the other equally honest and intelligent jurors who have heard the same evidence with the same degree of attention and with the same desire to arrive at the truth under the sanction of the same oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, jurors favoring conviction ought to seriously ask themselves whether they should not distrust the weight or sufficiency of the evidence which fails to dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of their fellow jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only should jurors in the minority re-examine their positions, but jurors in the majority should also do so to see whether they have given careful consideration and sufficient weight to the evidence that has favorably impressed the persons in disagreement with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remember that I gave you a charge on Friday and I gave you this morning the charge for you to have in writing.  The burden of proof instruction is a legal tool that will help you to decide this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law imposes upon the prosecution a high burden of proof.  The prosecution has the burden to establish with respect to each count each essential element of the offense and to establish that essential element beyond a reasonable doubt.  And with respect to any element of any count that you are left in reasonable doubt, then the defendant is entitled to the benefit of such doubt and must be acquitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is your duty to decide the case if you can do so without doing violence to your individual judgment.  But remember, as I said before, that your indecision is not going to be the end of this.  Because in the long run I have to take your indecisive verdict, that is no verdict, and I will have to simply try this case again, as I said, and get 12 jurors that may be worse equipped, they are going to hear the same evidence, and they are going to go through the same exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So the point that I am trying to make is that if you put all of your 12 minds to work and all of you make an honest effort not to fight with each other, for example, but to honestly listen to each other, I am pretty sure that you will be able to agree on a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remember something that I said before, and if I did not, I think I did say it in the preliminary instructions that I gave you, you are not parties to this case.  You do not work for the government.  You are not related to the defendant.  You are strangers to this controversy the same way that I am.  Our mission is to try to resolve this case, to decide this case on the basis of the instructions and on the basis of the applicable law.  That is what the system requires.  That is the only system that we have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So with that in mind, I am going to beg you to go back and give it a try because I am pretty sure that you can.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No objections to the charge were made after the charge was given and before the jury retired to deliberate.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  No copies of the pattern charge were provided to counsel at the time the charge was given to the jury.  Immediately after instructing the jury, the court informed counsel that the charge given was the proposed pattern charge.  At approximately 6:40 p.m.  the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant guilty on the conspiracy charge and not guilty on the substantive charge of aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 13, 1996, the defendant received a copy of the proposed pattern jury instruction pursuant to his request.  On December 16, 1996, after contrasting the proposed pattern instruction with the instruction as given by the district court, the defendant filed a timely request for a new trial.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.  The defendant argued that the court's Allen charge was defective and coerced the jury into reaching a verdict.  Since the defendant failed to object to the charge before the jury retired to deliberate, the district court reviewed the charge for plain error.  The court rejected the government's arguments opposing a new trial and ordered a new trial.  The government appeals this decision, arguing that the court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial on the basis that the Allen charge constituted plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is within the discretion of the district court to set aside a jury verdict and order a new trial, but this remedy must be \"sparingly used, and then only where there would be a miscarriage of justice.\"  United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 387 (1st Cir.1979) (quotations omitted).  \"[A]n appellate court must sustain the granting of a new trial unless there was an abuse of discretion.\"  Borras v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., 586 F.2d 881, 887 (1st Cir.1978).  A review for abuse of discretion is deferential to the district court, as the court was present at the trial and had the opportunity first hand to observe the evidence, the witnesses, and the jury.  However, there are several components to the abuse of discretion standard.  See United States v. Castro, 129 F.3d 226, 228-29 (1st Cir.1997).  While a court of appeals need not defer to the district court in reviewing questions of law, see Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 98-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), findings of fact are often subjected to clear error review, see Castro, 129 F.3d 226, 228-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendants in this case failed to object to the Allen charge in a timely fashion, a reviewing court may not take notice of the error unless the error meets the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In United States v. Olano, the Supreme Court articulated the proper analysis to be employed in reviewing for plain error.  See 507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-80, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  First, an error must have been committed.  See id. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. at 1776-77.   Second, the error must be \"plain,\" which has been interpreted as \"obvious\" or \"clear under current law.\"  Id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Third, the error must affect substantial rights.  See id. at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Finally, once these three elements are satisfied, the court may in its discretion take notice of the plain error if it is appropriate to do so.

The Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the past, we have referred to the Allen charge as the \"dynamite charge\" and noted that it should be used with \"great caution, and only when absolutely necessary.\"  United States v. Flannery, 451 F.2d 880, 883 (1st Cir.1971).  A defendant may be prejudiced by an Allen charge in a number of ways.  See United States v. Angiulo, 485 F.2d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1973).  Therefore, we have instructed district courts to include three elements in the substance of an Allen charge to ameliorate its potentially prejudicial effect.  See United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 222 (1st Cir.1996).  \"A district court should instruct jurors in substance that (1) members of both the majority and the minority should reexamine their positions, (2) a jury has the right to fail to agree, and (3) the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains with the government.\"  Id. We have further instructed trial courts to avoid substantive departures from approved formulations of the Allen charge, and to avoid using language that might heighten its coercive effect.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.   In situations where the substance of these elements was not communicated to the jury, this court has found reversible error without further inquiry.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39-40.   At issue in this case is the second element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court stated that agreement should not come at the cost of doing violence to a juror's independent judgment, and that an indecisive verdict will require a new trial.  While the court determined that it had failed to include in its Allen charge the substance of the jury's right to fail to agree, it indicated that implicit in the charge given was the jury's right to fail to agree.  This court has refrained from offering definite wording for an Allen charge, and in Vachon we held that a court's failure to include the specific language \"a jury has the right to disagree\" did not necessitate a new trial.  See United States v. Vachon, 869 F.2d 653, 659 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the case at hand is readily distinguished from Vachon.   Here, the language the court used to communicate the jury's right to fail to agree was insufficient when considered in the coercive context in which it was given, i.e., the jury had already informed the court on three occasions that it could not reach a unanimous verdict.  Moreover, any force behind the implicitly communicated right to fail to agree was negated by the court's other statements in which it was embedded.  The court summarized the \"point\" of the Allen charge given by stating \"if you put all of your 12 minds to work and all of you make an honest effort not to fight with each other, for example, but to honestly listen to each other, I am pretty sure that you will be able to agree on a verdict.\"   This statement inevitably created an atmosphere of coercion that minimized the significance of the positions held by the individual jurors and in effect compelled unanimity.  Referring to a juror's attempts to maintain his or her individual judgment as a \"fight\" undermined the admonition that jurors should not do violence to their individual judgment.  The coercive nature of this language was enhanced by the court's statement that the \"mission\" was to \"try to resolve this case, to decide this case....  That is what the system requires.  That is the only system that we have....  I am going to beg you to go back and give it a try because I am pretty sure that you can.\"   These statements infer that it would be reasonable, perhaps even expected, for the jurors to come to a decision on the evidence submitted, and that our system of justice required and depended on their arriving at such a decision.  Finally, the aura of compulsion was intensified by the court's implicit dissatisfaction with an indecisive verdict.  The court emphasized that the jury's indecision \"is no verdict\" and \"is not going to be the end of this\" and that \"in the long run\" \"I will have to simply try this case again.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements in the context in which they appear run counter to our instruction that \"in all events, the court should be careful to ... avoid language which might heighten\" the coercive effect of an Allen charge.  Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.   This court has expressly disapproved of statements that \"directly imply[ ] that it would be reasonable for the jury to reach a decision on the evidence before them.\"  Id. (disapproving court's statements to jury (1) about expense of trial, (2) that court did not want to try case again, and (3) that case was not very difficult);  see also Flannery, 451 F.2d at 883 (disapproving court's statement \"the case must at some time be decided.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, because the jury's weakly enunciated right to deliver an indecisive verdict was closely intertwined with language that strongly compelled a jury agreement, the charge failed to communicate adequately the substance of the jury's right to fail to agree.  We therefore find that the lower court's determination that its instruction was legally insufficient was correct under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government fails in its attempt to characterize the trial court's order for a new trial as being premised solely upon the court's failure to state expressly that the jury had a \"right to fail to agree.\"   The trial court's order focused on the First Circuit's requirement that \"the substance of the jury's right\" be communicated.  The court found that it had \"failed to communicate the notion that the jury has a 'right' to deliver an inconclusive verdict,\" and that the charge lacked \"complete accuracy in communicating the extent of the jury's obligations and rights.\"   Second, given the facts of this case, we disagree with the government's contention that the defendant's failure to object in a timely manner indicates the charge was not in error.  The parties were not provided with a copy of the draft pattern charge.  Immediately after the jury was excused, the court said to the parties \"[b]efore you say anything, let me say this ...\" and informed the parties that the instruction given was a proposed pattern Allen charge that the First Circuit was considering for publication.  We agree with the district court that the failure of the parties to object was understandable in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Clarity of the Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second requirement of Rule 52(b) is that the error be plain or clear.  Here, the court's error in its instruction constituted clear error under current law.  We established as early as 1973 that the failure to instruct the jury on the substance of the three elements was reversible error, without further inquiry as to the coerciveness of the charge.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39-40.   The error committed by the trial court is therefore \"plain error\" under Rule 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Substantial Rights Affected</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we must address the third requirement of Rule 52(b), whether the plain error affected substantial rights.  In most instances, this requires that the error be prejudicial.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Here, the jury sent three notes to the court over a six hour period indicating that the jury was deadlocked, and ultimately suggested that the jury be allowed to \"retire.\"   A reasonable inference is that the jurors were divided and deeply entrenched in their opinions.  The court then instructed the jury with the Allen charge at issue, using language that we have found to be coercive in the context in which it was given.  The jury returned its verdict approximately an hour and forty minutes later.  Its verdict was split.  It acquitted the defendant of the substantive charge, but convicted the defendant of the conspiracy charge.  The district court found it likely that the modified Allen charge \"intimated [the jury] into a decision\" and \"tainted this jury's deliberation.\"   The trial court's findings on the prejudicial effect of the Allen are entitled to deference, and we find them to be reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, however, that the verdict was free from undue influence, and that the charge did not have a prejudicial effect on the defendant.  It asserts that the verdict was not inconsistent, and that the court erred when it considered the inconsistency of the verdict as evidence of coercion.  Although an inconsistent verdict in itself is not grounds to vacate a conviction, see Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932), an inconsistent verdict can be probative of whether a jury was confused or coerced into rendering a compromise verdict, see United States v. Washington, 127 F.3d 510, 513-14 (6th Cir.1997) (considering alleged inconsistent verdict as evidence of jury confusion);  Hafner v. Brown, 983 F.2d 570, 575 (4th Cir.1992) (\"If the district judge concludes that an inconsistent verdict reflects jury confusion or uncertainty, he or she has the duty to clarify the law governing the case and resubmit the verdict for a jury decision.\")   Furthermore, we do not disagree with the district court that \"given the nature of the evidence in this case, the logical verdicts would have been that [the defendant] was guilty of both the substantive charge and the conspiracy charge or that he was innocent of both charges.\"   To bolster its contentions, the government again argues that neither party objected to the charge, an issue we have already addressed supra, and need not revisit.  Finally, the government urges that the polling of the jurors failed to indicate any coercion.  Polling is useful to indicate an irregularity in a verdict.  See Siverson v. O'Leary, 764 F.2d 1208, 1219-20 (7th Cir.1985).  However, the failure of a poll to indicate coercion is not conclusive as to whether coercion actually existed.  See Manning, 79 F.3d at 223 (in open court, after jury had reached verdict, asking \"juror to admit before his fellow jurors that he had voted against his will was asking too much.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Miscarriage of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the three elements required by Rule 52(b) are therefore satisfied in this case.  However, Rule 52(b) is discretionary.  Even when plain error is found that affects substantial rights, a reviewing court must determine whether the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings' \" before exercise of its discretion is appropriate.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936));  see Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1550, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).  Under this standard, a reviewing court should exercise its discretion when failure to take notice of the error would result in a miscarriage of justice.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1778-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government's case relied upon the testimony of a cooperating witness.  The trial court found the credibility of this witness to be \"substantially compromised by impeachment through cross examination and by the testimony of a probation officer.\"   The court determined that it was likely this led to the \"severe deadlock broken only by the Allen charge\" which \"intimidated [the jury] into a decision.\"   This court forewarned against this precise situation in Angiulo when we expressed our concern that an Allen charge may prejudice a defendant by depriving the defendant of \"whatever safeguard he might have had in a hung jury [or] a declaration of mistrial.\"  485 F.2d at 39.   In this case the jury verdict may be attributed at least in part to coercion by the court.  We agree with the district court's implicit determination that a failure to order a new trial would result in a miscarriage of justice.  We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Allen v.

I will explain why and give you further instructions.</p>\n        <p>In trials absolute certainty can be neither expected nor attained.  You should consider that you are selected in the same manner and from the same source as any future jury would be selected.  There is no reason to suppose that this case would ever be submitted to 12 men and women more intelligent, more impartial or more competent to decide it than you, or that more or clearer evidence would be produced in the future.  Thus, it is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so without violence to your individual judgment.</p>\n        <p>The verdict to which a juror agrees must, of course, be his or her own verdict, the result of his or her own convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his or her fellow jurors.  Yet, in order to bring 12 minds to a unanimous result, you must examine the questions submitted to you with an open mind and with proper regard for, and deference to, the opinion of your fellow jurors.</p>\n        <p>In conferring together you ought to pay proper respect to each other's opinions and you ought to listen with a mind open to being convinced by each other's arguments.  Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors favoring acquittal should consider whether a doubt in their own mind is a reasonable one when it makes no impression upon the minds of the other equally honest and intelligent jurors who have heard the same evidence with the same degree of attention and with the same desire to arrive at the truth under the sanction of the same oath.</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, jurors favoring conviction ought seriously to ask themselves whether they should not distrust the weight or sufficiency of evidence which fails to dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of their fellow jurors.</p>\n        <p>Not only should jurors in the minority re-examine their positions, but jurors in the majority should do so also, to see whether they have given careful consideration and sufficient weight to the evidence that has favorably impressed the persons in disagreement with them.</p>\n        <p>Burden of proof is a legal tool for helping you decide.  The law imposes upon the prosecution a high burden of proof.  The prosecution has the burden to establish, with respect to each count, each essential element of the offense, and to establish that essential element beyond a reasonable doubt.  And if with respect to any element of any count you are left in reasonable doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of such doubt and must be acquitted.</p>\n        <p>It is your duty to decide the case, if you can conscientiously do so without violence to your individual judgment.  It is also your duty to return a verdict on any counts as to which all of you agree, even if you cannot agree on all counts.

On appeal, the government asserts that the district court abused its discretion by finding plain error in its charge and granting a new trial.  Because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that its charge was improper, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from an order entered January 15, 1997, by the district court granting a new trial.  The government prosecuted the appellee, Daniel Paniagua-Ramos, for conspiracy to possess 400 kilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute it, and for aiding and abetting the possession of the cocaine in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 and 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried in district court from Tuesday, December 3, 1996, to Friday, December 6, 1996.  On Friday, December 6, the jury retired to deliberate for three hours, after which they requested leave to continue on Monday, December 9. On Monday morning they began deliberating at approximately 9:30 a.m., but at 10:30 a.m.  they forwarded a note to the court stating:  \"We have not reached an unanimous decision, and will not be changed.\"   The court instructed the jury to continue trying to decide.  After lunch, they continued deliberations.  The jury sent another note to the court at 4:16 p.m.  stating:  \"We still don't have a unanimous verdict, and none wants to change its decision.\"   At 4:33 p.m.  the jury sent yet another note to the court, stating:  \"We suggest to retire our position as a juror for the case of Mr. Daniel Paniagua.  Due to no unanimous verdict between all jurors.\"   The court then gave the jury a charge based in part on the modified Allen<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> charge found in a draft of proposed criminal law pattern jury instructions under consideration for use as an aid to the district courts of the First Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The court instructed the jury as follows:Members of the jury, I have seen your two notes but I want you to listen carefully to what I have to say and, of course, this is an additional instruction.  I want all of you to pay careful attention to this instruction that I am going to give you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trials, such as this one that you participated in, absolute certainty can neither be expected nor attained.  And that happens, I would say, in the majority of the trials.  You should consider that you are selected or you were selected in this case in the same manner and from the same source as any future jury will be selected.  In other words, the fact that you have not agreed doesn't mean that this is the end of the case.  The case will have to be tried again if you cannot agree.  The point I am making is this:  There is no reason to suppose that this case would be ever [sic] submitted to 12 jurors different from you people who are either more intelligent or more capable or more impartial or more competent than the 12 of you.  And they are going to hear the same evidence that you have heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point that I am trying to make is that you, the 12 of you, have to make a conscious effort to try to decide this case if you can do so without doing violence to your individual judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know by experience in dealing with collective decisions, because I have sat, for example, on the Court of Appeals many times and then it is three judges deciding, that the three judges or the many judges may have different views on something.

See id. at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Finally, once these three elements are satisfied, the court may in its discretion take notice of the plain error if it is appropriate to do so.  See id. at 735-37, 113 S.Ct. at 1778-80.   We will address these elements seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the past, we have referred to the Allen charge as the \"dynamite charge\" and noted that it should be used with \"great caution, and only when absolutely necessary.\"  United States v. Flannery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"300190\"><a href=\"/opinion/300190/united-states-v-john-flannery/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 883 (1st Cir.1971).  A defendant may be prejudiced by an Allen charge in a number of ways.  See United States v. Angiulo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"313577\"><a href=\"/opinion/313577/united-states-v-gennaro-j-angiulo/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1973).  Therefore, we have instructed district courts to include three elements in the substance of an Allen charge to ameliorate its potentially prejudicial effect.  See United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1996).  \"A district court should instruct jurors in substance that (1) members of both the majority and the minority should reexamine their positions, (2) a jury has the right to fail to agree, and (3) the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains with the government.\"  Id. We have further instructed trial courts to avoid substantive departures from approved formulations of the Allen charge, and to avoid using language that might heighten its coercive effect.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.   In situations where the substance of these elements was not communicated to the jury, this court has found reversible error without further inquiry.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39-40.   At issue in this case is the second element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court stated that agreement should not come at the cost of doing violence to a juror's independent judgment, and that an indecisive verdict will require a new trial.  While the court determined that it had failed to include in its Allen charge the substance of the jury's right to fail to agree, it indicated that implicit in the charge given was the jury's right to fail to agree.  This court has refrained from offering definite wording for an Allen charge, and in Vachon we held that a court's failure to include the specific language \"a jury has the right to disagree\" did not necessitate a new trial.  See United States v. Vachon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519496\"><a href=\"/opinion/519496/united-states-v-adelard-vachon/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 659 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the case at hand is readily distinguished from Vachon.   Here, the language the court used to communicate the jury's right to fail to agree was insufficient when considered in the coercive context in which it was given, i.e., the jury had already informed the court on three occasions that it could not reach a unanimous verdict.  Moreover, any force behind the implicitly communicated right to fail to agree was negated by the court's other statements in which it was embedded.  The court summarized the \"point\" of the Allen charge given by stating \"if you put all of your 12 minds to work and all of you make an honest effort not to fight with each other, for example, but to honestly listen to each other, I am pretty sure that you will be able to agree on a verdict.\"   This statement inevitably created an atmosphere of coercion that minimized the significance of the positions held by the individual jurors and in effect compelled unanimity.  Referring to a juror's attempts to maintain his or her individual judgment as a \"fight\" undermined the admonition that jurors should not do violence to their individual judgment.  The coercive nature of this language was enhanced by the court's statement that the \"mission\" was to \"try to resolve this case, to decide this case....  That is what the system requires.  That is the only system that we have....  I am going to beg you to go back and give it a try because I am pretty sure that you can.\"   These statements infer that it would be reasonable, perhaps even expected, for the jurors to come to a decision on the evidence submitted, and that our system of justice required and depended on their arriving at such a decision.  Finally, the aura of compulsion was intensified by the court's implicit dissatisfaction with an indecisive verdict.  The court emphasized that the jury's indecision \"is no verdict\" and \"is not going to be the end of this\" and that \"in the long run\" \"I will have to simply try this case again.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements in the context in which they appear run counter to our instruction that \"in all events, the court should be careful to ... avoid language which might heighten\" the coercive effect of an Allen charge.  Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39.   This court has expressly disapproved of statements that \"directly imply[ ] that it would be reasonable for the jury to reach a decision on the evidence before them.\"  Id. (disapproving court's statements to jury (1) about expense of trial, (2) that court did not want to try case again, and (3) that case was not very difficult);  see also Flannery, 451 F.2d at 883 (disapproving court's statement \"the case must at some time be decided.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, because the jury's weakly enunciated right to deliver an indecisive verdict was closely intertwined with language that strongly compelled a jury agreement, the charge failed to communicate adequately the substance of the jury's right to fail to agree.  We therefore find that the lower court's determination that its instruction was legally insufficient was correct under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government fails in its attempt to characterize the trial court's order for a new trial as being premised solely upon the court's failure to state expressly that the jury had a \"right to fail to agree.\"   The trial court's order focused on the First Circuit's requirement that \"the substance of the jury's right\" be communicated.  The court found that it had \"failed to communicate the notion that the jury has a 'right' to deliver an inconclusive verdict,\" and that the charge lacked \"complete accuracy in communicating the extent of the jury's obligations and rights.\"   Second, given the facts of this case, we disagree with the government's contention that the defendant's failure to object in a timely manner indicates the charge was not in error.  The parties were not provided with a copy of the draft pattern charge.  Immediately after the jury was excused, the court said to the parties \"[b]efore you say anything, let me say this ...\" and informed the parties that the instruction given was a proposed pattern Allen charge that the First Circuit was considering for publication.  We agree with the district court that the failure of the parties to object was understandable in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Clarity of the Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second requirement of Rule 52(b) is that the error be plain or clear.  Here, the court's error in its instruction constituted clear error under current law.  We established as early as 1973 that the failure to instruct the jury on the substance of the three elements was reversible error, without further inquiry as to the coerciveness of the charge.  See Angiulo, 485 F.2d at 39-40.   The error committed by the trial court is therefore \"plain error\" under Rule 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Substantial Rights Affected</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we must address the third requirement of Rule 52(b), whether the plain error affected substantial rights.  In most instances, this requires that the error be prejudicial.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. at 1777-78.   Here, the jury sent three notes to the court over a six hour period indicating that the jury was deadlocked, and ultimately suggested that the jury be allowed to \"retire.\"   A reasonable inference is that the jurors were divided and deeply entrenched in their opinions.  The court then instructed the jury with the Allen charge at issue, using language that we have found to be coercive in the context in which it was given.  The jury returned its verdict approximately an hour and forty minutes later.  Its verdict was split.  It acquitted the defendant of the substantive charge, but convicted the defendant of the conspiracy charge.  The district court found it likely that the modified Allen charge \"intimated [the jury] into a decision\" and \"tainted this jury's deliberation.\"   The trial court's findings on the prejudicial effect of the Allen are entitled to deference, and we find them to be reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues, however, that the verdict was free from undue influence, and that the charge did not have a prejudicial effect on the defendant.  It asserts that the verdict was not inconsistent, and that the court erred when it considered the inconsistency of the verdict as evidence of coercion.  Although an inconsistent verdict in itself is not grounds to vacate a conviction, see Dunn v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101833\"><a href=\"/opinion/101833/dunn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101833\"><a href=\"/opinion/101833/dunn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span> (1932), an inconsistent verdict can be probative of whether a jury was confused or coerced into rendering a compromise verdict, see United States v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747184\"><a href=\"/opinion/747184/united-states-v-errol-eugene-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 513-14 (6th Cir.1997) (considering alleged inconsistent verdict as evidence of jury confusion);  Hafner v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597828\"><a href=\"/opinion/597828/mark-r-hafner-v-david-brown-gary-reininger-jonathan-pease-terry-ressin/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 575 (4th Cir.1992) (\"If the district judge concludes that an inconsistent verdict reflects jury confusion or uncertainty, he or she has the duty to clarify the law governing the case and resubmit the verdict for a jury decision.\")   Furthermore, we do not disagree with the district court that \"given the nature of the evidence in this case, the logical verdicts would have been that [the defendant] was guilty of both the substantive charge and the conspiracy charge or that he was innocent of both charges.\"   To bolster its contentions, the government again argues that neither party objected to the charge, an issue we have already addressed supra, and need not revisit.  Finally, the government urges that the polling of the jurors failed to indicate any coercion.  Polling is useful to indicate an irregularity in a verdict.  See Siverson v. O'Leary, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453537\"><a href=\"/opinion/453537/charles-m-siverson-v-michael-oleary-and-neil-f-hartigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span>, 1219-20 (7th Cir.1985).  However, the failure of a poll to indicate coercion is not conclusive as to whether coercion actually existed.  See Manning, 79 F.3d at 223 (in open court, after jury had reached verdict, asking \"juror to admit before his fellow jurors that he had voted against his will was asking too much.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Miscarriage of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the three elements required by Rule 52(b) are therefore satisfied in this case.  However, Rule 52(b) is discretionary.  Even when plain error is found that affects substantial rights, a reviewing court must determine whether the error \" 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings' \" before exercise of its discretion is appropriate.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span> (1997).  Under this standard, a reviewing court should exercise its discretion when failure to take notice of the error would result in a miscarriage of justice.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1778-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government's case relied upon the testimony of a cooperating witness.  The trial court found the credibility of this witness to be \"substantially compromised by impeachment through cross examination and by the testimony of a probation officer.\"   The court determined that it was likely this led to the \"severe deadlock broken only by the Allen charge\" which \"intimidated [the jury] into a decision.\"   This court forewarned against this precise situation in Angiulo when we expressed our concern that an Allen charge may prejudice a defendant by depriving the defendant of \"whatever safeguard he might have had in a hung jury [or] a declaration of mistrial.\"  485 F.2d at 39.   In this case the jury verdict may be attributed at least in part to coercion by the court.  We agree with the district court's implicit determination that a failure to order a new trial would result in a miscarriage of justice.

Yet, in order to bring 12 minds to a unanimous result, you must examine the questions submitted to you with an open mind and with proper regard for, and deference to, the opinion of your fellow jurors.</p>\n        <p>In conferring together you ought to pay proper respect to each other's opinions and you ought to listen with a mind open to being convinced by each other's arguments.  Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors favoring acquittal should consider whether a doubt in their own mind is a reasonable one when it makes no impression upon the minds of the other equally honest and intelligent jurors who have heard the same evidence with the same degree of attention and with the same desire to arrive at the truth under the sanction of the same oath.</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, jurors favoring conviction ought seriously to ask themselves whether they should not distrust the weight or sufficiency of evidence which fails to dispel reasonable doubt in the minds of their fellow jurors.</p>\n        <p>Not only should jurors in the minority re-examine their positions, but jurors in the majority should do so also, to see whether they have given careful consideration and sufficient weight to the evidence that has favorably impressed the persons in disagreement with them.</p>\n        <p>Burden of proof is a legal tool for helping you decide.  The law imposes upon the prosecution a high burden of proof.  The prosecution has the burden to establish, with respect to each count, each essential element of the offense, and to establish that essential element beyond a reasonable doubt.  And if with respect to any element of any count you are left in reasonable doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of such doubt and must be acquitted.</p>\n        <p>It is your duty to decide the case, if you can conscientiously do so without violence to your individual judgment.  It is also your duty to return a verdict on any counts as to which all of you agree, even if you cannot agree on all counts.  But if you cannot agree, it is your right to fail to agree.</p>\n        <p>I now instruct you to go back and resume your deliberations.</p>\n        <p>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions Drafting Committee, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit, \"Charge to a Hung Jury,\" Part 6.06 (discussion draft later adopted without significant revision).</p>\n        <p>This charge was contained in a discussion draft prepared by the Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions Drafting Committee.  At the First Circuit Judicial Conference held on October 1, 1997, the federal judges present voted to approve publication of the final version of the pattern instructions with the following caveat appearing in the Preface:</p>\n        <p>Although we believe that the pattern instructions and, in particular, the commentary that accompanies them will be helpful in crafting a jury charge in a particular case, it bears emphasis that no district judge is required to use the pattern instructions, and that the Court of Appeals has not in any way approved the use of a particular instruction.</p>\n        <p>Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions Drafting Committee, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit, Preface (visited Dec. 17, 1997) http://www.med.circ1.dcn/crpji/crpjitext.htm.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 states in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.</p>\n        <p>Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, a party waives an objection to a jury instruction if the party fails to enter the objection into the record after the judge has instructed the jury but before the jury retires to deliberate.
