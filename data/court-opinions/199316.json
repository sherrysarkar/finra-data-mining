The district court ordered a law\n\nfirm, Dickstein, Shapiro, Morin & Oshinsky, LLP (\"Dickstein\"),\n\nnot   itself   a    party    to   the    underlying       action,    to    produce\n\ndocuments    that    the    appellants,       Ogden    Corporation     and    Ogden\n\nMartin Systems of Haverhill, Inc. (collectively, \"Ogden\"), claim\n\nare within the attorney-client privilege.                 The appellee, Federal\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), asserts that the so-\n\ncalled \"joint client exception\" trumps the privilege and, thus,\n\nlegitimates    the    order.      After       providing    necessary      context,\n\nsurmounting    a     jurisdictional           obstacle,     and    charting     the\n\nparameters of both the privilege and the exception, we affirm\n\nthe turnover order.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1978, Citicorp North America, Inc. (\"Citicorp\") and\n\nNew England Merchants Leasing Corp. (\"NEMLC\") formed a general\n\npartnership (\"SBR Associates\") to develop a refuse-to-energy\n\nfacility in Haverhill, Massachusetts.                 Each nominated a wholly-\n\nowned subsidiary to serve as a general partner:                        CIC Omega\n\nLease, Inc., for Citicorp, and NEMLC Alpha, Inc., for NEMLC.                     In\n\nthe early 1980s, the partners (hereinafter, with their parents\n\nand   successors,     sometimes     collectively          called   \"the    banks\")\n\ndesigned and built the facility and leased it to an independent\n\noperator, Refuse Fuels, Inc. (\"RFI\"), on condition that RFI\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpurchase    insurance     policies       (\"the       efficacy    insurance\")       to\n\nprotect against operational glitches leading to shortfalls in\n\nrevenue.\n\n            The hedge proved prudent; from the moment that the\n\nfacility went on line, it was plagued with problems.                          In an\n\neffort to protect their investment, the banks terminated the\n\narrangement with RFI and brought Ogden into the venture.                         The\n\ndetails of the transaction are unimportant at this juncture,\n\nsave   to   say    that   by    virtue    of     a    series     of    complicated\n\nagreements,       Ogden   acquired     the       banks'    interests        in   SBR\n\nAssociates and assumed sole control of the business on December\n\n23, 1986.\n\n            The     operational    difficulties           that     the      facility\n\nencountered       had   given   rise     to    claims     under       the   efficacy\n\ninsurance, and the parties sought to tie up this loose end.\n\nThey entered into a specific agreement (\"the restated assignment\n\nagreement\") with regard to those claims.                Under that agreement,\n\nOgden was to direct the recovery effort against the efficacy\n\ninsurers and pay portions of the realized proceeds (net of fees\n\nand expenses) to the banks.        Betimes, Ogden would keep the banks\n\napprised    of    progress.     Finally,       the     agreement       contained    a\n\nmechanism whereby the banks could redeem Ogden's interest and\n\ntake direct control of the recovery effort should Ogden wish to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconsummate a settlement with the efficacy insurers that the\n\nbanks deemed unacceptable.\n\n           Ogden retained Dickstein to handle the claims against\n\nthe efficacy insurers.         Meanwhile, it continued to operate the\n\nHaverhill facility, incurring additional losses (which furnished\n\na basis for further insurance claims).           The facility shut down\n\nsometime in 1990.    On January 6, 1991, NEMLC's parent company,\n\nBank of New England, N.A., was adjudged insolvent, and the FDIC\n\nwas appointed as receiver (thus becoming, in effect, successor\n\nin interest to NEMLC and NEMLC Alpha).\n\n           By mid-1996, Dickstein had recovered $18,700,000 from\n\nthe efficacy insurers.         On August 2, 1996, a Dickstein partner,\n\nLeslie   Cohen,   wrote   to    the   banks,   notifying   them   of   their\n\nallocable shares of the funds collected.           Both Citicorp and the\n\nFDIC protested the proposed allocation, arguing that they were\n\nbeing shortchanged and that the terms of the restated assignment\n\nagreement were not being followed.          Each demanded substantially\n\nmore money.1 Ogden balked. Dickstein continued to prosecute the\n\nunderlying litigation — at the time the parties submitted their\n\nappellate briefs, the total amounts recovered on the insurance\n\n\n    1The crux of the dispute appears to be whether, under the\nrestated assignment agreement, the parties are to share only the\nproceeds of claims accrued against the efficacy insurance as of\nthe closing date of their transaction, or also the proceeds of\nclaims that arose thereafter.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fclaims exceeded $60,000,000 — but it refused to become entangled\n\nin the internecine squabble over the allocation of the proceeds.\n\n          Citicorp and the FDIC sued Ogden in the district court\n\nfor breach of contract and unfair business practices.                   In due\n\ncourse, the FDIC served Dickstein with a subpoena duces tecum\n\nthat, inter alia, commanded production of communications between\n\nit and Ogden.     Dickstein objected, citing the attorney-client\n\nprivilege.      The    FDIC    moved   to     compel,   contending     that    no\n\nprivilege attached because Dickstein had represented Ogden and\n\nthe banks jointly in connection with the litigation against the\n\nefficacy insurers.       The district court granted this motion by\n\nendorsement.    Ogden appealed the order, and the district court\n\nstayed production pending resolution of the appeal.\n\nII.   APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          There   is    a     threshold      issue   here.     Ogden   premises\n\nappellate jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which provides for\n\njurisdiction    over    appeals    taken      from   \"final\"   decisions      and\n\norders of the district courts.          Since the order from which Ogden\n\npurports to appeal does not conclude the litigation on the\n\nmerits, it is not final in the stereotypical sense.                See United\n\nStates v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).   Nevertheless, some orders that do not themselves end\n\nlitigation are deemed final (and thus immediately appealable)\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\funder the collateral order doctrine.       See Cohen v. Beneficial\n\nIndus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546-47 (1949).\n\n         To   qualify   for   this    sanctuary,   an   order   must\n\nconclusively resolve an important question distinct from the\n\nmerits and yet be unreviewable, as a practical matter, in a\n\nconventional end-of-case appeal.       See Cunningham v. Hamilton\n\nCounty, 119 S. Ct. 1915, 1920 (1999); Swint v. Chambers County\n\nComm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 42 (1995).      The compass of this exception\n\nis \"narrow,\" Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 712\n\n(1996), and discovery orders generally are not thought to come\n\nwithin it.2   See Insurers Syndicate for the Joint Underwriting\n\nof Medico-Hosp. Prof'l Liab. Ins. v. Garcia, 864 F.2d 208, 210\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n         One reason that most discovery orders do not fall\n\nwithin the collateral order exception is because they do not\n\nmeet the \"otherwise effectively unreviewable\" requirement; the\n\n\n\n    2 At an earlier stage of this litigation, the FDIC filed a\nrequest for production of documents in Ogden's possession\nrelating to the efficacy insurance litigation. See Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 34. Ogden objected to furnishing communications between it\nand Dickstein, asserting attorney-client privilege.     The FDIC\nmoved to compel production, and the district court granted the\nmotion. We dismissed Ogden's attempted appeal without prejudice\nfor want of appellate jurisdiction (though the disputed\ndocuments have yet to be produced). This is a perfect example\nof a discovery order that is not immediately appealable: Ogden,\nafter all, can refuse to comply with the order and thus invite\na finding of contempt (or some equivalent sanction).\n\n                               -7-\n\fparty resisting the discovery order \"can gain the right of\n\nappeal . . . by defying it, being held in contempt, and then\n\nappealing    from      the   contempt   order,   which   would    be   a   final\n\njudgment    as    to   [him].\"     Corporacion     Insular   de   Seguros      v.\n\nGarcia, 876 F.2d 254, 257 (1st Cir. 1989).                   This praxis —\n\ninsisting upon disobedience followed by contempt as a condition\n\nto reviewability — is commonly called the Cobbledick rule.                    See\n\nCobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 328 (1940).                 The rule\n\nserves efficiency interests because it encourages reflection\n\nboth by the party seeking discovery and by the party resisting\n\nit.   See 15B Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 3914.23, at 154 (2d ed. 1992).\n\n            The    rationale     underlying      the   Cobbledick      rule    is\n\ndistorted, however, when a discovery order runs to someone other\n\nthan an adverse party (a phenomenon that occurs when, say, a\n\ncourt enforces a subpoena duces tecum served upon a non-party).\n\nSince a third person \"presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the\n\nproceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance,\" Church of\n\nScientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 18 n.11 (1992), this\n\ncircumstance justifies a different approach.                 Under what has\n\nbeen termed the Perlman rule, a discovery order addressed to a\n\nnon-party sometimes may be treated as an immediately appealable\n\nfinal order vis-à-vis a party who claims to hold an applicable\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fprivilege.    See id.; see also Perlman v. United States, 247 U.S.\n\n7, 12-15 (1918).        Courts frequently have invoked Perlman when a\n\nclient (who is herself a party or a grand jury target) seeks to\n\nappeal an order compelling her attorney (who is neither a party\n\nnor a target) to produce allegedly privileged materials.                     See,\n\ne.g., In re Sealed Case, 146 F.3d 881, 883 (D.C. Cir. 1998); In\n\nre Grand Jury Subpoenas, 123 F.3d 695, 699 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nConkling v. Turner, 883 F.2d 431, 433-34 (5th Cir. 1989); In re\n\nGrand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 731 F.2d 1032, 1036 n.3 (2d\n\nCir. 1984).\n\n            On its face, this appeal appears to fit the classic\n\nPerlman mold:      the FDIC directed a subpoena duces tecum at the\n\nlaw firm (a non-party); the district court enforced the subpoena\n\nand   ordered     the    firm   to    produce    the     disputed    documents;\n\ncompliance with that order will let the cat out of the bag, thus\n\nrendering    an   end-of-case        appeal   nugatory;     and     the   client,\n\nalthough a party to the case, has no way of testing the order by\n\nallowing itself to be held in contempt.                   In this sense, the\n\nclient (Ogden) is at the mercy of its quondam counsel, and an\n\nimmediate appeal offers the only vehicle by which it can gain\n\neffective review of the privilege issue.\n\n            Despite      this   apparent        match,     we     proceed    with\n\ncircumspection.         Some tension exists in our precedents as to\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fwhether the availability of immediate review in cases such as\n\nthis should          be   gauged    by   the Perlman rule or by the more\n\nencompassing Cohen collateral order doctrine.                       In the past few\n\nyears,       two    different      panels    of    this    court    have   furnished\n\ndivergent answers to this question.                   Compare United States v.\n\nBillmyer, 57 F.3d 31, 34 & n.1. (1st Cir. 1995), with In re\n\nGrand Jury Subpoenas, 123 F.3d at 696-99.\n\n                 Although these decisions do not fit tongue in groove,\n\nthe distinction between them does not affect reviewability in\n\nthis case.3 Under either approach, a substantial privilege claim\n\nthat       cannot    effectively     be     tested    by    the    privilege-holder\n\nthrough      a     contemptuous     refusal       ordinarily      will   qualify   for\n\nimmediate review if the claim otherwise would be lost.                          This is\n\nsuch a case.         Moreover (as we shortly shall explain), the scope\n\nof   review        here   essentially       involves       what    are   more   nearly\n\ncategorized as clear-cut questions of law, reviewable no matter\n\nwhether the appeal is viewed through the lens of Cohen or\n\nPerlman.         Thus, Billmyer, fairly read and applied, does not\n\n\n       3\n      The principal difference lies in the fact the Perlman rule\narguably contains no limitation on the scope of review, while\nreview under the collateral order doctrine arguably is limited\nto \"clear-cut legal error\" as opposed to challenges that seek to\ntest either factual determinations or the application of a\nsettled legal rule to the particular facts. Billmyer, 57 F.3d\nat 35. But, as the panel's actions in Billmyer evince, see id.\nat 35-37 (addressing waiver issue on the merits), the scope-of-\nreview limitation is flexible.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fremove the order sub judice from the class of orders that are\n\nimmediately appealable under In re Grand Jury Subpoenas and the\n\nPerlman rubric.4      Consequently, we have jurisdiction to hear and\n\ndetermine Ogden's appeal.\n\nIII.       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              Trial judges enjoy broad discretion in the handling of\n\ninterstitial      matters,   such   as     the   management   of   pretrial\n\ndiscovery.       As a result, an appellate court will intervene in\n\nsuch matters \"only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice,\n\nthat is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly\n\nwrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved\n\nparty.\"      Mack v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179,\n\n186 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n              Ogden invites us to abandon this abuse-of-discretion\n\nstandard in favor of plenary review because the district court\n\ngranted the motion to compel by endorsement, without elaborating\n\nupon its thinking.      We decline the invitation.       Although a lower\n\n\n       4\n      With regard to the tension between Billmyer and In re Grand\nJury Subpoenas, we note that two recent developments favor the\nlatter. Billmyer relied in part on In re Oberkoetter, 612 F.2d\n15 (1st Cir. 1980), a decision that this court subsequently\noverruled in In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 123 F.3d at 697 n.2,\n699. Billmyer likewise relied to some extent on the decision in\nIn re Grand Jury Proceedings, 43 F.3d 966, 969-70 (5th Cir.\n1994), a decision that the Fifth Circuit since has qualified or\nabandoned.   See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 190 F.3d 375, 384\nn.11 (5th Cir. 1999), petition for cert. filed, ___ U.S.L.W. ___\n(U.S. Dec. 20, 1999) (No. 99-1046).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcourt's    elucidation    of   its    reasoning   invariably    eases     the\n\nappellate task, motions often are decided summarily.                We have\n\nthus far refused to insist upon a rigid rule to the contrary.\n\nSee, e.g., Camilo-Robles v.           Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 872 (1999); Domegan v. Fair, 859\n\nF.2d 1059, 1065-66 (1st Cir. 1988).               While it is sometimes\n\nnecessary to remand for specific findings when confronted with\n\nan opaque ruling, see, e.g., Francis v. Goodman, 81 F.3d 5, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 1996); Pearson v. Fair, 808 F.2d 163, 165-67 (1st Cir.\n\n1986) (per curiam), we are aware of no authority that would\n\nallow us automatically to vary the standard of review depending\n\non whether a district court has taken the time to explain its\n\nrationale.    In all events, the question is academic here, as the\n\nrecord    before   us   permits   a   clear   understanding    of   why   the\n\ndistrict court ruled as it did.\n\nIV.   THE MERITS\n\n            In a discovery dispute, the burden to establish an\n\napplicable privilege rests with the party resisting discovery.\n\nSee United States v. Construction Prods. Research, Inc., 73 F.3d\n\n464, 473 (2d Cir. 1996).          If the privilege is established and\n\nthe question becomes whether an exception to it obtains, the\n\ndevoir of persuasion shifts to the proponent of the exception.\n\nSee McMorgan & Co. v. First Cal. Mortgage Co., 931 F. Supp. 699,\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f701 (N.D. Cal. 1996).     We look to Massachusetts law to determine\n\nthe scope of both the asserted privilege and the exception in\n\nthis case.     See Fed. R. Evid. 501; 6 James Wm. Moore et al.,\n\nMoore's Federal Practice § 26.47[4] (3d ed. 1999).              As to\n\nmatters about which the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\nhas not spoken, we take a predictive approach and seek guidance\n\nfrom other persuasive case law, learned treatises, and pertinent\n\npublic policy considerations.      Cf. Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l,\n\nInc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir. 1996) (endorsing such an\n\napproach for use in diversity cases).\n\n          The privilege at issue here — the attorney-client\n\nprivilege — serves important ends.         Its root purpose is \"to\n\nencourage full and frank communication between attorneys and\n\ntheir clients and thereby promote broader public interests in\n\nthe observance of law and administration of justice.\"           Upjohn\n\nCo. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).         The privilege\n\nsprings      from   the   attorney-client     relationship.         In\n\nMassachusetts, such a relationship comes into being \"when (1) a\n\nperson seeks advice or assistance from an attorney, (2) the\n\nadvice or assistance sought pertains to matters within the\n\nattorney's    professional   competence,    and   (3)   the   attorney\n\nexpressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually gives the\n\ndesired advice or assistance.\"      DeVaux v.

Theran, 639 N.E.2d 720, 723 (Mass.\n\n1994).     The     privilege    that   attends    the     attorney-client\n\nrelationship \"extends to all communications made to an attorney\n\nor   counsellor,   duly   qualified    and   authorized    as   such,   and\n\napplied to by the party in that capacity, with a view to obtain\n\nhis advice and opinion in matters of law, in relation to his\n\nlegal rights, duties and obligations.\"           Hatton v. Robinson, 14\n\nPick. 416, 421 (Mass. 1833).\n\n          Despite its venerable provenance, the attorney-client\n\nprivilege is not absolute.      One recognized exception renders the\n\nprivilege inapplicable to disputes between joint clients.               See\n\nBeacon Oil Co. v.       Perelis, 160 N.E. 892, 894 (Mass. 1928).\n\nThus, when a lawyer represents multiple clients having a common\n\ninterest, communications between the lawyer and any one (or\n\nmore) of the clients are privileged as to outsiders but not\n\ninter sese.    See Eureka Inv. Corp. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co.,\n\n743 F.2d 932, 936-38 (D.C. Cir. 1984); 8 John Henry Wigmore,\n\nWigmore on Evidence § 2312 at 603-09 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).\n\nAs one leading treatise explains,\n\n          When two or more persons, each having an\n          interest in some problem, or situation,\n          jointly   consult   an    attorney,   their\n          confidential   communications    with   the\n\n                                  -14-\n\f          attorney, though known to each other, will\n          of course be privileged in a controversy of\n          either or both of the clients with the\n          outside   world,  that   is,   with   parties\n          claiming adversely to both or either of\n          those within the original charmed circle.\n          But it will often happen that the two\n          original clients will fall out between\n          themselves   and   become    engaged   in   a\n          controversy in which the communications at\n          their joint consultation with the lawyer may\n          be vitally material. In such a controversy\n          it   is   clear  that   the    privilege   is\n          inapplicable.\n\n1 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence § 91 at 335-36\n\n(4th ed. 1992).\n\n          In determining whether parties are \"joint clients,\"\n\ncourts may consider multiple factors, including but not limited\n\nto   matters     such   as   payment     arrangements,    allocation     of\n\ndecisionmaking     roles,    requests     for   advice,   attendance     at\n\nmeetings, frequency and content of correspondence, and the like.\n\nSee McMorgan, 931 F. Supp. at 702; In re Colocotronis Tanker\n\nSecs. Litig., 449 F. Supp. 828, 830-32 (S.D.N.Y. 1978); Connelly\n\nv. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., 96 F.R.D. 339, 342 (D. Mass. 1982).\n\nIn   addition,    the   joint   client    exception   presupposes      that\n\ncommunications have been \"made in the course of the attorney's\n\njoint representation of a 'common interest' of the two parties.\"\n\nEureka, 743 F.2d at 937.        The term \"common interest\" typically\n\nentails an identical (or nearly identical) legal interest as\n\nopposed to a merely similar interest.           See, e.g., McMorgan, 931\n\n                                   -15-\n\fF. Supp. at 701; NL Indus. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 144\n\nF.R.D. 225, 230-31 (D.N.J. 1992).           Thus, the proponent of the\n\nexception    must    establish     cooperation      in   fact    toward   the\n\nachievement of a common objective.               See Shamis v. Ambassador\n\nFactors Corp., 34 F. Supp. 2d 879, 893 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).\n\n            In this case, it cannot be gainsaid that Dickstein and\n\nOgden enjoyed an attorney-client relationship in respect to the\n\nwar being waged against the efficacy insurers.                   The record\n\nattests that the banks also were Dickstein's clients in that\n\nstruggle.     They, like Ogden, had a pecuniary interest in the\n\navails of the insurance — interests that were identical in\n\ncharacter (albeit different in amount).                  They, like Ogden,\n\ndesired to press for those proceeds, through litigation if\n\nnecessary.     The banks pooled their interests with Ogden's and\n\nauthorized Ogden to secure the services of a law firm to mount\n\na unified offensive to prosecute their joint claims against the\n\ninsurers.    The assistance that Ogden sought on behalf of itself\n\nand   the   banks   fell   well   within   the    purview   of   Dickstein's\n\nprofessional competence, and Dickstein actually rendered the\n\ndesired services.\n\n            In undertaking the enterprise, Dickstein unequivocally\n\ncommitted itself to joint representation.            When it brought suit\n\nagainst the efficacy insurers it entered an appearance not only\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\ffor Ogden, but also for the wholly-owned subsidiary of NEMLC\n\n(and    it    still    represents   both    in   that    litigation).     These\n\nentries of appearance themselves constitute persuasive evidence\n\nof a joint client relationship.\n\n              Dickstein's subsequent actions confirm that impression.\n\nEarly    on    (in    February   1987),     it   wrote   to   both   NEMLC   and\n\nCiticorp, describing an executive summary of the strategy that\n\nit proposed to pursue on behalf of Ogden and the banks in the\n\nunified      litigation.      The   words    \"ATTORNEY     CLIENT    PRIVILEGED\n\nCOMMUNICATION\" were emblazoned at the head of the first page of\n\neach letter.          The text of the letter sent to NEMLC (which was\n\nmaterially identical to the one sent to Citicorp) stated in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n              This firm has been engaged to represent the\n              beneficiaries of a proposed claim against\n              the   efficacy     insurers    covering   the\n              referenced Project.      We have prepared a\n              substantive Memorandum and Executive Summary\n              detailing our review of the matter and the\n              potential for recovery under the efficacy\n              policies.   Before we provide this material\n              to you, however, in order to protect and\n              maintain its privileged and confidential\n              nature, we need to confirm, and obtain your\n              acknowledgment, that with regard to the\n              proposed efficacy claim, there exists,\n              between   New   England    Merchants  Leasing\n              Corporation (\"NEMLC\") and NEMLC Alpha Inc.\n              on the one hand and this firm on the other,\n              an attorney-client relationship. As you are\n              aware, under the terms of the [restated\n              assignment agreement], NEMLC and NEMLC Alpha\n              Inc. stand to benefit from any recovery from\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            the efficacy insurers.    As such, we have\n            been retained to represent the interests of\n            NEMLC and NEMLC Alpha Inc. as well as all\n            other beneficiaries under the referenced\n            agreements.\n\nThe letter went on to request that the recipient \"acknowledge\n\nthe   applicability       of    the   attorney-client    privilege       to   our\n\nrelationship, and provide assurances that the contents of the\n\nreferenced documents, and any others prepared by this firm, will\n\nbe treated as confidential and not disclosed to anyone who is\n\nnot a 'client' of this firm in this matter.\"                      Finally, the\n\nletter provided a means for signifying the recipient's agreement\n\nto the formation of the attorney-client relationship.                         Both\n\nNEMLC     and   Citicorp       executed   and   returned       copies    of    the\n\nengagement      letters    to    Dickstein, 5   which   then    furnished      the\n\nstrategic assessment to them.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — a\n\nsurfeit of other evidence indicates the existence of a joint\n\nattorney-client relationship.             We offer three examples.             The\n\nrecord     contains   (1)       copious   notes    taken     by    a    Citicorp\n\nrepresentative     during       a   telephone   conference      with    Attorney\n\n\n      5\n     Ogden argues that Dickstein merely intended these\nengagement letters to protect certain documents from discovery\nby the efficacy insurers — but it has cited no respectable\nauthority for this kind of \"limited\" or \"nominal\" attorney-\nclient privilege, and we dismiss the notion out of hand. A law\nfirm that says one thing and induces confidences as a result\ncannot later be heard to profess that it meant another.\n\n                                       -18-\n\fLeveridge (a Dickstein partner) on March 30, 1988, in regard to\n\nlitigation strategy; (2) copies of correspondence from Leveridge\n\nto the banks asking for assistance in responding to discovery\n\nrequests       and    soliciting    suggestions            for    dealing    with     the\n\nefficacy insurers; and (3) a copy of a letter written by a\n\nDickstein       lawyer,     Paul    Taskier,          on     September      16,     1991,\n\nresponding to an inquiry from Citicorp and furnishing a detailed\n\ninterpretation of the allocation provision contained in the\n\nrestated assignment agreement (an interpretation starkly at odds\n\nwith the interpretation that Dickstein urged upon the banks in\n\nAugust of 1996).\n\n            This evidence points clearly and convincingly to a\n\njoint client relationship.          See Bays, 639 N.E.2d at 723; DeVaux,\n\n444 N.E.2d at 357.         The entries of appearance and the engagement\n\nletters alone constitute powerful proof, and the correspondence\n\nevinces    a    coordinated      legal    strategy           sufficient     to    lead   a\n\nreasonable      person     standing      in   NEMLC's        shoes    to    infer   that\n\nDickstein had become its attorney.                    See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at\n\n1265;   Shamis,       34   F.   Supp.    2d   at      893.       Courts    customarily\n\ndetermine       the    existence        vel     non     of       an   attorney-client\n\nrelationship by evaluating whether the putative client's belief\n\nthat such a relationship existed was objectively reasonable\n\nunder all the circumstances.              See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1265;\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fSky Valley L.P. v. ATX Sky Valley, Ltd., 150 F.R.D. 648, 651-52\n\n(N.D.   Cal.   1993).       Here,   the   reasonableness      of    the   banks'\n\nprofessed belief that Dickstein had become their attorney in\n\nregard to the efficacy insurance litigation is manifest.\n\n            Ogden's attempt to persuade us to a different view\n\nlacks force.     It claims that no joint client relationship could\n\nhave been forged because of the uncertainty about the eventual\n\nallocation     of     the   litigation    proceeds.      This      \"intrinsic\"\n\nadversity,     Ogden    says,   destroyed     the   requisite      identity    of\n\ninterests.     See McMorgan, 931 F. Supp. at 701 (explaining that\n\nmere similarity in interests is not enough to establish a joint\n\nclient relationship).\n\n            This argument is spun from whole cloth.           At the crucial\n\ntime — the time when Dickstein and the banks tied the attorney-\n\nclient knot — no one had expressed the view that the allocation\n\nprovision in the restated assignment agreement was inscrutable,\n\nand there was no reason to believe that the beneficiaries of the\n\ninsurance would part company when it came time to divide the\n\nproceeds.       For    aught    that   appeared,    Ogden's     interest      was\n\nentirely congruent with NEMLC's and Citicorp's.                    No more was\n\nexigible:      the mere possibility of a future dispute did not\n\nprevent the formation of a valid joint client relationship.                   See\n\nSky Valley, 150 F.R.D. at 662.\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f              In a related vein, Ogden asseverates that even if a\n\njoint client relationship initially existed, the relationship\n\nwas dissolved once it (and, presumably, Dickstein) realized that\n\nits    interests       had   become    adverse    to    the   banks.          This\n\nasseveration rests on a false premise.               A joint attorney-client\n\nrelationship remains intact until it is expressly terminated or\n\nuntil circumstances arise that readily imply to all the joint\n\nclients that the relationship is over.6              See Flynt v. Brownfield,\n\nBowen & Bally, 882 F.2d 1048, 1051-52 (6th Cir. 1989).                    Here,\n\nthe record reveals no hint of any circumstances existing prior\n\nto Dickstein's August 2, 1996 letter (proposing a particular\n\nallocation of proceeds) from which the banks reasonably could\n\nhave       inferred   that   their    interests   had   become      inimical    to\n\nOgden's.\n\n              In sum, the FDIC has adduced substantial evidence to\n\nsupport      its   assertion   that    Ogden   and    the   banks    sought    and\n\n\n\n       6\n     Contrary to Ogden's importuning, Eureka does not stand for\na different rule. There, the communications at issue were made\nafter the interests of the joint clients diverged and their\nattorney,   aware  of   the  divergence,   undertook   separate\nrepresentation of one client, distinct from the joint\nrepresentation.   See 743 F.2d at 937.     The court's holding\naddresses whether the content of these communications pertained\nto the common interest that formed the basis of the joint\nrepresentation. See id. We decline to read Eureka as holding\nthat a joint client relationship evaporates whenever one client\nunilaterally determines that its interests have diverged from\nthose of its co-clients.\n\n                                       -21-\n\freceived legal advice from Dickstein with regard to a common\n\ninterest     —     the    efficacy       insurance     litigation    —   thereby\n\nestablishing that all three had forged a joint attorney-client\n\nrelationship with Dickstein.              See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1264;\n\nBays, 639 N.E.2d at 723.           Since that relationship remained whole\n\nuntil the banks received Dickstein's letter of August 2, 1996,\n\nthe joint client exception to the attorney-client privilege\n\napplies.         See    Beacon    Oil,   160    N.E.   at   894.    It   follows\n\ninexorably       that    the     claim   of    attorney-client     privilege   is\n\nimpuissant with respect to documents generated on or before\n\nAugust 2, 1996.7\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    7 In its present posture, this appeal requires us only to\npass upon Ogden's global claim of attorney-client privilege. To\nthe extent (if at all) that other grounds for resisting\nproduction attach to particular documents (say, that a given\nitem is wholly unrelated to Dickstein's representation of the\njoint clients' common interest or originated after August 2,\n1996), the district court, in its discretion, may consider those\nobjections and may, if necessary, review specific documents in\ncamera.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f",

The appellee, Federal\n\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), asserts that the so-\n\ncalled \"joint client exception\" trumps the privilege and, thus,\n\nlegitimates    the    order.      After       providing    necessary      context,\n\nsurmounting    a     jurisdictional           obstacle,     and    charting     the\n\nparameters of both the privilege and the exception, we affirm\n\nthe turnover order.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1978, Citicorp North America, Inc. (\"Citicorp\") and\n\nNew England Merchants Leasing Corp. (\"NEMLC\") formed a general\n\npartnership (\"SBR Associates\") to develop a refuse-to-energy\n\nfacility in Haverhill, Massachusetts.                 Each nominated a wholly-\n\nowned subsidiary to serve as a general partner:                        CIC Omega\n\nLease, Inc., for Citicorp, and NEMLC Alpha, Inc., for NEMLC.                     In\n\nthe early 1980s, the partners (hereinafter, with their parents\n\nand   successors,     sometimes     collectively          called   \"the    banks\")\n\ndesigned and built the facility and leased it to an independent\n\noperator, Refuse Fuels, Inc. (\"RFI\"), on condition that RFI\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpurchase    insurance     policies       (\"the       efficacy    insurance\")       to\n\nprotect against operational glitches leading to shortfalls in\n\nrevenue.\n\n            The hedge proved prudent; from the moment that the\n\nfacility went on line, it was plagued with problems.                          In an\n\neffort to protect their investment, the banks terminated the\n\narrangement with RFI and brought Ogden into the venture.                         The\n\ndetails of the transaction are unimportant at this juncture,\n\nsave   to   say    that   by    virtue    of     a    series     of    complicated\n\nagreements,       Ogden   acquired     the       banks'    interests        in   SBR\n\nAssociates and assumed sole control of the business on December\n\n23, 1986.\n\n            The     operational    difficulties           that     the      facility\n\nencountered       had   given   rise     to    claims     under       the   efficacy\n\ninsurance, and the parties sought to tie up this loose end.\n\nThey entered into a specific agreement (\"the restated assignment\n\nagreement\") with regard to those claims.                Under that agreement,\n\nOgden was to direct the recovery effort against the efficacy\n\ninsurers and pay portions of the realized proceeds (net of fees\n\nand expenses) to the banks.        Betimes, Ogden would keep the banks\n\napprised    of    progress.     Finally,       the     agreement       contained    a\n\nmechanism whereby the banks could redeem Ogden's interest and\n\ntake direct control of the recovery effort should Ogden wish to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fconsummate a settlement with the efficacy insurers that the\n\nbanks deemed unacceptable.\n\n           Ogden retained Dickstein to handle the claims against\n\nthe efficacy insurers.         Meanwhile, it continued to operate the\n\nHaverhill facility, incurring additional losses (which furnished\n\na basis for further insurance claims).           The facility shut down\n\nsometime in 1990.    On January 6, 1991, NEMLC's parent company,\n\nBank of New England, N.A., was adjudged insolvent, and the FDIC\n\nwas appointed as receiver (thus becoming, in effect, successor\n\nin interest to NEMLC and NEMLC Alpha).\n\n           By mid-1996, Dickstein had recovered $18,700,000 from\n\nthe efficacy insurers.         On August 2, 1996, a Dickstein partner,\n\nLeslie   Cohen,   wrote   to    the   banks,   notifying   them   of   their\n\nallocable shares of the funds collected.           Both Citicorp and the\n\nFDIC protested the proposed allocation, arguing that they were\n\nbeing shortchanged and that the terms of the restated assignment\n\nagreement were not being followed.          Each demanded substantially\n\nmore money.1 Ogden balked. Dickstein continued to prosecute the\n\nunderlying litigation — at the time the parties submitted their\n\nappellate briefs, the total amounts recovered on the insurance\n\n\n    1The crux of the dispute appears to be whether, under the\nrestated assignment agreement, the parties are to share only the\nproceeds of claims accrued against the efficacy insurance as of\nthe closing date of their transaction, or also the proceeds of\nclaims that arose thereafter.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fclaims exceeded $60,000,000 — but it refused to become entangled\n\nin the internecine squabble over the allocation of the proceeds.\n\n          Citicorp and the FDIC sued Ogden in the district court\n\nfor breach of contract and unfair business practices.                   In due\n\ncourse, the FDIC served Dickstein with a subpoena duces tecum\n\nthat, inter alia, commanded production of communications between\n\nit and Ogden.     Dickstein objected, citing the attorney-client\n\nprivilege.      The    FDIC    moved   to     compel,   contending     that    no\n\nprivilege attached because Dickstein had represented Ogden and\n\nthe banks jointly in connection with the litigation against the\n\nefficacy insurers.       The district court granted this motion by\n\nendorsement.    Ogden appealed the order, and the district court\n\nstayed production pending resolution of the appeal.\n\nII.   APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n          There   is    a     threshold      issue   here.     Ogden   premises\n\nappellate jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which provides for\n\njurisdiction    over    appeals    taken      from   \"final\"   decisions      and\n\norders of the district courts.          Since the order from which Ogden\n\npurports to appeal does not conclude the litigation on the\n\nmerits, it is not final in the stereotypical sense.                See United\n\nStates v.

The FDIC\nmoved to compel production, and the district court granted the\nmotion. We dismissed Ogden's attempted appeal without prejudice\nfor want of appellate jurisdiction (though the disputed\ndocuments have yet to be produced). This is a perfect example\nof a discovery order that is not immediately appealable: Ogden,\nafter all, can refuse to comply with the order and thus invite\na finding of contempt (or some equivalent sanction).\n\n                               -7-\n\fparty resisting the discovery order \"can gain the right of\n\nappeal . . . by defying it, being held in contempt, and then\n\nappealing    from      the   contempt   order,   which   would    be   a   final\n\njudgment    as    to   [him].\"     Corporacion     Insular   de   Seguros      v.\n\nGarcia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524263\"><a href=\"/opinion/524263/corporacion-insular-de-seguros-v-hon-juan-antonio-garcia-appeal-of-dr/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (1st Cir. 1989).                   This praxis —\n\ninsisting upon disobedience followed by contempt as a condition\n\nto reviewability — is commonly called the Cobbledick rule.                    See\n\nCobbledick v.

The rule\n\nserves efficiency interests because it encourages reflection\n\nboth by the party seeking discovery and by the party resisting\n\nit.   See 15B Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure § 3914.23, at 154 (2d ed. 1992).\n\n            The    rationale     underlying      the   Cobbledick      rule    is\n\ndistorted, however, when a discovery order runs to someone other\n\nthan an adverse party (a phenomenon that occurs when, say, a\n\ncourt enforces a subpoena duces tecum served upon a non-party).\n\nSince a third person \"presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the\n\nproceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance,\" Church of\n\nScientology v.

Under what has\n\nbeen termed the Perlman rule, a discovery order addressed to a\n\nnon-party sometimes may be treated as an immediately appealable\n\nfinal order vis-à-vis a party who claims to hold an applicable\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fprivilege.

In this sense, the\n\nclient (Ogden) is at the mercy of its quondam counsel, and an\n\nimmediate appeal offers the only vehicle by which it can gain\n\neffective review of the privilege issue.\n\n            Despite      this   apparent        match,     we     proceed    with\n\ncircumspection.         Some tension exists in our precedents as to\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fwhether the availability of immediate review in cases such as\n\nthis should          be   gauged    by   the Perlman rule or by the more\n\nencompassing Cohen collateral order doctrine.                       In the past few\n\nyears,       two    different      panels    of    this    court    have   furnished\n\ndivergent answers to this question.                   Compare United States v.\n\nBillmyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697654\"><a href=\"/opinion/697654/united-states-v-john-w-billmyer-american-honda-motor-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 & n.1.

This is\n\nsuch a case.         Moreover (as we shortly shall explain), the scope\n\nof   review        here   essentially       involves       what    are   more   nearly\n\ncategorized as clear-cut questions of law, reviewable no matter\n\nwhether the appeal is viewed through the lens of Cohen or\n\nPerlman.         Thus, Billmyer, fairly read and applied, does not\n\n\n       3\n      The principal difference lies in the fact the Perlman rule\narguably contains no limitation on the scope of review, while\nreview under the collateral order doctrine arguably is limited\nto \"clear-cut legal error\" as opposed to challenges that seek to\ntest either factual determinations or the application of a\nsettled legal rule to the particular facts. Billmyer, 57 F.3d\nat 35. But, as the panel's actions in Billmyer evince, see id.\nat 35-37 (addressing waiver issue on the merits), the scope-of-\nreview limitation is flexible.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fremove the order sub judice from the class of orders that are\n\nimmediately appealable under In re Grand Jury Subpoenas and the\n\nPerlman rubric.4      Consequently, we have jurisdiction to hear and\n\ndetermine Ogden's appeal.\n\nIII.

As a result, an appellate court will intervene in\n\nsuch matters \"only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice,\n\nthat is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly\n\nwrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved\n\nparty.\"      Mack v.

The record\n\nattests that the banks also were Dickstein's clients in that\n\nstruggle.     They, like Ogden, had a pecuniary interest in the\n\navails of the insurance — interests that were identical in\n\ncharacter (albeit different in amount).                  They, like Ogden,\n\ndesired to press for those proceeds, through litigation if\n\nnecessary.     The banks pooled their interests with Ogden's and\n\nauthorized Ogden to secure the services of a law firm to mount\n\na unified offensive to prosecute their joint claims against the\n\ninsurers.    The assistance that Ogden sought on behalf of itself\n\nand   the   banks   fell   well   within   the    purview   of   Dickstein's\n\nprofessional competence, and Dickstein actually rendered the\n\ndesired services.\n\n            In undertaking the enterprise, Dickstein unequivocally\n\ncommitted itself to joint representation.            When it brought suit\n\nagainst the efficacy insurers it entered an appearance not only\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\ffor Ogden, but also for the wholly-owned subsidiary of NEMLC\n\n(and    it    still    represents   both    in   that    litigation).     These\n\nentries of appearance themselves constitute persuasive evidence\n\nof a joint client relationship.\n\n              Dickstein's subsequent actions confirm that impression.\n\nEarly    on    (in    February   1987),     it   wrote   to   both   NEMLC   and\n\nCiticorp, describing an executive summary of the strategy that\n\nit proposed to pursue on behalf of Ogden and the banks in the\n\nunified      litigation.      The   words    \"ATTORNEY     CLIENT    PRIVILEGED\n\nCOMMUNICATION\" were emblazoned at the head of the first page of\n\neach letter.          The text of the letter sent to NEMLC (which was\n\nmaterially identical to the one sent to Citicorp) stated in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n              This firm has been engaged to represent the\n              beneficiaries of a proposed claim against\n              the   efficacy     insurers    covering   the\n              referenced Project.      We have prepared a\n              substantive Memorandum and Executive Summary\n              detailing our review of the matter and the\n              potential for recovery under the efficacy\n              policies.   Before we provide this material\n              to you, however, in order to protect and\n              maintain its privileged and confidential\n              nature, we need to confirm, and obtain your\n              acknowledgment, that with regard to the\n              proposed efficacy claim, there exists,\n              between   New   England    Merchants  Leasing\n              Corporation (\"NEMLC\") and NEMLC Alpha Inc.\n              on the one hand and this firm on the other,\n              an attorney-client relationship. As you are\n              aware, under the terms of the [restated\n              assignment agreement], NEMLC and NEMLC Alpha\n              Inc. stand to benefit from any recovery from\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            the efficacy insurers.    As such, we have\n            been retained to represent the interests of\n            NEMLC and NEMLC Alpha Inc. as well as all\n            other beneficiaries under the referenced\n            agreements.\n\nThe letter went on to request that the recipient \"acknowledge\n\nthe   applicability       of    the   attorney-client    privilege       to   our\n\nrelationship, and provide assurances that the contents of the\n\nreferenced documents, and any others prepared by this firm, will\n\nbe treated as confidential and not disclosed to anyone who is\n\nnot a 'client' of this firm in this matter.\"                      Finally, the\n\nletter provided a means for signifying the recipient's agreement\n\nto the formation of the attorney-client relationship.                         Both\n\nNEMLC     and   Citicorp       executed   and   returned       copies    of    the\n\nengagement      letters    to    Dickstein, 5   which   then    furnished      the\n\nstrategic assessment to them.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — a\n\nsurfeit of other evidence indicates the existence of a joint\n\nattorney-client relationship.             We offer three examples.             The\n\nrecord     contains   (1)       copious   notes    taken     by    a    Citicorp\n\nrepresentative     during       a   telephone   conference      with    Attorney\n\n\n      5\n     Ogden argues that Dickstein merely intended these\nengagement letters to protect certain documents from discovery\nby the efficacy insurers — but it has cited no respectable\nauthority for this kind of \"limited\" or \"nominal\" attorney-\nclient privilege, and we dismiss the notion out of hand. A law\nfirm that says one thing and induces confidences as a result\ncannot later be heard to profess that it meant another.\n\n                                       -18-\n\fLeveridge (a Dickstein partner) on March 30, 1988, in regard to\n\nlitigation strategy; (2) copies of correspondence from Leveridge\n\nto the banks asking for assistance in responding to discovery\n\nrequests       and    soliciting    suggestions            for    dealing    with     the\n\nefficacy insurers; and (3) a copy of a letter written by a\n\nDickstein       lawyer,     Paul    Taskier,          on     September      16,     1991,\n\nresponding to an inquiry from Citicorp and furnishing a detailed\n\ninterpretation of the allocation provision contained in the\n\nrestated assignment agreement (an interpretation starkly at odds\n\nwith the interpretation that Dickstein urged upon the banks in\n\nAugust of 1996).\n\n            This evidence points clearly and convincingly to a\n\njoint client relationship.          See Bays, 639 N.E.2d at 723; DeVaux,\n\n444 N.E.2d at 357.         The entries of appearance and the engagement\n\nletters alone constitute powerful proof, and the correspondence\n\nevinces    a    coordinated      legal    strategy           sufficient     to    lead   a\n\nreasonable      person     standing      in   NEMLC's        shoes    to    infer   that\n\nDickstein had become its attorney.                    See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at\n\n1265;   Shamis,       34   F.   Supp.    2d   at      893.       Courts    customarily\n\ndetermine       the    existence        vel     non     of       an   attorney-client\n\nrelationship by evaluating whether the putative client's belief\n\nthat such a relationship existed was objectively reasonable\n\nunder all the circumstances.              See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1265;\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fSky Valley L.P. v.

Cal.   1993).       Here,   the   reasonableness      of    the   banks'\n\nprofessed belief that Dickstein had become their attorney in\n\nregard to the efficacy insurance litigation is manifest.\n\n            Ogden's attempt to persuade us to a different view\n\nlacks force.     It claims that no joint client relationship could\n\nhave been forged because of the uncertainty about the eventual\n\nallocation     of     the   litigation    proceeds.      This      \"intrinsic\"\n\nadversity,     Ogden    says,   destroyed     the   requisite      identity    of\n\ninterests.     See McMorgan, 931 F. Supp. at 701 (explaining that\n\nmere similarity in interests is not enough to establish a joint\n\nclient relationship).\n\n            This argument is spun from whole cloth.           At the crucial\n\ntime — the time when Dickstein and the banks tied the attorney-\n\nclient knot — no one had expressed the view that the allocation\n\nprovision in the restated assignment agreement was inscrutable,\n\nand there was no reason to believe that the beneficiaries of the\n\ninsurance would part company when it came time to divide the\n\nproceeds.       For    aught    that   appeared,    Ogden's     interest      was\n\nentirely congruent with NEMLC's and Citicorp's.                    No more was\n\nexigible:      the mere possibility of a future dispute did not\n\nprevent the formation of a valid joint client relationship.                   See\n\nSky Valley, 150 F.R.D. at 662.\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f              In a related vein, Ogden asseverates that even if a\n\njoint client relationship initially existed, the relationship\n\nwas dissolved once it (and, presumably, Dickstein) realized that\n\nits    interests       had   become    adverse    to    the   banks.          This\n\nasseveration rests on a false premise.               A joint attorney-client\n\nrelationship remains intact until it is expressly terminated or\n\nuntil circumstances arise that readily imply to all the joint\n\nclients that the relationship is over.6              See Flynt v. Brownfield,\n\nBowen & Bally, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1051-52 (6th Cir. 1989).                    Here,\n\nthe record reveals no hint of any circumstances existing prior\n\nto Dickstein's August 2, 1996 letter (proposing a particular\n\nallocation of proceeds) from which the banks reasonably could\n\nhave       inferred   that   their    interests   had   become      inimical    to\n\nOgden's.\n\n              In sum, the FDIC has adduced substantial evidence to\n\nsupport      its   assertion   that    Ogden   and    the   banks    sought    and\n\n\n\n       6\n     Contrary to Ogden's importuning, Eureka does not stand for\na different rule. There, the communications at issue were made\nafter the interests of the joint clients diverged and their\nattorney,   aware  of   the  divergence,   undertook   separate\nrepresentation of one client, distinct from the joint\nrepresentation.   See 743 F.2d at 937.     The court's holding\naddresses whether the content of these communications pertained\nto the common interest that formed the basis of the joint\nrepresentation. See id. We decline to read Eureka as holding\nthat a joint client relationship evaporates whenever one client\nunilaterally determines that its interests have diverged from\nthose of its co-clients.\n\n                                       -21-\n\freceived legal advice from Dickstein with regard to a common\n\ninterest     —     the    efficacy       insurance     litigation    —   thereby\n\nestablishing that all three had forged a joint attorney-client\n\nrelationship with Dickstein.              See Sheinkopf, 927 F.2d at 1264;\n\nBays, 639 N.E.2d at 723.           Since that relationship remained whole\n\nuntil the banks received Dickstein's letter of August 2, 1996,\n\nthe joint client exception to the attorney-client privilege\n\napplies.         See    Beacon    Oil,   160    N.E.   at   894.    It   follows\n\ninexorably       that    the     claim   of    attorney-client     privilege   is\n\nimpuissant with respect to documents generated on or before\n\nAugust 2, 1996.7\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    7 In its present posture, this appeal requires us only to\npass upon Ogden's global claim of attorney-client privilege. To\nthe extent (if at all) that other grounds for resisting\nproduction attach to particular documents (say, that a given\nitem is wholly unrelated to Dickstein's representation of the\njoint clients' common interest or originated after August 2,\n1996), the district court, in its discretion, may consider those\nobjections and may, if necessary, review specific documents in\ncamera.\n\n                                         -22-\n\f</pre>",
