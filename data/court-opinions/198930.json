Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Selya, Boudin, and Lynch,\n\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n   David M. Lipman, with whom Karen E. Lipman and Lipman & Katz, P.A.\nwere on brief, for appellant.\n    Mark K. McDonough, with whom Cuddy & Lanham was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                           May 16, 2000\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       In   this   diversity action the\n\ndistrict court entered summary judgment against Lilia Twombly, an\n\nAmeriCorps participant, on her breach of contract claims against her\n\nAmeriCorps contracting agency, the Association of Farmworker\n\nOpportunity Programs (AFOP). Twombly claimed that AFOP failed to\n\nprovide her with \"health and medical coverage\" and \"worker's\n\ncompensation\" as recited in her contract. We affirm summary judgment\n\non the health coverage claim and reverse on the workers' compensation\n\nclaim. Resolution of the latter claim involves exploration of the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts provisions excusing performance\n\nbecause of impracticability caused by governmental regulation.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Twombly had a contract with AFOP to run pesticide safety\n\nprograms for farm workers from January 8, 1995, through December 15,\n\n1995. On March 23, 1995, she executed a two page contract with AFOP,\n\nunder which AFOP agreed to provide her with a stipend and benefits\n\nincluding \"health and medical coverage, child care if needed, [and]\n\nworker's compensation.\" AFOP enrolled her in a health insurance policy\n\nissued by Allianz/SRC, which had a maximum payout of $10,000. AFOP\n\npaid 85% of the premiums; the Training and Development Corporation\n\n(TDC), the host agency for AFOP in Maine, paid the remaining 15%.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          For her part, Twombly provided the services she was required\n\nto provide under the contract. Participants such as Twombly had full-\n\ntime work assignments averaging 40 hours per week and were paid\n\nstipends at an annual rate of $7,650 in exchange for their service.\n\nTwombly was the single parent of a seven-year-old child and relied on\n\nAFOP's promises to provide health insurance and workers' compensation.\n\n          On June 16, 1995, Twombly was in a serious automobile\n\naccident on Interstate 95 while heading back from a training\n\ndemonstration in Houlton, Maine. She suffered severe injuries that\n\nresulted in a substantial loss of physical and mental functioning. The\n\nhealth insurer paid out the $10,000 maximum. Twombly's plight is\n\ndescribed in another opinion arising out of her accident. See Twombly\n\nv. AIG Life Ins. Co., 199 F.3d 20, 21-23 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          In 1997, Twombly filed an application for workers'\n\ncompensation with the Maine Workers' Compensation Board. On October\n\n28, 1998, the Board dismissed the petition against AFOP. As to AFOP,\n\nthe Board concluded that while Twombly was AFOP's employee under Maine\n\nworkers' compensation law, Maine law was preempted by the National and\n\nCommunity Service Act of 1990 (NCSA), 42 U.S.C. § 12501 et seq. The\n\nNCSA states that an AmeriCorps participant such as Twombly \"shall not\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbe considered to be an employee of the program in which the participant\n\nis enrolled.\"     Id. § 12511 (17).1    Twombly then brought this suit.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          At the trial court, Twombly argued that the contract was\n\nambiguous as to the scope of the health insurance AFOP was required to\n\nprovide. She also said that resolution of the ambiguity required\n\nreference to certain federal minimum standards, specifically those\n\nunder the NCSA.    The relevant provision states:\n\n                  A State or other recipient of assistance\n          under section 12571 of this title shall provide\n          a basic health care policy for each full-time\n          participant in a national service program carried\n          out or supported using the assistance, if the\n          participant is not otherwise covered by a health\n          care policy. Not more than 85 percent of the\n          cost of a premium shall be provided by the\n          [Corporation for National and Community Service\n          (CNCS)], with the remaining cost paid by the\n          entity receiving assistance under section 12571\n          of this title. The [CNCS] shall establish\n          minimum standards that all plans must meet in\n          order to qualify for payment under this part, any\n          circumstances in which an alternative health care\n          policy may be substituted for the basic health\n          care policy, and mechanisms to prohibit\n          participants from dropping existing coverage.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12594(d)(1) (emphasis added); see also 45 C.F.R.\n\n§ 2522.250(b) (requiring grantees to provide eligible participants with\n\nminimum health benefits).\n\n\n\n\n     1    The Board denied the petition against TDC on the ground that\nTwombly was not an employee of TDC.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            The district court concluded that the phrase \"health and\n\nmedical coverage\" was unambiguous and that Twombly was in fact provided\n\nthe health insurance required by the contract, so AFOP did not breach\n\nthe contract. The district court determined that the NCSA had no\n\nbearing on whether the contract was ambiguous, and that any failure to\n\ncomply with the CNCS minimum standard may or may not give rise to a\n\ncause of action, but that that was a separate matter from breach of\n\ncontract.\n\n            In response to Twombly's claim for workers' compensation,\n\nAFOP argued that the claim for workers' compensation was both barred by\n\nres judicata and preempted by federal law. AFOP also argued that its\n\nperformance was excused because of legal impossibility. The court\n\nrested its grant of summary judgment for AFOP on the last ground,\n\nfinding that under § 264 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts there\n\nwas an intervention of federal law that made performance impracticable\n\nand therefore discharged any duty.      See Restatement (Second) of\n\nContracts § 264 cmt. a (1981).    The district court also relied on\n\nAmerican Mercantile Exchange v. Blunt, 66 A. 212 (Me. 1906), in\n\nreaching this conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          Our review on summary judgment is de novo. See National\n\nForeign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38, 49 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ngranted, 120 S. Ct. 525 (1999). On appeal, Twombly argues that AFOP\n\nwas not entitled to summary judgment. She says that the district court\n\nerred in finding the contract unambiguous as it related to health\n\ncoverage and granting AFOP summary judgment on the issue. Twombly also\n\nargues that AFOP contracted to provide her with workers' compensation,\n\neither under the state system or through private purchase of equivalent\n\ncoverage, and that performance of this obligation was not excused.\n\nA. Health Insurance\n\n          Twombly argues that the district court did not apply the\n\nprinciple that a contract is construed against the drafter; in any\n\nevent, she says, the contract is ambiguous as to the scope of the\n\npromise to provide health insurance, and she was entitled to discovery\n\non what AFOP intended the phrase \"health and medical coverage\" to mean.\n\nShe says typical health insurance policies do not contain dollar\n\nlimits, and the policy that AFOP provided did not comply with the\n\nfederal requirements for AmeriCorps Programs. AFOP says, supported by\n\naffidavit, that its minimal health policy was in compliance with\n\nfederal law regulating AmeriCorps, and that, in fact, the insurance was\n\nexactly what was arranged for and recommended by AmeriCorps.\n\n          The question whether contractual terms are ambiguous is,\n\nunder Maine law, initially a matter of law for the court.          See\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fFitzgerald v. Gamester, 658 A.2d 1065, 1069 (Me. 1995). This case\n\ncomes to us on summary judgment, and so the question of contractual\n\nmeaning has a factual context.\n\n          We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the health\n\ninsurance claim.    The payment of $10,000 in benefits met AFOP's\n\ncontractual obligation to provide health and medical coverage. There\n\nmay be extreme cases where the health coverage provided is so minimal,\n\nsay $1 worth of coverage, that it cannot be said to comply with the\n\nobligation to provide health insurance. But that is not this case.\n\nFurther, the federal regulations required AFOP to provide \"minimum\"\n\nhealth benefits as determined by the CNCS, and the policy met that\n\ndefinition. See 45 C.F.R. § 2522.250(b). The defendants produced\n\nundisputed evidence that the insurance provided was exactly what the\n\nCNCS, which was responsible for setting the minimum benefits, arranged\n\nfor and recommended.2\n\nB. Workers' Compensation\n\n          The district court erred, Twombly argues, in granting summary\n\njudgment on the workers' compensation claim and in relying on\n\nRestatement § 264. She also says it was possible for AFOP to perform\n\neven if the state denied benefits. AFOP, she points out, could have\n\n\n     2     Twombly says that her requested discovery was restricted by\nthe district court. This is true, but most of the discovery sought was\nirrelevant to this issue. The defendant's affidavit -- establishing\nthat AFOP complied with what CNCS recommended -- was filed in support\nof the summary judgment motion, and plaintiff did not contest the fact\nasserted or seek discovery on this specific issue. We take this fact\nas undisputed.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fpurchased the equivalent of workers' compensation insurance to meet its\n\nobligations. The fact that AFOP purchased a workers' compensation-like\n\npolicy from AIG, see Twombly, 199 F.3d at 21-22, is evidence, Twombly\n\nclaims, of AFOP's intent that she be provided with such benefits.3 If\n\nAFOP's obligation were meant to be limited, Twombly says, then the\n\ncontract would have said \"worker's compensation to the extent provided\n\nby law.\" Finally, Twombly says that since the Workers' Compensation\n\nBoard determined it did not have jurisdiction, there is no res judicata\n\neffect because there was no adjudication on the merits.\n\n           AFOP says, citing 4 Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen's\n\nCompensation § 87.73 (1989), that if it were the intent of the parties\n\nthat AFOP privately purchase the equivalent of workers' compensation,\n\nthen the contract should have explicitly said so and referred to a\n\nscale of benefits. Further, AFOP claims that Twombly showed that she\n\ninterpreted the contract to mean the standard state-operated system by\n\nfiling for benefits. (Plaintiff says this is not so; the employer\n\ncould have chosen not to contest her application in the state system.)\n\nAFOP also says that res judicata results from the unappealed Board\n\nfinding.\n\n           We think the issue turns on whether the Restatement (Second)\n\nof Contracts excuses AFOP from performance of a commitment to provide\n\n\n\n     3     At the Workers' Compensation Board hearing, AFOP's witness\nseemed to take the position that any workers' compensation obligation\ncould and should be satisfied by AFOP's insurer, AIG. That issue is\nnot before us.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fworkers' compensation.     The commitment is unambiguous. set the\n                                                        We\n\nfactual context for discussing the Restatement issue.         Based in\n\nVirginia, AFOP is a private non-profit group with national operations.\n\nAFOP is an AmeriCorps grant recipient. As such, it is, as it knew,\n\nsubject to the terms of the NCSA, the federal act governing grants from\n\nthe AmeriCorps program.     Since 1991, the NCSA has provided that\n\nparticipants in an approved AmeriCorps program -- such as Twombly --\n\n\"shall not be considered employees of the program.\" National and\n\nCommunity Service Technical Amendments Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-10\n\n§ 3(4), 105 Stat. 29 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 12511(17)(B)).4\n\nDespite this language, AFOP prepared a standard form contract for its\n\nparticipants, which Twombly signed in 1995. The contract promised that\n\nAFOP would provide workers' compensation.        Twombly accepted the\n\ncontract in reliance on that promise and performed her part of the\n\ncontract by working for AFOP.\n\n           When Twombly filed for workers' compensation benefits with\n\nthe state, AFOP had the choice to contest or not contest the claim. If\n\nAFOP had not contested the claim and it had been allowed, AFOP would\n\nhave borne the costs of the compensation. Alternatively, if the claim\n\n     4     There is no need to decide the issue of whether the federal\nAct provision preempts the Maine Workers' Compensation Act, as the\nWorkers' Compensation Board held. The transcript before the Board\ncontains evidence that the U.S. Department of Labor considers\nparticipants not to be federal employees for purposes of the federal\nunemployment compensation system, but leaves it to the states to\ndetermine eligibility for the state unemployment systems. Nor is there\nany need to decide what, if any, are the res judicata effects of that\ndecision as to Twombly given our disposition of the matter.\n\n                                  -9-\n\ffor benefits had been denied (whether the claim had been contested or\n\nuncontested), AFOP could have paid Twombly workers' compensation in\n\nanother form.\n\n          The provisions of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts at\n\nissue have to do with situations in which a court relieves a party from\n\nperformance of an obligation because\n\n          [a]n extraordinary circumstance may make\n          performance so vitally different from what was\n          reasonably to be expected as to alter the\n          essential nature of that performance. In such a\n          case the court must determine whether justice\n          requires a departure from the general rule that\n          the obligor bear the risk that the contract may\n          become more burdensome or less desirable.\n\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 11, introductory note at 309-10.\n\n          The analysis begins with Restatement § 261, which provides:\n\n          Discharge by Supervening Impracticability\n\n          Where, after a contract is made, a party's\n          performance is made impracticable without his\n          fault by the occurrence of an event the non-\n          occurrence of which was a basic assumption on\n          which the contract was made, his duty to render\n          that performance is discharged, unless the\n          language or the circumstances indicate the\n          contrary.\n\nId. § 261. Importantly, § 261 states \"a principle broadly applicable\n\nto all types of impracticability\" and \"'deliberately refrains from any\n\neffort at an exhaustive expression of contingencies.'\" Id. § 261 cmt.\n\na (quoting U.C.C. § 2-615 cmt. 2). The rules stated in §§ 262-64 guide\n\nthe determination whether the principle of § 261 applies in specific\n\ncircumstances.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            In entering summary judgment on this claim, the district\n\ncourt relied on the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 264, which\n\nprovides:\n\n            Prevention by Governmental Regulation or Order\n\n            If the performance of a duty is made\n            impracticable by having to comply with a domestic\n            or foreign governmental regulation or order, that\n            regulation or order is an event the non-\n            occurrence of which was a basic assumption on\n            which the contract was made.\n\nId. § 264. This is generally thought to be an issue of law for the\n\ncourt, not the jury, to decide. See id. ch. 11 introductory note at\n\n310.   While Maine has not yet decided whether it will adopt this\n\nsection, we assume arguendo that it will look to § 264 and this part of\n\nthe Restatement for guidance. See Bouchard v. Blunt, 579 A.2d 261, 263\n\nn.3 (Me. 1990) (referring to Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261).\n\n            Section 264 of the Restatement provides a specific instance\n\nof the general doctrine of \"Discharge by Supervening Impracticability\"\n\ncontained in § 261. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 264 cmt.\n\na, illus. 1, 2.    By the terms of its commentary, § 264 applies to\n\nsupervening government actions, as does § 261. See id. § 264 cmt. a;\n\nid. § 261 (referring to performance made impracticable \"after a\n\ncontract is made\") (emphasis added). The 1991 amendment of the NCSA\n\ncannot be supervening as to a 1995 contract. Indeed, the Restatement\n\nsays that when the government prohibition already exists at the time of\n\nthe making of the contract, the rule stated in § 266(1) applies. See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 264 cmt. a (\"If the prohibition or\n\n                                  -11-\n\fprevention already exists at the time of the making of the contract,\n\nthe rule stated in § 266(1) rather than that stated in § 261 controls,\n\nand this Section applies for the purpose of that rule as well.\").\n\n          Thus, § 261 does not apply, and we turn to § 266(1). Section\n\n266(1) only excuses performance\n\n          [w]here, at the time a contract is made, a\n          party's performance under it is impracticable\n          without his fault because of a fact of which he\n          has no reason to know and the non-existence of\n          which is a basic assumption on which the contract\n          is made, no duty to render that performance\n          arises, unless the language or circumstances\n          indicate the contrary.\n\n\nId. § 266(1). AFOP is not entitled to relief under § 266(1). AFOP, an\n\norganization of national scope and the drafter of the form contract,\n\ncannot be said to be \"without fault,\" or not to have reason to know of\n\nthe definition of \"participant\" enacted in 1991. See In re Estate of\n\nZellmer, 82 N.W. 2d 891, 894 (Wis. 1957) (holding that estate was not\n\nexcused from performance under Restatement where decedent should have\n\nknown of lapsed premiums on insurance policy). It is equally clear\n\nthat the \"fact\" in question was material. AFOP knowingly promised\n\nworkers' compensation, and Twombly relied on that promise in accepting\n\nAFOP's offer.\n\n          Finally, the \"language and circumstances\" of the contract are\n\nsuch that AFOP is not excused from performance under § 266(1). Even if\n\nAFOP were in fact ignorant of the 1991 provision -- and the evidence\n\npresented to the Workers' Compensation Board is to the contrary -- the\n\n\n                                -12-\n\frisks of that ignorance are better borne by AFOP than by the individual\n\nAmeriCorps participants. This is not a situation where a later law\n\nmakes it illegal for a plaintiff to perform or partially perform but\n\nplaintiff still seeks to be paid the contract price, as in American\n\nMercantile Exchange, 66 A. at 213-14, the case on which the district\n\ncourt relied. Rather, after entering into the contract in reliance on\n\nthe promise of workers' compensation, Twombly performed her side of the\n\ncontract.    It would be unjust to say AFOP is excused from its\n\nobligation.5 If AFOP did not wish to oblige itself to provide workers'\n\ncompensation in any form, or to provide it if and only if the state\n\nWorkers' Compensation Board approved, it could have drafted the\n\ncontract accordingly.\n\n            We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the health\n\ncoverage claim, reverse the entry of summary judgment on the workers'\n\ncompensation claim, and remand for further proceedings. No costs are\n\nawarded.\n\n\n\n\n     5    The Maine Workers' Compensation Board determined that\n\"Twombly was traveling as part of her duties . . . [at] AFOP\" at the\ntime of her injury. We take that as established. If there are any\nremaining issues about coverage, they may be explored on remand.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f",

Resolution of the latter claim involves exploration of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts provisions excusing performance because of impracticability caused by governmental regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twombly had a contract with AFOP to run pesticide safety programs for farm workers from January 8, 1995, through December 15, 1995. On March 23, 1995, she executed a two page contract with AFOP, under which AFOP agreed to provide her with a stipend and benefits including \"health and medical coverage, child care if needed, [and] worker's compensation.\" AFOP enrolled her in a health insurance policy issued by Allianz/SRC, which had a maximum payout of $10,000. AFOP paid 85% of the premiums; the Training and Development Corporation (TDC), the host agency for AFOP in Maine, paid the remaining 15%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For her part, Twombly provided the services she was required to provide under the contract. Participants such as Twombly had full-time work assignments averaging 40 hours per week and were paid stipends at an annual rate of $7,650 in exchange for their service. Twombly was the single parent of a seven-year-old child and relied on AFOP's promises to provide health insurance and workers' compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 1995, Twombly was in a serious automobile accident on Interstate 95 while heading back from a training demonstration in Houlton, Maine. She suffered severe injuries that resulted in a substantial loss of physical and mental functioning. The health insurer paid out the $10,000 maximum. Twombly's plight is described in another opinion arising out of her accident. See Twombly v. AIG Life Ins. Co., 199 F.3d 20, 21-23 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Twombly filed an application for workers' compensation with the Maine Workers' Compensation Board. On October 28, 1998, the Board dismissed the petition against AFOP. As to AFOP, the Board concluded that while Twombly was AFOP's employee under Maine workers' compensation law, Maine law was preempted by the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12501 et seq. The NCSA states that an AmeriCorps participant such as Twombly \"shall not be considered to be an employee of the program in which the participant is enrolled.\" Id. &#167; 12511 (17).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Twombly then brought this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial court, Twombly argued that the contract was ambiguous as to the scope of the health insurance AFOP was required to provide. She also said that resolution of the ambiguity required reference to certain federal minimum standards, specifically those under the NCSA. The relevant provision states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A State or other recipient of assistance under section 12571 of this title shall provide a basic health care policy for each full-time participant in a national service program carried out or supported using the assistance, if the participant is not otherwise covered by a health care policy. Not more than 85 percent of the cost of a premium shall be provided by the [Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)], with the remaining cost paid by the entity receiving assistance under section 12571 of this title. The [CNCS] shall establish minimum standards that all plans must meet in order to qualify for payment under this part, any circumstances in which an alternative health care policy may be substituted for the basic health care policy, and mechanisms to prohibit participants from dropping existing coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 12594(d)(1) (emphasis added); see also 45 C.F.R. &#167; 2522.250(b) (requiring grantees to provide eligible participants with minimum health benefits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the phrase \"health and medical coverage\" was unambiguous and that Twombly was in fact provided the health insurance required by the contract, so AFOP did not breach the contract. The district court determined that the NCSA had no bearing on whether the contract was ambiguous, and that any failure to comply with the CNCS minimum standard may or may not give rise to a cause of action, but that that was a separate matter from breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Twombly's claim for workers' compensation, AFOP argued that the claim for workers' compensation was both barred by res judicata and preempted by federal law. AFOP also argued that its performance was excused because of legal impossibility. The court rested its grant of summary judgment for AFOP on the last ground, finding that under &#167; 264 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts there was an intervention of federal law that made performance impracticable and therefore discharged any duty. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264 cmt. a (1981). The district court also relied on American Mercantile Exchange v. Blunt, 66 A. 212 (Me. 1906), in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review on summary judgment is de novo. See National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. granted, 120 S. Ct. 525 (1999). On appeal, Twombly argues that AFOP was not entitled to summary judgment. She says that the district court erred in finding the contract unambiguous as it related to health coverage and granting AFOP summary judgment on the issue. Twombly also argues that AFOP contracted to provide her with workers' compensation, either under the state system or through private purchase of equivalent coverage, and that performance of this obligation was not excused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Health Insurance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twombly argues that the district court did not apply the principle that a contract is construed against the drafter; in any event, she says, the contract is ambiguous as to the scope of the promise to provide health insurance, and she was entitled to discovery on what AFOP intended the phrase \"health and medical coverage\" to mean. She says typical health insurance policies do not contain dollar limits, and the policy that AFOP provided did not comply with the federal requirements for AmeriCorps Programs. AFOP says, supported by affidavit, that its minimal health policy was in compliance with federal law regulating AmeriCorps, and that, in fact, the insurance was exactly what was arranged for and recommended by AmeriCorps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether contractual terms are ambiguous is, under Maine law, initially a matter of law for the court. See Fitzgerald v. Gamester, 658 A.2d 1065, 1069 (Me. 1995). This case comes to us on summary judgment, and so the question of contractual meaning has a factual context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the health insurance claim. The payment of $10,000 in benefits met AFOP's contractual obligation to provide health and medical coverage. There may be extreme cases where the health coverage provided is so minimal, say $1 worth of coverage, that it cannot be said to comply with the obligation to provide health insurance. But that is not this case. Further, the federal regulations required AFOP to provide \"minimum\" health benefits as determined by the CNCS, and the policy met that definition. See 45 C.F.R. &#167; 2522.250(b). The defendants produced undisputed evidence that the insurance provided was exactly what the CNCS, which was responsible for setting the minimum benefits, arranged for and recommended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Workers' Compensation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred, Twombly argues, in granting summary judgment on the workers' compensation claim and in relying on Restatement &#167; 264. She also says it was possible for AFOP to perform even if the state denied benefits. AFOP, she points out, could have purchased the equivalent of workers' compensation insurance to meet its obligations. The fact that AFOP purchased a workers' compensation-like policy from AIG, see Twombly, 199 F.3d at 21-22, is evidence, Twombly claims, of AFOP's intent that she be provided with such benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If AFOP's obligation were meant to be limited, Twombly says, then the contract would have said \"worker's compensation to the extent provided by law.\" Finally, Twombly says that since the Workers' Compensation Board determined it did not have jurisdiction, there is no res judicata effect because there was no adjudication on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFOP says, citing 4 Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation &#167; 87.73 (1989), that if it were the intent of the parties that AFOP privately purchase the equivalent of workers' compensation, then the contract should have explicitly said so and referred to a scale of benefits. Further, AFOP claims that Twombly showed that she interpreted the contract to mean the standard state-operated system by filing for benefits. (Plaintiff says this is not so; the employer could have chosen not to contest her application in the state system.) AFOP also says that res judicata results from the unappealed Board finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the issue turns on whether the Restatement (Second) of Contracts excuses AFOP from performance of a commitment to provide workers' compensation. The commitment is unambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the factual context for discussing the Restatement issue. Based in Virginia, AFOP is a private non-profit group with national operations. AFOP is an AmeriCorps grant recipient. As such, it is, as it knew, subject to the terms of the NCSA, the federal act governing grants from the AmeriCorps program. Since 1991, the NCSA has provided that participants in an approved AmeriCorps program -- such as Twombly -- \"shall not be considered employees of the program.\" National and Community Service Technical Amendments Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-10 &#167; 3(4), 105 Stat. 29 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12511(17)(B)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Despite this language, AFOP prepared a standard form contract for its participants, which Twombly signed in 1995. The contract promised that AFOP would provide workers' compensation. Twombly accepted the contract in reliance on that promise and performed her part of the contract by working for AFOP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Twombly filed for workers' compensation benefits with the state, AFOP had the choice to contest or not contest the claim. If AFOP had not contested the claim and it had been allowed, AFOP would have borne the costs of the compensation. Alternatively, if the claim for benefits had been denied (whether the claim had been contested or uncontested), AFOP could have paid Twombly workers' compensation in another form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts at issue have to do with situations in which a court relieves a party from performance of an obligation because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]n extraordinary circumstance may make performance so vitally different from what was reasonably to be expected as to alter the essential nature of that performance. In such a case the court must determine whether justice requires a departure from the general rule that the obligor bear the risk that the contract may become more burdensome or less desirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 11, introductory note at 309-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis begins with Restatement &#167; 261, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discharge by Supervening ImpracticabilityWhere, after a contract is made, a party's performance is made impracticable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his duty to render that performance is discharged, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 261. Importantly, &#167; 261 states \"a principle broadly applicable to all types of impracticability\" and \"'deliberately refrains from any effort at an exhaustive expression of contingencies.'\" Id. &#167; 261 cmt. a (quoting U.C.C. &#167; 2-615 cmt. 2). The rules stated in &#167;&#167; 262-64 guide the determination whether the principle of &#167; 261 applies in specific circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In entering summary judgment on this claim, the district court relied on the Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prevention by Governmental Regulation or Order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the performance of a duty is made impracticable by having to comply with a domestic or foreign governmental regulation or order, that regulation or order is an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 264. This is generally thought to be an issue of law for the court, not the jury, to decide. See id. ch. 11 introductory note at 310. While Maine has not yet decided whether it will adopt this section, we assume arguendo that it will look to &#167; 264 and this part of the Restatement for guidance. See Bouchard v. Blunt, 579 A.2d 261, 263 n.3 (Me. 1990) (referring to Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 261).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 264 of the Restatement provides a specific instance of the general doctrine of \"Discharge by Supervening Impracticability\" contained in &#167; 261. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264 cmt. a, illus. 1, 2. By the terms of its commentary, &#167; 264 applies to supervening government actions, as does &#167; 261. See id. &#167; 264 cmt. a; id. &#167; 261 (referring to performance made impracticable \"after a contract is made\") (emphasis added). The 1991 amendment of the NCSA cannot be supervening as to a 1995 contract. Indeed, the Restatement says that when the government prohibition already exists at the time of the making of the contract, the rule stated in &#167; 266(1) applies. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264 cmt. a (\"If the prohibition or prevention already exists at the time of the making of the contract, the rule stated in &#167; 266(1) rather than that stated in &#167; 261 controls, and this Section applies for the purpose of that rule as well.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, &#167; 261 does not apply, and we turn to &#167; 266(1). Section 266(1) only excuses performance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]here, at the time a contract is made, a party's performance under it is impracticable without his fault because of a fact of which he has no reason to know and the non-existence of which is a basic assumption on which the contract is made, no duty to render that performance arises, unless the language or circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 266(1). AFOP is not entitled to relief under &#167; 266(1). AFOP, an organization of national scope and the drafter of the form contract, cannot be said to be \"without fault,\" or not to have reason to know of the definition of \"participant\" enacted in 1991. See In re Estate of Zellmer, 82 N.W. 2d 891, 894 (Wis. 1957) (holding that estate was not excused from performance under Restatement where decedent should have known of lapsed premiums on insurance policy). It is equally clear that the \"fact\" in question was material. AFOP knowingly promised workers' compensation, and Twombly relied on that promise in accepting AFOP's offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the \"language and circumstances\" of the contract are such that AFOP is not excused from performance under &#167; 266(1). Even if AFOP were in fact ignorant of the 1991 provision -- and the evidence presented to the Workers'Compensation Board is to the contrary -- the risks of that ignorance are better borne by AFOP than by the individual AmeriCorps participants. This is not a situation where a later law makes it illegal for a plaintiff to perform or partially perform but plaintiff still seeks to be paid the contract price, as in American Mercantile Exchange, 66 A. at 213-14, the case on which the district court relied. Rather, after entering into the contract in reliance on the promise of workers' compensation, Twombly performed her side of the contract. It would be unjust to say AFOP is excused from its obligation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If AFOP did not wish to oblige itself to provide workers' compensation in any form, or to provide it if and only if the state Workers' Compensation Board approved, it could have drafted the contract accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the health coverage claim, reverse the entry of summary judgment on the workers' compensation claim, and remand for further proceedings.

This is true, but most of the discovery sought was irrelevant to this issue. The defendant's affidavit -- establishing that AFOP complied with what CNCS recommended -- was filed in support of the summary judgment motion, and plaintiff did not contest the fact asserted or seek discovery on this specific issue.

The NCSA states that an AmeriCorps participant such as Twombly \"shall not be considered to be an employee of the program in which the participant is enrolled.\" Id. &#167; 12511 (17).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Twombly then brought this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial court, Twombly argued that the contract was ambiguous as to the scope of the health insurance AFOP was required to provide. She also said that resolution of the ambiguity required reference to certain federal minimum standards, specifically those under the NCSA. The relevant provision states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A State or other recipient of assistance under section 12571 of this title shall provide a basic health care policy for each full-time participant in a national service program carried out or supported using the assistance, if the participant is not otherwise covered by a health care policy. Not more than 85 percent of the cost of a premium shall be provided by the [Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)], with the remaining cost paid by the entity receiving assistance under section 12571 of this title. The [CNCS] shall establish minimum standards that all plans must meet in order to qualify for payment under this part, any circumstances in which an alternative health care policy may be substituted for the basic health care policy, and mechanisms to prohibit participants from dropping existing coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 12594(d)(1) (emphasis added); see also 45 C.F.R. &#167; 2522.250(b) (requiring grantees to provide eligible participants with minimum health benefits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the phrase \"health and medical coverage\" was unambiguous and that Twombly was in fact provided the health insurance required by the contract, so AFOP did not breach the contract. The district court determined that the NCSA had no bearing on whether the contract was ambiguous, and that any failure to comply with the CNCS minimum standard may or may not give rise to a cause of action, but that that was a separate matter from breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Twombly's claim for workers' compensation, AFOP argued that the claim for workers' compensation was both barred by res judicata and preempted by federal law. AFOP also argued that its performance was excused because of legal impossibility. The court rested its grant of summary judgment for AFOP on the last ground, finding that under &#167; 264 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts there was an intervention of federal law that made performance impracticable and therefore discharged any duty. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264 cmt. a (1981). The district court also relied on American Mercantile Exchange v. Blunt, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></span> (Me. 1906), in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review on summary judgment is de novo. See National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198529\"><a href=\"/opinion/198529/national-foreign-v-natsios/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.), cert. granted, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></span> (1999). On appeal, Twombly argues that AFOP was not entitled to summary judgment. She says that the district court erred in finding the contract unambiguous as it related to health coverage and granting AFOP summary judgment on the issue. Twombly also argues that AFOP contracted to provide her with workers' compensation, either under the state system or through private purchase of equivalent coverage, and that performance of this obligation was not excused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Health Insurance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Twombly argues that the district court did not apply the principle that a contract is construed against the drafter; in any event, she says, the contract is ambiguous as to the scope of the promise to provide health insurance, and she was entitled to discovery on what AFOP intended the phrase \"health and medical coverage\" to mean. She says typical health insurance policies do not contain dollar limits, and the policy that AFOP provided did not comply with the federal requirements for AmeriCorps Programs. AFOP says, supported by affidavit, that its minimal health policy was in compliance with federal law regulating AmeriCorps, and that, in fact, the insurance was exactly what was arranged for and recommended by AmeriCorps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question whether contractual terms are ambiguous is, under Maine law, initially a matter of law for the court. See Fitzgerald v. Gamester, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></span>, 1069 (Me. 1995). This case comes to us on summary judgment, and so the question of contractual meaning has a factual context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the health insurance claim. The payment of $10,000 in benefits met AFOP's contractual obligation to provide health and medical coverage. There may be extreme cases where the health coverage provided is so minimal, say $1 worth of coverage, that it cannot be said to comply with the obligation to provide health insurance. But that is not this case. Further, the federal regulations required AFOP to provide \"minimum\" health benefits as determined by the CNCS, and the policy met that definition. See 45 C.F.R. &#167; 2522.250(b). The defendants produced undisputed evidence that the insurance provided was exactly what the CNCS, which was responsible for setting the minimum benefits, arranged for and recommended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Workers' Compensation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred, Twombly argues, in granting summary judgment on the workers' compensation claim and in relying on Restatement &#167; 264. She also says it was possible for AFOP to perform even if the state denied benefits. AFOP, she points out, could have purchased the equivalent of workers' compensation insurance to meet its obligations. The fact that AFOP purchased a workers' compensation-like policy from AIG, see Twombly, 199 F.3d at 21-22, is evidence, Twombly claims, of AFOP's intent that she be provided with such benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If AFOP's obligation were meant to be limited, Twombly says, then the contract would have said \"worker's compensation to the extent provided by law.\" Finally, Twombly says that since the Workers' Compensation Board determined it did not have jurisdiction, there is no res judicata effect because there was no adjudication on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFOP says, citing 4 Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation &#167; 87.73 (1989), that if it were the intent of the parties that AFOP privately purchase the equivalent of workers' compensation, then the contract should have explicitly said so and referred to a scale of benefits. Further, AFOP claims that Twombly showed that she interpreted the contract to mean the standard state-operated system by filing for benefits. (Plaintiff says this is not so; the employer could have chosen not to contest her application in the state system.) AFOP also says that res judicata results from the unappealed Board finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the issue turns on whether the Restatement (Second) of Contracts excuses AFOP from performance of a commitment to provide workers' compensation. The commitment is unambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the factual context for discussing the Restatement issue. Based in Virginia, AFOP is a private non-profit group with national operations. AFOP is an AmeriCorps grant recipient. As such, it is, as it knew, subject to the terms of the NCSA, the federal act governing grants from the AmeriCorps program. Since 1991, the NCSA has provided that participants in an approved AmeriCorps program -- such as Twombly -- \"shall not be considered employees of the program.\" National and Community Service Technical Amendments Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-10 &#167; 3(4), 105 Stat. 29 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12511(17)(B)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Despite this language, AFOP prepared a standard form contract for its participants, which Twombly signed in 1995. The contract promised that AFOP would provide workers' compensation. Twombly accepted the contract in reliance on that promise and performed her part of the contract by working for AFOP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Twombly filed for workers' compensation benefits with the state, AFOP had the choice to contest or not contest the claim. If AFOP had not contested the claim and it had been allowed, AFOP would have borne the costs of the compensation. Alternatively, if the claim for benefits had been denied (whether the claim had been contested or uncontested), AFOP could have paid Twombly workers' compensation in another form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provisions of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts at issue have to do with situations in which a court relieves a party from performance of an obligation because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]n extraordinary circumstance may make performance so vitally different from what was reasonably to be expected as to alter the essential nature of that performance. In such a case the court must determine whether justice requires a departure from the general rule that the obligor bear the risk that the contract may become more burdensome or less desirable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Contracts ch. 11, introductory note at 309-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis begins with Restatement &#167; 261, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discharge by Supervening ImpracticabilityWhere, after a contract is made, a party's performance is made impracticable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his duty to render that performance is discharged, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 261. Importantly, &#167; 261 states \"a principle broadly applicable to all types of impracticability\" and \"'deliberately refrains from any effort at an exhaustive expression of contingencies.'\" Id. &#167; 261 cmt. a (quoting U.C.C. &#167; 2-615 cmt. 2). The rules stated in &#167;&#167; 262-64 guide the determination whether the principle of &#167; 261 applies in specific circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In entering summary judgment on this claim, the district court relied on the Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prevention by Governmental Regulation or Order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the performance of a duty is made impracticable by having to comply with a domestic or foreign governmental regulation or order, that regulation or order is an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 264. This is generally thought to be an issue of law for the court, not the jury, to decide. See id. ch. 11 introductory note at 310. While Maine has not yet decided whether it will adopt this section, we assume arguendo that it will look to &#167; 264 and this part of the Restatement for guidance. See Bouchard v. Blunt, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></span>, 263 n.3 (Me. 1990) (referring to Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 261).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 264 of the Restatement provides a specific instance of the general doctrine of \"Discharge by Supervening Impracticability\" contained in &#167; 261. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264 cmt. a, illus. 1, 2. By the terms of its commentary, &#167; 264 applies to supervening government actions, as does &#167; 261. See id. &#167; 264 cmt. a; id. &#167; 261 (referring to performance made impracticable \"after a contract is made\") (emphasis added). The 1991 amendment of the NCSA cannot be supervening as to a 1995 contract. Indeed, the Restatement says that when the government prohibition already exists at the time of the making of the contract, the rule stated in &#167; 266(1) applies. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 264 cmt. a (\"If the prohibition or prevention already exists at the time of the making of the contract, the rule stated in &#167; 266(1) rather than that stated in &#167; 261 controls, and this Section applies for the purpose of that rule as well.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, &#167; 261 does not apply, and we turn to &#167; 266(1). Section 266(1) only excuses performance</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]here, at the time a contract is made, a party's performance under it is impracticable without his fault because of a fact of which he has no reason to know and the non-existence of which is a basic assumption on which the contract is made, no duty to render that performance arises, unless the language or circumstances indicate the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 266(1). AFOP is not entitled to relief under &#167; 266(1). AFOP, an organization of national scope and the drafter of the form contract, cannot be said to be \"without fault,\" or not to have reason to know of the definition of \"participant\" enacted in 1991. See In re Estate of Zellmer, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></span>, 894 (Wis. 1957) (holding that estate was not excused from performance under Restatement where decedent should have known of lapsed premiums on insurance policy). It is equally clear that the \"fact\" in question was material. AFOP knowingly promised workers' compensation, and Twombly relied on that promise in accepting AFOP's offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the \"language and circumstances\" of the contract are such that AFOP is not excused from performance under &#167; 266(1). Even if AFOP were in fact ignorant of the 1991 provision -- and the evidence presented to the Workers'Compensation Board is to the contrary -- the risks of that ignorance are better borne by AFOP than by the individual AmeriCorps participants. This is not a situation where a later law makes it illegal for a plaintiff to perform or partially perform but plaintiff still seeks to be paid the contract price, as in American Mercantile Exchange, 66 A. at 213-14, the case on which the district court relied. Rather, after entering into the contract in reliance on the promise of workers' compensation, Twombly performed her side of the contract. It would be unjust to say AFOP is excused from its obligation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If AFOP did not wish to oblige itself to provide workers' compensation in any form, or to provide it if and only if the state Workers' Compensation Board approved, it could have drafted the contract accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the health coverage claim, reverse the entry of summary judgment on the workers' compensation claim, and remand for further proceedings. No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Board denied the petition against TDC on the ground that Twombly was not an employee of TDC.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Twombly says that her requested discovery was restricted by the district court. This is true, but most of the discovery sought was irrelevant to this issue. The defendant's affidavit -- establishing that AFOP complied with what CNCS recommended -- was filed in support of the summary judgment motion, and plaintiff did not contest the fact asserted or seek discovery on this specific issue. We take this fact as undisputed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At the Workers' Compensation Board hearing, AFOP's witness seemed to take the position that any workers' compensation obligation could and should be satisfied by AFOP's insurer, AIG.
