After careful review of the record and\r                                \r\n\nthe petition for review,  we find no reversible error  in the\r\n\nBIA  decision.   Accordingly, we affirm,  essentially for the\r\n\nreasons stated  in that  decision, adding only  the following\r\n\ncomments.\r\n\n     1.   Contrary to petitioner's assertion,  his Maine drug\r\n\nconviction  is an \"aggravated felony\"  in the context of this\r\n\ndeportation   proceeding.     See   8  U.S.C      1101(a)(43)\r                                             \r\n\n(\"aggravated   felony\"   includes   illicit  trafficking   in\r\n\ncontrolled  substances  as  defined   in  21  U.S.C.     802,\r\n\nincluding drug trafficking  crimes as defined in 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(c));  Amaral v. INS, 977  F.2d 33, 35-36  (1st Cir. 1992)\r                                   \r\n\n(explaining  the definitions  of \"aggravated\"  and \"felony\").\r\n\nIn any  event, the  point is  not properly  raised to  us, as\r\n\npetitioner  conceded  his  deportability in  the  proceedings\r\n\nbefore the immigration judge and the BIA.\r\n\n     2.    The  BIA's  description  of  petitioner's juvenile\r\n\nrecord is supported by the evidence presented by petitioner's\r\n\nwitnesses.  To the extent that  petitioner disputes the BIA's\r\n\ncharacterization  of his juvenile arrest for theft as one for\r\n\n\"robbery,\" we  find any  such inaccuracy on  this tangential,\r\n\nbackground point to  be harmless.  See White v.  INS, 17 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n475, 479 (1st  Cir. 1994)  (INS error is  harmless unless  it\r\n\ncould have affected the decision).  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     3.  We perceive no merit  in petitioner's assertion that\r\n\n\"many  other mitigating circumstances\"  have been \"overlooked\r\n\nor  ignored.\"    Our  review of  the  record  discloses  that\r\n\npetitioner, then represented by counsel, had a full and  fair\r\n\nopportunity to  present his arguments and  evidence, and that\r\n\nthe BIA fully considered the arguments and evidence presented\r\n\nto it.  We have no authority to consider matters not  brought\r\n\nto the BIA's attention.   See 8 U.S.C.   1105a(c); Alleyne v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nINS, 879 F.2d 1172, 1182 (1st Cir. 1989).  \r               \r\n\n     4.  Finally, on its merits,  the BIA's decision suggests\r\n\nno  grounds  for  reversal.    The  BIA  considered  all  the\r\n\nevidence, made specific findings as  to both the positive and\r\n\nnegative factors, and explained  how it reached the decision.\r\n\nThe BIA noted  that this was a difficult case  because of the\r\n\nfactors on both sides, including some outstanding equities in\r\n\npetitioner's  favor.    Even  in  light  of  the  outstanding\r\n\nequities, the grant or denial of a waiver remains a matter of\r\n\nBIA  discretion, and  this court  will not  \"second-guess the\r\n\nBoard on the  manner in  which it  weights different  factors\r\n\nwhen arriving at its ultimate decision.\"  See Gouveia v. INS,\r                                                                        \r\n\n980 F.2d 814, 819 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n     There  being  no  substantial  question for  review,  we\r\n\nsummarily affirm the decision of the BIA and deny and dismiss\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe petition for review.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
