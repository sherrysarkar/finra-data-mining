McDermott,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant Corporation  Counsel, City of Boston Law Department, were on\r\nbrief for appellee, City of Boston, Transportation Department.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                      December 13, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per  Curiam.   After  consideration of  the briefs,\r                                 \r\n\narguments  and record, we affirm the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt  for substantially  the  same reasons  set  out in  the\r\n\nmemorandum and order of the magistrate judge.1\r\n\n          Like the magistrate judge,  we can find no property\r\n\ninterest  in  the  state  position  plaintiff  held  that  is\r\n\nsufficient to support a  federal due process claim.   We also\r\n\nagree that the Eleventh  Amendment prevents plaintiff, in the\r\n\ncircumstances, from suing a state administrative  official in\r\n\na  federal forum over the question of an alleged violation of\r\n\nthe state  civil service law.   Whether and to what  extent a\r\n\nstate forum is or  would have been available to  plaintiff to\r\n\nlitigate  any of  his claims  concerning state  civil service\r\n\npractices is a matter outside our jurisdiction to consider.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Pursuant  to  28 U.S.C.     636(c) the  instant  case was\r\nreferred  and  reassigned in  the  district  court, with  the\r\nparties' consent,  to the magistrate judge  for all purposes,\r\nincluding trial and the entry of judgment.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
