D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n              and Doumar,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula\nD. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.\n     James S. Nixon, with whom Gross, Minsky & Mogul, P.A. was\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                       October 23, 2001\n\n\n\n______________\n*Of the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting by designation.\n\f         Per Curiam.     This appeal was argued on September 14,\n\n2001, in conjunction with several other appeals raising the same\n\nprincipal question:    does an undifferentiated conviction under\n\nMaine's general-purpose assault statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 17-A, § 207, constitute a conviction for a misdemeanor\n\ncrime of domestic violence within the purview of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g)(9)?   We answered that question affirmatively in United\n\nStates v. Nason, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 01-1440].\n\nNason is fully dispositive here.     Accordingly, the government's\n\nappeal is sustained, the district court's dismissal of the\n\nindictment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with the rule announced in Nason.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f",
