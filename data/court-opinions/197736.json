John Brennick was  convicted of\r                                      \r\n\nvarious offenses centered  around his failure to  pay over to\r\n\nthe Treasury income  and social security taxes  withheld from\r\n\nhis  employees' paychecks.  The district court calculated the\r\n\nrange of imprisonment  fixed by the sentencing  guidelines at\r\n\n41  to 51  months but  then departed  downward and  imposed a\r\n\nsentence  of 13  months' imprisonment.    The government  now\r\n\nappeals, arguing that the downward departure was error.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     John Brennick was the president and sole proprietor of a\r\n\nnumber  of head  injury  treatment centers  in Massachusetts,\r\n\nPennsylvania,  Delaware and Maryland.   He also  operated one\r\n\nhead trauma  center in New  Jersey as a  limited partnership,\r\n\nBrennick  being the  general  partner.   Some of  the centers\r\n\nprovided sophisticated  medical treatment;  others appear  to\r\n\nhave been supported living centers for head injured patients.\r\n\nTaken as a  whole, the companies were a  large and successful\r\n\nbusiness venture.\r\n\n     Employers  like Brennick are required to withhold income\r\n\ntaxes and social security taxes  from employee paychecks on a\r\n\nperiodic basis and to pay those amounts over to the Treasury.\r\n\nThe  Internal Revenue Service specifies the periods for which\r\n\nsuch withholding is required.  Employers are required  by law\r\n\nto deposit the  withheld taxes into the Treasury within three\r\n\ndays after  the end  of each such  period.   Regular returns,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nspecifying  the  amounts  withheld and  paid  over,  are also\r\n\nrequired on a quarterly basis.\r\n\n     From 1986 to  1992, Brennick followed a  regular pattern\r\n\nof withholding the taxes from his employees' pay but delaying\r\n\npayment of  the monies into  the Treasury  for a  substantial\r\n\nperiod beyond  the time  due.  Normally  his payments  to the\r\n\ngovernment were  between  two and  six months  after the  due\r\n\ndates.     Brennick   routinely   filed  returns   accurately\r\n\ndescribing  the amounts withheld, and when he ultimately made\r\n\nthe  delayed  payments to  the  Treasury,  he  also paid  the\r\n\ninterest and penalties prescribed by law for late payments.\r\n\n     During this period,  Brennick frequently withdrew  money\r\n\nfrom his businesses by means that avoided bank reports to the\r\n\nIRS  that are  required  when a  person  withdraws more  than\r\n\n$10,000  from an  individual bank  on a  single  banking day.\r\n\nBrennick told various of his employees and  family members to\r\n\ncash checks drawn on Brennick's various business accounts and\r\n\nto turn  the money over to  him.  The  individual checks were\r\n\nfor less than $10,000 each;  but the total withdrawn from his\r\n\ncompany accounts was often well over $10,000 a day.\r\n\n     There  is  no  claim  that  Brennick  was  forbidden  to\r\n\nwithdraw  the monies from  the companies' accounts;  in fact,\r\n\nfor most  of them  he was the  sole proprietor,  and for  the\r\n\nremaining one he  was the general partner.   The charge later\r\n\nbrought  against him was that the withdrawals were structured\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nto  avoid the filing  of currency transaction  reports and to\r\n\ndeflect the  attention of  the tax authorities.   It  is said\r\n\nthat Brennick took much or all the money he withdrew and lost\r\n\nit in gambling:  he claims to have lost more than  $1 million\r\n\na year.\r\n\n     During the  second half  of 1992, Brennick's  businesses\r\n\nbegan to suffer  financial problems.  Changes  were occurring\r\n\nin  the health  care industry  adversely affecting  providers\r\n\nlike Brennick.  Insurance reimbursements came more slowly and\r\n\nfor  lower  amounts,  while the  costs  of  providing service\r\n\nincreased.  In December 1992, one of  the banks that had been\r\n\nlending money to Brennick failed and Brennick could not  find\r\n\nanother lender to replace it.\r\n\n     At  the  same   time,  the  IRS  began   to  investigate\r\n\nBrennick's  pattern of  chronically  late  payments.    In  a\r\n\nmeeting with  an  IRS agent  on  October 30,  1992,  Brennick\r\n\nagreed to  a payment  plan, including  a  commitment to  keep\r\n\ncurrent on future payments.  He  promised that his businesses\r\n\nwould seek to expedite payments to  the IRS and would cut his\r\n\nown pay and  the pay of other executives in order to pay back\r\n\ntaxes.  Instead,  Brennick removed another $80,000  cash from\r\n\nthe businesses in November 1992  and almost twice that amount\r\n\nin December.\r\n\n     In  addition, Brennick now began to file false quarterly\r\n\nwithholding tax returns for many  of the companies.   Returns\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nfiled in  the third  and fourth quarter  of 1992  incorrectly\r\n\nstated   that  Brennick  had  paid  over  to  the  government\r\n\nvirtually all of the withheld taxes; in truth, the  companies\r\n\nin question had paid  none of the taxes over to the  IRS.  In\r\n\ntwo cases Brennick signed the false returns himself; in other\r\n\ncases they  were signed  by employees,  but Brennick was  the\r\n\nperson responsible for the withholding of the taxes.\r\n\n     In February  1993, Brennick filed for  reorganization of\r\n\nhis businesses under chapter  11 of the Bankruptcy  Code, and\r\n\nlater  the case was transformed into a chapter 7 liquidation.\r\n\nAt the initial  filing, Brennick owed the  Treasury over $1.4\r\n\nmillion in withheld taxes that  should have been, but had not\r\n\nbeen,  paid over to  the government.   During reorganization,\r\n\nBrennick  took additional  funds out  of  the businesses  for\r\n\nhimself while  failing to pay  over the full amount  of taxes\r\n\nwithheld during the same period.\r\n\n     In  1995,   a  grand  jury  indicted  Brennick.    In  a\r\n\nsuperseding indictment,  Brennick was charged  with 22 counts\r\n\nof  willful failure to  account for, and  pay over quarterly,\r\n\nspecified withholding taxes, 26 U.S.C.   7202; nine counts of\r\n\nstructuring currency  transactions, 31  U.S.C.     5313, 5322\r\n\nand 5324; and one count  of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct\r\n\nand impede  the  IRS, 26  U.S.C.    7212(a).    There was  an\r\n\nadditional single  charge of  bankruptcy fraud,  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n152, but the jury later deadlocked on that issue.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     In  December  1995,   Brennick  went  on  trial.     The\r\n\ngovernment,  in addition to  offering evidence of  the events\r\n\nalready  described,  called  several   of  Brennick's  former\r\n\nemployees who testified that Brennick had known the deadlines\r\n\nfor  paying  over  the withheld  taxes  but  had deliberately\r\n\nchosen to ignore them even though his employees had sought to\r\n\nget him  to  pay over  the  taxes on  a  timely basis.    The\r\n\nbankruptcy  fraud count aside, the jury convicted Brennick on\r\n\nall remaining counts.\r\n\n     The   district  court  held   a  two-day  proceeding  to\r\n\ndetermine Brennick's sentence and after sentencing, issued  a\r\n\nmemorandum and order explaining the court's analysis.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.   Brennick, 949 F. Supp. 32  (D. Mass 1996).  After\r                                \r\n\nbriefly  setting out  the  background  facts, the  memorandum\r\n\ncalculated the normal  guideline range, referring (as  we do)\r\n\nto the 1992  version of the guidelines.  Then,  at length, it\r\n\nset out  the framework for departures and the court's reasons\r\n\nfor departing in this case.\r\n\n     Brennick  was  convicted  of violating  three  different\r\n\nstatutes--failure to  pay over  withheld taxes,  structuring,\r\n\nand  obstructing  the  IRS--but   the  conduct  was  arguably\r\n\nrelated.  In any event, the district court chose to treat the\r\n\noffenses  as closely  related  counts  to  be  grouped  under\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3D1.2,  and its  choice is  not disputed  on this\r\n\nappeal.1  Where counts are  so grouped, the court selects the\r\n\noffense level for the violation  among the group that had the\r\n\nhighest offense level.  U.S.S.G.   3D1.3(b).\r\n\n     The  district court ruled that the highest offense level\r\n\nwas  generated by  the  offense  of  corruptly  impeding  tax\r\n\nofficials  under 26 U.S.C.    7212(a).   Although no specific\r\n\nguideline exists for this offense (unless force is used), see\r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.S.G.,  appendix  A,  the court  is  directed  to use  the\r\n\nguideline  for the  offense most  analogous  to the  criminal\r\n\nconduct of  which the  defendant was  convicted.   U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n1B1.2.   Here, the district court concluded  that the closest\r\n\nanalogy for  the obstructive conduct  was the offense  of tax\r\n\nevasion,  a  violation of  26  U.S.C.     7201, for  which  a\r\n\nspecific  tax  evasion  guideline is  set  forth,  U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n2T1.1.\r\n\n     Although Brennick was not charged with tax evasion, this\r\n\nchoice of  analogy is not  challenged by either side,  and we\r\n\naccept it  as reasonable  for purposes of  this appeal.   The\r\n\ngovernment's obstruction  charge embraced  all of  Brennick's\r\n\nbehavior  (deliberate underpayments,  structuring, and  other\r\n\nacts of  falsity or  concealment) and  that conduct  includes\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The government says for the record that the structuring\r\ncounts  should  have  been grouped  separately  from  the tax\r\ncounts,  which would have  resulted in a  one-level increase.\r\nU.S.S.G.    3D1.4.   But this  caveat was  not raised  in the\r\ndistrict court and is not pursued here.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nwithholding  revenues  from   the  government  combined  with\r\n\nelements of conscious wrongdoing and personal gain.\r\n\n     The base offense level for the tax evasion guideline  is\r\n\ndriven by  the tax loss  inflicted on the government,  and in\r\n\nthis case  the undisputed  level of  the government's  loss--\r\n\n\"more  than  $1,500,000\"--corresponds  to  offense level  18.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2T1.1(a), 2T4.1(M).  The district court added two\r\n\nlevels  on the ground  that Brennick had  used \"sophisticated\r\n\nmeans\" to impede  discovery of  the offense,  see U.S.S.G.   \r                                                             \r\n\n2T1.1(b)(2), and two  more levels for obstruction  of justice\r\n\nbecause of  untruthful testimony  by Brennick  at trial,  see\r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3C1.1.  \r\n\n     Given  a  total offense  level  of  22 (and  a  criminal\r\n\nhistory  category I), the guideline range  for Brennick was a\r\n\nterm  of imprisonment of 41  to 51 months.   From this range,\r\n\nthe district court departed downward  to level 13, for  which\r\n\nthe  prescribed range  for a  defendant  in criminal  history\r\n\ncategory  I is  12 to  18  months' imprisonment.   The  court\r\n\nimposed a sentence of 13 months, as well as a fine  of $6,000\r\n\nand the  statutory special  assessment, noting that  Brennick\r\n\nremained personally liable  to the government for  tax losses\r\n\nhe had caused, 26 U.S.C.   6672.\r\n\n     The court's reasons for the departure were set  forth in\r\n\nsome  detail but  reflect two  central themes:    first, that\r\n\nBrennick's intent  was not as  wicked as that of  the typical\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\ntax evader because, despite some conscious wrongdoing, he did\r\n\nnot intend permanently to deprive the government of the funds\r\n\nhe failed to pay over; and second, the ultimate losses to the\r\n\ngovernment were due  not merely to Brennick's  conduct but to\r\n\ncontributing   causes  as  well,  including  failure  of  his\r\n\nbusiness's main bank  and adverse developments in  the health\r\n\ncare market.  \r\n\n     The  government  has  now   appealed  to  challenge  the\r\n\nsentence.   It  argues  that  the departure  was  based on  a\r\n\nmisconstruction of the  guidelines and that even if  a ground\r\n\nfor departure exists in theory (which the government denies),\r\n\nthe  district  court's  decision  to  depart  and  degree  of\r\n\ndeparture were  unreasonable on the  present facts.   We take\r\n\nthe issues in that order.  \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     Departures from the  guideline range  are allowed  where\r\n\n\"the   court  finds  that  there  exists  an  aggravating  or\r\n\nmitigating  circumstance  of  a kind,  or  to  a degree,  not\r\n\nadequately  taken   into  consideration  by   the  Sentencing\r\n\nCommission in formulating the  guidelines that should  result\r\n\nin a  sentence different from  that described.\"  18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n3553(b).  Sometimes, the guidelines identify a \"circumstance\"\r\n\nthat  is  a  permissible or  forbidden  basis  for departure,\r\n\nsometimes further indicating that departure is  encouraged or\r\n\ndiscouraged.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     Absent such explicit guidance, the Commission itself has\r\n\ntold courts that they should  treat each guideline as carving\r\n\nout  a \"heartland\"  representing  \"a  set  of  typical  cases\r\n\nembodying  the   conduct  that  each   guideline  describes.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G. ch.  1, pt. A  intro. comment  4(b).  \"When  a court\r\n\nfinds  an atypical case, one  to which a particular guideline\r\n\nlinguistically  applies   but  where   conduct  significantly\r\n\ndiffers  from the  norm,  the court  may  consider whether  a\r\n\ndeparture  is  warranted.\"   Id.   If  the  characteristic is\r                                            \r\n\n\"atypical\"  and aggravates or  mitigates the typical conduct,\r\n\nit may provide a basis for departure.\r\n\n     Where a district  court does depart, an  aggrieved party\r\n\nmay appeal from both the decision to depart and the extent of\r\n\nthe  departure.  18  U.S.C.   3742.   The  standard of review\r\n\nvaries with the nature of the issue involved, deference being\r\n\nlimited or absent on abstract issues of law but more generous\r\n\nas to questions of  law application and factfinding.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Black, 78 F.3d  1, 8 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 117\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. 254  (1996).  The present case presents  issues of all\r\n\nthree kinds.\r\n\n     We start  with the  district court's  determination that\r\n\nBrennick,  although he  had deliberately  failed  to pay  the\r\n\ngovernment  the withheld wages  and social security  taxes at\r\n\nthe time they were due, genuinely intended to pay them in due\r\n\ncourse.   In the  district court's view,  Brennick's main aim\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nwas to  use the  IRS as  a bank.   It is  not clear  that the\r\n\ngovernment  directly challenges this finding, but in any case\r\n\nwe think  the finding is not clearly  erroneous, the standard\r\n\nordinarily  applied   to  determinations  of   fact  made  at\r\n\nsentencing.  United States v.  Pineda, 981 F.2d 569, 572 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1992).\r\n\n     Brennick's   pattern   before   financial   difficulties\r\n\nengulfed him was  to retain the use of the  funds in question\r\n\nfor periods of  four to six months  and then to pay  over the\r\n\nfunds, adding penalties  and interests.  The  likelihood that\r\n\nhe would be able to make this repayment obviously declined as\r\n\ntroubles loomed in  late 1992, but  he continued to  scramble\r\n\nfor  resources to  continue payment.   Whether  an intent  to\r\n\nrepay can be  ascribed to all of  the delays in payment  is a\r\n\nmore difficult issue.  See part III below.\r                                      \r\n\n     In the district judge's sentencing memorandum and order,\r\n\nshe relied heavily upon this  intention to repay to carve the\r\n\npresent case out  of the \"heartland\"  of typical tax  evasion\r\n\ncases.   The  government says  this  rationale was  a belated\r\n\nattempt   to  bolster  a  departure  earlier  premised  on  a\r\n\ndifferent ground, namely, that there were multiple causes for\r\n\nthe  loss  to  the  government.    Our  own  reading  of  the\r\n\nsentencing  transcript  suggests  that  the  benign  view  of\r\n\nBrennick's  intent  was  always an  element  in  the district\r\n\ncourt's reasoning.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     The nature of the scienter element in a tax evasion case\r\n\nis complicated to summarize given that different requirements\r\n\nmay apply  on different issues.  Still,  the taxpayer usually\r\n\nis  attempting to deprive the government permanently of taxes\r\n\nowed   to  it.    Typically,  the  instruction  requires  the\r\n\ngovernment  to prove that the defendant \"willfully evaded, or\r\n\nattempted  to evade,  income  taxes  with  the  intention  of\r\n\ndefrauding the government of  taxes owed.\"  Leonard B.  Sand,\r                      \r\n\net al., Modern  Federal Jury Instructions: Criminal    59.01,\r                                                               \r\n\nInstruction  59-8 (1992) (emphasis added).  See, e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Aitken, 755 F.2d 188 (1st Cir. 1985).\r                            \r\n\n     Admittedly, it would do a  defendant no good to say that\r\n\nhe deliberately understated his income but sincerely intended\r\n\nto pay the money back to the government  in five years' time.\r\n\nBut  neither is it easy to imagine a fraud conviction where a\r\n\ndefendant files an accurate return, intends shortly to pay in\r\n\nfull, but  remits the funds  with interest shortly  after the\r                                                                     \r\n\nApril  15 deadline.    Indeed,  the  guideline  covering  the\r\n\nfailure to  pay over  payroll taxes notes  in the  commentary\r\n\nthat   \"[t]he  offense  is  a  felony  that  is  infrequently\r\n\nprosecuted.\"  U.S.S.G.   2T1.6, commentary.\r\n\n     In  all events,  we are  inclined  on the  basis of  the\r\n\ninformation we have and our common sense to think that such a\r\n\ntemporary  delay in payment--where  the defendant expected to\r\n\npay--is not a \"typical\" or  \"heartland\" case of tax  evasion.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nThus,  even  if  the  evasion  statute  and  guideline  might\r\n\n\"linguistically\" be extended to embrace  such temporary delay\r\n\ncases, the intent  to delay payment  only briefly could  take\r\n\nthe  case out of the  heartland.  And,  as already noted, the\r\n\ndistrict court made such a finding in this  case, sustainable\r\n\nat  least as  to much  of  the losses  driving the  guideline\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n     The  district court had  another theme in  its departure\r\n\nanalysis.  It said that the $1.5 million loss suffered by the\r\n\ngovernment overstated the  seriousness of Brennick's offense,\r\n\npartly because the  losses were due to  multiple causes, some\r\n\nof which  were not  Brennick's  fault or  within his  control\r\n\n(failure   of  his   bank,  the   changes   in  health   care\r\n\nreimbursement).   The government says that these concepts are\r\n\npart of  the fraud  guidelines and applying  them to  the tax\r\n\ncrime guidelines is an error of law.\r\n\n     The  fraud  guidelines,  like  the  tax guidelines,  set\r\n\noffense  levels  primarily based  upon loss.   But  the fraud\r\n\nguidelines alone  refer in  comment to the  possibility of  a\r\n\ndeparture  where computed  losses  under-  or  overstate  the\r\n\nseriousness of  the offense;  likewise, the  fraud guidelines\r\n\nalone at one  time referred to multiple causes  as a possible\r\n\nexample of an overstatement and while that language  has been\r\n\ndeleted, they  retain that  concept in  one of the  examples.\r\n\nCompare U.S.S.G.    2F1.1,  application note  11 (1990)  with\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\napplication note 10 (1991).   See generally  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 406 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                   \r\n\n     We agree with the government that provisions in one  set\r\n\nof  guidelines  cannot  normally  be  transferred  to another\r\n\nseparate set of guidelines.  See United States  v. Smallwood,\r                                                                        \r\n\n920 F.2d 1231, 1238 (5th Cir. 1991); United States v. Anders,\r                                                                        \r\n\n899 F.2d 570, 580 (6th  Cir. 1990).  The guidelines  for each\r\n\noffense or set of offenses  tend to function as an integrated\r\n\nunit,  containing  their  own  tradeoffs and  specifications.\r\n\nThus, without laying  down an iron rule, we  view skeptically\r\n\nany importation  of language from  another offense guideline,\r\n\nabsent an explicit cross-reference.\r\n\n     Yet this  does not  take the government  very far.   The\r\n\nnotion in the fraud guideline  that the loss table may under-\r\n\nor overstate the  seriousness of the  offense is little  more\r\n\nthan another  way  of saying  that departures  from the  loss\r\n\ntable may be  warranted for good cause.  Even if we treat the\r                                                  \r\n\nfraud guideline's  language as generously  inviting a  search\r\n\nfor  such causes,  the  fact  remains  that  the  all-purpose\r\n\ndeparture provision  remains available for tax cases whenever\r\n\nthe  case falls  outside  the  heartland.   See  18 U.S.C.   \r                                                           \r\n\n3553(b); U.S.S.G.   5K2.0.\r\n\n     The fraud guidelines' multiple-cause language  is a more\r\n\ncomplicated  matter.    The government  says  that  the fraud\r\n\nguidelines may need  such flexibility because of  the diverse\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nsituations to which  they must apply.  By  contrast, it says,\r\n\n\"loss\" for tax  purposes is based on  calculations, set forth\r\n\nin the guidelines,  that (in words of the  brief) \"focus upon\r\n\nthe amount due and  owing at the time of the offense.\"   If a\r\n\ntax evader  repays what was  stolen, says the  government, he\r\n\nmerely   deserves  a  few   levels  off  for   acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility.\r\n\n     Tax  loss seems  to be  a somewhat more  protean concept\r\n\nthan the government implies,2 but we  think that the argument\r\n\nis  beside  the  point.    We are  here  concerned  not  with\r\n\ncomputing the loss--the parties have agreed that it should be\r\n\ntreated as \"more than 1.5 million\"--but rather with whether a\r\n\ndeparture  is proper.   And  we are  dealing not  with  a tax\r\n\nevader  who stole  the  government's money  and  later had  a\r\n\nchange of heart  but with someone who (accepting the district\r\n\ncourt's finding) never intended to steal the money at all (or\r\n\nat least most of it).\r\n\n     Further, regardless  of the fraud  guideline, the  facts\r\n\nmentioned by the district court in its causation analysis are\r\n\nobviously  relevant  even  if  the   analysis  is  not.    To\r\n\ndistinguish  Brennick from  the ordinary  tax  evader, it  is\r\n\nessential to show  that he did  intend to  pay over what  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Tax  loss  is  defined  somewhat  differently  for  the\r\ndifferent   tax  offenses,   compare  U.S.S.G.      2T1.1(a),\r                                                \r\n2T1.2(a), 2T1.3(a), and 2T1.6(a), and  the tax table at 2T4.1\r\nhas changed over time.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nowed and was merely deferring payment.  This premise would be\r\n\nhard to  sustain unless some  other cause had  contributed to\r\n\nhis later failure to pay over the funds.\r\n\n     This said, we think that  it merely invites confusion to\r\n\ntreat  \"multiple causation\"  as an  independent  basis for  a\r\n\ndeparture.  And we think that to do so  would be inconsistent\r\n\nwith  the normal presumption that provisions in one guideline\r\n\nare  not  to be  read  into  the  guideline for  a  different\r\n\noffense--absent  an  explicit cross  reference or  some other\r\n\nreason to believe that the  Commission so intended.  We doubt\r\n\nthat  this emendation would alter the district court's desire\r\n\nto depart, but as a remand is required for other reasons,  it\r\n\nis free to decide the point for itself.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n     While a departure  could be justified in  theory in this\r\n\ncase, we do not think  that either the decision to depart  or\r\n\nthe  amount of the  departure has been  adequately explained.\r\n\nOur reasons  are not the  usual ones--that  the departure  is\r\n\nbased on  an impermissible ground  or that there has  been no\r\n\neffort to explain the degree  of departure.  Rather, we think\r\n\nthat factors  weighing against  any departure,  and certainly\r\n\none of this degree, received inadequate attention.\r\n\n     In this case the guideline  range for Brennick was 41 to\r\n\n51 months; and the 13-month  sentence imposed was less than a\r\n\nthird of the minimum and just over a quarter of the  maximum.\r\n\nA 13-month sentence would  be the midpoint in the range for a\r\n\nfirst time offender who evaded  or sought to evade $40,000 or\r\n\nmore  in taxes  but had  no other  adjustment.   Brennick, of\r\n\ncourse, caused the government a tax loss of over $1,500,000.\r\n\n     It would  be easy enough  to understand the  sentence if\r\n\nBrennick  had merely  withheld  a large  payment,  reasonably\r\n\nexpecting  to pay  the  money  shortly but  using  it in  the\r\n\nmeantime  for  business  purposes  which  then   unexpectedly\r\n\ncollapsed.   Absent  loss  to  the  government,  there  would\r\n\nprobably  not even  be  a  prosecution in  such  a case;  and\r\n\ncertainly the intent would be less culpable than  in ordinary\r\n\ntax evasion.  But Brennick's actions and intentions were more\r\n\nserious than this abstraction allows.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\n     First,  Brennick   may  in  some  sense   have  intended\r\n\nrepayment,  but  the  reasonableness,  and perhaps  even  the\r\n\npossibility, of  such a belief must have  lessened over time.\r\n\nTo  the eve  of bankruptcy  and  apparently beyond,  Brennick\r\n\nappears  to have  deferred payment  to  the government  while\r\n\nwithdrawing  very substantial sums for  his own use.  Without\r\n\nmore findings, it would be  hard to give Brennick the benefit\r\n\nof a  bona fide intention to  repay the entire loss,  even if\r                                                          \r\n\nmuch of it may be encompassed.  \r\n\n     Second,   even  apart  from   an  intention   to  repay,\r\n\nBrennick's good faith is marred by dishonesty in at least two\r\n\nrespects, (even apart from his falsehoods at trial which were\r\n\nthe subject of a  separate adjustment).  On  a number of  the\r\n\nlater returns, Brennick falsely stated or had others misstate\r\n\nthat  the amounts due to the government had been paid when he\r\n\nknew that  they had  not.  And  his elaborate  structuring of\r\n\nwithdrawals was effectively an effort to mislead and conceal,\r\n\nas   perhaps  also   was  his   use   of  multiple   employer\r\n\nidentification numbers.\r\n\n     Third, Brennick committed the  crime of structuring  and\r\n\nthe government points out that the structure counts alone, if\r\n\nno  other offense  had  been  committed,  could  easily  have\r\n\nproduced an  adjusted offense level  of 17,3 and  a guideline\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3That level might  have been anywhere between 15 and 21.\r\nUnder the 1992 guidelines, the structuring counts generated a\r\nbase offense level  of 13. U.S.S.G.   2S1.3(a)(1),  and would\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nsentence of 24 to 30 months.  The minimum is almost twice the\r                                                     \r\n\namount  of Brennick's actual  sentence after departure.   The\r\n\ngovernment  has  not  argued  that  this  makes  a  departure\r\n\nimpermissible as a  matter of law, but it  certainly bears on\r\n\nthe reasonableness and degree of departure.\r\n\n     We  appreciate that where a ground for departure exists,\r\n\nthe district  court's discretion  is at  its zenith  deciding\r\n\nboth whether and  how far to depart.  United  States v. Diaz-\r                                                                         \r\n\nVillafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st cir. 1989).  But  the quid\r                                                                         \r\n\npro quo for departures is reviewability, including review for\r                   \r\n\nabuse  of discretion,  18 U.S.C.    3742(b)(3);  and even  if\r\n\nreview is hedged by deference,  Koon v. United States, 116 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 2035, 2046 (1996), it has to mean something.\r\n\n     In this  case,  we fail  to see  how a  departure to  13\r\n\nmonths can be justified as reasonable on this record in light\r                                                                \r\n\nof  the three considerations  set forth  above, all  of which\r\n\nappear to  us relevant.   We have put to  one side Brennick's\r\n\ngambling, the significance of which is a matter of reasonable\r\n\ndispute,  and the  government's claim  that  he deprived  his\r\n\nemployees of health care, which was neither a charged offense\r\n\nnor clearly relevant conduct.    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nhave been adjusted upward two  levels for the amount of money\r\ninvolved.  U.S.S.G.    2S1.3(b)(2).     Brennick's  two-level\r\nadjustment for obstruction  of justice would  presumably also\r\nhave applied, generating  a level of 17.   A further increase\r\nof four levels  would have resulted  if the court  determined\r\nthat  \"the defendant  knew or  believed that  the funds  were\r\ncriminally derived property.\"  U.S.S.G.   2S1.3(b)(1).\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n     Possibly, even  after these  factors are  considered and\r\n\nweighed in  full, there  is still  warrant for  a substantial\r\n\ndeparture,  but we  think that  some  further explanation  is\r\n\nessential.   Indeed, while the  district court takes  note of\r\n\nBrennick's  false  filings,  the  government  says  that  the\r\n\ndiscussion  understates  them;4  and   the  district  court's\r\n\ndecision  does  not  squarely   address  our  concerns  about\r\n\nBrennick's good  faith on the  later losses or the  import of\r\n\nthe structuring guideline.\r\n\n     The sentence  was  not imposed  casually:  the  district\r\n\ncourt conducted  a lengthy  sentencing and  wrote at  length,\r\n\naddressing itself primarily to  the government's objections--\r\n\nwhich  we think  are overstated.   The  area is  complicated;\r\n\nthere   is   little   helpful   precedent;   and   Brennick's\r\n\ncircumstances are  unusual.   If it takes  one more  round to\r\n\nfine-tune the sentence, this is a price worth paying.\r\n\n     On  remand, the  district  court  is  free  to  consider\r\n\nwhether   its  inclination  to  depart  is  affected  by  our\r\n\nconclusion  that the  fraud guideline  should  be put  to one\r\n\nside.   Assuming  not,  we expect  that  in resentencing  the\r\n\ndistrict court will  address the considerations that  we have\r\n\noutlined.   While  expressing  doubt that  a  sentence of  13\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     4The district  court  mentioned  two  returns  filed  by\r\nBrennick  falsely claiming that the amount indicated was paid\r\nin full.

The district court calculated the range of imprisonment fixed by the sentencing guidelines at 41 to 51 months but then departed downward and imposed a sentence of 13 months' imprisonment.  The government now appeals, arguing that the downward departure was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Brennick was the president and sole proprietor of a number of head injury treatment centers in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.  He also operated one head trauma center in New Jersey as a limited partnership, Brennick being the general partner.  Some of the centers provided sophisticated medical treatment;  others appear to have been supported living centers for head injured patients.  Taken as a whole, the companies were a large and successful business venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employers like Brennick are required to withhold income taxes and social security taxes from employee paychecks on a periodic basis and to pay those amounts over to the Treasury.  The Internal Revenue Service specifies the periods for which such withholding is required.  Employers are required by law to deposit the withheld taxes into the Treasury within three days after the end of each such period.  Regular returns, specifying the amounts withheld and paid over, are also required on a quarterly basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1986 to 1992, Brennick followed a regular pattern of withholding the taxes from his employees' pay but delaying payment of the monies into the Treasury for a substantial period beyond the time due.  Normally his payments to the government were between two and six months after the due dates.  Brennick routinely filed returns accurately describing the amounts withheld, and when he ultimately made the delayed payments to the Treasury, he also paid the interest and penalties prescribed by law for late payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Brennick frequently withdrew money from his businesses by means that avoided bank reports to the IRS that are required when a person withdraws more than $10,000 from an individual bank on a single banking day.  Brennick told various of his employees and family members to cash checks drawn on Brennick's various business accounts and to turn the money over to him.  The individual checks were for less than $10,000 each;  but the total withdrawn from his company accounts was often well over $10,000 a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no claim that Brennick was forbidden to withdraw the monies from the companies' accounts;  in fact, for most of them he was the sole proprietor, and for the remaining one he was the general partner.  The charge later brought against him was that the withdrawals were structured to avoid the filing of currency transaction reports and to deflect the attention of the tax authorities.  It is said that Brennick took much or all the money he withdrew and lost it in gambling:  he claims to have lost more than $1 million a year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the second half of 1992, Brennick's businesses began to suffer financial problems. Changes were occurring in the health care industry adversely affecting providers like Brennick.  Insurance reimbursements came more slowly and for lower amounts, while the costs of providing service increased.  In December 1992, one of the banks that had been lending money to Brennick failed and Brennick could not find another lender to replace it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the IRS began to investigate Brennick's pattern of chronically late payments.  In a meeting with an IRS agent on October 30, 1992, Brennick agreed to a payment plan, including a commitment to keep current on future payments.  He promised that his businesses would seek to expedite payments to the IRS and would cut his own pay and the pay of other executives in order to pay back taxes.  Instead, Brennick removed another $80,000 cash from the businesses in November 1992 and almost twice that amount in December.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Brennick now began to file false quarterly withholding tax returns for many of the companies.  Returns filed in the third and fourth quarter of 1992 incorrectly stated that Brennick had paid over to the government virtually all of the withheld taxes;  in truth, the companies in question had paid none of the taxes over to the IRS.  In two cases Brennick signed the false returns himself;  in other cases they were signed by employees, but Brennick was the person responsible for the withholding of the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, Brennick filed for reorganization of his businesses under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and later the case was transformed into a chapter 7 liquidation.  At the initial filing, Brennick owed the Treasury over $1.4 million in withheld taxes that should have been, but had not been, paid over to the government.  During reorganization, Brennick took additional funds out of the businesses for himself while failing to pay over the full amount of taxes withheld during the same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, a grand jury indicted Brennick.  In a superseding indictment, Brennick was charged with 22 counts of willful failure to account for, and pay over quarterly, specified withholding taxes, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7202;  nine counts of structuring currency transactions, 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5313, 5322 and 5324;  and one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the IRS, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7212(a).  There was an additional single charge of bankruptcy fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 152, but the jury later deadlocked on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1995, Brennick went on trial.  The government, in addition to offering evidence of the events already described, called several of Brennick's former employees who testified that Brennick had known the deadlines for paying over the withheld taxes but had deliberately chosen to ignore them even though his employees had sought to get him to pay over the taxes on a timely basis.  The bankruptcy fraud count aside, the jury convicted Brennick on all remaining counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a two-day proceeding to determine Brennick's sentence and after sentencing, issued a memorandum and order explaining the court's analysis.  United States v. Brennick, 949 F.Supp. 32 (D.Mass.1996).  After briefly setting out the background facts, the memorandum calculated the normal guideline range, referring (as we do) to the 1992 version of the guidelines.  Then, at length, it set out the framework for departures and the court's reasons for departing in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennick was convicted of violating three different statutes--failure to pay over withheld taxes, structuring, and obstructing the IRS--but the conduct was arguably related.  In any event, the district court chose to treat the offenses as closely related counts to be grouped under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2, and its choice is not disputed on this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Where counts are so grouped, the court selects the offense level for the violation among the group that has the highest offense level.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the highest offense level was generated by the offense of corruptly impeding tax officials under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7212(a).  Although no specific guideline exists for this offense (unless force is used), see U.S.S.G., appendix A, the court is directed to use the guideline for the offense most analogous to the criminal conduct of which the defendant was convicted.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2.  Here, the district court concluded that the closest analogy for the obstructive conduct was the offense of tax evasion, a violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201, for which a specific tax evasion guideline is set forth, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Brennick was not charged with tax evasion, this choice of analogy is not challenged by either side, and we accept it as reasonable for purposes of this appeal.  The government's obstruction charge embraced all of Brennick's behavior (deliberate underpayments, structuring, and other acts of falsity or concealment) and that conduct includes withholding revenues from the government combined with elements of conscious wrongdoing and personal gain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The base offense level for the tax evasion guideline is driven by the tax loss inflicted on the government, and in this case the undisputed level of the government's loss--\"more than $1,500,000\"--corresponds to offense level 18.  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2T1.1(a), 2T4.1(M).  The district court added two levels on the ground that Brennick had used \"sophisticated means\" to impede discovery of the offense, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T1.1(b)(2), and two more levels for obstruction of justice because of untruthful testimony by Brennick at trial, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given a total offense level of 22 (and a criminal history category I), the guideline range for Brennick was a term of imprisonment of 41 to 51 months.  From this range, the district court departed downward to level 13, for which the prescribed range for a defendant in criminal history category I is 12 to 18 months' imprisonment.  The court imposed a sentence of 13 months, as well as a fine of $6,000 and the statutory special assessment, noting that Brennick remained personally liable to the government for tax losses he had caused, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6672.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reasons for the departure were set forth in some detail but reflect two central themes:  first, that Brennick's intent was not as wicked as that of the typical tax evader because, despite some conscious wrongdoing, he did not intend permanently to deprive the government of the funds he failed to pay over;  and second, the ultimate losses to the government were due not merely to Brennick's conduct but to contributing causes as well, including failure of his business's main bank and adverse developments in the health care market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has now appealed to challenge the sentence.  It argues that the departure was based on a misconstruction of the guidelines and that even if a ground for departure exists in theory (which the government denies), the district court's decision to depart and degree of departure were unreasonable on the present facts.  We take the issues in that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Departures from the guideline range are allowed where \"the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b).  Sometimes, the guidelines identify a \"circumstance\" that is a permissible or forbidden basis for departure, sometimes further indicating that departure is encouraged or discouraged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent such explicit guidance, the Commission itself has told courts that they should treat each guideline as carving out a \"heartland\" representing \"a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.\"  U.S.S.G. ch. 1, pt.  A intro. comment 4(b).  \"When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted.\"  Id. If the characteristic is \"atypical\" and aggravates or mitigates the typical conduct, it may provide a basis for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a district court does depart, an aggrieved party may appeal from both the decision to depart and the extent of the departure.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742.  The standard of review varies with the nature of the issue involved, deference being limited or absent on abstract issues of law but more generous as to questions of law application and factfinding.  United States v. Black, 78 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 254, 136 L.Ed.2d 180 (1996).  The present case presents issues of all three kinds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the district court's determination that Brennick, although he had deliberately failed to pay the government the withheld wage and social security taxes at the time they were due, genuinely intended to pay them in due course.  In the district court's view, Brennick's main aim was to use the IRS as a bank.  It is not clear that the government directly challenges this finding, but in any case we think the finding is not clearly erroneous, the standard ordinarily applied to determinations of fact made at sentencing.  United States v. Pineda, 981 F.2d 569, 572 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennick's pattern before financial difficulties engulfed him was to retain the use of the funds in question for periods of four to six months and then to pay over the funds, adding penalties and interests.  The likelihood that he would be able to make this repayment obviously declined as troubles loomed in late 1992, but he continued to scramble for resources to continue payment.  Whether an intent to repay can be ascribed to all of the delays in payment is a more difficult issue.  See part III below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district judge's sentencing memorandum and order, she relied heavily upon this intention to repay to carve the present case out of the \"heartland\" of typical tax evasion cases.  The government says this rationale was a belated attempt to bolster a departure earlier premised on a different ground, namely, that there were multiple causes for the loss to the government.  Our own reading of the sentencing transcript suggests that the benign view of Brennick's intent was always an element in the district court's reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the scienter element in a tax evasion case is complicated to summarize given that different requirements may apply on different issues.  Still, the taxpayer usually is attempting to deprive the government permanently of taxes owed to it.  Typically, the instruction requires the government to prove that the defendant \"willfully evaded, or attempted to evade, income taxes with the intention of defrauding the government of taxes owed.\"   Leonard B. Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions:  Criminal p 59.01, Instruction 59-8 (1992) (emphasis added).  See, e.g., United States v. Aitken, 755 F.2d 188 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, it would do a defendant no good to say that he deliberately understated his income but sincerely intended to pay the money back to the government in five years' time.  But neither is it easy to imagine a fraud conviction where a defendant files an accurate return, intends shortly to pay in full, but remits the funds with interest shortly after the April 15 deadline.  Indeed, the guideline covering the failure to pay over payroll taxes notes in the commentary that \"[t]he offense is a felony that is infrequently prosecuted.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T1.6, commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we are inclined on the basis of the information we have and our common sense to think that such a temporary delay in payment--where the defendant expected to pay--is not a \"typical\" or \"heartland\" case of tax evasion.  Thus, even if the evasion statute and guideline might \"linguistically\" be extended to embrace such temporary delay cases, the intent to delay payment only briefly could take the case out of the heartland.  And, as already noted, the district court made such a finding in this case, sustainable at least as to much of the losses driving the guideline sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had another theme in its departure analysis.  It said that the $1.5 million loss suffered by the government overstated the seriousness of Brennick's offense, partly because the losses were due to multiple causes, some of which were not Brennick's fault or within his control (failure of his bank, the changes in health care reimbursement).  The government says that these concepts are part of the fraud guidelines and applying them to the tax crime guidelines is an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fraud guidelines, like the tax guidelines, set offense levels primarily based upon loss.  But the fraud guidelines alone refer in comment to the possibility of a departure where computed losses under- or overstate the seriousness of the offense;  likewise, the fraud guidelines alone at one time referred to multiple causes as a possible example of an overstatement and while that language has been deleted, they retain that concept in one of the examples.  Compare U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, application note 11 (1990) with application note 10 (1991).  See generally United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 406 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that provisions in one set of guidelines cannot normally be transferred to another separate set of guidelines.  See United States v. Smallwood, 920 F.2d 1231, 1238 (5th Cir.1991);  United States v. Anders, 899 F.2d 570, 580 (6th Cir.1990).  The guidelines for each offense or set of offenses tend to function as an integrated unit, containing their own tradeoffs and specifications.  Thus, without laying down an iron rule, we view skeptically any importation of language from another offense guideline, absent an explicit cross-reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this does not take the government very far.  The notion in the fraud guideline that the loss table may under- or overstate the seriousness of the offense is little more than another way of saying that departures from the loss table may be warranted for good cause.   Even if we treat the fraud guideline's language as generously inviting a search for such causes, the fact remains that the all-purpose departure provision remains available for tax cases whenever the case falls outside the heartland.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fraud guidelines' multiple-cause language is a more complicated matter.  The government says that the fraud guidelines may need such flexibility because of the diverse situations to which they must apply.  By contrast, it says, \"loss\" for tax purposes is based on calculations, set forth in the guidelines, that (in words of the brief) \"focus upon the amount due and owing at the time of the offense.\"   If a tax evader repays what was stolen, says the government, he merely deserves a few levels off for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tax loss seems to be a somewhat more protean concept than the government implies,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but we think that the argument is beside the point.  We are here concerned not with computing the loss--the parties have agreed that it should be treated as \"more than 1.5 million\"--but rather with whether a departure is proper.  And we are dealing not with a tax evader who stole the government's money and later had a change of heart but with someone who (accepting the district court's finding) never intended to steal the money at all (or at least most of it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, regardless of the fraud guideline, the facts mentioned by the district court in its causation analysis are obviously relevant even if the analysis is not.  To distinguish Brennick from the ordinary tax evader, it is essential to show that he did intend to pay over what was owed and was merely deferring payment.  This premise would be hard to sustain unless some other cause had contributed to his later failure to pay over the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This said, we think that it merely invites confusion to treat \"multiple causation\" as an independent basis for a departure.  And we think that to do so would be inconsistent with the normal presumption that provisions in one guideline are not to be read into the guideline for a different offense--absent an explicit cross reference or some other reason to believe that the Commission so intended.  We doubt that this emendation would alter the district court's desire to depart, but as a remand is required for other reasons, it is free to decide the point for itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a departure could be justified in theory in this case, we do not think that either the decision to depart or the amount of the departure has been adequately explained.  Our reasons are not the usual ones--that the departure is based on an impermissible ground or that there has been no effort to explain the degree of departure.  Rather, we think that factors weighing against any departure, and certainly one of this degree, received inadequate attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the guideline range for Brennick was 41 to 51 months;  and the 13-month sentence imposed was less than a third of the minimum and just over a quarter of the maximum.  A 13-month sentence would be the midpoint in the range for a first time offender who evaded or sought to evade $40,000 or more in taxes but had no other adjustment.  Brennick, of course, caused the government a tax loss of over $1,500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be easy enough to understand the sentence if Brennick had merely withheld a large payment, reasonably expecting to pay the money shortly but using it in the meantime for business purposes which then unexpectedly collapsed.  Absent loss to the government, there would probably not even be a prosecution in such a case;  and certainly the intent would be less culpable than in ordinary tax evasion.  But Brennick's actions and intentions were more serious than this abstraction allows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Brennick may in some sense have intended repayment, but the reasonableness, and perhaps even the possibility, of such a belief must have lessened over time.  To the eve of bankruptcy and apparently beyond, Brennick appears to have deferred payment to the government while withdrawing very substantial sums for his own use.  Without more findings, it would be hard to give Brennick the benefit of a bona fide intention to repay the entire loss, even if much of it may be encompassed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even apart from an intention to repay, Brennick's good faith is marred by dishonesty in at least two respects, (even apart from his falsehoods at trial which were the subject of a separate adjustment).  On a number of the later returns, Brennick falsely stated or had others misstate that the amounts due to the government had been paid when he knew that they had not.  And his elaborate structuring of withdrawals was effectively an effort to mislead and conceal, as perhaps also was his use of multiple employer identification numbers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Brennick committed the crime of structuring and the government points out that the structure counts alone, if no other offense had been committed, could easily have produced an adjusted offense level of 17,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and a guideline sentence of 24 to 30 months.  The minimum is almost twice the amount of Brennick's actual sentence after departure.  The government has not argued that this makes a departure impermissible as a matter of law, but it certainly bears on the reasonableness and degree of departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appreciate that where a ground for departure exists, the district court's discretion is at its zenith deciding both whether and how far to depart.  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49-50 (1st Cir.1989).  But the quid pro quo for departures is reviewability, including review for abuse of discretion, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(b)(3);  and even if review is hedged by deference, Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2046, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), it has to mean something.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we fail to see how a departure to 13 months can be justified as reasonable on this record in light of the three considerations set forth above, all of which appear to us relevant.  We have put to one side Brennick's gambling, the significance of which is a matter of reasonable dispute, and the government's claim that he deprived his employees of health care, which was neither a charged offense nor clearly relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possibly, even after these factors are considered and weighed in full, there is still warrant for a substantial departure, but we think that some further explanation is essential.  Indeed, while the district court takes note of Brennick's false filings, the government says that the discussion understates them;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  and the district court's decision does not squarely address our concerns about Brennick's good faith on the later losses or the import of the structuring guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence was not imposed casually:  the district court conducted a lengthy sentencing and wrote at length, addressing itself primarily to the government's objections--which we think are overstated.  The area is complicated;  there is little helpful precedent;  and Brennick's circumstances are unusual.  If it takes one more round to fine-tune the sentence, this is a price worth paying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court is free to consider whether its inclination to depart is affected by our conclusion that the fraud guideline should be put to one side.  Assuming not, we expect that in resentencing the district court will address the considerations that we have outlined.  While expressing doubt that a sentence of 13 months is justified, we impose no mechanical downward limit.  What procedure to follow on remand is entirely for the district court to decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence imposed by the district court is vacated in its entirety and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government says for the record that the structuring counts should have been grouped separately from the tax counts, which would have resulted in a one-level increase.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4.  But this caveat was not raised in the district court and is not pursued here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Tax loss is defined somewhat differently for the different tax offenses, compare U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2T1.1(a), 2T1.2(a), 2T1.3(a), and 2T1.6(a), and the tax table at 2T4.1 has changed over time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> That level might have been anywhere between 15 and 21.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.3(b)(2).  Brennick's two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice would presumably also have applied, generating a level of 17.

The district court calculated the range of imprisonment fixed by the sentencing guidelines at 41 to 51 months but then departed downward and imposed a sentence of 13 months' imprisonment.  The government now appeals, arguing that the downward departure was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Brennick was the president and sole proprietor of a number of head injury treatment centers in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.  He also operated one head trauma center in New Jersey as a limited partnership, Brennick being the general partner.  Some of the centers provided sophisticated medical treatment;  others appear to have been supported living centers for head injured patients.  Taken as a whole, the companies were a large and successful business venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employers like Brennick are required to withhold income taxes and social security taxes from employee paychecks on a periodic basis and to pay those amounts over to the Treasury.  The Internal Revenue Service specifies the periods for which such withholding is required.  Employers are required by law to deposit the withheld taxes into the Treasury within three days after the end of each such period.  Regular returns, specifying the amounts withheld and paid over, are also required on a quarterly basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1986 to 1992, Brennick followed a regular pattern of withholding the taxes from his employees' pay but delaying payment of the monies into the Treasury for a substantial period beyond the time due.  Normally his payments to the government were between two and six months after the due dates.  Brennick routinely filed returns accurately describing the amounts withheld, and when he ultimately made the delayed payments to the Treasury, he also paid the interest and penalties prescribed by law for late payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period, Brennick frequently withdrew money from his businesses by means that avoided bank reports to the IRS that are required when a person withdraws more than $10,000 from an individual bank on a single banking day.  Brennick told various of his employees and family members to cash checks drawn on Brennick's various business accounts and to turn the money over to him.  The individual checks were for less than $10,000 each;  but the total withdrawn from his company accounts was often well over $10,000 a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no claim that Brennick was forbidden to withdraw the monies from the companies' accounts;  in fact, for most of them he was the sole proprietor, and for the remaining one he was the general partner.  The charge later brought against him was that the withdrawals were structured to avoid the filing of currency transaction reports and to deflect the attention of the tax authorities.  It is said that Brennick took much or all the money he withdrew and lost it in gambling:  he claims to have lost more than $1 million a year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the second half of 1992, Brennick's businesses began to suffer financial problems. Changes were occurring in the health care industry adversely affecting providers like Brennick.  Insurance reimbursements came more slowly and for lower amounts, while the costs of providing service increased.  In December 1992, one of the banks that had been lending money to Brennick failed and Brennick could not find another lender to replace it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the IRS began to investigate Brennick's pattern of chronically late payments.  In a meeting with an IRS agent on October 30, 1992, Brennick agreed to a payment plan, including a commitment to keep current on future payments.  He promised that his businesses would seek to expedite payments to the IRS and would cut his own pay and the pay of other executives in order to pay back taxes.  Instead, Brennick removed another $80,000 cash from the businesses in November 1992 and almost twice that amount in December.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Brennick now began to file false quarterly withholding tax returns for many of the companies.  Returns filed in the third and fourth quarter of 1992 incorrectly stated that Brennick had paid over to the government virtually all of the withheld taxes;  in truth, the companies in question had paid none of the taxes over to the IRS.  In two cases Brennick signed the false returns himself;  in other cases they were signed by employees, but Brennick was the person responsible for the withholding of the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, Brennick filed for reorganization of his businesses under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and later the case was transformed into a chapter 7 liquidation.  At the initial filing, Brennick owed the Treasury over $1.4 million in withheld taxes that should have been, but had not been, paid over to the government.  During reorganization, Brennick took additional funds out of the businesses for himself while failing to pay over the full amount of taxes withheld during the same period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, a grand jury indicted Brennick.  In a superseding indictment, Brennick was charged with 22 counts of willful failure to account for, and pay over quarterly, specified withholding taxes, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7202;  nine counts of structuring currency transactions, 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5313, 5322 and 5324;  and one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the IRS, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7212(a).  There was an additional single charge of bankruptcy fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 152, but the jury later deadlocked on that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1995, Brennick went on trial.  The government, in addition to offering evidence of the events already described, called several of Brennick's former employees who testified that Brennick had known the deadlines for paying over the withheld taxes but had deliberately chosen to ignore them even though his employees had sought to get him to pay over the taxes on a timely basis.  The bankruptcy fraud count aside, the jury convicted Brennick on all remaining counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a two-day proceeding to determine Brennick's sentence and after sentencing, issued a memorandum and order explaining the court's analysis.  United States v. Brennick, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span> (D.Mass.1996).  After briefly setting out the background facts, the memorandum calculated the normal guideline range, referring (as we do) to the 1992 version of the guidelines.  Then, at length, it set out the framework for departures and the court's reasons for departing in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennick was convicted of violating three different statutes--failure to pay over withheld taxes, structuring, and obstructing the IRS--but the conduct was arguably related.  In any event, the district court chose to treat the offenses as closely related counts to be grouped under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2, and its choice is not disputed on this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Where counts are so grouped, the court selects the offense level for the violation among the group that has the highest offense level.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the highest offense level was generated by the offense of corruptly impeding tax officials under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7212(a).  Although no specific guideline exists for this offense (unless force is used), see U.S.S.G., appendix A, the court is directed to use the guideline for the offense most analogous to the criminal conduct of which the defendant was convicted.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2.  Here, the district court concluded that the closest analogy for the obstructive conduct was the offense of tax evasion, a violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201, for which a specific tax evasion guideline is set forth, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Brennick was not charged with tax evasion, this choice of analogy is not challenged by either side, and we accept it as reasonable for purposes of this appeal.  The government's obstruction charge embraced all of Brennick's behavior (deliberate underpayments, structuring, and other acts of falsity or concealment) and that conduct includes withholding revenues from the government combined with elements of conscious wrongdoing and personal gain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The base offense level for the tax evasion guideline is driven by the tax loss inflicted on the government, and in this case the undisputed level of the government's loss--\"more than $1,500,000\"--corresponds to offense level 18.  U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2T1.1(a), 2T4.1(M).  The district court added two levels on the ground that Brennick had used \"sophisticated means\" to impede discovery of the offense, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T1.1(b)(2), and two more levels for obstruction of justice because of untruthful testimony by Brennick at trial, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given a total offense level of 22 (and a criminal history category I), the guideline range for Brennick was a term of imprisonment of 41 to 51 months.  From this range, the district court departed downward to level 13, for which the prescribed range for a defendant in criminal history category I is 12 to 18 months' imprisonment.  The court imposed a sentence of 13 months, as well as a fine of $6,000 and the statutory special assessment, noting that Brennick remained personally liable to the government for tax losses he had caused, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6672.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reasons for the departure were set forth in some detail but reflect two central themes:  first, that Brennick's intent was not as wicked as that of the typical tax evader because, despite some conscious wrongdoing, he did not intend permanently to deprive the government of the funds he failed to pay over;  and second, the ultimate losses to the government were due not merely to Brennick's conduct but to contributing causes as well, including failure of his business's main bank and adverse developments in the health care market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has now appealed to challenge the sentence.  It argues that the departure was based on a misconstruction of the guidelines and that even if a ground for departure exists in theory (which the government denies), the district court's decision to depart and degree of departure were unreasonable on the present facts.  We take the issues in that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Departures from the guideline range are allowed where \"the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b).  Sometimes, the guidelines identify a \"circumstance\" that is a permissible or forbidden basis for departure, sometimes further indicating that departure is encouraged or discouraged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent such explicit guidance, the Commission itself has told courts that they should treat each guideline as carving out a \"heartland\" representing \"a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.\"  U.S.S.G. ch. 1, pt.  A intro. comment 4(b).  \"When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted.\"  Id. If the characteristic is \"atypical\" and aggravates or mitigates the typical conduct, it may provide a basis for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a district court does depart, an aggrieved party may appeal from both the decision to depart and the extent of the departure.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742.  The standard of review varies with the nature of the issue involved, deference being limited or absent on abstract issues of law but more generous as to questions of law application and factfinding.  United States v. Black, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196600\"><a href=\"/opinion/196600/united-states-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span> (1996).  The present case presents issues of all three kinds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the district court's determination that Brennick, although he had deliberately failed to pay the government the withheld wage and social security taxes at the time they were due, genuinely intended to pay them in due course.  In the district court's view, Brennick's main aim was to use the IRS as a bank.  It is not clear that the government directly challenges this finding, but in any case we think the finding is not clearly erroneous, the standard ordinarily applied to determinations of fact made at sentencing.  United States v. Pineda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596482\"><a href=\"/opinion/596482/united-states-v-ramon-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brennick's pattern before financial difficulties engulfed him was to retain the use of the funds in question for periods of four to six months and then to pay over the funds, adding penalties and interests.  The likelihood that he would be able to make this repayment obviously declined as troubles loomed in late 1992, but he continued to scramble for resources to continue payment.  Whether an intent to repay can be ascribed to all of the delays in payment is a more difficult issue.  See part III below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district judge's sentencing memorandum and order, she relied heavily upon this intention to repay to carve the present case out of the \"heartland\" of typical tax evasion cases.  The government says this rationale was a belated attempt to bolster a departure earlier premised on a different ground, namely, that there were multiple causes for the loss to the government.  Our own reading of the sentencing transcript suggests that the benign view of Brennick's intent was always an element in the district court's reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the scienter element in a tax evasion case is complicated to summarize given that different requirements may apply on different issues.  Still, the taxpayer usually is attempting to deprive the government permanently of taxes owed to it.  Typically, the instruction requires the government to prove that the defendant \"willfully evaded, or attempted to evade, income taxes with the intention of defrauding the government of taxes owed.\"   Leonard B. Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions:  Criminal p 59.01, Instruction 59-8 (1992) (emphasis added).  See, e.g., United States v. Aitken, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448137\"><a href=\"/opinion/448137/united-states-v-richard-a-aitken/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, it would do a defendant no good to say that he deliberately understated his income but sincerely intended to pay the money back to the government in five years' time.  But neither is it easy to imagine a fraud conviction where a defendant files an accurate return, intends shortly to pay in full, but remits the funds with interest shortly after the April 15 deadline.  Indeed, the guideline covering the failure to pay over payroll taxes notes in the commentary that \"[t]he offense is a felony that is infrequently prosecuted.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2T1.6, commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we are inclined on the basis of the information we have and our common sense to think that such a temporary delay in payment--where the defendant expected to pay--is not a \"typical\" or \"heartland\" case of tax evasion.  Thus, even if the evasion statute and guideline might \"linguistically\" be extended to embrace such temporary delay cases, the intent to delay payment only briefly could take the case out of the heartland.  And, as already noted, the district court made such a finding in this case, sustainable at least as to much of the losses driving the guideline sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court had another theme in its departure analysis.  It said that the $1.5 million loss suffered by the government overstated the seriousness of Brennick's offense, partly because the losses were due to multiple causes, some of which were not Brennick's fault or within his control (failure of his bank, the changes in health care reimbursement).  The government says that these concepts are part of the fraud guidelines and applying them to the tax crime guidelines is an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fraud guidelines, like the tax guidelines, set offense levels primarily based upon loss.  But the fraud guidelines alone refer in comment to the possibility of a departure where computed losses under- or overstate the seriousness of the offense;  likewise, the fraud guidelines alone at one time referred to multiple causes as a possible example of an overstatement and while that language has been deleted, they retain that concept in one of the examples.  Compare U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, application note 11 (1990) with application note 10 (1991).  See generally United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 406 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that provisions in one set of guidelines cannot normally be transferred to another separate set of guidelines.  See United States v. Smallwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552794\"><a href=\"/opinion/552794/united-states-v-robert-jesse-smallwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span>, 1238 (5th Cir.1991);  United States v. Anders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538856\"><a href=\"/opinion/538856/united-states-v-bonnie-sue-anders-89-5465-and-trumanda-weddle/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 580 (6th Cir.1990).  The guidelines for each offense or set of offenses tend to function as an integrated unit, containing their own tradeoffs and specifications.  Thus, without laying down an iron rule, we view skeptically any importation of language from another offense guideline, absent an explicit cross-reference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this does not take the government very far.  The notion in the fraud guideline that the loss table may under- or overstate the seriousness of the offense is little more than another way of saying that departures from the loss table may be warranted for good cause.   Even if we treat the fraud guideline's language as generously inviting a search for such causes, the fact remains that the all-purpose departure provision remains available for tax cases whenever the case falls outside the heartland.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fraud guidelines' multiple-cause language is a more complicated matter.  The government says that the fraud guidelines may need such flexibility because of the diverse situations to which they must apply.  By contrast, it says, \"loss\" for tax purposes is based on calculations, set forth in the guidelines, that (in words of the brief) \"focus upon the amount due and owing at the time of the offense.\"   If a tax evader repays what was stolen, says the government, he merely deserves a few levels off for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tax loss seems to be a somewhat more protean concept than the government implies,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but we think that the argument is beside the point.  We are here concerned not with computing the loss--the parties have agreed that it should be treated as \"more than 1.5 million\"--but rather with whether a departure is proper.  And we are dealing not with a tax evader who stole the government's money and later had a change of heart but with someone who (accepting the district court's finding) never intended to steal the money at all (or at least most of it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, regardless of the fraud guideline, the facts mentioned by the district court in its causation analysis are obviously relevant even if the analysis is not.  To distinguish Brennick from the ordinary tax evader, it is essential to show that he did intend to pay over what was owed and was merely deferring payment.  This premise would be hard to sustain unless some other cause had contributed to his later failure to pay over the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This said, we think that it merely invites confusion to treat \"multiple causation\" as an independent basis for a departure.  And we think that to do so would be inconsistent with the normal presumption that provisions in one guideline are not to be read into the guideline for a different offense--absent an explicit cross reference or some other reason to believe that the Commission so intended.  We doubt that this emendation would alter the district court's desire to depart, but as a remand is required for other reasons, it is free to decide the point for itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a departure could be justified in theory in this case, we do not think that either the decision to depart or the amount of the departure has been adequately explained.  Our reasons are not the usual ones--that the departure is based on an impermissible ground or that there has been no effort to explain the degree of departure.  Rather, we think that factors weighing against any departure, and certainly one of this degree, received inadequate attention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the guideline range for Brennick was 41 to 51 months;  and the 13-month sentence imposed was less than a third of the minimum and just over a quarter of the maximum.  A 13-month sentence would be the midpoint in the range for a first time offender who evaded or sought to evade $40,000 or more in taxes but had no other adjustment.  Brennick, of course, caused the government a tax loss of over $1,500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be easy enough to understand the sentence if Brennick had merely withheld a large payment, reasonably expecting to pay the money shortly but using it in the meantime for business purposes which then unexpectedly collapsed.  Absent loss to the government, there would probably not even be a prosecution in such a case;  and certainly the intent would be less culpable than in ordinary tax evasion.  But Brennick's actions and intentions were more serious than this abstraction allows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Brennick may in some sense have intended repayment, but the reasonableness, and perhaps even the possibility, of such a belief must have lessened over time.  To the eve of bankruptcy and apparently beyond, Brennick appears to have deferred payment to the government while withdrawing very substantial sums for his own use.  Without more findings, it would be hard to give Brennick the benefit of a bona fide intention to repay the entire loss, even if much of it may be encompassed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even apart from an intention to repay, Brennick's good faith is marred by dishonesty in at least two respects, (even apart from his falsehoods at trial which were the subject of a separate adjustment).  On a number of the later returns, Brennick falsely stated or had others misstate that the amounts due to the government had been paid when he knew that they had not.  And his elaborate structuring of withdrawals was effectively an effort to mislead and conceal, as perhaps also was his use of multiple employer identification numbers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Brennick committed the crime of structuring and the government points out that the structure counts alone, if no other offense had been committed, could easily have produced an adjusted offense level of 17,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and a guideline sentence of 24 to 30 months.  The minimum is almost twice the amount of Brennick's actual sentence after departure.  The government has not argued that this makes a departure impermissible as a matter of law, but it certainly bears on the reasonableness and degree of departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We appreciate that where a ground for departure exists, the district court's discretion is at its zenith deciding both whether and how far to depart.  United States v. Diaz-Villafane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49-50 (1st Cir.1989).  But the quid pro quo for departures is reviewability, including review for abuse of discretion, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(b)(3);  and even if review is hedged by deference, Koon v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span>, 2046, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996), it has to mean something.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we fail to see how a departure to 13 months can be justified as reasonable on this record in light of the three considerations set forth above, all of which appear to us relevant.  We have put to one side Brennick's gambling, the significance of which is a matter of reasonable dispute, and the government's claim that he deprived his employees of health care, which was neither a charged offense nor clearly relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possibly, even after these factors are considered and weighed in full, there is still warrant for a substantial departure, but we think that some further explanation is essential.  Indeed, while the district court takes note of Brennick's false filings, the government says that the discussion understates them;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  and the district court's decision does not squarely address our concerns about Brennick's good faith on the later losses or the import of the structuring guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence was not imposed casually:  the district court conducted a lengthy sentencing and wrote at length, addressing itself primarily to the government's objections--which we think are overstated.  The area is complicated;  there is little helpful precedent;  and Brennick's circumstances are unusual.  If it takes one more round to fine-tune the sentence, this is a price worth paying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court is free to consider whether its inclination to depart is affected by our conclusion that the fraud guideline should be put to one side.  Assuming not, we expect that in resentencing the district court will address the considerations that we have outlined.  While expressing doubt that a sentence of 13 months is justified, we impose no mechanical downward limit.  What procedure to follow on remand is entirely for the district court to decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence imposed by the district court is vacated in its entirety and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government says for the record that the structuring counts should have been grouped separately from the tax counts, which would have resulted in a one-level increase.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4.  But this caveat was not raised in the district court and is not pursued here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Tax loss is defined somewhat differently for the different tax offenses, compare U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 2T1.1(a), 2T1.2(a), 2T1.3(a), and 2T1.6(a), and the tax table at 2T4.1 has changed over time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> That level might have been anywhere between 15 and 21.  Under the 1992 guidelines, the structuring counts generated a base offense level of 13, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.3(a)(1), and would have been adjusted upward two levels for the amount of money involved.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.3(b)(2).  Brennick's two-level adjustment for obstruction of justice would presumably also have applied, generating a level of 17.  A further increase of four levels would have resulted if the court determined that \"the defendant knew or believed that the funds were criminally derived property.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.3(b)(1)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court mentioned two returns filed by Brennick falsely claiming that the amount indicated was paid in full.
