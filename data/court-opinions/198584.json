Juan M. Prez-Gimnez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Reavley, Senior Circuit Judge,*\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Rachel Brill for appellant.\r\n   Thomas M. Gannon, attorney, Department of Justice, with whom\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 2, 1999\r\n\n   *Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.\r\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  This case involves a large drug\r\ntrafficking organization that imported cocaine from Colombia and\r\ndistributed it in Puerto Rico and New York from 1986 until 1990. \r\nIn April 1991, as the climax of a lengthy investigation, a federal\r\ngrand jury returned a thirty-four count superseding indictment\r\ncharging defendant-appellant Eusebio Escobar-de Jess (\"Escobar\")\r\nand seventeen other individuals not parties to this appeal with\r\nvarious drug-related offenses.  In April 1993, a jury convicted\r\nEscobar of sixteen drug, assault, and weapons-related counts,\r\nincluding Count 1, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in\r\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.  848(a) &amp; (c), and Count 12, causing an\r\nintentional killing while engaged in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C.  848(e).  This appeal\r\nfollowed, the disposition of which was deferred pending the Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in United States v. Richardson, 119 S. Ct. 1717\r\n(1999), on juror unanimity requirements applicable to a continuing\r\ncriminal enterprise charge.  After careful consideration of the\r\nrecord and Escobar's many arguments on appeal, we affirm all of the\r\nconvictions.  \r\nI.  Background\r\nWe recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\nverdicts, consistent with support in the record. See United States\r\nv. Rodrguez, 162 F.3d 135, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  We summarize\r\nbelow the facts presented during the trial, providing additional\r\ndetails as they become relevant to the discussion.\r\nThe March 26, 1986 Lajas Incident\r\nLargely through the testimony of cooperating co-defendant\r\nEdwin Soto-Osorio (\"Soto\"), the government established that on \r\nMarch 26, 1986, Escobar directed Soto and co-defendants Florentino\r\nRivera-Mojica (\"Rivera\") and Antonio Santos-Caraballo (\"Santos\") to\r\naccompany him to a dirt road in the middle of a sugar cane field in\r\nLajas to meet a plane containing cocaine from Colombia.  To\r\ndemarcate the makeshift landing strip, the men placed white lights\r\nalong the beginning of the road and yellow lights along the end of\r\nthe road.  The lights were powered by a car battery.  After the\r\nplane crash-landed, the four men and several other individuals\r\nassociated with Escobar retrieved much of the plane's drug cargo\r\nand transported it to nearby Loza. Following the departure of\r\nEscobar and his associates, law enforcement officers arrived at the\r\nscene of the crash and discovered cocaine in the plane.       \r\nThe April 14, 1986 Shooting of Customs Agents\r\nOn April 14, 1986, co-defendant Eric Flores-Rivera\r\n(\"Flores\") drove a yellow truck to the Isla Grande airport and\r\nobtained more than one hundred gallons of aviation gasoline. \r\nSurveilling agents then observed Flores drive the yellow truck into\r\nthe Potrero Cuevas Farm (\"the farm\") near Carolina.  An agent also\r\nobserved a blue truck driven by co-defendant Andrs Morales-Cruz\r\n(\"Morales\") enter the farm.  Waiting outside the farm, agents heard\r\na plane flying overhead.  Shortly thereafter, agents observed the\r\nyellow truck, a white van, and a blue truck driven by Escobar and\r\ncarrying six passengers (four dressed in camouflage) leave the\r\nfarm.  Two of the surveilling agents followed the white van to a\r\nnearby town, where the van suddenly reversed direction and its\r\noccupants opened fire on the agents.  Both agents were seriously\r\nwounded.\r\nIn the days following the shootings, agents searched the\r\nvicinity of the farm and discovered a clandestine landing strip\r\nmade of dirt.  They also found, inter alia, twenty heavy-duty lamps\r\nthat had been purchased by Escobar, batteries, and a string that\r\nhad been stretched along the makeshift landing strip.  Escobar's\r\nfingerprints were on one of the lamps, and more than sixty gallons\r\nof the aviation fuel which had been brought to the farm by Flores\r\nwere gone.  Agents found the white van used in the shooting in the\r\nLoza River on April 16.       \r\nThe November 1989 Intercepted Cocaine Shipment\r\nIn 1989 federal authorities began an investigation of\r\nEscobar that included court-ordered electronic surveillance and the\r\nuse of a confidential informant named William Cedrs.  In order to\r\ninfiltrate Escobar's organization, Cedrs began managing a Loza\r\ngrocery store and bakery, and, through his acquaintances with co-\r\ndefendants Rivera and Hctor Ros-Velsquez (\"Ros\"), was\r\nintroduced to Escobar.  Through his infiltration of Escobar's\r\norganization, Cedrs learned that Escobar directed an organization\r\nof at least fourteen members. \r\nIn early November 1989, Escobar and Rivera made plans to\r\ndeliver a shipment of cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York on a\r\ncommercial airlines flight. Cedrs expressed interest in\r\nparticipating in the delivery, and Escobar agreed.  On November 21,\r\nco-defendant Fernando Faccio-Laboy (\"Faccio\") delivered eighty\r\nkilograms of cocaine to Escobar, who in turn delivered the cocaine\r\nto Cedrs in five suitcases.  Rivera and Cedrs placed official\r\ninspection seals from the United States Department of Agriculture\r\non the five suitcases and presented them at the check-in counter at\r\nthe airport.  Rivera and Cedrs boarded the flight, but the\r\nsuitcases were seized upon arrival in New York by federal\r\nauthorities.  Rivera called Escobar in Puerto Rico to report the\r\nsituation.  Escobar later met with Faccio and a representative of\r\nthe Ochoa family, part of Colombia's Medelln cartel, to discuss\r\nthe lost cocaine.   \r\nDecember 1989:  Planning for Future Importations\r\nIn December 1989 Escobar began to plan additional\r\nimportations of cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico.  On December\r\n9 and December 13, Escobar and several subordinates traveled to\r\nVieques, Puerto Rico, to inspect potential sites for clandestine\r\nairstrips to use in importing approximately 1,500 kilograms of\r\ncocaine from the Medelln and Cali cartels in Colombia.  On or\r\nabout December 20, Escobar and his subordinates also discussed the\r\npossibility of using a plane to drop the cocaine into the ocean\r\nnear Gunica, where it would be picked up by speedboats directed by\r\nco-defendants Soto and Santos.  During the month of December 1989\r\nEscobar also discussed cocaine importation with Jos Alberto Ochoa-\r\nVasco (\"Ochoa\"), a representative of the Medelln cartel. \r\nThe Murder of Martn Matos-Cruz\r\nAccording to Cedrs's testimony, in December 1989 Escobar\r\nasked him to kill Martn Matos-Cruz (\"Matos\"), who was the third-\r\nranking member of Escobar's organization and had fallen out of\r\nfavor with Escobar.  On January 2, 1990, however, Escobar told\r\nCedrs that he had found another person, co-defendant Michael Cruz-\r\nGonzlez (\"Cruz\"), to kill Matos.  The same day, Escobar and Cruz\r\ntraveled to Carolina to identify Matos's residence, and on January\r\n3, according to Cedrs's testimony, Cruz shot and killed Matos\r\noutside Matos's residence.  On January 5, at Escobar's request,\r\nCedrs gave Cruz $1,500 as a partial payment for the murder.      \r\nThe March 1990 Attempted Importation\r\n     Throughout January and February 1990, Escobar and his\r\nconfederates continued to plan drug importations, meeting at least\r\nfifteen times to discuss the logistics of the effort.  Between\r\nMarch 5 and March 13, Escobar was in repeated telephone contact\r\nwith several individuals, including Soto, regarding an anticipated\r\ncocaine delivery.  On March 13, Escobar and his men attempted to\r\nimport 320 kilograms of cocaine by air, but the flight was\r\nintercepted by Coast Guard and Customs Service aircraft, causing it\r\nto break off and return to Colombia.  \r\nFollowing this aborted importation, Escobar and his\r\nconfederates continued to meet during March and April to discuss\r\nother ways to successfully import cocaine to Puerto Rico.  On April\r\n2, Mesa informed Escobar by telephone that a shipment of cocaine\r\nwas ready for delivery and that he should arrange to receive it. \r\nShortly thereafter, however, Escobar entered a drug rehabilitation\r\nprogram in order to avoid revocation of his parole.  Cedrs\r\nreplaced him in meetings with representatives of the Medelln and\r\nCali cartels, and kept Escobar informed of developments.  On April\r\n8, Cedrs and Flores met Escobar at the drug rehabilitation\r\nfacility to discuss arrangements for the importation.  Before the\r\nimportation could be executed, however, Escobar was arrested.\r\nII.  The Jury Instructions\r\nA.  Continuing Criminal Enterprise\r\nSection 848, often referred to as the \"kingpin\" statute,\r\nmakes it a crime to engage in a \"continuing criminal enterprise.\" \r\nThe statute provides:\r\n  [A] person is engaged in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise if \r\n\n  (1) he violates any provision of [the federal\r\ndrug laws, i.e.,] this subchapter or\r\nsubchapter II of this chapter the punishment\r\nfor which is a felony, and\r\n\n  (2) such violation is part of a continuing\r\nseries of violations of [the federal drug\r\nlaws, i.e.,] this subchapter or subchapter II\r\nof this chapter  \r\n\n      (A) which are undertaken by such person in\r\n  concert with five or more other persons\r\n  with respect to whom such person occupies\r\n  a position of organizer [or supervisor or\r\n  manager] and \r\n\n      (B) from which such person obtains\r\n  substantial income or resources.\r\n\n21 U.S.C.  848(c).  In this case, the jury convicted Escobar of\r\nCount 1, charging that he had engaged in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise (\"CCE\") from on or about April 1986 until the date the\r\nindictment was filed, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  848(a) &amp; (c); and\r\nof Count 12, charging that he had caused the killing of Martn\r\nMatos-Cruz while engaged in the CCE, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \r\n848(e)(1)(A). \r\nOn appeal Escobar argues that the district court erred in\r\nfailing to grant his proposal to instruct the jurors that, in order\r\nto convict under section 848, they must agree unanimously on which\r\nunderlying violations   of the ten alleged   constituted the three\r\nrelated violations necessary to establish a \"continuing series.\"\r\nSee United States v. Chagra, 653 F.2d 26, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1981)\r\n(noting that other courts have required at least three violations\r\nfor a \"continuing series\").  Although recent Supreme Court\r\nauthority confirms that the district court did err, we conclude\r\nthat the error in this case was harmless.\r\nIn United States v. Richardson, 119 S. Ct. 1707 (1999),\r\nthe Supreme Court addressed the question whether a jury must agree\r\nunanimously about which specific predicate violations make up the\r\n\"continuing series of violations.\"  That question turned on whether \r\nthe existence of a \"series\" is itself a single element, as to which\r\nthe violations are merely underlying \"brute facts\" not requiring\r\njuror unanimity, or whether the individual violations in that\r\nseries are themselves elements of the offense. See id. at 1710. \r\nUnder the former interpretation, jurors, in order to find that a\r\ndefendant committed a \"continuing series of violations\" within the\r\nmeaning of section 848, would need to agree unanimously only that\r\nthe defendant had engaged in a continuing series of at least three\r\nviolations; individual jurors would be free to find that continuing\r\nseries based on the same, overlapping, or entirely different\r\nviolations.  See id.  Thus, under this theory, a defendant could be\r\nconvicted of the CCE offense even if jurors could not agree\r\nunanimously that the defendant committed any of the alleged\r\nviolations.  For example, half of the jurors might find that\r\noffenses A, B, and C, but no others, were committed and constituted\r\na continuing series, and the other half of the jurors might find\r\nthat offenses D, E, and F, but no others, were committed and\r\nconstituted a continuing series.  \r\nRelying on considerations of language, tradition, and\r\npotential unfairness, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that\r\nthe \"violations\" referred to in section 848 are simply fungible\r\nmeans of satisfying the \"series\" element of section 848.  See id.\r\nat 1709-13.  Rather, the Court held that those \"violations\" are\r\nthemselves elements of the offense, meaning that jury unanimity in\r\nrespect to each individual violation is necessary.  See id. \r\nAccordingly, in cases where the government introduces evidence that\r\nthe defendant has committed more underlying drug crimes than\r\nlegally necessary to make up a \"series,\" Richardson requires that\r\nthey agree unanimously about which crimes make up the continuing\r\nseries.  See id. at 1709.\r\nIn light of Richardson, the government concedes that the\r\ndistrict court erred by failing to instruct the jurors that the\r\n\"violations\" are themselves elements of the CCE offense and that\r\nthey therefore must agree unanimously about which three (or more)\r\ndrug crimes the defendant committed.  The government argues,\r\nhowever, that the court's error was harmless because the jury\r\nseparately convicted Escobar of Counts 10, 19, 20, 23, 24, and 33,\r\nwhich were six of the ten predicate offenses alleged to constitute\r\nthe series.  See supra note 6.  Thus, the government observes, the\r\njurors must have unanimously agreed that Escobar committed six of\r\nthe alleged violations, which was more than enough to constitute a\r\n\"series.\"  See Chagra, 653 F.2d at 27-28. \r\nWe have previously recognized that some uncertainty\r\nexists about whether a jury instruction that misdefines or omits an\r\nelement of the offense charged is susceptible to harmless error\r\nreview. See United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564, 573 (1st Cir.\r\n1995); United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1309, 1309 n.12 (1st\r\nCir. 1994) (collecting cases).  The Supreme Court recently\r\naddressed this question in Neder v. United States, 119 S. Ct. 1827\r\n(1999), in which the Court ruled that the trial court's omission\r\nduring its jury instructions of an essential element of the offense\r\ncharged (namely, the materiality element of a tax offense) is\r\nsubject to harmless error review.  See id. at 1833-36.  In Neder,\r\nthe Court observed that an error is \"structural,\" and therefore not\r\nsubject to harmless error review, only in a \"'very limited class of\r\ncases,'\" id. at 1833 (quoting Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S.\r\n461, 468 (1997)), and that it had on many occasions applied\r\nharmless error analysis to cases involving improper instructions on\r\na single element of the offense, see id. at 1834 (citing Yates v.\r\nEvatt, 500 U.S. 391 (1991) (mandatory rebuttable presumption);\r\nCarella v. California, 491 U.S. 263 (1989) (per curiam) (mandatory\r\nconclusive presumption); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497 (1987)\r\n(misstatement of element); Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570 (1986)\r\n(mandatory presumption)).  Such omissions, the Court stated,\r\n\"differ[] markedly from the constitutional violations we have found\r\nto defy harmless-error review,\" such as the complete denial of\r\ncounsel or trial before a biased judge. Id. at 1833.  Accordingly,\r\nwhere a court omits or misdescribes an essential element of the\r\noffense, as happened here by the court's failure to instruct the\r\njury that the \"violations\" were themselves elements of the CCE\r\ncrime and that they therefore must agree unanimously which\r\nviolations make up the \"continuing series,\" the conviction must\r\nnonetheless be affirmed if the reviewing court can conclude beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the\r\ndefendant guilty absent the error.  See id. at 1838.\r\nIn this case, the jury's decision to convict Escobar on\r\nCounts 10, 19, 20, 23, 24, and 33   which were alleged to be\r\npredicate violations supporting the CCE count    necessarily\r\nestablishes that the jurors agreed unanimously that he was guilty\r\nof those offenses.  This decision ensures that the concern at the\r\ncore of the Richardson decision   namely, that jurors might convict\r\na defendant of a CCE on the basis of violations for which there was\r\nnon-unanimity   is not present.  The guilty verdicts on Counts 10,\r\n19, 20, 23, 24, and 33 are tantamount to the jury having found \r\nthat he committed each of these violations for the purposes of the\r\nCCE count. \r\nThat is not the end of the matter, however.  Section 848\r\nalso requires that jurors agree that the \"series\" of violations be\r\n\"continuing\" in nature   that is, that they be related to each\r\nother in some way.  See United States v. Edmonds, 80 F.3d 810, 814\r\n(3d Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. Jones, 801 F.2d 304, 307\r\n(8th Cir. 1986); United States v. Baker, 905 F.2d 1100, 1104 (7th\r\nCir. 1990)).  Although the guilty verdicts on Counts 10, 19, 20,\r\n23, 24, and 33 erase as a matter of logic any concern that the jury\r\ndid not agree that Escobar actually committed the offenses making\r\nup the series, we can affirm the CCE convictions only if we can\r\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury, had it been\r\nproperly instructed, would have found that at least three of those\r\ncounts were related to each other. \r\nThe evidence introduced to support the separate\r\nconvictions on those counts also establishes inescapably their\r\nrelatedness.  The counts involved Escobar's ongoing and persistent\r\nefforts to import and distribute cocaine over a finite period of\r\ntime in late 1989 and early 1990.  After the failed importation\r\nattempt in late 1989 (Count 10), Escobar re-grouped and tried again\r\nin March 1990 (Counts 19, 20, 23, and 24).  After failing once\r\nagain in March, he began planning for another attempt in April 1990\r\n(Count 33).  The relatedness of the counts is demonstrated by their\r\nproximity in time and identity of purpose, and we conclude beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that the jury, had it been properly instructed,\r\nwould have found that the counts were \"continuing\" in nature.  See\r\nid. at 825; United States v. King, 169 F.3d 1035, 1041 (6th Cir.\r\n1989).  Accordingly, we conclude that the court's refusal to\r\ninstruct the jurors that they must agree unanimously about which\r\nviolations make up the \"continuing series\" of violations, within\r\nthe meaning of section 848(c)(2), was harmless.  \r\nB. The Telephone Facilitation Counts\r\nEscobar also argues that the district court erred in its\r\ninstructions to the jury on three telephone facilitation counts,\r\nwhich charged him with using a telephone in facilitating the\r\nimportation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  843(b). \r\nSpecifically, Escobar contends that the district court should have\r\nexpressly instructed the jury that in order to convict under\r\nsection 843(b), it had to find that the underlying drug offenses\r\nalleged to have been facilitated by his telephone use   namely, the\r\nimportations   were actually committed.  Because Escobar did not\r\nobject to the district court's instructions during the trial and\r\nraises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review only for\r\nplain error.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); Johnson v. United States,\r\n520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\r\n732 (1993). \r\nThe federal courts have uniformly held that, to obtain a\r\nconviction on a charge of telephone facilitation pursuant to\r\nsection 843, the government must prove commission of the underlying\r\noffense.  See United States v. Iennaco, 893 F.2d 394, 396-97 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1990); United States v. Dotson, 895 F.2d 263, 264 (6th Cir.\r\n1990)(citing United States v. McGhee, 854 F.2d 905, 908 (6th Cir.\r\n1988)); United States v. Johnstone, 856 F.2d 539, 543 (3d Cir.\r\n1988); United States v. Mims, 812 F.2d 1068, 1077 (8th Cir. 1987);\r\nUnited States v. Russo, 796 F.2d 1443, 1463-64 (11th Cir. 1986);\r\nUnited States v. Rey, 641 F.2d 222, 224 n.6 (5th Cir. 1981); United\r\nStates v. Webster, 639 F.2d 174, 189 (4th Cir. 1981); United States\r\nv. Watson, 594 F.2d 1330, 1342-43 (10th Cir. 1979); United States\r\nv. Steinberg, 525 F.2d 1126, 1133-34 (2d Cir. 1975).  But Escobar's\r\nchallenge, though predicated on section 843(b)'s requirement that\r\nthe underlying drug offense have been committed, is more specific: \r\nhe assigns error to the district court's failure to expressly\r\ncharge the jury regarding this requirement (over and above\r\nrecitation of the statutory language). On this narrower\r\ninstructional point, there is little authority.  Indeed, we have\r\ndiscovered only one case that has addressed whether a district\r\ncourt must instruct the jury in the manner urged by Escobar.  See\r\nDotson, 895 F.2d at 263 (holding that the district court should\r\nhave expressly charged the jury that it had to find underlying\r\ncrimes were actually committed, but concluding that the court's\r\nerror was harmless). \r\nAlthough the language of section 843(b) itself arguably\r\nconveys without any need for elaboration the requirement of a jury\r\nfinding that the underlying drug offense was committed, we agree\r\nthat an instruction would have clarified any potential ambiguity in\r\nsection 843(b)'s language on that point.  See id. at 264.  However,\r\ngiven the scarcity of authority mandating such an instruction,\r\ncombined with the nature of the alleged instructional error, we\r\ncannot conclude that any error in the court's instructions was\r\n\"plain,\" see Olano, 507 U.S. at 734 (for the purposes of Rule\r\n52(b), the word \"plain\" is synonymous with \"clear,\" or,\r\nequivalently, \"obvious\"), or that it affected Escobar's substantial\r\nrights or denigrated the judicial proceedings, see Johnson, 520\r\nU.S. at 467. \r\nIII.  The Jury Selection\r\nWe next consider Escobar's Batson-based claim that his\r\nconvictions must be vacated because of deficiencies in the jury\r\nselection process.  See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). \r\nHis argument, although difficult to parse, appears to be two-\r\npronged. First, he contends that the district court's conclusion\r\nthat he failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in\r\nthe government's use of its peremptory strikes was clearly\r\nerroneous.  Alternatively, he says that even if he did fail to\r\nestablish a prima facie case, the district court's erroneous ruling\r\non voir dire questions made it impossible for him to establish a\r\nprima facie case. We disagree with both contentions.  \r\nDuring the jury selection process, defense counsel \r\nrequested the court to order that the government provide race-\r\nneutral explanations for its peremptory strikes of two African-\r\nAmerican men, contending that these strikes demonstrated a\r\n\"pattern\" of removing African-American men that raised an inference\r\nof racial discrimination. The government denied that the strikes\r\nwere racially motivated, but did not offer a race-neutral\r\nexplanation. The court denied Escobar's request, reasoning that six\r\nor seven African-American individuals remained in the jury pool and\r\nthat there was insufficient evidence to establish a \"pattern\" of\r\nstrikes.    \r\n The three-part framework that must be applied to equal\r\nprotection challenges to the government's use of a peremptory\r\nstrike is well established.  First, a defendant must make a prima\r\nfacie showing of discrimination in the government's use of its\r\nperemptory strike.  See Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-97.  If the\r\ndefendant fulfills this requirement, the government must then\r\nproffer a race-neutral explanation for having challenged the juror. \r\nSee id. at 97. Finally, if the government meets its burden of\r\nproduction by proffering a race-neutral explanation, the district\r\ncourt must then decide whether the defendant has carried the\r\nultimate burden of proving that the government's use of its\r\nperemptory strike constituted purposeful discrimination.  See id.;\r\nHernndez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-59 (1991).  In challenging\r\nthe government's use of peremptory strikes, the defendant retains\r\nthe burden of proof throughout. See United States v. Bergodere, 40\r\nF.3d 512, 515 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r\nAlthough the prima facie case requirement \"is not\r\nonerous, neither can it be taken for granted.\"  Bergodere, 40 F.3d\r\nat 516.  To satisfy his burden of establishing a prima facie case,\r\nEscobar was required to have shown, inter alia, \"circumstances\r\nsufficient . . . to raise an inference that the prosecutor struck\r\nthe venireperson on account of race.\"  Id.  All relevant\r\ncircumstances are to be considered in determining whether the\r\ndefendant has established a prima facie case, see Batson, 476 U.S.\r\nat 96-97; Chakouian v. Moran, 975 F.2d 931, 933-34 (1st Cir. 1992),\r\nand the district court's ruling on this fact-sensitive question\r\nmust be upheld unless it is clearly erroneous, see Bergodere, 40\r\nF.3d at 516. \r\nAlthough it is true that a \"pattern\" of strikes against\r\nAfrican-Americans is one circumstance which may raise an inference\r\nof discrimination, see Batson, 476 U.S. at 97, the district court's\r\nconclusion that the government's two strikes failed to demonstrate\r\nsuch a \"pattern\" was not clearly erroneous, particularly in light\r\nof the court's observation that six or seven African-Americans were\r\nseated in the jury pool at the time of the strikes and that six or\r\nseven African-Americans were eventually selected to serve on the\r\njury.  See, e.g., United States v. Sangineto-Miranda, 859 F.2d\r\n1501, 1521-22 (6th Cir. 1988) (noting that composition of the\r\nultimate jury sworn may be relevant to Batson prima facie inquiry). \r\nMoreover, Escobar does not suggest, nor do we discern, that the\r\nprosecutor's questions and statements during the voir dire\r\nexamination of potential jurors raise any inference of racially\r\nmotivated strikes. See id. (noting that \"the prosecutor's questions\r\nand statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his\r\nchallenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory\r\npurpose\").  We find no clear error in this case.      \r\nAlternatively, Escobar points out that during voir dire\r\nhe proposed that the district court ask potential jurors questions\r\nrelated to racial bias, which he argued were necessary because\r\nEscobar is African-American and because \"there is racism in Puerto\r\nRico.\"  The court denied the request, reasoning that there was no\r\nindication that racial animosity or racial motive was an issue in\r\nthe case.  Escobar now claims that the court's refusal to question\r\njurors about their potential racial bias hindered his later efforts\r\nto establish a prima facie case of discriminatory intent in the\r\ngovernment's use of its peremptory strikes to remove the two\r\nAfrican-American men during the jury selection process.\r\nTo the extent that Escobar does in fact challenge\r\ndirectly the court's denial of his request to question potential\r\njurors about racial prejudice (and it is unclear whether he makes\r\nthis challenge), we find that the voir dire conducted in this case\r\nwas sufficient.  While the Supreme Court has held that under\r\ncertain circumstances the possibility of racial prejudice makes\r\nspecial voir dire questioning constitutionally mandated, see Turner\r\nv. Murray, 476 U.S. 28 (1986) (involving sentencing of black\r\ndefendant who had been convicted of a capital offense); Ham v.\r\nSouth Carolina, 409 U.S. 524 (1973)(involving black civil rights\r\nactivist whose defense to drug charge was that he had been framed\r\nby white police), voir dire ordinarily need not include questions\r\nregarding racial prejudice, see United States v. Brown, 938 F.2d\r\n1482, 1485 (1st Cir. 1991).  \"The mere fact that a defendant is\r\nblack does not alone trigger the special questioning requirement\r\nfound in Ham and Turner.\"  Id.  Rather, it is \"[o]nly when there\r\nare more substantial indications of the likelihood of racial or\r\nethnic prejudice\" that a trial court is required to ask potential\r\njurors about the issue of racial bias.  Id. (quoting Rosales-Lpez\r\nv. United States, 451 U.S. 182, 190 (1981)).  The only\r\njustifications for the special questioning asserted by defense\r\ncounsel were that his client is African-American and that \"racism\r\nexists in Puerto Rico.\"  Standing alone, these are not the special\r\ncircumstances that would require a district court to ask potential\r\njurors if racial prejudice would be a factor in their decision-\r\nmaking process.  \r\nFurthermore, we fail to perceive how the district court's\r\nrefusal to question jurors about racial bias impeded Escobar's\r\nability to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the\r\ngovernment's use of its peremptory strikes, and Escobar does not\r\nadequately explain the connection.  Even if the court had granted\r\nEscobar's request to question potential jurors about racial bias,\r\nsuch questioning would have revealed only the potential jurors'\r\nracial biases, enabling either party to remove prejudiced jurors\r\nfor cause.  We do not see how such questioning could have shed\r\nlight on the government's allegedly improper motives for exercising\r\nits peremptory strikes, evidence of which was lacking in Escobar's\r\nefforts to establish a prima facie case under Batson.  \r\nFinally, Escobar challenges the constitutionality of 28\r\nU.S.C.  1865(b)(2) &amp; (3), which require that jurors be able to\r\nspeak the English language and be able to read, write, and\r\nunderstand the English language with a degree of proficiency\r\nsufficient to fill out satisfactorily the juror qualification form. \r\nHaving previously considered and rejected this contention, see\r\nUnited States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 326, 326 n.4 (1st Cir.\r\n1995)(citing United States v. Aponte-Surez, 905 F.2d 483, 992 (1st\r\nCir. 1990)), we decline to revisit the issue.\r\nIV.  Prosecutorial Misconduct\r\nEscobar claims that cooperating co-defendant Soto's\r\ntestimony created a false impression about the extent to which Soto\r\ncould benefit from pleading guilty and testifying for the\r\ngovernment, and that the prosecutor's failure to correct this\r\nmisleading testimony resulted in reversible error.  We find nothing\r\nfalse or misleading about Soto's testimony.         \r\nBefore Escobar's trial, Soto entered into a plea\r\nagreement which provided, inter alia, that he would plead guilty to\r\na drug conspiracy count; that he understood that he may be\r\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment not less than ten years; that\r\nhe acknowledged that the government could move the court to impose\r\na sentence below the sentencing range dictated by the sentencing\r\nguidelines based on his substantial assistance; and that if he\r\nfully complied with the agreement, the government would not\r\nprosecute him for other drug crimes resulting from information\r\nprovided by him and that the government would move to dismiss the\r\nremaining charges against him.  \r\nDuring the trial, Escobar's defense counsel cross-\r\nexamined Soto about the plea agreement, asking inter alia whether\r\nSoto was aware that the government had the discretion to move the\r\ncourt to impose a sentence of less than ten years.  Soto responded\r\nthat he was not aware of this; that he expected to receive a\r\nsentence of eight to ten years instead of the thirty years to life\r\nwhich would have been imposed if he had not entered into the plea\r\nagreement; and that he had discussed the plea agreement with his\r\nattorney only in a \"overall way\" and not \"part by part.\"  Escobar\r\nnow claims reversible error based on Soto's failure to disclose\r\nthat the government could move the court to impose a sentence below\r\nthe statutory minimum and the government's silence on the matter. \r\nIt is true, of course, that the government may not\r\nknowingly use false testimony to obtain a conviction, even if the\r\nfalse testimony goes only to a witness's credibility.  See Napue v.\r\nIllinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959) (finding due process violation\r\nwhere witness falsely denied that he would receive any benefit from\r\ngovernment in exchange for his testimony).  In this case, however,\r\nSoto's testimony simply cannot be characterized as false or\r\nmisleading.  First, the plea agreement itself simply stated that\r\nthe government had the discretion to move the court to impose a\r\nsentence below the statutory minimum.  The government had not\r\npromised to file such a motion.  Moreover, Escobar points to\r\nnothing in the record suggesting that Soto was not truthful about\r\nhis understanding of the plea agreement and what his sentence was\r\nlikely to be.  When questioned about the numerous benefits he had\r\nbeen promised pursuant to the agreement, Soto testified\r\nforthrightly, and there can be little doubt that the jury was\r\npresented with sufficient evidence to allow it to make a\r\ndiscriminating appraisal of Soto's motives to testify.  See United\r\nStates v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 293 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\n\nV.  Evidentiary Matters\r\n   A.  The March 26, 1986 Lajas Incident\r\nEscobar argues that the court erred by allowing the\r\nintroduction of evidence, including the testimony of co-operating\r\nco-defendant Soto, concerning the March 26, 1986 airdrop at Lajas\r\n(\"the Lajas incident\").  Escobar characterizes the Lajas incident\r\nas evidence of a prior bad act, and contends that the district\r\ncourt erred by concluding that it was admissible under Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 404(b) as proof of the Escobar organization's modus operandi,\r\nor, alternatively, as proof of the knowledge and intent of the\r\norganization's members to carry out a major drug trafficking\r\nscheme. \r\nThe district court's pre-trial order denying Escobar's\r\nmotion in limine, however, did not premise the admissibility of the\r\nLajas incident evidence solely on Rule 404(b) grounds.  Rather, the\r\ncourt also ruled that the Lajas incident evidence was not \"prior\r\nbad act\" evidence at all, as the incident fell within the temporal\r\nscope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment and pertained to\r\nthe same conspiracy alleged in the indictment.  Because we agree\r\nwith the latter theory of admissibility, we need not address the\r\ndistrict court's determination that the evidence was admissible\r\nunder Rule 404(b).  See United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858,\r\n865 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Tejada, 886 F.2d 483, 487\r\n(1st Cir. 1989).  \r\nThe indictment alleged that the conspiracy began \"on or\r\nabout April 1986.\"  The Lajas incident occurred on March 26, 1986. \r\nGiven the closeness in time of the Lajas incident to April 1986, we\r\nhave little difficulty concluding that the Lajas incident is fairly\r\nencompassed by the temporal scope of the conspiracy alleged in the\r\nindictment.  See United States v. Paredes-Rodrguez, 160 F.3d 49,\r\n56 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"reference to approximate dates in an\r\nindictment is not binding and thus the scope of the indictment may\r\ncover prior events\") (citing United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d 456,\r\n461 n.12 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v. Crocker, 788 F.2d 802,\r\n805 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"approximate dates in an indictment are not\r\ncontrolling\")); see also United States v. Morris, 700 F.2d 427, 429\r\n(1st Cir. 1983) (\"Where a particular date is not a substantive\r\nelement of the crime charged, strict chronological specificity or\r\naccuracy is not required.\").  Moreover, the temporal proximity and\r\nfactual similarity of the Lajas incident and the April 14th alleged\r\nairdrop provide adequate evidence that the Lajas incident stemmed\r\nfrom the same conspiratorial agreement to import and distribute\r\ncocaine.  The events were separated by a period of only two-and-a-\r\nhalf weeks, employed nearly identical means (e.g., an airdrop at a\r\nclandestine airstrip illuminated by battery-powered lights), and\r\ninvolved the same illegal purpose of importing and distributing\r\ncocaine.  In these circumstances, we conclude that the Lajas\r\nincident served as an additional overt act within the conspiracy\r\ncharged, and was properly admitted as direct evidence of the\r\nconspiracy itself. See Tejada, 886 F.2d at 487 (\"Where evidence of\r\n'bad acts' is direct proof of the crime charged, Rule 404(b) is, of\r\ncourse, inapplicable.\").                \r\nB.  The 1988 Heroin Purchase\r\nAt trial, cooperating co-defendant Rosa Rodrguez-Campos\r\n(\"Rodrguez\") testified pursuant to a plea agreement that she was\r\na long-time drug trafficker and that in 1990 she agreed to loan\r\nEscobar money to finance his importation of cocaine from Colombia\r\nto Puerto Rico.  As part of its direct examination of Rodrguez\r\nconcerning her role in the alleged conspiracy, the government\r\nsought to introduce her testimony that Escobar purchased $90,000\r\nworth of heroin from her in 1988.  The district court allowed\r\nRodrguez to testify that Escobar had purchased heroin from her,\r\nreasoning that the heroin purchase, although uncharged in the\r\nindictment, was relevant and admissible because it helped to\r\nexplain the history between Rodrguez and Escobar and her\r\nwillingness to finance Escobar's cocaine trafficking venture. \r\nEscobar claims that the district court erred by admitting this\r\ntestimony concerning the heroin transaction, arguing that it was\r\noutside the scope of the charged conspiracy (which pertained only\r\nto cocaine, not heroin) and that it was elicited solely for the\r\npurpose of showing his propensity to commit drug crimes in\r\nviolation of Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\r\nEvidence that a defendant on trial for one crime has been\r\ninvolved in another crime or bad act is inadmissible under Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 404(b) if it is offered solely to prove the criminal\r\ncharacter of the defendant or his propensity to commit crimes of\r\nthe sort for which he is on trial.  See United States v.\r\nFrankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v.\r\nJohnston, 784 F.2d 416, 423 n.10 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing United\r\nStates v. Zeuli, 725 F.2d 813, 816 (1st Cir. 1984)); United States\r\nv. Fosher, 568 F.2d 207, 212 (1st Cir. 1978).  Rule 404(b),\r\nhowever, is not exclusionary. See Fosher, 568 F.2d at 212; 2 Jack\r\nB. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence, \r\n404.20[3] (2d ed. 1997).  Rather, the rule permits the introduction\r\nof uncharged bad act evidence if the evidence is relevant for\r\npurposes other than proof of a defendant's bad character or\r\ncriminal propensity, subject only to the limitations of Rule 403. \r\nSee United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir. 1992);\r\nJohnston, 784 F.2d at 423 n.10 (citing Fosher, 568 F.2d at 212). \r\nIn a conspiracy case, evidence of other bad acts, subject\r\nalways to the requirements of Rule 403, can be admitted to explain\r\nthe background, formation, and development of the illegal\r\nrelationship, see United States v. Prevatte, 16 F.3d 767, 775-76\r\n(7th Cir. 1994); United States v. Jones, 982 F.2d 380, 382-83 (9th\r\nCir. 1993); United States v. Passarella, 788 F.2d 377, 383-84 (6th\r\nCir. 1986); United States v. Magnano, 543 F.2d 431, 435 (2d Cir.\r\n1976); and, more specifically, to help the jury understand the\r\nbasis for the co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust, see\r\nUnited States v. Love, 134 F.3d 595, 603 (4th Cir. 1998); United\r\nStates v. Pipola, 83 F.3d 556, 565-56 (2d Cir. 1996); United States\r\nv. Rosa, 11 F.3d 315, 334 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v. Daz,\r\n994 F.2d 393, 395 (7th Cir. 1993).  As the district court observed,\r\nsee supra note 19, the heroin purchase was important to show how a\r\nrelationship of trust had developed between Escobar and Rodrguez\r\nthrough other similar drug transactions, which in turn explained\r\nwhy Rodrguez would have agreed to finance Escobar's cocaine\r\ntrafficking venture as she claimed.  Such evidence was specially\r\nprobative of the conspiratorial agreement that existed between\r\nthem, a fact which was directly in issue and material to the case.\r\nSee United States v. Spaeni, 60 F.3d 313, 316 (7th Cir. 1995). \r\nMoreover, the potential of prejudice from the heroin\r\npurchase evidence, although undeniably present in some quantum, did\r\nnot substantially outweigh its probative value.  Rodrguez's\r\ntestimony regarding the heroin purchase, although brief, was\r\ncritical to set the stage for the rest of her testimony concerning\r\nthe formation, nature, and extent of her conspiratorial\r\nrelationship with Escobar, and it represented only a tiny fraction\r\nof the incriminating evidence presented to the jury during the\r\ncourse of the trial.  In these circumstances, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the district court's decision to admit the challenged\r\ntestimony. \r\nC.  The Wiretap Evidence \r\nEscobar challenges the district court's denial of his\r\nmotion to suppress evidence derived from intercepted telephone\r\ncommunications, which he says violated Title III of the Omnibus\r\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.  2510-2522. \r\nIn March 1990 the district court issued a wiretap order\r\nauthorizing the interception of communications on telephone line\r\n809-256-2600, which was installed at Escobar's business, Sueo Real\r\nConstruction Company (\"Sueo Real\").  According to the district\r\ncourt's findings (which are not challenged on appeal), Escobar\r\nbroke the telephone's receiver in February or March 1990 and\r\nrefused to pay the telephone bills after becoming upset that people\r\nhad used the Sueo Real telephone to make long-distance phone\r\ncalls.  Cedrs thereafter \"extended a phone line\" to Cedrs's\r\ngrocery business, Colmado El Coqu, which was adjacent to Sueo\r\nReal, and paid the phone bills to keep the line in service. \r\nEscobar knew that Cedrs had extended the phone line, and in fact\r\nused the extension line in Colmado El Coqu himself on several\r\noccasions.\r\nEscobar argues that the intercepted communications must\r\nbe suppressed because they occurred at Colmado El Coqu, rather\r\nthan at the location specified in the wiretap order, Sueo Real. \r\nTo support this contention Escobar relies on 18 U.S.C.  2518(4),\r\nwhich provides that the order authorizing an interception specify\r\nfive items, including \"the nature and location of the \r\ncommunications facilities as to which, or the place where,\r\nauthority to intercept is granted.\"  18 U.S.C.  2518(4)(b).   The\r\norder's authorization, he argues, was limited to the telephone line\r\nat issue, which in turn was limited to the confines of Sueo Real. \r\nWe agree that by its terms the order authorized\r\ninterception of conversations occurring on the telephone line\r\ndenominated 809-256-2600, which was located in Sueo Real.  We find\r\nnothing in the statute, however, that requires the wiretap order to\r\nhave identified the particular locations of various extensions of\r\nthat telephone line, nor does Escobar cite any authority for that\r\nproposition.  The telephone line remained located in Sueo Real, as\r\nprovided in the wiretap order, even though it had apparently been\r\nrigged with a long extension cord to enable a person to access the\r\nline from a remote location (i.e., the adjacent Colmado El Coqu). \r\nMoreover, assuming arguendo that section 2518(4)(b) does\r\nrequire an order to identify the particular locations of various\r\nextensions of the same telephone line, it is well-settled that not\r\nevery failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in\r\nTitle III necessitates suppression. See United States v.\r\nCunningham, 113 F.3d 289, 293-94 (1st Cir. 1997); see also United\r\nStates v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413, 433-34 (1977); United States v.\r\nChavez, 416 U.S. 562, 574-75 (1974); 18 U.S.C.  2515,\r\n2518(10)(a).  Rather, \"violations of even . . . central\r\nrequirements do not mandate suppression if the government\r\ndemonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the statutory purpose\r\nhas been achieved despite the violation.\"  Cunningham, 113 F.3d at\r\n293-94 (quoting United States v. Johnson, 696 F.2d 115, 121 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1982)).  To the extent that Title III is designed to protect\r\nprivacy interests similar to those reflected in the Fourth\r\nAmendment, see id. at 294, that statutory purpose was served by the\r\ndistrict court's finding of probable cause to intercept and by the\r\norder's inclusion of other items of particularity, including the\r\nidentity of the person whose communications were to be intercepted,\r\nthe nature and location of the telephone line to be intercepted, a\r\nparticular description of the type of communication sought to be\r\nintercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which the\r\ncommunications relate, see 18 U.S.C.  2518(4).  Inclusion of the\r\nparticular location of various extensions of the telephone line\r\n(whose location was properly identified in the order) would not\r\nhave substantially furthered the statutory objectives of protecting\r\nprivacy interests and ensuring that intercept procedures are used\r\nonly in \"those situations clearly calling for the employment of\r\nthis extraordinary investigative device.\" United States v.\r\nGiordano, 416 U.S. 505 527 (1974).  The district court properly\r\ndenied Escobar's suppression motion. \r\n\nVI.  Variance\r\nEscobar contends that his conviction on Count 20,\r\ncharging him with attempted importation, must be reversed because\r\nof a fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence offered\r\nat trial.  Count 20 of the indictment charged, inter alia, that the\r\nMarch 13, 1990 attempted importation took place \"at Guayama, Puerto\r\nRico, in the District of Puerto Rico, and elsewhere and within the\r\njurisdiction of this Court.\"  At trial, informant Cedrs testified\r\nthat the attempted importation took place \"around the town of\r\nGunica, that part of the southern coast of Puerto Rico.\"  Escobar\r\nmoved to strike all evidence related to Count 20 because the\r\nindictment referred to Guayama, not Gunica.  Noting that both\r\ntowns were in the southern part of Puerto Rico and that they were\r\n\"not that far apart,\" the district court denied the motion. \r\nA variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a\r\nscenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the\r\nindictment.  See United States v. Paredes-Rodrguez, 160 F.3d 49,\r\n56 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\r\nCir. 1994); United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).  A variance requires reversal of a conviction \"only if [the\r\nvariance] is both material and prejudicial, for example, if the\r\nvariance works a substantial interference with the defendant's\r\nright to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep.\" \r\nArcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6.  Where an indictment gives a defendant\r\n\"particular notice of the events charged, and the proof at trial\r\ncenters on those events, minor differences in the details of the\r\nfacts charged, as contrasted to those proved, are unlikely to be\r\neither material or prejudicial.\" Id. \r\nWe note preliminarily our reluctance to characterize what\r\nhappened here as a variance at all, given the breadth of the\r\nindictment's description of the physical location of the attempted\r\nimportation (\"Guayama, Puerto Rico, in the District of Puerto Rico,\r\nand elsewhere and within the jurisdiction of this Court\") and the\r\nambiguity of Cedrs's testimony (namely, that the attempted\r\nimportation took place \"around the town of Gunica, that part of\r\nthe southern coast of Puerto Rico\").  In any event, whatever\r\ndiscrepancy may have existed between the indictment and the\r\nevidence adduced at trial was neither material nor prejudicial. \r\nThe location of the attempted importation was not an element of the\r\ncrime; both towns are in southern Puerto Rico, and are within the\r\ndistrict court's jurisdiction; and Escobar does not contend that\r\nthe indictment's allegations caused him to be misinformed of the\r\ncharges against him.  In his closing argument to the jury, Escobar\r\npointed out the purported variance and other evidence that he\r\nconsidered to be contradictory.  It was the jury's province to\r\nresolve any conflicts in the evidence about the attempted\r\nimportation, see United States v. Angiulo, 847 F.2d 956, 967 (1st\r\nCir. 1988), and it rejected Escobar's arguments.  In these\r\ncircumstances, we find no merit to Escobar's claim of a fatal\r\nvariance.     \r\nVII.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nEscobar challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nsupporting his convictions on the CCE counts (counts 1 and 12); the\r\nassault counts (counts 5 and 6); the weapons counts (counts 7, 15,\r\n16); and one interstate travel count (count 18).  In considering\r\nhis sufficiency challenges, we must take the evidence in a light\r\nmost favorable to the verdicts, drawing all plausible inferences\r\nand resolving all credibility determinations in their favor.  See\r\nUnited States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 730 (1st Cir. 1991).  The\r\nevidence may be entirely circumstantial, and the government need\r\nnot disprove every hypothesis of innocence.  See Rodrguez, 162\r\nF.3d at 141; United States v. Hahn, 17 F.3d 502, 506 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (quoting United States v.  Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17\r\n(1st Cir. 1991)).  We must affirm the verdicts \"so long as any\r\nrational trier of the facts could have found the essential elements\r\nof the crime[s] beyond a reasonable doubt.\" David, 940 F.2d at 730.\r\nA.  Continuing Criminal Enterprise  \r\nA conviction under 21 U.S.C.  848 for engaging in a CCE\r\nrequires proof that the defendant (1) committed a felony drug\r\noffense, (2) as part of a continuing series of such violations, (3)\r\nin concert with five or more persons in relation to whom he acted\r\nas a supervisor, organizer, or manager, (4) and from which he\r\nobtained substantial income or other resources.  21 U.S.C.  848;\r\nsee United States v. Hahn, 17 F.3d 502, 506 (1st Cir. 1994); see\r\nalso United States v. Chagra, 653 F.2d 26, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1981)\r\n(noting that courts have required three or more violations to\r\nconstitute a \"continuing series\"). Escobar asserts that the\r\ngovernment failed to establish the second, third, and fourth\r\nelements of the CCE offense.  \r\nAs to the second element, Escobar contends (1) that the\r\nevidence did not establish that the alleged violations were of a\r\n\"continuing\" nature   that is, that they were related to one\r\nanother, and (2) that the counts related to the 1990 planned\r\nimportations cannot constitute predicate offenses under the CCE\r\nstatute because those importations were too \"inchoate and\r\nincomplete.\"  For the reasons previously set forth in part II(A)\r\nsupra, we find ample evidence of the relatedness of Counts 10, 19,\r\n20, 23, 24, and 33. Furthermore, we find nothing in section 848\r\nthat limits predicate offenses to successful, completed drug\r\nimportations in the manner suggested by Escobar. See 21 U.S.C. \r\n848 (predicate offenses may consist of \"violations of [subchapter\r\nI] or subchapter II of [chapter 13]).     \r\nTurning to the third element under the CCE statute,\r\nEscobar argues that the government failed to prove that he\r\n\"occupie[d] a position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any\r\nother position of management,\"  21 U.S.C.  848, with respect to at\r\nleast five individuals.  In determining whether a defendant\r\norganized, supervised, or managed a criminal enterprise, we give\r\nthose terms their ordinary meaning.  See David, 940 F.2d at 731;\r\nsee also United States v. Rouleau, 894 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(operative terms must be read in the disjunctive and are distinct\r\nin their meaning).  Further, there is no requirement that the five\r\nindividuals be shown to have acted in concert or contemporaneously,\r\nsee David, 940 F.2d at 731 (citing United States v. Tarvers, 833\r\nF.2d 1068, 1075 (1st Cir. 1987)), nor must the jurors agree on the\r\nparticular identities of the henchmen, see id. (citing United\r\nStates v. Aiello, 864 F.2d 257, 264 (2d Cir. 1988); United States\r\nv. Lueth, 807 F.2d 719, 731 (8th Cir. 1986)).       \r\nIn this case, Escobar does not expressly dispute that he\r\nacted as an organizer, supervisor, or manager with respect to four\r\nindividuals.  Indeed, there is ample evidence in the record that\r\nEscobar acted in such capacity with respect to co-defendant Soto in\r\nthe March 5, 1990, telephone offense (Count 19); with respect to\r\nSantos in the March 13, 1990 telephone offense (Count 20); and with\r\nrespect to co-defendants Ismael Santiago-Corujo (\"Santiago\") and\r\nFlores during the conspiracy offense in connection with the April\r\n1990 plans to import cocaine by sea (Count 2).  Escobar does\r\ndispute, however, that he acted as an organizer, supervisor, or\r\nmanager with respect to a fifth individual, co-defendant Rivera,\r\nduring the November 21, 1989, drug offense.  Specifically, he\r\ncontends that the evidence showed that he had only \"an interest\" in\r\nthe transaction, given that Faccio, not he, was the original owner\r\nof the cocaine.  \r\nTo be an organizer, supervisor or manager within the\r\nmeaning of 21 U.S.C.  848, however, the defendant \"need not be the\r\ndominant organizer or manager of the enterprise; he need only\r\noccupy some managerial position with respect to five or more\r\npersons.\"  Rodrguez, 162 F.2d at 142 (quoting Hahn, 17 F.3d at 506\r\nn.4)).  As to the November 21, 1989 incident, there was evidence\r\nthat after receiving the cocaine from Faccio, Escobar delivered it\r\nto Cedrs, who in turn arranged for Rivera and co-defendant Ros to\r\nsmuggle the drugs onto a commercial airline flight; that Escobar\r\npurchased airline tickets; and that upon arriving in New York\r\nRivera called Escobar to report that the cocaine had been lost. \r\nMoreover, Cedrs testified generally that as to at least fourteen\r\nindividuals, including Rivera, Escobar was \"the top man, the person\r\nwho would plan, the person who would organize and the person who\r\nwould order all aspects of the organization.\" This evidence was\r\nsufficient for a rational jury to find that Rivera was acting under\r\nthe direction of Escobar on November 21, 1989 for the purposes of\r\nthe CCE statute.       \r\nFinally, Escobar contends that the government failed to\r\nprove that he obtained substantial income or other resources from\r\nthe CCE.  The substantial income requirement is meant \"to exclude\r\ntrivial amounts derived from occasional drug sales,\" Hahn, 17 F.3d\r\nat 507, and may be proven directly (by evidence of revenue or\r\nresources) or circumstantially (such as by evidence of the\r\ndefendant's position in the criminal organization and the volume of\r\ndrugs handled by the organization), see id.  In this case, the\r\ngovernment introduced evidence showing that from 1985 to 1989\r\nEscobar made expenditures of $238,766 for which no income source\r\ncould be identified; that in 1989 he spent approximately $300,000\r\nin cash, $216,000 of which came from unidentified sources; and that\r\nhis net worth as of October 1989 was more than one million dollars. \r\nThis evidence entitled the jury to conclude that Escobar obtained\r\n\"substantial income or resources\" within the meaning of section\r\n848.  Although Escobar contends that the government's evidence\r\ncontained inconsistencies and that Escobar's flush financial\r\nsituation could have a benign explanation, he made those arguments\r\nto the jury, which was free to reject them.  See United States v.\r\nArango-Echeberry, 927 F.2d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v.\r\nAngiulo, 847 F.2d 956, 967 (1st Cir. 1988).   The evidence was\r\nsufficient to support Counts 1 and 12.          \r\nB.  Assaults on the Customs Officers\r\nEscobar argues that the court erred in instructing the\r\njury that it could convict on counts 5 and 6 (charging him with the\r\nApril 14, 1986 shootings of the customs officers) on the basis of\r\nPinkerton liability, as there was insufficient evidence to\r\nestablish his participation in a conspiracy on that date.\r\nSpecifically, Escobar contends that the absence of any direct\r\nevidence of an importation actually having occurred on April 14th\r\nmade it impossible for any rational factfinder to conclude that a\r\nconspiracy existed; and that, in any event, the evidence\r\nestablished only his mere presence at the scene where some of the\r\nconspiratorial activities allegedly took place.  Without\r\nsufficient evidence of his participation in a conspiracy on the\r\nevening of April 14th, he argues, the Pinkerton instruction was\r\nimproper.  \r\nTo prove the elements of a conspiracy, the government\r\nmust show beyond a reasonable doubt that the \"defendant and one or\r\nmore coconspirators intended to agree and . . . to commit the\r\nsubstantive criminal offense which was the object of their unlawful\r\nagreement.\"  United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir.\r\n1992) (quoting United States v. Lpez, 944 F.2d 33, 39 (1st Cir.\r\n1991)) (alteration in original); see United States v. Cruz, 981\r\nF.2d 613, 616 (1st Cir. 1992).  No particular formalities attend\r\nthis showing: the agreement may be express or tacit and may be\r\nproved by direct or circumstantial evidence.  See United States v.\r\nSeplveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v.\r\nGmez-Pabn, 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir. 1990).  Indeed, \"[d]ue to\r\nthe clandestine nature of criminal conspiracies, the law recognizes\r\nthat . . . a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a\r\ndevelopment and collocation of circumstances.\" Tejeda, 974 F.2d at\r\n212 (quoting United States v. Snchez, 917 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.\r\n1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \r\nApplying these standards here, we conclude that there was\r\nsufficient evidence to support the Pinkerton charge.  First,\r\ncontrary to Escobar's assertion, the fact that the government\r\nintroduced no direct evidence of contraband having been imported by\r\nplane on April 14th does not preclude the jury from concluding that\r\nEscobar and his cohorts were engaged in a conspiracy to achieve\r\nsuch ends.  Proof of the conspiracy's objective having been\r\naccomplished is not required to sustain a conspiracy conviction. \r\nSee David, 940 F.2d at 735 (noting that \"the law is well-settled\r\nthat a criminal conspiracy can exist despite the eventual failure\r\nof its objective\").   \r\nAs to Escobar's claim that the evidence established only\r\nhis mere presence at the scene of the conspiratorial activities,\r\nsee, e.g., United States v. Ocampo, 964 F.2d 80, 82 (1st Cir.\r\n1992), we disagree.  Proof of participation in a conspiracy may\r\nconsist of circumstantial evidence, and jurors are \"neither\r\nrequired to divorce themselves from their common sense nor to\r\nabandon the dictates of mature experience.\"  United States v.\r\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992).  The government presented\r\nevidence that on April 14th co-defendant Flores purchased more than\r\none hundred gallons of aviation gasoline; that Flores and co-\r\ndefendant Morales entered the Potrero Cuevas Farm in separate\r\nvehicles; that law enforcement agents waiting nearby then heard a\r\nplane flying overhead; that shortly thereafter agents observed\r\nseveral vehicles exit the farm, including a truck driven by Escobar\r\nthat carried six passengers, four of whom were dressed in\r\ncamouflage; that a few days later agents searching the farm\r\ndiscovered a clandestine landing strip, battery-powered lamps that\r\nhad been purchased by Escobar (one of which had Escobar's\r\nfingerprints on it), and sixty gallons of missing aviation fuel. \r\nThe jury was entitled to infer from this evidence Escobar's\r\nparticipation, rather than mere presence, in the conspiratorial\r\nactivities.  See United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); Tejeda, 974 F.2d at 213 (\"[T]he factfinder may\r\nfairly infer . . . that it runs counter to human experience to\r\nsuppose that criminal conspirators would welcome innocent\r\nnonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\").  The evidence was\r\nsufficient to support the Pinkerton charge.  \r\nC.  The Weapons Charges\r\nEscobar was charged in Count 7 with possessing a machine\r\ngun in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(o)(1).  In Counts 15 and 16,\r\nhe was charged with possessing firearms as a convicted felon in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  With respect to both Counts\r\n7 and 16, Escobar's main contention is that the uncorroborated\r\ntestimony of informant Cedrs concerning the weapons charges cannot\r\nsuffice to support his convictions. Cedrs's testimony, even if\r\nuncorroborated, was sufficient to support Escobar's conviction\r\nbecause it was not \"incredible or insubstantial on its face.\" \r\nUnited States v. Gmez-Pabn, 911 F.2d 847, 853 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(quoting United States v. Aponte-Surez, 905 F.2d 483, 489 (1st\r\nCir. 1990)).  Escobar also claims that the evidence showed that he\r\nwas not the actual owner of the machinegun at issue in Count 7. \r\nThere is nothing in the statute to suggest, however, that liability\r\nunder section 922(o)(1) turns on actual ownership; rather, that\r\nsection makes it unlawful to \"transfer or possess\" a machinegun. \r\n18 U.S.C.  922(o)(1).\r\nAs to Count 16, charging him with possessing a firearm as\r\na convicted felon, Escobar further contends that his possession of\r\nthe firearm at issue was too brief to support a conviction.  Cedrs\r\ntestified that in January 1990 co-defendant Fernando Montaez-\r\nBultrn (\"Montaez\") gave the firearm to Escobar, and that at some\r\npoint thereafter Escobar gave the firearm to Cedrs with\r\ninstructions to keep it until Montaez and co-defendant Cruz asked\r\nfor it.  This testimony is sufficient.  Even if Escobar actually\r\npossessed the firearm for a short period of time, duration of\r\npossession is not an element of the statute.  See 18 U.S.C. \r\n922(g)(1).  Moreover, a defendant's possession need not be actual;\r\nconstructive possession is encompassed by section 922(g)(1) as\r\nwell.  See United States v. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1398 (1st Cir.\r\n1992) (holding that \"as long as a convicted felon knowingly has the\r\npower and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and\r\ncontrol over a firearm or over the area in which the weapon is\r\nlocated, directly or through others, he is in possession of the\r\nfirearm\").   \r\nFinally, with respect to Count 15, also charging him with\r\npossessing a firearm as a convicted felon, Escobar notes that (1)\r\nthe firearm at issue was, under the government's theory of the\r\ncase, actually possessed by co-defendant Cruz and used to execute\r\nMatos; and (2) the jury acquitted Cruz of the killing.  Escobar\r\nargues that Cruz's acquittal on the murder charge indicates that\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to show that Cruz actually\r\npossessed the firearm; and that if there was insufficient evidence\r\nto show that Cruz actually possessed the firearm, then a fortiori\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to show that Escobar constructively\r\npossessed the firearm.  The logic of Escobar's argument falters at\r\nthe threshold.  Cruz's acquittal on the murder charge does not\r\nestablish that Cruz did not actually possess the firearm in\r\nquestion, nor does it establish that Escobar did not constructively\r\npossess the firearm.  Moreover, even if the verdicts were\r\ninconsistent (which they are not), this would not justify the\r\nvacation of Escobar's conviction under Count 15.  See United States\r\nv. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 69 (1984).   The evidence was sufficient to\r\nsupport the challenged weapons convictions.\r\nD.  The March 1990 Interstate Travel Charge\r\nFinally, Escobar challenges the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence supporting his conviction on Count 18 for aiding and\r\nabetting the interstate travel of co-defendant Jorge \"Papo Luciano\"\r\nValds-Alvarez (\"Valds\") to promote Escobar's drug trafficking, in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  1952 &amp; 2.  To establish a violation of\r\nsection 1952, the government must prove: (1) interstate travel or\r\nuse of an interstate facility; (2) with the intent to distribute\r\nthe proceeds of or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on,\r\nor facilitate an unlawful activity; (3) followed by performance or\r\nattempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful\r\nactivity.  See United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 681 (1st Cir.\r\n1983); United States v. Coran, 589 F.2d 70, 72 (1st Cir. 1978). \r\nWhile Escobar concedes that Cedrs's testimony may have established\r\nthat Valds traveled from Miami to Puerto Rico (a necessary\r\nconcession in light of the evidence), Escobar nonetheless contends\r\nthat the evidence was insufficient to establish that Valds'\r\npurpose in such travel was \"to promote, manage, establish, carry\r\non, or facilitate\" Escobar's drug trafficking operation.  Cedrs\r\ntestified, however, that after the attempted importation of March\r\n13, 1990, Escobar spoke of using a friend from Miami, \"Papo\r\nLuciano,\" to assist in the importation of drugs through the\r\nnortheastern coast of Puerto Rico; and that in a recorded telephone\r\nconversation, Escobar mentioned a \"Georgie\" whom he had brought to\r\nPuerto Rico from Florida to participate in shipments that were\r\nbeing planned through the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico.  This\r\nunambiguous testimony was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Valds had traveled to Puerto Rico\r\nintending to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate\r\nEscobar's drug trafficking activities, and not for some lawful\r\npurpose.  \r\nVIII.  Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm Escobar's\r\nconvictions in all respects.\r\nAffirmed.                                                      \n",

This case involves a large drug\r\ntrafficking organization that imported cocaine from Colombia and\r\ndistributed it in Puerto Rico and New York from 1986 until 1990. \r\nIn April 1991, as the climax of a lengthy investigation, a federal\r\ngrand jury returned a thirty-four count superseding indictment\r\ncharging defendant-appellant Eusebio Escobar-de Jess (\"Escobar\")\r\nand seventeen other individuals not parties to this appeal with\r\nvarious drug-related offenses.  In April 1993, a jury convicted\r\nEscobar of sixteen drug, assault, and weapons-related counts,\r\nincluding Count 1, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in\r\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.  848(a) &amp; (c), and Count 12, causing an\r\nintentional killing while engaged in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C.  848(e).

After careful consideration of the\r\nrecord and Escobar's many arguments on appeal, we affirm all of the\r\nconvictions.  \r\nI.  Background\r\nWe recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\nverdicts, consistent with support in the record. See United States\r\nv. Rodrguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198229\"><a href=\"/opinion/198229/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  We summarize\r\nbelow the facts presented during the trial, providing additional\r\ndetails as they become relevant to the discussion.\r\nThe March 26, 1986 Lajas Incident\r\nLargely through the testimony of cooperating co-defendant\r\nEdwin Soto-Osorio (\"Soto\"), the government established that on \r\nMarch 26, 1986, Escobar directed Soto and co-defendants Florentino\r\nRivera-Mojica (\"Rivera\") and Antonio Santos-Caraballo (\"Santos\") to\r\naccompany him to a dirt road in the middle of a sugar cane field in\r\nLajas to meet a plane containing cocaine from Colombia.  To\r\ndemarcate the makeshift landing strip, the men placed white lights\r\nalong the beginning of the road and yellow lights along the end of\r\nthe road.  The lights were powered by a car battery.  After the\r\nplane crash-landed, the four men and several other individuals\r\nassociated with Escobar retrieved much of the plane's drug cargo\r\nand transported it to nearby Loza. Following the departure of\r\nEscobar and his associates, law enforcement officers arrived at the\r\nscene of the crash and discovered cocaine in the plane.       \r\nThe April 14, 1986 Shooting of Customs Agents\r\nOn April 14, 1986, co-defendant Eric Flores-Rivera\r\n(\"Flores\") drove a yellow truck to the Isla Grande airport and\r\nobtained more than one hundred gallons of aviation gasoline. \r\nSurveilling agents then observed Flores drive the yellow truck into\r\nthe Potrero Cuevas Farm (\"the farm\") near Carolina.  An agent also\r\nobserved a blue truck driven by co-defendant Andrs Morales-Cruz\r\n(\"Morales\") enter the farm.  Waiting outside the farm, agents heard\r\na plane flying overhead.  Shortly thereafter, agents observed the\r\nyellow truck, a white van, and a blue truck driven by Escobar and\r\ncarrying six passengers (four dressed in camouflage) leave the\r\nfarm.  Two of the surveilling agents followed the white van to a\r\nnearby town, where the van suddenly reversed direction and its\r\noccupants opened fire on the agents.  Both agents were seriously\r\nwounded.\r\nIn the days following the shootings, agents searched the\r\nvicinity of the farm and discovered a clandestine landing strip\r\nmade of dirt.  They also found, inter alia, twenty heavy-duty lamps\r\nthat had been purchased by Escobar, batteries, and a string that\r\nhad been stretched along the makeshift landing strip.  Escobar's\r\nfingerprints were on one of the lamps, and more than sixty gallons\r\nof the aviation fuel which had been brought to the farm by Flores\r\nwere gone.  Agents found the white van used in the shooting in the\r\nLoza River on April 16.       \r\nThe November 1989 Intercepted Cocaine Shipment\r\nIn 1989 federal authorities began an investigation of\r\nEscobar that included court-ordered electronic surveillance and the\r\nuse of a confidential informant named William Cedrs.  In order to\r\ninfiltrate Escobar's organization, Cedrs began managing a Loza\r\ngrocery store and bakery, and, through his acquaintances with co-\r\ndefendants Rivera and Hctor Ros-Velsquez (\"Ros\"), was\r\nintroduced to Escobar.  Through his infiltration of Escobar's\r\norganization, Cedrs learned that Escobar directed an organization\r\nof at least fourteen members. \r\nIn early November 1989, Escobar and Rivera made plans to\r\ndeliver a shipment of cocaine from Puerto Rico to New York on a\r\ncommercial airlines flight. Cedrs expressed interest in\r\nparticipating in the delivery, and Escobar agreed.  On November 21,\r\nco-defendant Fernando Faccio-Laboy (\"Faccio\") delivered eighty\r\nkilograms of cocaine to Escobar, who in turn delivered the cocaine\r\nto Cedrs in five suitcases.  Rivera and Cedrs placed official\r\ninspection seals from the United States Department of Agriculture\r\non the five suitcases and presented them at the check-in counter at\r\nthe airport.  Rivera and Cedrs boarded the flight, but the\r\nsuitcases were seized upon arrival in New York by federal\r\nauthorities.  Rivera called Escobar in Puerto Rico to report the\r\nsituation.  Escobar later met with Faccio and a representative of\r\nthe Ochoa family, part of Colombia's Medelln cartel, to discuss\r\nthe lost cocaine.   \r\nDecember 1989:  Planning for Future Importations\r\nIn December 1989 Escobar began to plan additional\r\nimportations of cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico.  On December\r\n9 and December 13, Escobar and several subordinates traveled to\r\nVieques, Puerto Rico, to inspect potential sites for clandestine\r\nairstrips to use in importing approximately 1,500 kilograms of\r\ncocaine from the Medelln and Cali cartels in Colombia.  On or\r\nabout December 20, Escobar and his subordinates also discussed the\r\npossibility of using a plane to drop the cocaine into the ocean\r\nnear Gunica, where it would be picked up by speedboats directed by\r\nco-defendants Soto and Santos.  During the month of December 1989\r\nEscobar also discussed cocaine importation with Jos Alberto Ochoa-\r\nVasco (\"Ochoa\"), a representative of the Medelln cartel. \r\nThe Murder of Martn Matos-Cruz\r\nAccording to Cedrs's testimony, in December 1989 Escobar\r\nasked him to kill Martn Matos-Cruz (\"Matos\"), who was the third-\r\nranking member of Escobar's organization and had fallen out of\r\nfavor with Escobar.  On January 2, 1990, however, Escobar told\r\nCedrs that he had found another person, co-defendant Michael Cruz-\r\nGonzlez (\"Cruz\"), to kill Matos.  The same day, Escobar and Cruz\r\ntraveled to Carolina to identify Matos's residence, and on January\r\n3, according to Cedrs's testimony, Cruz shot and killed Matos\r\noutside Matos's residence.  On January 5, at Escobar's request,\r\nCedrs gave Cruz $1,500 as a partial payment for the murder.      \r\nThe March 1990 Attempted Importation\r\n     Throughout January and February 1990, Escobar and his\r\nconfederates continued to plan drug importations, meeting at least\r\nfifteen times to discuss the logistics of the effort.  Between\r\nMarch 5 and March 13, Escobar was in repeated telephone contact\r\nwith several individuals, including Soto, regarding an anticipated\r\ncocaine delivery.  On March 13, Escobar and his men attempted to\r\nimport 320 kilograms of cocaine by air, but the flight was\r\nintercepted by Coast Guard and Customs Service aircraft, causing it\r\nto break off and return to Colombia.  \r\nFollowing this aborted importation, Escobar and his\r\nconfederates continued to meet during March and April to discuss\r\nother ways to successfully import cocaine to Puerto Rico.  On April\r\n2, Mesa informed Escobar by telephone that a shipment of cocaine\r\nwas ready for delivery and that he should arrange to receive it. \r\nShortly thereafter, however, Escobar entered a drug rehabilitation\r\nprogram in order to avoid revocation of his parole.  Cedrs\r\nreplaced him in meetings with representatives of the Medelln and\r\nCali cartels, and kept Escobar informed of developments.  On April\r\n8, Cedrs and Flores met Escobar at the drug rehabilitation\r\nfacility to discuss arrangements for the importation.  Before the\r\nimportation could be executed, however, Escobar was arrested.\r\nII.  The Jury Instructions\r\nA.  Continuing Criminal Enterprise\r\nSection 848, often referred to as the \"kingpin\" statute,\r\nmakes it a crime to engage in a \"continuing criminal enterprise.\" \r\nThe statute provides:\r\n  [A] person is engaged in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise if \r\n\n  (1) he violates any provision of [the federal\r\ndrug laws, i.e.,] this subchapter or\r\nsubchapter II of this chapter the punishment\r\nfor which is a felony, and\r\n\n  (2) such violation is part of a continuing\r\nseries of violations of [the federal drug\r\nlaws, i.e.,] this subchapter or subchapter II\r\nof this chapter  \r\n\n      (A) which are undertaken by such person in\r\n  concert with five or more other persons\r\n  with respect to whom such person occupies\r\n  a position of organizer [or supervisor or\r\n  manager] and \r\n\n      (B) from which such person obtains\r\n  substantial income or resources.\r\n\n21 U.S.C.  848(c).  In this case, the jury convicted Escobar of\r\nCount 1, charging that he had engaged in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise (\"CCE\") from on or about April 1986 until the date the\r\nindictment was filed, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  848(a) &amp; (c); and\r\nof Count 12, charging that he had caused the killing of Martn\r\nMatos-Cruz while engaged in the CCE, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \r\n848(e)(1)(A). \r\nOn appeal Escobar argues that the district court erred in\r\nfailing to grant his proposal to instruct the jurors that, in order\r\nto convict under section 848, they must agree unanimously on which\r\nunderlying violations   of the ten alleged   constituted the three\r\nrelated violations necessary to establish a \"continuing series.\"\r\nSee United States v. Chagra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392053\"><a href=\"/opinion/392053/united-states-v-jamiel-chagra/\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1981)\r\n(noting that other courts have required at least three violations\r\nfor a \"continuing series\").  Although recent Supreme Court\r\nauthority confirms that the district court did err, we conclude\r\nthat the error in this case was harmless.\r\nIn United States v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999),\r\nthe Supreme Court addressed the question whether a jury must agree\r\nunanimously about which specific predicate violations make up the\r\n\"continuing series of violations.\"  That question turned on whether \r\nthe existence of a \"series\" is itself a single element, as to which\r\nthe violations are merely underlying \"brute facts\" not requiring\r\njuror unanimity, or whether the individual violations in that\r\nseries are themselves elements of the offense. See id. at 1710. \r\nUnder the former interpretation, jurors, in order to find that a\r\ndefendant committed a \"continuing series of violations\" within the\r\nmeaning of section 848, would need to agree unanimously only that\r\nthe defendant had engaged in a continuing series of at least three\r\nviolations; individual jurors would be free to find that continuing\r\nseries based on the same, overlapping, or entirely different\r\nviolations.  See id.  Thus, under this theory, a defendant could be\r\nconvicted of the CCE offense even if jurors could not agree\r\nunanimously that the defendant committed any of the alleged\r\nviolations.  For example, half of the jurors might find that\r\noffenses A, B, and C, but no others, were committed and constituted\r\na continuing series, and the other half of the jurors might find\r\nthat offenses D, E, and F, but no others, were committed and\r\nconstituted a continuing series.  \r\nRelying on considerations of language, tradition, and\r\npotential unfairness, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that\r\nthe \"violations\" referred to in section 848 are simply fungible\r\nmeans of satisfying the \"series\" element of section 848.  See id.\r\nat 1709-13.  Rather, the Court held that those \"violations\" are\r\nthemselves elements of the offense, meaning that jury unanimity in\r\nrespect to each individual violation is necessary.  See id. \r\nAccordingly, in cases where the government introduces evidence that\r\nthe defendant has committed more underlying drug crimes than\r\nlegally necessary to make up a \"series,\" Richardson requires that\r\nthey agree unanimously about which crimes make up the continuing\r\nseries.  See id. at 1709.\r\nIn light of Richardson, the government concedes that the\r\ndistrict court erred by failing to instruct the jurors that the\r\n\"violations\" are themselves elements of the CCE offense and that\r\nthey therefore must agree unanimously about which three (or more)\r\ndrug crimes the defendant committed.  The government argues,\r\nhowever, that the court's error was harmless because the jury\r\nseparately convicted Escobar of Counts 10, 19, 20, 23, 24, and 33,\r\nwhich were six of the ten predicate offenses alleged to constitute\r\nthe series.  See supra note 6.  Thus, the government observes, the\r\njurors must have unanimously agreed that Escobar committed six of\r\nthe alleged violations, which was more than enough to constitute a\r\n\"series.\"  See Chagra, 653 F.2d at 27-28. \r\nWe have previously recognized that some uncertainty\r\nexists about whether a jury instruction that misdefines or omits an\r\nelement of the offense charged is susceptible to harmless error\r\nreview.

Such omissions, the Court stated,\r\n\"differ[] markedly from the constitutional violations we have found\r\nto defy harmless-error review,\" such as the complete denial of\r\ncounsel or trial before a biased judge. Id. at 1833.  Accordingly,\r\nwhere a court omits or misdescribes an essential element of the\r\noffense, as happened here by the court's failure to instruct the\r\njury that the \"violations\" were themselves elements of the CCE\r\ncrime and that they therefore must agree unanimously which\r\nviolations make up the \"continuing series,\" the conviction must\r\nnonetheless be affirmed if the reviewing court can conclude beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the\r\ndefendant guilty absent the error.  See id. at 1838.\r\nIn this case, the jury's decision to convict Escobar on\r\nCounts 10, 19, 20, 23, 24, and 33   which were alleged to be\r\npredicate violations supporting the CCE count    necessarily\r\nestablishes that the jurors agreed unanimously that he was guilty\r\nof those offenses.  This decision ensures that the concern at the\r\ncore of the Richardson decision   namely, that jurors might convict\r\na defendant of a CCE on the basis of violations for which there was\r\nnon-unanimity   is not present.  The guilty verdicts on Counts 10,\r\n19, 20, 23, 24, and 33 are tantamount to the jury having found \r\nthat he committed each of these violations for the purposes of the\r\nCCE count. \r\nThat is not the end of the matter, however.  Section 848\r\nalso requires that jurors agree that the \"series\" of violations be\r\n\"continuing\" in nature   that is, that they be related to each\r\nother in some way.  See United States v.

Although the guilty verdicts on Counts 10, 19, 20,\r\n23, 24, and 33 erase as a matter of logic any concern that the jury\r\ndid not agree that Escobar actually committed the offenses making\r\nup the series, we can affirm the CCE convictions only if we can\r\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury, had it been\r\nproperly instructed, would have found that at least three of those\r\ncounts were related to each other. \r\nThe evidence introduced to support the separate\r\nconvictions on those counts also establishes inescapably their\r\nrelatedness.  The counts involved Escobar's ongoing and persistent\r\nefforts to import and distribute cocaine over a finite period of\r\ntime in late 1989 and early 1990.  After the failed importation\r\nattempt in late 1989 (Count 10), Escobar re-grouped and tried again\r\nin March 1990 (Counts 19, 20, 23, and 24).  After failing once\r\nagain in March, he began planning for another attempt in April 1990\r\n(Count 33).  The relatedness of the counts is demonstrated by their\r\nproximity in time and identity of purpose, and we conclude beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that the jury, had it been properly instructed,\r\nwould have found that the counts were \"continuing\" in nature.  See\r\nid. at 825; United States v. King, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1041 (6th Cir.\r\n1989).  Accordingly, we conclude that the court's refusal to\r\ninstruct the jurors that they must agree unanimously about which\r\nviolations make up the \"continuing series\" of violations, within\r\nthe meaning of section 848(c)(2), was harmless.  \r\nB. The Telephone Facilitation Counts\r\nEscobar also argues that the district court erred in its\r\ninstructions to the jury on three telephone facilitation counts,\r\nwhich charged him with using a telephone in facilitating the\r\nimportation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  843(b). \r\nSpecifically, Escobar contends that the district court should have\r\nexpressly instructed the jury that in order to convict under\r\nsection 843(b), it had to find that the underlying drug offenses\r\nalleged to have been facilitated by his telephone use   namely, the\r\nimportations   were actually committed.  Because Escobar did not\r\nobject to the district court's instructions during the trial and\r\nraises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review only for\r\nplain error.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); Johnson v.

But Escobar's\r\nchallenge, though predicated on section 843(b)'s requirement that\r\nthe underlying drug offense have been committed, is more specific: \r\nhe assigns error to the district court's failure to expressly\r\ncharge the jury regarding this requirement (over and above\r\nrecitation of the statutory language). On this narrower\r\ninstructional point, there is little authority.  Indeed, we have\r\ndiscovered only one case that has addressed whether a district\r\ncourt must instruct the jury in the manner urged by Escobar.  See\r\nDotson, 895 F.2d at 263 (holding that the district court should\r\nhave expressly charged the jury that it had to find underlying\r\ncrimes were actually committed, but concluding that the court's\r\nerror was harmless). \r\nAlthough the language of section 843(b) itself arguably\r\nconveys without any need for elaboration the requirement of a jury\r\nfinding that the underlying drug offense was committed, we agree\r\nthat an instruction would have clarified any potential ambiguity in\r\nsection 843(b)'s language on that point.  See id. at 264.  However,\r\ngiven the scarcity of authority mandating such an instruction,\r\ncombined with the nature of the alleged instructional error, we\r\ncannot conclude that any error in the court's instructions was\r\n\"plain,\" see Olano, 507 U.S. at 734 (for the purposes of Rule\r\n52(b), the word \"plain\" is synonymous with \"clear,\" or,\r\nequivalently, \"obvious\"), or that it affected Escobar's substantial\r\nrights or denigrated the judicial proceedings, see Johnson, 520\r\nU.S. at 467. \r\nIII.  The Jury Selection\r\nWe next consider Escobar's Batson-based claim that his\r\nconvictions must be vacated because of deficiencies in the jury\r\nselection process.  See Batson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). \r\nHis argument, although difficult to parse, appears to be two-\r\npronged. First, he contends that the district court's conclusion\r\nthat he failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in\r\nthe government's use of its peremptory strikes was clearly\r\nerroneous.  Alternatively, he says that even if he did fail to\r\nestablish a prima facie case, the district court's erroneous ruling\r\non voir dire questions made it impossible for him to establish a\r\nprima facie case. We disagree with both contentions.  \r\nDuring the jury selection process, defense counsel \r\nrequested the court to order that the government provide race-\r\nneutral explanations for its peremptory strikes of two African-\r\nAmerican men, contending that these strikes demonstrated a\r\n\"pattern\" of removing African-American men that raised an inference\r\nof racial discrimination. The government denied that the strikes\r\nwere racially motivated, but did not offer a race-neutral\r\nexplanation. The court denied Escobar's request, reasoning that six\r\nor seven African-American individuals remained in the jury pool and\r\nthat there was insufficient evidence to establish a \"pattern\" of\r\nstrikes.    \r\n The three-part framework that must be applied to equal\r\nprotection challenges to the government's use of a peremptory\r\nstrike is well established.  First, a defendant must make a prima\r\nfacie showing of discrimination in the government's use of its\r\nperemptory strike.  See Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-97.  If the\r\ndefendant fulfills this requirement, the government must then\r\nproffer a race-neutral explanation for having challenged the juror. \r\nSee id. at 97. Finally, if the government meets its burden of\r\nproduction by proffering a race-neutral explanation, the district\r\ncourt must then decide whether the defendant has carried the\r\nultimate burden of proving that the government's use of its\r\nperemptory strike constituted purposeful discrimination.  See id.;\r\nHernndez v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358-59 (1991).  In challenging\r\nthe government's use of peremptory strikes, the defendant retains\r\nthe burden of proof throughout. See United States v. Bergodere, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195758\"><a href=\"/opinion/195758/united-states-v-bergodere/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 515 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r\nAlthough the prima facie case requirement \"is not\r\nonerous, neither can it be taken for granted.\"  Bergodere, 40 F.3d\r\nat 516.  To satisfy his burden of establishing a prima facie case,\r\nEscobar was required to have shown, inter alia, \"circumstances\r\nsufficient . . . to raise an inference that the prosecutor struck\r\nthe venireperson on account of race.\"  Id.

See, e.g., United States v.

See id. (noting that \"the prosecutor's questions\r\nand statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his\r\nchallenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory\r\npurpose\").  We find no clear error in this case.      \r\nAlternatively, Escobar points out that during voir dire\r\nhe proposed that the district court ask potential jurors questions\r\nrelated to racial bias, which he argued were necessary because\r\nEscobar is African-American and because \"there is racism in Puerto\r\nRico.\"  The court denied the request, reasoning that there was no\r\nindication that racial animosity or racial motive was an issue in\r\nthe case.  Escobar now claims that the court's refusal to question\r\njurors about their potential racial bias hindered his later efforts\r\nto establish a prima facie case of discriminatory intent in the\r\ngovernment's use of its peremptory strikes to remove the two\r\nAfrican-American men during the jury selection process.\r\nTo the extent that Escobar does in fact challenge\r\ndirectly the court's denial of his request to question potential\r\njurors about racial prejudice (and it is unclear whether he makes\r\nthis challenge), we find that the voir dire conducted in this case\r\nwas sufficient.  While the Supreme Court has held that under\r\ncertain circumstances the possibility of racial prejudice makes\r\nspecial voir dire questioning constitutionally mandated, see Turner\r\nv.

The only\r\njustifications for the special questioning asserted by defense\r\ncounsel were that his client is African-American and that \"racism\r\nexists in Puerto Rico.\"  Standing alone, these are not the special\r\ncircumstances that would require a district court to ask potential\r\njurors if racial prejudice would be a factor in their decision-\r\nmaking process.  \r\nFurthermore, we fail to perceive how the district court's\r\nrefusal to question jurors about racial bias impeded Escobar's\r\nability to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the\r\ngovernment's use of its peremptory strikes, and Escobar does not\r\nadequately explain the connection.  Even if the court had granted\r\nEscobar's request to question potential jurors about racial bias,\r\nsuch questioning would have revealed only the potential jurors'\r\nracial biases, enabling either party to remove prejudiced jurors\r\nfor cause.  We do not see how such questioning could have shed\r\nlight on the government's allegedly improper motives for exercising\r\nits peremptory strikes, evidence of which was lacking in Escobar's\r\nefforts to establish a prima facie case under Batson.  \r\nFinally, Escobar challenges the constitutionality of 28\r\nU.S.C.  1865(b)(2) &amp; (3), which require that jurors be able to\r\nspeak the English language and be able to read, write, and\r\nunderstand the English language with a degree of proficiency\r\nsufficient to fill out satisfactorily the juror qualification form. \r\nHaving previously considered and rejected this contention, see\r\nUnited States v.

Prosecutorial Misconduct\r\nEscobar claims that cooperating co-defendant Soto's\r\ntestimony created a false impression about the extent to which Soto\r\ncould benefit from pleading guilty and testifying for the\r\ngovernment, and that the prosecutor's failure to correct this\r\nmisleading testimony resulted in reversible error.  We find nothing\r\nfalse or misleading about Soto's testimony.         \r\nBefore Escobar's trial, Soto entered into a plea\r\nagreement which provided, inter alia, that he would plead guilty to\r\na drug conspiracy count; that he understood that he may be\r\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment not less than ten years; that\r\nhe acknowledged that the government could move the court to impose\r\na sentence below the sentencing range dictated by the sentencing\r\nguidelines based on his substantial assistance; and that if he\r\nfully complied with the agreement, the government would not\r\nprosecute him for other drug crimes resulting from information\r\nprovided by him and that the government would move to dismiss the\r\nremaining charges against him.  \r\nDuring the trial, Escobar's defense counsel cross-\r\nexamined Soto about the plea agreement, asking inter alia whether\r\nSoto was aware that the government had the discretion to move the\r\ncourt to impose a sentence of less than ten years.  Soto responded\r\nthat he was not aware of this; that he expected to receive a\r\nsentence of eight to ten years instead of the thirty years to life\r\nwhich would have been imposed if he had not entered into the plea\r\nagreement; and that he had discussed the plea agreement with his\r\nattorney only in a \"overall way\" and not \"part by part.\"  Escobar\r\nnow claims reversible error based on Soto's failure to disclose\r\nthat the government could move the court to impose a sentence below\r\nthe statutory minimum and the government's silence on the matter. \r\nIt is true, of course, that the government may not\r\nknowingly use false testimony to obtain a conviction, even if the\r\nfalse testimony goes only to a witness's credibility.  See Napue v.\r\nIllinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105912\"><a href=\"/opinion/105912/napue-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269 (1959) (finding due process violation\r\nwhere witness falsely denied that he would receive any benefit from\r\ngovernment in exchange for his testimony).  In this case, however,\r\nSoto's testimony simply cannot be characterized as false or\r\nmisleading.  First, the plea agreement itself simply stated that\r\nthe government had the discretion to move the court to impose a\r\nsentence below the statutory minimum.  The government had not\r\npromised to file such a motion.  Moreover, Escobar points to\r\nnothing in the record suggesting that Soto was not truthful about\r\nhis understanding of the plea agreement and what his sentence was\r\nlikely to be.  When questioned about the numerous benefits he had\r\nbeen promised pursuant to the agreement, Soto testified\r\nforthrightly, and there can be little doubt that the jury was\r\npresented with sufficient evidence to allow it to make a\r\ndiscriminating appraisal of Soto's motives to testify.  See United\r\nStates v. Devin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551278\"><a href=\"/opinion/551278/united-states-v-francis-e-devin/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\n\nV.  Evidentiary Matters\r\n   A.  The March 26, 1986 Lajas Incident\r\nEscobar argues that the court erred by allowing the\r\nintroduction of evidence, including the testimony of co-operating\r\nco-defendant Soto, concerning the March 26, 1986 airdrop at Lajas\r\n(\"the Lajas incident\").  Escobar characterizes the Lajas incident\r\nas evidence of a prior bad act, and contends that the district\r\ncourt erred by concluding that it was admissible under Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 404(b) as proof of the Escobar organization's modus operandi,\r\nor, alternatively, as proof of the knowledge and intent of the\r\norganization's members to carry out a major drug trafficking\r\nscheme. \r\nThe district court's pre-trial order denying Escobar's\r\nmotion in limine, however, did not premise the admissibility of the\r\nLajas incident evidence solely on Rule 404(b) grounds.  Rather, the\r\ncourt also ruled that the Lajas incident evidence was not \"prior\r\nbad act\" evidence at all, as the incident fell within the temporal\r\nscope of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment and pertained to\r\nthe same conspiracy alleged in the indictment.  Because we agree\r\nwith the latter theory of admissibility, we need not address the\r\ndistrict court's determination that the evidence was admissible\r\nunder Rule 404(b).  See United States v. Arboleda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558577\"><a href=\"/opinion/558577/united-states-v-carlos-arboleda-united-states-v-martin-castillo-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n865 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v.

Moreover, the temporal proximity and\r\nfactual similarity of the Lajas incident and the April 14th alleged\r\nairdrop provide adequate evidence that the Lajas incident stemmed\r\nfrom the same conspiratorial agreement to import and distribute\r\ncocaine.  The events were separated by a period of only two-and-a-\r\nhalf weeks, employed nearly identical means (e.g., an airdrop at a\r\nclandestine airstrip illuminated by battery-powered lights), and\r\ninvolved the same illegal purpose of importing and distributing\r\ncocaine.  In these circumstances, we conclude that the Lajas\r\nincident served as an additional overt act within the conspiracy\r\ncharged, and was properly admitted as direct evidence of the\r\nconspiracy itself. See Tejada, 886 F.2d at 487 (\"Where evidence of\r\n'bad acts' is direct proof of the crime charged, Rule 404(b) is, of\r\ncourse, inapplicable.\").                \r\nB.  The 1988 Heroin Purchase\r\nAt trial, cooperating co-defendant Rosa Rodrguez-Campos\r\n(\"Rodrguez\") testified pursuant to a plea agreement that she was\r\na long-time drug trafficker and that in 1990 she agreed to loan\r\nEscobar money to finance his importation of cocaine from Colombia\r\nto Puerto Rico.  As part of its direct examination of Rodrguez\r\nconcerning her role in the alleged conspiracy, the government\r\nsought to introduce her testimony that Escobar purchased $90,000\r\nworth of heroin from her in 1988.  The district court allowed\r\nRodrguez to testify that Escobar had purchased heroin from her,\r\nreasoning that the heroin purchase, although uncharged in the\r\nindictment, was relevant and admissible because it helped to\r\nexplain the history between Rodrguez and Escobar and her\r\nwillingness to finance Escobar's cocaine trafficking venture. \r\nEscobar claims that the district court erred by admitting this\r\ntestimony concerning the heroin transaction, arguing that it was\r\noutside the scope of the charged conspiracy (which pertained only\r\nto cocaine, not heroin) and that it was elicited solely for the\r\npurpose of showing his propensity to commit drug crimes in\r\nviolation of Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\r\nEvidence that a defendant on trial for one crime has been\r\ninvolved in another crime or bad act is inadmissible under Fed.

As the district court observed,\r\nsee supra note 19, the heroin purchase was important to show how a\r\nrelationship of trust had developed between Escobar and Rodrguez\r\nthrough other similar drug transactions, which in turn explained\r\nwhy Rodrguez would have agreed to finance Escobar's cocaine\r\ntrafficking venture as she claimed.  Such evidence was specially\r\nprobative of the conspiratorial agreement that existed between\r\nthem, a fact which was directly in issue and material to the case.\r\nSee United States v. Spaeni, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699579\"><a href=\"/opinion/699579/united-states-v-jeffrey-a-spaeni/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (7th Cir. 1995). \r\nMoreover, the potential of prejudice from the heroin\r\npurchase evidence, although undeniably present in some quantum, did\r\nnot substantially outweigh its probative value.  Rodrguez's\r\ntestimony regarding the heroin purchase, although brief, was\r\ncritical to set the stage for the rest of her testimony concerning\r\nthe formation, nature, and extent of her conspiratorial\r\nrelationship with Escobar, and it represented only a tiny fraction\r\nof the incriminating evidence presented to the jury during the\r\ncourse of the trial.  In these circumstances, we find no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the district court's decision to admit the challenged\r\ntestimony. \r\nC.  The Wiretap Evidence \r\nEscobar challenges the district court's denial of his\r\nmotion to suppress evidence derived from intercepted telephone\r\ncommunications, which he says violated Title III of the Omnibus\r\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.  2510-2522. \r\nIn March 1990 the district court issued a wiretap order\r\nauthorizing the interception of communications on telephone line\r\n809-256-2600, which was installed at Escobar's business, Sueo Real\r\nConstruction Company (\"Sueo Real\").  According to the district\r\ncourt's findings (which are not challenged on appeal), Escobar\r\nbroke the telephone's receiver in February or March 1990 and\r\nrefused to pay the telephone bills after becoming upset that people\r\nhad used the Sueo Real telephone to make long-distance phone\r\ncalls.  Cedrs thereafter \"extended a phone line\" to Cedrs's\r\ngrocery business, Colmado El Coqu, which was adjacent to Sueo\r\nReal, and paid the phone bills to keep the line in service. \r\nEscobar knew that Cedrs had extended the phone line, and in fact\r\nused the extension line in Colmado El Coqu himself on several\r\noccasions.\r\nEscobar argues that the intercepted communications must\r\nbe suppressed because they occurred at Colmado El Coqu, rather\r\nthan at the location specified in the wiretap order, Sueo Real. \r\nTo support this contention Escobar relies on 18 U.S.C.  2518(4),\r\nwhich provides that the order authorizing an interception specify\r\nfive items, including \"the nature and location of the \r\ncommunications facilities as to which, or the place where,\r\nauthority to intercept is granted.\"  18 U.S.C.  2518(4)(b).   The\r\norder's authorization, he argues, was limited to the telephone line\r\nat issue, which in turn was limited to the confines of Sueo Real. \r\nWe agree that by its terms the order authorized\r\ninterception of conversations occurring on the telephone line\r\ndenominated 809-256-2600, which was located in Sueo Real.  We find\r\nnothing in the statute, however, that requires the wiretap order to\r\nhave identified the particular locations of various extensions of\r\nthat telephone line, nor does Escobar cite any authority for that\r\nproposition.  The telephone line remained located in Sueo Real, as\r\nprovided in the wiretap order, even though it had apparently been\r\nrigged with a long extension cord to enable a person to access the\r\nline from a remote location (i.e., the adjacent Colmado El Coqu). \r\nMoreover, assuming arguendo that section 2518(4)(b) does\r\nrequire an order to identify the particular locations of various\r\nextensions of the same telephone line, it is well-settled that not\r\nevery failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in\r\nTitle III necessitates suppression.

The district court properly\r\ndenied Escobar's suppression motion. \r\n\nVI.  Variance\r\nEscobar contends that his conviction on Count 20,\r\ncharging him with attempted importation, must be reversed because\r\nof a fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence offered\r\nat trial.  Count 20 of the indictment charged, inter alia, that the\r\nMarch 13, 1990 attempted importation took place \"at Guayama, Puerto\r\nRico, in the District of Puerto Rico, and elsewhere and within the\r\njurisdiction of this Court.\"  At trial, informant Cedrs testified\r\nthat the attempted importation took place \"around the town of\r\nGunica, that part of the southern coast of Puerto Rico.\"  Escobar\r\nmoved to strike all evidence related to Count 20 because the\r\nindictment referred to Guayama, not Gunica.  Noting that both\r\ntowns were in the southern part of Puerto Rico and that they were\r\n\"not that far apart,\" the district court denied the motion. \r\nA variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a\r\nscenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the\r\nindictment.  See United States v. Paredes-Rodrguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759118\"><a href=\"/opinion/759118/united-states-v-jesus-paredes-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n56 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v.

A variance requires reversal of a conviction \"only if [the\r\nvariance] is both material and prejudicial, for example, if the\r\nvariance works a substantial interference with the defendant's\r\nright to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep.\" \r\nArcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6.  Where an indictment gives a defendant\r\n\"particular notice of the events charged, and the proof at trial\r\ncenters on those events, minor differences in the details of the\r\nfacts charged, as contrasted to those proved, are unlikely to be\r\neither material or prejudicial.\" Id. \r\nWe note preliminarily our reluctance to characterize what\r\nhappened here as a variance at all, given the breadth of the\r\nindictment's description of the physical location of the attempted\r\nimportation (\"Guayama, Puerto Rico, in the District of Puerto Rico,\r\nand elsewhere and within the jurisdiction of this Court\") and the\r\nambiguity of Cedrs's testimony (namely, that the attempted\r\nimportation took place \"around the town of Gunica, that part of\r\nthe southern coast of Puerto Rico\").  In any event, whatever\r\ndiscrepancy may have existed between the indictment and the\r\nevidence adduced at trial was neither material nor prejudicial. \r\nThe location of the attempted importation was not an element of the\r\ncrime; both towns are in southern Puerto Rico, and are within the\r\ndistrict court's jurisdiction; and Escobar does not contend that\r\nthe indictment's allegations caused him to be misinformed of the\r\ncharges against him.  In his closing argument to the jury, Escobar\r\npointed out the purported variance and other evidence that he\r\nconsidered to be contradictory.  It was the jury's province to\r\nresolve any conflicts in the evidence about the attempted\r\nimportation, see United States v. Angiulo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506589\"><a href=\"/opinion/506589/united-states-v-jason-brion-angiulo-united-states-of-america-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 967 (1st\r\nCir. 1988), and it rejected Escobar's arguments.  In these\r\ncircumstances, we find no merit to Escobar's claim of a fatal\r\nvariance.     \r\nVII.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nEscobar challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nsupporting his convictions on the CCE counts (counts 1 and 12); the\r\nassault counts (counts 5 and 6); the weapons counts (counts 7, 15,\r\n16); and one interstate travel count (count 18).  In considering\r\nhis sufficiency challenges, we must take the evidence in a light\r\nmost favorable to the verdicts, drawing all plausible inferences\r\nand resolving all credibility determinations in their favor.

Escobar asserts that the\r\ngovernment failed to establish the second, third, and fourth\r\nelements of the CCE offense.  \r\nAs to the second element, Escobar contends (1) that the\r\nevidence did not establish that the alleged violations were of a\r\n\"continuing\" nature   that is, that they were related to one\r\nanother, and (2) that the counts related to the 1990 planned\r\nimportations cannot constitute predicate offenses under the CCE\r\nstatute because those importations were too \"inchoate and\r\nincomplete.\"  For the reasons previously set forth in part II(A)\r\nsupra, we find ample evidence of the relatedness of Counts 10, 19,\r\n20, 23, 24, and 33. Furthermore, we find nothing in section 848\r\nthat limits predicate offenses to successful, completed drug\r\nimportations in the manner suggested by Escobar. See 21 U.S.C. \r\n848 (predicate offenses may consist of \"violations of [subchapter\r\nI] or subchapter II of [chapter 13]).     \r\nTurning to the third element under the CCE statute,\r\nEscobar argues that the government failed to prove that he\r\n\"occupie[d] a position of organizer, a supervisory position, or any\r\nother position of management,\"  21 U.S.C.  848, with respect to at\r\nleast five individuals.  In determining whether a defendant\r\norganized, supervised, or managed a criminal enterprise, we give\r\nthose terms their ordinary meaning.  See David, 940 F.2d at 731;\r\nsee also United States v.

Indeed, there is ample evidence in the record that\r\nEscobar acted in such capacity with respect to co-defendant Soto in\r\nthe March 5, 1990, telephone offense (Count 19); with respect to\r\nSantos in the March 13, 1990 telephone offense (Count 20); and with\r\nrespect to co-defendants Ismael Santiago-Corujo (\"Santiago\") and\r\nFlores during the conspiracy offense in connection with the April\r\n1990 plans to import cocaine by sea (Count 2).  Escobar does\r\ndispute, however, that he acted as an organizer, supervisor, or\r\nmanager with respect to a fifth individual, co-defendant Rivera,\r\nduring the November 21, 1989, drug offense.  Specifically, he\r\ncontends that the evidence showed that he had only \"an interest\" in\r\nthe transaction, given that Faccio, not he, was the original owner\r\nof the cocaine.  \r\nTo be an organizer, supervisor or manager within the\r\nmeaning of 21 U.S.C.  848, however, the defendant \"need not be the\r\ndominant organizer or manager of the enterprise; he need only\r\noccupy some managerial position with respect to five or more\r\npersons.\"  Rodrguez, 162 F.2d at 142 (quoting Hahn, 17 F.3d at 506\r\nn.4)).  As to the November 21, 1989 incident, there was evidence\r\nthat after receiving the cocaine from Faccio, Escobar delivered it\r\nto Cedrs, who in turn arranged for Rivera and co-defendant Ros to\r\nsmuggle the drugs onto a commercial airline flight; that Escobar\r\npurchased airline tickets; and that upon arriving in New York\r\nRivera called Escobar to report that the cocaine had been lost. \r\nMoreover, Cedrs testified generally that as to at least fourteen\r\nindividuals, including Rivera, Escobar was \"the top man, the person\r\nwho would plan, the person who would organize and the person who\r\nwould order all aspects of the organization.\" This evidence was\r\nsufficient for a rational jury to find that Rivera was acting under\r\nthe direction of Escobar on November 21, 1989 for the purposes of\r\nthe CCE statute.       \r\nFinally, Escobar contends that the government failed to\r\nprove that he obtained substantial income or other resources from\r\nthe CCE.  The substantial income requirement is meant \"to exclude\r\ntrivial amounts derived from occasional drug sales,\" Hahn, 17 F.3d\r\nat 507, and may be proven directly (by evidence of revenue or\r\nresources) or circumstantially (such as by evidence of the\r\ndefendant's position in the criminal organization and the volume of\r\ndrugs handled by the organization), see id.  In this case, the\r\ngovernment introduced evidence showing that from 1985 to 1989\r\nEscobar made expenditures of $238,766 for which no income source\r\ncould be identified; that in 1989 he spent approximately $300,000\r\nin cash, $216,000 of which came from unidentified sources; and that\r\nhis net worth as of October 1989 was more than one million dollars. \r\nThis evidence entitled the jury to conclude that Escobar obtained\r\n\"substantial income or resources\" within the meaning of section\r\n848.  Although Escobar contends that the government's evidence\r\ncontained inconsistencies and that Escobar's flush financial\r\nsituation could have a benign explanation, he made those arguments\r\nto the jury, which was free to reject them.

Batista-Polanco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); Tejeda, 974 F.2d at 213 (\"[T]he factfinder may\r\nfairly infer . . . that it runs counter to human experience to\r\nsuppose that criminal conspirators would welcome innocent\r\nnonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\").  The evidence was\r\nsufficient to support the Pinkerton charge.  \r\nC.  The Weapons Charges\r\nEscobar was charged in Count 7 with possessing a machine\r\ngun in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(o)(1).  In Counts 15 and 16,\r\nhe was charged with possessing firearms as a convicted felon in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1).  With respect to both Counts\r\n7 and 16, Escobar's main contention is that the uncorroborated\r\ntestimony of informant Cedrs concerning the weapons charges cannot\r\nsuffice to support his convictions. Cedrs's testimony, even if\r\nuncorroborated, was sufficient to support Escobar's conviction\r\nbecause it was not \"incredible or insubstantial on its face.\" \r\nUnited States v. Gmez-Pabn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546890\"><a href=\"/opinion/546890/united-states-v-luis-e-gomez-pabon-united-states-v-wilfredo/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 853 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(quoting United States v. Aponte-Surez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543061\"><a href=\"/opinion/543061/united-states-v-emigdio-aponte-suarez-united-states-of-america-v-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 489 (1st\r\nCir. 1990)).  Escobar also claims that the evidence showed that he\r\nwas not the actual owner of the machinegun at issue in Count 7. \r\nThere is nothing in the statute to suggest, however, that liability\r\nunder section 922(o)(1) turns on actual ownership; rather, that\r\nsection makes it unlawful to \"transfer or possess\" a machinegun. \r\n18 U.S.C.  922(o)(1).\r\nAs to Count 16, charging him with possessing a firearm as\r\na convicted felon, Escobar further contends that his possession of\r\nthe firearm at issue was too brief to support a conviction.  Cedrs\r\ntestified that in January 1990 co-defendant Fernando Montaez-\r\nBultrn (\"Montaez\") gave the firearm to Escobar, and that at some\r\npoint thereafter Escobar gave the firearm to Cedrs with\r\ninstructions to keep it until Montaez and co-defendant Cruz asked\r\nfor it.  This testimony is sufficient.  Even if Escobar actually\r\npossessed the firearm for a short period of time, duration of\r\npossession is not an element of the statute.  See 18 U.S.C. \r\n922(g)(1).  Moreover, a defendant's possession need not be actual;\r\nconstructive possession is encompassed by section 922(g)(1) as\r\nwell.  See United States v. Wight, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586812\"><a href=\"/opinion/586812/united-states-v-phillip-a-wight/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1398 (1st Cir.\r\n1992) (holding that \"as long as a convicted felon knowingly has the\r\npower and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and\r\ncontrol over a firearm or over the area in which the weapon is\r\nlocated, directly or through others, he is in possession of the\r\nfirearm\").   \r\nFinally, with respect to Count 15, also charging him with\r\npossessing a firearm as a convicted felon, Escobar notes that (1)\r\nthe firearm at issue was, under the government's theory of the\r\ncase, actually possessed by co-defendant Cruz and used to execute\r\nMatos; and (2) the jury acquitted Cruz of the killing.  Escobar\r\nargues that Cruz's acquittal on the murder charge indicates that\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to show that Cruz actually\r\npossessed the firearm; and that if there was insufficient evidence\r\nto show that Cruz actually possessed the firearm, then a fortiori\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to show that Escobar constructively\r\npossessed the firearm.  The logic of Escobar's argument falters at\r\nthe threshold.  Cruz's acquittal on the murder charge does not\r\nestablish that Cruz did not actually possess the firearm in\r\nquestion, nor does it establish that Escobar did not constructively\r\npossess the firearm.  Moreover, even if the verdicts were\r\ninconsistent (which they are not), this would not justify the\r\nvacation of Escobar's conviction under Count 15.  See United States\r\nv. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 (1984).   The evidence was sufficient to\r\nsupport the challenged weapons convictions.\r\nD.  The March 1990 Interstate Travel Charge\r\nFinally, Escobar challenges the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence supporting his conviction on Count 18 for aiding and\r\nabetting the interstate travel of co-defendant Jorge \"Papo Luciano\"\r\nValds-Alvarez (\"Valds\") to promote Escobar's drug trafficking, in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  1952 &amp; 2.  To establish a violation of\r\nsection 1952, the government must prove: (1) interstate travel or\r\nuse of an interstate facility; (2) with the intent to distribute\r\nthe proceeds of or otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on,\r\nor facilitate an unlawful activity; (3) followed by performance or\r\nattempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful\r\nactivity.  See United States v. Arruda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423901\"><a href=\"/opinion/423901/united-states-v-john-m-arruda-united-states-of-america-v-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681 (1st Cir.\r\n1983); United States v. Coran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362202\"><a href=\"/opinion/362202/united-states-v-samuel-mark-coran-united-states-of-america-v-deborah-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1st Cir. 1978). \r\nWhile Escobar concedes that Cedrs's testimony may have established\r\nthat Valds traveled from Miami to Puerto Rico (a necessary\r\nconcession in light of the evidence), Escobar nonetheless contends\r\nthat the evidence was insufficient to establish that Valds'\r\npurpose in such travel was \"to promote, manage, establish, carry\r\non, or facilitate\" Escobar's drug trafficking operation.  Cedrs\r\ntestified, however, that after the attempted importation of March\r\n13, 1990, Escobar spoke of using a friend from Miami, \"Papo\r\nLuciano,\" to assist in the importation of drugs through the\r\nnortheastern coast of Puerto Rico; and that in a recorded telephone\r\nconversation, Escobar mentioned a \"Georgie\" whom he had brought to\r\nPuerto Rico from Florida to participate in shipments that were\r\nbeing planned through the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico.  This\r\nunambiguous testimony was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Valds had traveled to Puerto Rico\r\nintending to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate\r\nEscobar's drug trafficking activities, and not for some lawful\r\npurpose.  \r\nVIII.  Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm Escobar's\r\nconvictions in all respects.\r\nAffirmed.                                                      \n</pre>",
