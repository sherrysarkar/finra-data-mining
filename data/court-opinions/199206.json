Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Jesus Miranda-Gonzalez on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E.

Pro    se     appellant   Jesus    Miranda-\n\nGonzalez appeals a district court order that denied his\n\nmotion for reconsideration of an order that denied his\n\nmotion to vacate    a $5000 fine that appellant must pay as a\n\nsanction for distributing cocaine.          See Miranda-Gonzalez v.\n\nUnited States, 181 F.3d 164, 165 (1 st Cir. 1999).               Having\n\nthoroughly reviewed the record and the parties' briefs on\n\nappeal,   we    conclude   that     the    district    court    lacked\n\njurisdiction to consider appellant's motions.            Contrary to\n\nappellant's contentions on appeal, 18 U.S.C. § 3742 provided\n\nno basis for jurisdiction, for this statute only authorizes\n\nreview of a sentence on direct appeal.          Appellant failed to\n\ntake such an appeal following his 1993 conviction, and he\n\ncannot attack his sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3742 at this\n\nlate stage.     Similarly, neither 28 U.S.C. § 2255 nor 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3573 provide an avenue for relief.               See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Merric, 166 F.3d 406, 412 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nSmullen v. United States, 94 F.3d 20, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. Linker, 920 F.2d 1, 1-2 (7 th Cir. 1990);\n\nUnited States v. Michaud, 901 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1990).            And\n\nsince appellant committed the underlying drug offense long\n\nafter November 1, 1987, he may not seek to revise his\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fsentence under the former Fed. R. Crim. P. 35.   The present\n\nversion of this rule also provides appellant no relief.\n\n         In view of the foregoing, the district court's\n\norder denying appellant's motion for reconsideration is\n\nvacated and the court is directed to dismiss the motion for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.   See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                            -3-\n\f",
