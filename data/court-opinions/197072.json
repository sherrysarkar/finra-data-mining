We  affirm the  district court\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\nA.   The Offense of Conviction\r          A.   The Offense of Conviction\r                                        \r\n\n          On  the evening  of April  18, 1991,  multiple gunshots\r\n\nrang out on the  grounds of the Lenox Street  Housing Development\r\n\nin Boston.  Five Boston police officers in plain clothes, members\r\n\nof the Anti-gang  Violence Unit,  were on routine  patrol at  the\r\n\ntime, and  saw Raymond  Moreno, Stephen Fernandes,  and appellant\r\n\nHardy run  from the  area where  the shots had  been fired.   The\r\n\nofficers gave chase on  foot.  Just before submitting  to arrest,\r\n\nMoreno handed a long, dark, cylindrical object to Hardy, who kept\r\n\non running  through the residential neighborhood  adjacent to the\r\n\nhousing development.  Shortly  after the officers overtook Hardy,\r\n\nbut before he  could be subjected  to arrest, he tossed  a loaded\r\n\nBrowning .32 caliber semi-automatic pistol onto the ground.  \r\n\n          Following  Hardy's  arrest, the  officers  retraced his\r\n\nlikely  route from  the shooting  scene to  the arrest  scene and\r\n\nfound  a  fully-loaded,  sawed-off,  twelve-gauge,  double-barrel\r\n\nshotgun planted barrel-up in  the backyard garden of  a residence\r\n\noccupied  by  a  family  with  three  young  children.    Nearby,\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nFernandes was arrested while in possession of an unloaded  Helwan\r\n\n9  millimeter semi-automatic  pistol, later  confirmed to  be the\r\n\nfirearm discharged  at the Lenox Street  Housing Development site\r\n\nwhere the police first observed Hardy and two associates.  Later,\r\n\nHardy falsely denied knowing  either Moreno or Fernandes, claimed\r\n\nto be living with his mother, and gave a false home address.\r\n\nB.   The Trial and First Appeal\r          B.   The Trial and First Appeal\r                                         \r\n\n          Hardy  was  charged  with  being a  felon  in  unlawful\r\n\npossession  of a  firearm,  18 U.S.C.     922(g)(1), as  well  as\r\n\nunlawful possession of ammunition, id., and with possession of an\r                                                \r\n\nunregistered firearm, 26 U.S.C.    5861(d).  As Hardy's extensive\r\n\ncriminal record  included three violent felonies  and one serious\r\n\ndrug  offense  since 1985,  the  government gave  notice  that it\r\n\nintended  to  seek  the  mandatory  minimum  fifteen-year  prison\r\n\nsentence authorized  under the Armed Career  Criminal Act (ACCA),\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(e); see also  U.S.S.G.   4B1.4.  Following trial,\r                                      \r\n\nHardy was convicted and sentenced to 262 months in prison. \r\n\n          While Hardy's first appeal was pending, this court held\r\n\nthat a criminal defendant exposed to an ACCA sentencing  enhance-\r\n\nment may  challenge any  predicate state court  conviction during\r\n\nhis  federal sentencing  proceeding even  though his  state court\r\n\nremedies  have never been exhausted.  United States v. Paleo, 967\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 7, 11-12 (1st  Cir. 1992).  We accordingly  remanded Hardy's\r\n\ncase to the district court for reconsideration in light of Paleo.\r                                                                          \r\n\nC.   The First Remand and Second Appeal\r          C.   The First Remand and Second Appeal\r                                                 \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          On remand, the district court again imposed a 262-month\r\n\nprison  term, after  rejecting Hardy's  claim that  his predicate\r\n\nstate court  convictions were invalid.   United States  v. Hardy,\r                                                                          \r\n\n829 F. Supp. 478 (D. Mass. 1993).  Hardy again appealed.  Without\r\n\nreaching  the  sentencing  claims,  this  court  vacated  Hardy's\r\n\nfederal convictions on the  ground that the prosecution had  made\r\n\nimproper  comments  during closing  argument  at  trial.   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Hardy, 37 F.3d 753 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                         \r\n\nD.   The Second Remand and Sentencing \r          D.   The Second Remand and Sentencing \r                                               \r\n\n          During the second remand, Hardy  obtained a continuance\r\n\nand  successfully challenged  two  of the  predicate state  court\r\n\nconvictions.  As  he was no longer subject  to the ACCA mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence,  he  then  pled guilty  to  all  three  federal\r\n\ncharges.\r\n\n          At  the  resentencing,  the district  court  began  its\r\n\nguideline  calculation with a base offense level (BOL) of 18, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1(a)(1)  (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or  Trans-\r\n\nportation  of  Firearms or  Ammunition)  (1990),  then adopted  a\r\n\nrevised presentence  report (PSR) recommendation  that Hardy  not\r\n\nreceive a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of respon-\r\n\nsibility,  see  id.    3E1.1.1   The  court set  Hardy's criminal\r                             \r\n\nhistory category  (CHC)  at  III (6  points),  by  counting  four\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Unless otherwise  indicated, we  cite to the  November 1990\r\nguidelines in effect on the date of the offense of conviction.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nunvacated  prior convictions at one point each, see id.   4A1.1,2\r                                                                 \r\n\nand adding two points  because Hardy was on probation at the time\r\n\nthe offense of conviction was committed.  The resulting guideline\r\n\nsentencing  range (GSR)  for  Level 18,  CHC  III, was  33  to 41\r\n\nmonths.   \r\n\n          The district court decided  to make an upward departure\r\n\ndue to Hardy's \"ten-year history of grievous antisocial conduct,\"\r\n\nciting eight reasons:   (1)  CHC III did  not adequately  reflect\r\n\neither the  seriousness of Hardy's  past criminal conduct  or the\r\n\nlikelihood of  recidivism; (2) only one month  before the offense\r\n\nof conviction, Hardy  had been arrested and  charged with another\r\n\n\"very serious offense\"    his and Moreno's shooting and attempted\r\n\nmurder of a  fourteen-year-old boy, Kenneth  Walker, at the  same\r\n\nLenox  Street Housing Development; (3)  Hardy was on  bail in the\r\n\nWalker case at the  time he committed the offense  of conviction;\r\n\n(4) Hardy had been  arrested and charged with four  violent felo-\r\n\nnies  between 1985 and 1990, including kidnapping and assault and\r\n\nbattery, which  were not taken into account in the CHC III calcu-\r\n\nlation since  the state  court  charges had  been dismissed;  (5)\r\n\nHardy's two prior state court convictions for assault and battery\r\n\nagainst his  girlfriend and another  woman had been  vacated, not\r\n\nbecause  Hardy  was  not  responsible for  the  criminal  conduct\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The four state-court  convictions counted  by the  district\r\ncourt were:  (1) a 1985  conviction for cocaine possession; (2) a\r\n1988  conviction for assault and battery on a police officer; (3)\r\na  1990 conviction for drug possession; and (4) a 1990 conviction\r\nfor  possession with intent  to distribute cocaine  and heroin at\r\nLenox Street.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nunderlying the  convictions but due to  procedural infirmities at\r\n\ntrial;3 (6) \"the [two] weapons used . . . in this federal case [a\r\n\nsawed-off  shotgun and  semi-automatic pistol]  were particularly\r\n\ndangerous weapons\";  (7) officers of the  Anti-gang Violence Unit\r\n\nattested that the offense of conviction was part of a long series\r\n\nof  violent  drug-related  offenses  in  the  same  neighborhood,\r\n\ncommitted  by street gangs like the Columbia Point Dogs, of which\r\n\nHardy,  Moreno, and  Fernandes were  known  members; and  (8) the\r\n\noffense  of  conviction  occurred in  an  economically  depressed\r\n\nneighborhood \"where very vulnerable people live.\"  \r\n\n          The district  court determined that even  a full \"hori-\r\n\nzontal\" departure from Level 18, CHC III (33-41 months), to Level\r\n\n18, CHC VI (57-71  months), would be inadequate to  reflect these\r\n\neight factors.  Accordingly, the court determined  upon a \"verti-\r\n\ncal\"  upward  departure as  well, from  Level  18, CHC  VI (57-71\r\n\nmonths) to Level  24, CHC VI (100-125 months).   The court gauged\r\n\nits  vertical departure  through reference  to the  121-151 month\r\n\n(Level 32, CHC I) GSR  which would have been applicable  to Hardy\r\n\nunder  the  then-current   (i.e.,  November  1994)   guidelines.4\r                                          \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3According to the revised PSR, the  1985 assault and battery\r\ncharges were based  on evidence  that Hardy, in  a jealous  rage,\r\nkicked his girlfriend in the head and upper body then punched her\r\nin the head before  throwing her over a third-floor balcony.   In\r\nthe subsequent incident, he assaulted the same girlfriend and her\r\nsister,  beating both women about their heads and faces.  Hardy's\r\ngirlfriend was hospitalized on both occasions.\r\n\n     4The court arrived at  its adjusted BOL of 32  by increasing\r\nthe BOL (26)  six levels based  on \"various offense  characteris-\r\ntics.\"  Although the court did not cite to the  particular guide-\r\nline sections,  the government concedes that  the relevant guide-\r\nlines were U.S.S.G.    2K2.1(b)(4) (1994)  (use or possession  of\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nUltimately, the court settled  upon the 120-month prison sentence\r\n\nfrom which Hardy now appeals.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nfirearm  with an  obliterated  serial number)  and    2K2.1(b)(5)\r\n(1994) (use or  possession of firearm in connection  with another\r\nfelony offense [i.e., ongoing drug distribution]).\r                              \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nA.

Acceptance of Responsibility\r                                           \r\n\n          The district court denied  a two-level downward adjust-\r\n\nment for acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G.    3E1.1, for\r                                                    \r\n\nthe following reasons: \r\n\n          There was in fact a  trial of the offense  in\r\n          this  case  four  or so  years  ago,  [during\r\n          which] the defendant denied knowing the code-\r\n          fendant in that case,  and . .  . that . .  .\r\n          does bespeak . .  . failure to accept respon-\r\n          sibility, and then there was an appeal .  . .\r\n          during which there still was no acceptance of\r\n          responsibility, and  . .  . I think  I should\r\n          consider the fact . . . that a plea of guilty\r\n          in this case did not occur . . . until [after\r\n          Hardy's  two  predicate convictions  had been\r\n          set aside in state court.]  I don't criticize\r\n          counsel for undertaking that because it makes\r\n          some difference to the kinds of sentence that\r\n          may be  ultimately imposed in  this case, but\r\n          it strikes me that none of this suggests that\r\n          there  has been  a sincere acceptance  of re-\r\n          sponsibility.\r\n\nHardy asserts two challenges to the district court ruling.5\r\n\n          First, while  acknowledging that he  must establish any\r\n\nentitlement  to an  adjustment for acceptance  of responsibility,\r\n\nsee United States v.

Even assuming such a practice, which the govern-\r\nment  disputes, Hardy's  reliance  upon it  would be  objectively\r\nunreasonable  given the unequivocal guideline provision that \"[a]\r\ndefendant  who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to a sentenc-\r\ning reduction under this section as a matter of right,\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n   3E1.1(c), not to mention  the decisional law  in this circuit,\r\nsee United States v. Garcia, 905 F.2d 557, 561 (1st Cir.) (\"Down-\r                                     \r\nward adjustments  for acceptance of responsibility  are not auto-\r\nmatically  conferred upon  every  accused  who pleads  guilty.\"),\r\ncert.  denied, 498  U.S. 986 (1990).   Since    3E1.1 makes clear\r                       \r\nthat the  district court  must assess each  defendant's protesta-\r\ntions of remorse,  it would  be inconsistent with  its spirit  to\r\npermit  defendants to withhold  manifestations of  remorse simply\r\nbecause  the district court has not explicitly invited them.  See\r                                                                           \r\nRoyer,  895 F.2d at  30 (noting that    3E1.1 is  not designed to\r               \r\nencourage \"empty platitudes\"). \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          Second,  Hardy  contends that  he  reasonably refrained\r\n\nfrom pleading guilty until  after he had returned to  state court\r\n\nto  set aside two of his predicate convictions, since the govern-\r\n\nment's  decision to invoke the  ACCA otherwise would have exposed\r\n\nhim  to  a possible  life sentence  and  at least  a fifteen-year\r\n\nsentence,  instead  of  a  ten-year maximum.    Consequently,  he\r\n\nargues,  the  district court  improperly  relied  on the  delayed\r\n\nguilty  plea as  a basis  for finding  that he  had not  accepted\r\n\nresponsibility for his crimes.   \r\n\n          It is far  from clear  that the statement  made by  the\r\n\ndistrict court was intended to convey the message Hardy suggests.\r\n\nViewed  in context,  the  statement may  well have  been intended\r\n\nmerely  as a narrative of the prolonged procedural travel of this\r\n\ncase, during which Hardy never uttered a word remotely resembling\r\n\nremorse.   In  all  events, assuming  the  statement were  to  be\r\n\ninterpreted  as Hardy  suggests, we  conclude that  any resulting\r\n\nerror  was harmless in that it did not affect Hardy's substantial\r\n\nrights, see  Fed.

Undeterred,  Hardy  argues  that  a false\r\n\nstatement to the  police immediately after  arrest    as  distin-\r\n\nguished from a  misrepresentation to the probation office  or the\r\n\ncourt after  criminal proceedings  have been commenced     should\r\n\nnot be treated  as a failure to  accept responsibility.   We need\r\n\nventure no opinion on this matter, since Hardy cannot come within\r\n\nthe proposed rule in any event.\r\n\n          Rather, the  revised PSR  indicates  that though  Hardy\r\n\nfirst provided the false home  address to the police,  thereafter\r\n\nhe repeated  it to the United States Pretrial Services Department\r\n\nand a magistrate  judge.  Moreover,  Hardy lied about  possessing\r\n\nand concealing  the dangerous firearm (sawed  off shotgun) rather\r\n\nthan assisting in its recovery, and has never recanted.  Finally,\r\n\nhe  attempted to  evade and resist  arrest rather  than surrender\r\n\nvoluntarily.   By  contrast, the applicable  guideline commentary\r\n\nclearly  identifies the  kinds of  conduct considered  indicia of\r                                        \r\n\nacceptance of  responsibility:  a \"voluntary  and truthful admis-\r\n\nsion to authorities of involvement in the  offense,\" a \"voluntary\r\n\nsurrender  to authorities  promptly after  commission of  the of-\r\n\nfense,\" and \"voluntary assistance  to authorities in the recovery\r\n\nof the  fruits  and  instrumentalities  of  the  offense.\"    See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1, comment.

By  ignoring  this plain  option, and\r                                  \r\n\nfailing  to explain,  Hardy put  the government  to the  needless\r\n\nexpense of trying  him.  See  United States v.

Finally,  the  sentencing  court   assiduously\r\n\nsearched the  record and  observed Hardy's in-court  demeanor for\r\n\nany indication that he  was truly remorseful.  Instead,  it found\r\n\nonly his  unelucidated guilty plea,  with no mention  of remorse,\r\n\nand an extensive record of persisting criminal conduct \"inconsis-\r\n\ntent\" with genuine remorse.

The reference to  the number  of firearms was  made by  the\r\n\ndistrict court in the context of its discussion of the heightened\r\n\ndangerousness associated  with the manner in which  Hardy and his\r\n\ncohorts  not only possessed but  used their firearms.   See infra\r                                                                           \r\n\nSection II.B.2(b); cf.

The  use  and/or  indiscriminate\r\n\ndisposal of multiple weapons which took place in this case surely\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nelevated their dangerousness well above the level associated with\r\n\nthe simple possession of a single firearm.  \r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n          Moreover,  rather than being categorically forbidden as\r\n\na departure ground under section 2K2.1, the heightened dangerous-\r\n\nness occasioned by the  usage, and indiscriminate abandonment, of\r\n\nthe firearms involved here is encouraged as a departure ground in\r\n\nappropriate circumstances:\r\n\n          If  a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used\r                                                                      \r\n          or possessed in the  commission of the offense the\r                                \r\n          court may increase the  sentence above the  autho-\r\n          rized guideline range.  The extent of the increase\r\n          ordinarily  should depend on  the dangerousness of\r\n          the weapon, the  manner in which  it is used,  and\r\n          the  extent to  which it  endangered others.   The\r                                                                      \r\n          discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial\r                                          \r\n          sentence increase.\r\n\nSee U.S.S.G.   5K2.6 (emphasis added).9  \r             \r\n\n          Finally, the  fact that the  Commission decided against\r\n\nmaking  \"weapon  type\" a  specific  offense characteristic  under\r\n\nsection  2K2.1 in no sense indicates that it intended to preclude\r\n\na  judicial  determination  that  certain types  of  weapons  are\r\n\ninherently more dangerous than others, but simply that possession\r\n\nof a  particular type of weapon, in and of itself, is not invari-\r\n\nably  indicative of  the defendant's  intent.   For example,  the\r\n\nguidelines permit  a downward adjustment for  the illegal posses-\r\n\nsion  of a  firearm  intended for  recreational  use only.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1, comment.

See Figaro, 935 F.2d at  7 (\"[R]ecency of\r                                            \r\n\na  prior offense  may  be considered  an  indicator of  increased\r\n\nlikelihood  of  recidivism,  exacerbating  the  seriousness  of a\r\n\ndefendant's criminal history.\").   Given his  recent, persistent,\r\n\nand  escalating record of violent behavior,  see United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDoe, 18 F.3d  41, 47 (1st Cir.  1994) (noting that departure  was\r             \r\n\nwarranted  where defendant's  past criminal  conduct demonstrated\r\n\n\"significantly  unusual penchant  for  serious criminality\"),  we\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11As the government  aptly notes, Hardy was under  some sort\r\nof court supervision at the time of almost all his prior arrests.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nfind no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision that\r\n\nan upward  departure was warranted because  Hardy's pre-departure\r\n\nCHC underrepresented the seriousness of his past criminal conduct\r\n\nand the likelihood of recidivism.  See Koon, 116 S. Ct. at  2046-\r                                                     \r\n\n47  (holding  that district  court  is  entitled to  \"substantial\r\n\ndeference\"  in its  determination that  particular facts  of case\r\n\nimplicate a departure factor).\r\n\n          b)   Offense-Related Characteristics (  5K2.0)\r                    b)   Offense-Related Characteristics (  5K2.0)\r                                                                  \r\n\n          Similarly, we find  little merit in the  claim that the\r\n\nsentencing court abused its discretion in finding three \"unusual\"\r\n\noffense-related characteristics cumulatively  adequate to  remove\r\n\nHardy's  case from the \"heartland\" of section 2K2.1 cases.  Given\r\n\ntheir recognized utility and ubiquity in a very broad spectrum of\r\n\ncriminal  activities,  firearms  presumably may  be  possessed in\r\n\ncircumstances posing  widely divergent degrees  of dangerousness.\r\n\nAccordingly, it is not apparent to us that the Sentencing Commis-\r\n\nsion attempted, let alone managed, to devise section 2K2.1 with a\r\n\nview to  the extraordinary dangers  posed by gang  members indis-\r\n\ncriminately  shooting  and   discarding  particularly   dangerous\r\n\nfirearms in crowded inner-city residential areas.12 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12Hardy argues that street  gangs are such a \"fact  of life\"\r\nin the inner city that the Commission  could not but have antici-\r\npated that  a large  percentage of  criminal defendants  would be\r\nstreet gang members.   Of  course, the focus  of the  \"heartland\"\r\ninquiry is not nearly  so broad.  Instead, sentencing  courts are\r\nto inquire  whether one reasonably would expect an unusual number\r\nof defendants  convicted of  firearm/ammunition possession to  be\r\ngang  members.  See,  e.g., Koon, 116  S. Ct.  at 2052 (rejecting\r                                          \r\n\"career  loss\" as downward departure criterion  for purposes of  \r\n2H1.4,  since  it is  not  \"unusual\"  for  many public  officials\r\nconvicted of civil rights violations to lose their jobs).\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n          Hardy and his associates  repeatedly discharged a semi-\r\n\nautomatic  weapon  at  nighttime  within  a  crowded  residential\r\n\nhousing development  and, while fleeing  from the scene  to evade\r\n\narrest, Hardy planted a loaded sawed-off shotgun barrel-up in the\r                                                                    \r\n\nbackyard of a residence where children lived and played.  Without\r\n\ndeciding whether  it would suffice  as an independent  ground for\r                                                               \r\n\ndeparture,  we  think  the  district court,  in  these  egregious\r\n\ncircumstances, did  not abuse  its discretion by  concluding that\r\n\ncrowded,  low-income, inner-city  neighborhoods are  likely as  a\r\n\nrule to be  more vulnerable to the hazards posed by such reckless\r\n\nand indiscriminate criminal uses of firearms.\r\n\n          Lastly,  the record  includes  affidavits from  law en-\r\n\nforcement  officers  describing  Hardy's,  and  his  associates',\r\n\nlengthy affiliation with the Columbia Point Dogs, a Boston street\r\n\ngang  with  a  conspicuous  history of  inter-gang  violence  and\r\n\nillicit drug distribution in  the Lenox Street area.   The record\r\n\nfurther supports the conclusion that on April 18, 1991, Hardy and\r\n\nhis associates possessed the semi-automatic weapons and sawed-off\r\n\nshotgun  for the  purpose  of facilitating  their gang's  ongoing\r\n\nterrorization of the Lenox  Street neighborhood in furtherance of\r\n\nits drug  distribution operations.   See, e.g., United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSweeting,  933  F.3d  962,  966-67 (11th  Cir.  1991)  (affirming\r                  \r\n\ndefendant's  ongoing connection  to  street  gang as  appropriate\r\n\nground for departure); accord  United States v.

Accordingly, we find no manifest abuse\r\n\nof  discretion by the  district court.   See Koon, 116  S. Ct. at\r                                                           \r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n2046-47.  \r\n\n     3.   Reasonableness of Degree of Departure\r               3.

See United States v.  Tropiano, 50 F.3d 157, 162\r                                                         \r\n\n(2d Cir. 1995); supra  Section II.B.1 (contrasting \"unguided\" and\r                               \r\n\n\"guided\"  departures).   He  further  argues  that section  4A1.3\r\n\nrarely permits a sentencing court to depart beyond the sentencing\r\n\nrange  prescribed by CHC VI based on an \"egregious\" past criminal\r\n\nrecord, and, as such, it  constitutes a \"discouraged\" ground  for\r\n\ndeparture. \r\n\n          We need not reach either of  these arguments, since the\r\n\ndeparture decision was  not founded on section 4A1.3  alone, cf.,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  Fahm,  13 F.3d  at 450  &amp;  n.2 (involving  departure based\r                     \r\n\nexclusively  on   4A1.3 criteria), but on both sections 4A1.3 and\r\n\n5K2.0.  See  United States v.  Aymelek, 926 F.2d  64, 69-70  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1991) (noting  that    5K2.0 and 4A1.3 need  not be an \"'ei-\r\n\nther/or' proposition,\" and  that both  may be used  to support  a\r\n\nsingle departure decision).  The district court relied in part on\r\n\nsome offense-related  attributes (e.g., number  and dangerousness\r                                                \r\n\nof  weapons)  independently  sufficient  to  justify an  unguided\r\n\nvertical  departure under  section  5K2.0.   In determining  such\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\n\"mixed\" departures, no useful purpose is served by insisting that\r\n\nthe  sentencing court  adhere to  all section  4A1.3 formalities,\r\n\nonly to countenance its \"unguided\" discretion to make  an \"appro-\r\n\npriate\"  non-horizontal  departure  under  section  5K2.0.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFigaro, 935  F.2d at  8-9 (rejecting \"leap-frogging\"  argument in\r                \r\n\n\"mixed\"    4A1.3-5K2.0 case).\r\n\n          Finally,  Hardy's   protestations  notwithstanding,  we\r\n\ncannot conclude  that the  degree of departure  was unreasonable.\r\n\nSee DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1322.   A sentencing court is not required\r                    \r\n\nto \"dissect its departure decision, explaining in mathematical or\r\n\npseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice made.\"   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 408 (1st Cir. 1995).   Similarly,\r                           \r\n\nthe reasonableness vel non  of the degree of departure  need \"not\r                                    \r\n\n[] be determined by rigid  adherence to a particular  mechanistic\r\n\nformula,  but by an evaluation of 'the overall aggregate of known\r\n\ncircumstances.'\" Figaro,  935 F.2d at 9  n.2 (citations omitted).\r                                 \r\n\nWhile the departure in this case is indeed substantial (300%), we\r\n\nhave  affirmed larger ones. See Rostoff, 53 F.2d at 411 (collect-\r                                                 \r\n\ning  cases affirming  upward departures ranging  from 165  to 380\r\n\npercent).   Further, the district  court \"checked\" the  degree of\r\n\nits  departure  by  calculating the  hypothetical  sentence Hardy\r\n\nwould have received had he been sentenced under the November 1994\r\n\nguidelines (121-151  months), on  the theory that  the Commission\r\n\nhad since incorporated  many of the offense-related  characteris-\r\n\ntics that formed the  bases for the district court's  decision to\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\ndepart in this case.13  Given Hardy's persistent ten-year history\r\n\nof violent anti-social behavior, as  well as the dangerousness of\r\n\nhis conduct on  April 18,  1991, in possessing  and abandoning  a\r\n\nparticularly dangerous firearm in a residential  neighborhood, we\r\n\ncannot  say that  the  degree of  the  departure imposed  by  the\r\n\ndistrict court was not \"appropriate\" in the circumstances.\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  the district court judgment\r\n\nis affirmed.\r                     \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13Hardy argues that the district court erred in this regard.\r\nThe government  concedes that the court  incorrectly enhanced the\r\nhypothetical offense level two levels by relying on the fact that\r\none of Hardy's weapons  had an obliterated serial number.   Thus,\r\nthe correct hypothetical total offense level should have been 30,\r\nnot 32.   The error was  harmless, however, since the  court also\r\nassigned Hardy  a CHC I, Level 32, rather than CHC III, Level 30.\r\nBoth prescribe a sentencing range of 121-151 months.  \r\n\n                                28\r\r\n",

The Offense of Conviction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of April 18, 1991, multiple gunshots rang out on the grounds of the Lenox Street Housing Development in Boston.  Five Boston police officers in plain clothes, members of the Anti-gang Violence Unit, were on routine patrol at the time, and saw Raymond Moreno, Stephen Fernandes, and appellant Hardy run from the area where the shots had been fired.  The officers gave chase on foot.  Just before submitting to arrest, Moreno handed a long, dark, cylindrical object to Hardy, who kept on running through the residential neighborhood adjacent to the housing development.  Shortly after the officers overtook Hardy, but before he could be subjected to arrest, he tossed a loaded Browning .32 caliber semi-automatic pistol onto the ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Hardy's arrest, the officers retraced his likely route from the shooting scene to the arrest scene and found a fully-loaded, sawed-off, twelve-gauge, double-barrel shotgun planted barrel-up in the backyard garden of a residence occupied by a family with three young children.  Nearby, Fernandes was arrested while in possession of an unloaded Helwan 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol, later confirmed to be the firearm discharged at the Lenox Street Housing Development site where the police first observed Hardy and two associates.  Later, Hardy falsely denied knowing either Moreno or Fernandes, claimed to be living with his mother, and gave a false home address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Trial and First Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy was charged with being a felon in unlawful possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), as well as unlawful possession of ammunition, id., and with possession of an unregistered firearm, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d).  As Hardy's extensive criminal record included three violent felonies and one serious drug offense since 1985, the government gave notice that it intended to seek the mandatory minimum fifteen-year prison sentence authorized under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4.  Following trial, Hardy was convicted and sentenced to 262 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hardy's first appeal was pending, this court held that a criminal defendant exposed to an ACCA sentencing enhancement may challenge any predicate state court conviction during his federal sentencing proceeding even though his state court remedies have never been exhausted.  United States v. Paleo, 967 F.2d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir.1992).  We accordingly remanded Hardy's case to the district court for reconsideration in light of Paleo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The First Remand and Second Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court again imposed a 262-month prison term, after rejecting Hardy's claim that his predicate state court convictions were invalid.  United States v. Hardy, 829 F.Supp. 478 (D.Mass.1993).  Hardy again appealed.  Without reaching the sentencing claims, this court vacated Hardy's federal convictions on the ground that the prosecution had made improper comments during closing argument at trial.  United States v. Hardy, 37 F.3d 753 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Second Remand and Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the second remand, Hardy obtained a continuance and successfully challenged two of the predicate state court convictions.  As he was no longer subject to the ACCA mandatory minimum sentence, he then pled guilty to all three federal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the resentencing, the district court began its guideline calculation with a base offense level (BOL) of 18, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a)(1) (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) (1990), then adopted a revised presentence report (PSR) recommendation that Hardy not receive a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, see id.  &#167; 3E1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court set Hardy's criminal history category (CHC) at III (6 points), by counting four unvacated prior convictions at one point each, see id.  &#167;  4A1.1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and adding two points because Hardy was on probation at the time the offense of conviction was committed.  The resulting guideline sentencing range (GSR) for Level 18, CHC III, was 33 to 41 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided to make an upward departure due to Hardy's \"ten-year history of grievous antisocial conduct,\" citing eight reasons:  (1) CHC III did not adequately reflect either the seriousness of Hardy's past criminal conduct or the likelihood of recidivism;  (2) only one month before the offense of conviction, Hardy had been arrested and charged with another \"very serious offense\"--his and Moreno's shooting and attempted murder of a fourteen-year-old boy, Kenneth Walker, at the same Lenox Street Housing Development;  (3) Hardy was on bail in the Walker case at the time he committed the offense of conviction;  (4) Hardy had been arrested and charged with four violent felonies between 1985 and 1990, including kidnapping and assault and battery, which were not taken into account in the CHC III calculation since the state court charges had been dismissed;  (5) Hardy's two prior state court convictions for assault and battery against his girlfriend and another woman had been vacated, not because Hardy was not responsible for the criminal conduct underlying the convictions but due to procedural infirmities at trial;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  (6) \"the [two] weapons used ... in this federal case [a sawed-off shotgun and semi-automatic pistol] were particularly dangerous weapons\";  (7) officers of the Anti-gang Violence Unit attested that the offense of conviction was part of a long series of violent drug-related offenses in the same neighborhood, committed by street gangs like the Columbia Point Dogs, of which Hardy, Moreno, and Fernandes were known members;  and (8) the offense of conviction occurred in an economically depressed neighborhood \"where very vulnerable people live.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that even a full \"horizontal\" departure from Level 18, CHC III (33-41 months), to Level 18, CHC VI (57-71 months), would be inadequate to reflect these eight factors.  Accordingly, the court determined upon a \"vertical\" upward departure as well, from Level 18, CHC VI (57-71 months) to Level 24, CHC VI (100-125 months).  The court gauged its vertical departure through reference to the 121-151 month (Level 32, CHC I) GSR which would have been applicable to Hardy under the then-current (i.e., November 1994) guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Ultimately, the court settled upon the 120-month prison sentence from which Hardy now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, for the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>There was in fact a trial of the offense in this case four or so years ago, [during which] the defendant denied knowing the codefendant in that case, and ... that ... does bespeak ... failure to accept responsibility, and then there was an appeal ... during which there still was no acceptance of responsibility, and ... I think I should consider the fact ... that a plea of guilty in this case did not occur ... until [after Hardy's two predicate convictions had been set aside in state court.]  I don't criticize counsel for undertaking that because it makes some difference to the kinds of sentence that may be ultimately imposed in this case, but it strikes me that none of this suggests that there has been a sincere acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy asserts two challenges to the district court ruling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, while acknowledging that he must establish any entitlement to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, see United States v. Gonzales, 12 F.3d 298, 300 (1st Cir.1993), Hardy argues that section 3E1.1 creates a rebuttable presumption that a defendant who has pled guilty has carried his burden of proof, even though the record discloses no affirmative manifestations of remorse.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.3) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention is severely undercut by the pertinent guideline commentary, however, which plainly provides that \"[e]ntry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.3) (emphasis added).  The revised PSR discloses that Hardy, despite ample time and opportunity, has never truthfully admitted the facts underlying the offense of conviction, let alone subjectively manifested \"candor and authentic remorse.\"   See United States v. Wheelwright, 918 F.2d 226, 229 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming Hardy had truthfully admitted the relevant facts, nothing in the commentary upon which he relies remotely indicates that a guilty plea, even combined with a truthful admission, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.3), gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility will follow.  Indeed, Hardy's prolonged reticence aside, the commentary explicitly states that even the \"significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility\" generated by \"a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission,\" id., \"may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.  A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.\"  Id. (1994) (emphasis added);  see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(c) &amp; comment.  (n.3) (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the sentencing court must engage in a fact-intensive determination based on all evidence material to the defendant's acceptance of responsibility.  We in turn accord great deference to the sentencing court's determination.  See id. comment.  (n.5);  United States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Credibility and demeanor play a crucial role in determining whether a person is genuinely contrite,\" and \"the sentencing judge has the unique opportunity of observing the defendant ... and evaluating acceptance of responsibility in a live context.\").  Thus, nothing can come from Hardy's \"rebuttable presumption\" construct, both because it is legally unsound and because Hardy lied to the police and to a magistrate judge regarding his lack of prior association with codefendants Moreno and Fernandes, and gave a false home address which has never been recanted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Hardy contends that he reasonably refrained from pleading guilty until after he had returned to state court to set aside two of his predicate convictions, since the government's decision to invoke the ACCA otherwise would have exposed him to a possible life sentence and at least a fifteen-year sentence, instead of a ten-year maximum.  Consequently, he argues, the district court improperly relied on the delayed guilty plea as a basis for finding that he had not accepted responsibility for his crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far from clear that the statement made by the district court was intended to convey the message Hardy suggests.  Viewed in context, the statement may well have been intended merely as a narrative of the prolonged procedural travel of this case, during which Hardy never uttered a word remotely resembling remorse.  In all events, assuming the statement were to be interpreted as Hardy suggests, we conclude that any resulting error was harmless in that it did not affect Hardy's substantial rights, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a);  United States v. Curran, 926 F.2d 59, 62 (1st Cir.1991), since the alternative basis for denying the requested &#167; 3E1.1 reduction was entirely valid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest, Hardy lied when he told the police he had not known codefendant Moreno prior to April 18, 1991, whereas in fact Hardy and Moreno had shot Kenneth Walker in March 1991.  In addition, the record reveals that Hardy, after his arrest, lied about not having possessed a firearm, and gave police a false home address.  Undeterred, Hardy argues that a false statement to the police immediately after arrest--as distinguished from a misrepresentation to the probation office or the court after criminal proceedings have been commenced--should not be treated as a failure to accept responsibility.  We need venture no opinion on this matter, since Hardy cannot come within the proposed rule in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the revised PSR indicates that though Hardy first provided the false home address to the police, thereafter he repeated it to the United States Pretrial Services Department and a magistrate judge.  Moreover, Hardy lied about possessing and concealing the dangerous firearm (sawed off shotgun) rather than assisting in its recovery, and has never recanted.  Finally, he attempted to evade and resist arrest rather than surrender voluntarily.  By contrast, the applicable guideline commentary clearly identifies the kinds of conduct considered indicia of acceptance of responsibility:  a \"voluntary and truthful admission to authorities of involvement in the offense,\" a \"voluntary surrender to authorities promptly after commission of the offense,\" and \"voluntary assistance to authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the offense.\"   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.1(c)-(e)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that it was especially appropriate in these circumstances for the district court to consider \"the timeliness of the defendant's conduct in manifesting ... acceptance of responsibility,\" see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.1(g)), particularly since Hardy failed even to request a continuance to challenge the predicate state court convictions before his first trial.   By ignoring this plain option, and failing to explain, Hardy put the government to the needless expense of trying him.  See United States v. De Leon Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 455 (1st Cir.1995) (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.2) (1994)).  Finally, the sentencing court assiduously searched the record and observed Hardy's in-court demeanor for any indication that he was truly remorseful.  Instead, it found only his unelucidated guilty plea, with no mention of remorse, and an extensive record of persisting criminal conduct \"inconsistent\" with genuine remorse.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Upward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decision to depart beyond the prescribed GSR is reviewed for \"abuse of discretion\" only, see Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2046-47, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), and guided by three principal inquiries:  (1) whether the asserted grounds for departure were permissible under the guidelines;  (2) if so, whether the record evidence adequately demonstrates the required criteria;  and (3) whether the degree of departure was reasonable.  See United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1322 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).  Hardy assigns nine reasons for overturning the upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Validity of the Departure Criteria</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines prescribe two types of departure mechanisms.  Section 4A1.3 focuses primarily on past criminal conduct, and permits an upward departure if the defendant's pre-departure CHC, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1, \"does not adequately reflect the seriousness of [his] past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\"  Id. &#167; 4A1.3.  Normally, these section 4A1.3 departures are \"guided\" and horizontal.  That is, within the defendant's total offense level the court moves horizontally across the sentencing table through successively higher CHCs until it reaches an appropriate, or \"reflective\" sentencing range.  Only in extreme cases--those involving egregious past criminal conduct--may a section 4A1.3 departure exceed the GSR prescribed under CHC VI.  See United States v. Mendez-Colon, 15 F.3d 188, 190 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5K2.0, on the other hand, permits an upward departure if the district court finds \"an aggravating ... circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)).  The section 5K2.0 departure mechanism focuses primarily on \"unusual\" attributes of the offense of conviction, rather than any underrepresentation of past criminal conduct in the defendant's CHC. Section 5K2.0 departures are \"unguided,\" and functionally \"vertical,\" meaning that the sentencing court need not restrict itself to considering successively higher CHC ranges along the \"horizontal\" axis in the sentencing table, but may select whatever sentence appropriately reflects the \"unusual\" circumstances in the case.  See generally Bruce M. Selya &amp; Matthew R. Kipp, An Examination of Emerging Departure Jurisprudence Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 67 Notre Dame L.Rev. 1, 39-40 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy first argues that the district court committed an error of law by relying on the number and dangerousness of the weapons used by him and his two associates in the Lenox Street shooting spree as grounds for an upward departure.  He points out that the November 1990 guidelines expressly constitute the number of firearms a specific offense characteristic under section 2K2.2 (Unlawful Trafficking), but not under section 2K2.1 (Unlawful Possession), thereby implicitly rejecting the number of firearms as a ground for departure under section 2K2.1. See United States v. Enriquez-Munoz, 906 F.2d 1356, 1361 (9th Cir.1990).  But see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1 (1994) (amended version, designating number of firearms as specific offense characteristic).  Hardy also notes that section 2K2.1(a)(1) and 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861 already provide a twelve-level sentencing enhancement for the increased risk inherent in possessing some types of firearms (e.g., Hardy's sawed-off shotgun), see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a), thereby suggesting that the Commission meant to foreclose departures based on the \"dangerousness\" of all other weapon types (e.g., Hardy's semi-automatic pistol).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the explicit consideration given to the number of firearms in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.2, a departure criterion cannot be deemed impermissible in all circumstances unless categorically foreclosed by the Commission.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2051.   The Commission \"d[id] not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\"  U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy pled guilty to certain firearm possession charges.  The reference to the number of firearms was made by the district court in the context of its discussion of the heightened dangerousness associated with the manner in which Hardy and his cohorts not only possessed but used their firearms.  See infra Section II.B.2(b);  cf.  Enriquez-Munoz, 906 F.2d at 1361 (rejecting departure based on number of weapons and defendant's intent to cause \"greater harm,\" where sentencing court made no finding of such intent, and purchase/sale of multiple weapons created no demonstrably greater harm).  The use and/or indiscriminate disposal of multiple weapons which took place in this case surely elevated their dangerousness well above the level associated with the simple possession of a single firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, rather than being categorically forbidden as a departure ground under section 2K2.1, the heightened dangerousness occasioned by the usage, and indiscriminate abandonment, of the firearms involved here is encouraged as a departure ground in appropriate circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>If a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.  The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it is used, and the extent to which it endangered others.  The discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial sentence increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.6 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that the Commission decided against making \"weapon type\" a specific offense characteristic under section 2K2.1 in no sense indicates that it intended to preclude a judicial determination that certain types of weapons are inherently more dangerous than others, but simply that possession of a particular type of weapon, in and of itself, is not invariably indicative of the defendant's intent.  For example, the guidelines permit a downward adjustment for the illegal possession of a firearm intended for recreational use only.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1, comment.  (n.2) (\"[S]ome rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some handguns may be suitable for recreation.  Therefore, the guideline is not based upon the type of weapon.\");   see also id.  &#167; 2K2.1(b)(1) (citing recreational intent as mitigating sentencing factor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the omission of a specific offense characteristic relating to \"weapon type\" falls far short of a categorical prohibition.  Accordingly, to the extent a sentencing court supportably finds that a defendant's choice of weapons, and the actual manner of its use, increased the danger to \"unusual\" levels, an upward departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.6 would be permissible.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b);  see also, e.g., United States v. Lebon, 800 F.Supp. 1012, 1017 (D.Mass.1992) (departure warranted for defendant's use of semiautomatic weapons).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Existence Vel Non of Departure Criteria</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next inquire whether the record facts adequately support each departure criterion relied upon by the district court.  DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1322;  see supra Section I.D. Hardy directly challenges the sentencing court's reliance on:  (i) the determination that CHC III would not adequately reflect either the seriousness of Hardy's criminal history or the likelihood of recidivism, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3;  and (ii) three \"unusual\" offense-related characteristics of the Lenox Street shooting incident, see id.  &#167; 5K2.0, specifically that Hardy's firearm/ammunition possession on April 18, 1991, facilitated his ongoing participation in gang-related activities;  the Lenox Street shooting occurred in a crowded, low-income neighborhood particularly vulnerable to crime;  and the unusual level of risk created by the number and types of firearms, as well as the manner of their use in the Lenox Street shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial deference is due a sentencing court's assessment that the cumulative circumstances are unusual enough to implicate a departure criterion, thereby removing the case from the \"heartland\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>[T]he district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing.  Whether a given factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases.  District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do....  \"To ignore the district court's special competence--about the 'ordinariness' or 'unusualness' of a particular case--would risk depriving the Sentencing Commission of an important source of information, namely, the reactions of the trial judge to the fact-specific circumstances of the case....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koon, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-47 (quoting United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d 942, 951 (1st Cir.1993) (Breyer, C.J.))  (other citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) Uncounted Past Criminal Conduct (&#167; 4A1.3)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy challenges the district court's finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he committed the criminal conduct underlying the two assault and battery convictions vacated by the state court following his first trial.  See supra note 3. He uninformatively contends that the only reason he did not claim actual innocence of these charges when he returned to state court was that his motions to vacate focused exclusively on the procedural infirmities at trial.  Second, he contends that the district court's recidivism ruling is not supported by the record.  He points out that he is no longer a young adult (i.e., in his early twenties or younger), thus not within the statistical class of criminal defendants most prone to recidivism, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, backg'd;  United States v. Fahm, 13 F.3d 447, 450 (1st Cir.1994), and further that his street gang disbanded after repeated federal prosecutions.  These arguments fundamentally misapprehend the departure rationale relied on by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4A1.3 specifically encourages upward departures based on \"reliable information\" that a defendant previously engaged in \"prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a conviction,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(e),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> which plainly encompasses charged conduct underlying vacated convictions.  See, e.g., United States v. Guthrie, 931 F.2d 564, 572-73 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that vacated convictions may be considered under &#167; 4A1.3);  accord, e.g., Fahm, 13 F.3d at 451 n. 3 (affirming use of uncharged and unadjudicated criminal conduct as bases for upward departures).  As the trier of fact at sentencing, therefore, the district court was permitted to credit reliable evidence that Hardy committed the criminal conduct underlying the two assault-and-battery convictions vacated during these proceedings, see United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1991) (sentencing court \" 'enjoys wide discretion in determining both the relevance and reliability of sentencing information' \") (citation omitted).  The unchallenged statement in the revised PSR--that Hardy kicked his girlfriend in the head and upper body with his shod foot, punched her in the head, and threw her over a third-floor balcony, see supra note 3, afforded a competent basis for the district court's finding.  Whether or not Hardy should have asserted his actual innocence upon returning to state court, he concedes that he has never denied or objected to the description in the revised PSR of the two violent assaults underlying the vacated convictions, see United States v. Rosales, 19 F.3d 763, 770 (1st Cir.1994) (court may credit, as true and accurate, PSR's unchallenged description of past criminal conduct);  Figaro, 935 F.2d at 8. Nor does Hardy allude on appeal to any exculpatory evidence relating to the vacated convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim fares no better, for it would have us disregard not only the two vacated convictions but also the cumulative evidence upon which the district court relied in determining that Level 18, CHC III, underrepresented the seriousness of Hardy's past conduct and the likelihood of recidivism.  Between 1987 and 1989, Hardy was arrested four times for assaults and/or kidnapping, involving violent attacks in which he variously used his hands and feet, a rock, a stick, a bottle, and a knife against his victims.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(e).  At the time of the offense of conviction, Hardy not only was on probation in connection with a prior drug conviction, but also on bail pending charges (assault with intent to murder and firearms possession) in connection with his and Moreno's shooting of Kenneth Walker.  See id.  &#167; 4A1.3 (departure factors may include whether offense of conviction was committed \"while on bail or pretrial release for another serious offense\");  United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 952 (1st Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The Walker shooting occurred in the Lenox Street Housing Development a mere month prior to the offense of conviction.  See Figaro, 935 F.2d at 7 (\"[R]ecency of a prior offense may be considered an indicator of increased likelihood of recidivism, exacerbating the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history.\").  Given his recent, persistent, and escalating record of violent behavior, see United States v. Doe, 18 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that departure was warranted where defendant's past criminal conduct demonstrated \"significantly unusual penchant for serious criminality\"), we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision that an upward departure was warranted because Hardy's pre-departure CHC underrepresented the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and the likelihood of recidivism.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-47 (holding that district court is entitled to \"substantial deference\" in its determination that particular facts of case implicate a departure factor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) Offense-Related Characteristics (&#167; 5K2.0)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we find little merit in the claim that the sentencing court abused its discretion in finding three \"unusual\" offense-related characteristics cumulatively adequate to remove Hardy's case from the \"heartland\" of section 2K2.1 cases.  Given their recognized utility and ubiquity in a very broad spectrum of criminal activities, firearms presumably may be possessed in circumstances posing widely divergent degrees of dangerousness.  Accordingly, it is not apparent to us that the Sentencing Commission attempted, let alone managed, to devise section 2K2.1 with a view to the extraordinary dangers posed by gang members indiscriminately shooting and discarding particularly dangerous firearms in crowded inner-city residential areas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy and his associates repeatedly discharged a semi-automatic weapon at nighttime within a crowded residential housing development and, while fleeing from the scene to evade arrest, Hardy planted a loaded sawed-off shotgun barrel-up in the backyard of a residence where children lived and played.  Without deciding whether it would suffice as an independent ground for departure, we think the district court, in these egregious circumstances, did not abuse its discretion by concluding that crowded, low-income, inner-city neighborhoods are likely as a rule to be more vulnerable to the hazards posed by such reckless and indiscriminate criminal uses of firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the record includes affidavits from law enforcement officers describing Hardy's, and his associates', lengthy affiliation with the Columbia Point Dogs, a Boston street gang with a conspicuous history of inter-gang violence and illicit drug distribution in the Lenox Street area.  The record further supports the conclusion that on April 18, 1991, Hardy and his associates possessed the semi-automatic weapons and sawed-off shotgun for the purpose of facilitating their gang's ongoing terrorization of the Lenox Street neighborhood in furtherance of its drug distribution operations.  See, e.g., United States v. Sweeting, 933 F.2d 962, 966-67 (11th Cir.1991) (affirming defendant's ongoing connection to street gang as appropriate ground for departure);  accord United States v. Thomas, 906 F.2d 323, 328 (7th Cir.1990).  Accordingly, we find no manifest abuse of discretion by the district court.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Reasonableness of Degree of Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hardy argues that the section 4A1.3 departure was unreasonable in degree as a matter of law, because the district court proceeded directly from Level 18, CHC III, to Level 18, CHC VI, without either considering or explaining why the sentencing range prescribed at CHC IV or CHC V was inadequate to reflect the seriousness of his past conduct or the likelihood of recidivism.  See United States v. Tropiano, 50 F.3d 157, 162 (2d Cir.1995);  supra Section II.B.1 (contrasting \"unguided\" and \"guided\" departures).  He further argues that section 4A1.3 rarely permits a sentencing court to depart beyond the sentencing range prescribed by CHC VI based on an \"egregious\" past criminal record, and, as such, it constitutes a \"discouraged\" ground for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach either of these arguments, since the departure decision was not founded on section 4A1.3 alone, cf., e.g., Fahm, 13 F.3d at 450 &amp; n. 2 (involving departure based exclusively on &#167; 4A1.3 criteria), but on both sections 4A1.3 and 5K2.0.  See United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 69-70 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that &#167;&#167; 5K2.0 and 4A1.3 need not be an \" 'either/or' proposition,\" and that both may be used to support a single departure decision).  The district court relied in part on some offense-related attributes (e.g., number and dangerousness of weapons) independently sufficient to justify an unguided vertical departure under section 5K2.0.  In determining such \"mixed\" departures, no useful purpose is served by insisting that the sentencing court adhere to all section 4A1.3 formalities, only to countenance its \"unguided\" discretion to make an \"appropriate\" non-horizontal departure under section 5K2.0.  See Figaro, 935 F.2d at 8-9 (rejecting \"leap-frogging\" argument in \"mixed\" &#167;&#167; 4A1.3-5K2.0 case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hardy's protestations notwithstanding, we cannot conclude that the degree of departure was unreasonable.  See DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1322.   A sentencing court is not required to \"dissect its departure decision, explaining in mathematical or pseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice made.\"  United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 408 (1st Cir.1995).  Similarly, the reasonableness vel non of the degree of departure need \"not [ ] be determined by rigid adherence to a particular mechanistic formula, but by an evaluation of 'the overall aggregate of known circumstances.' \"  Figaro, 935 F.2d at 9 n. 2 (citations omitted).  While the departure in this case is indeed substantial (300%), we have affirmed larger ones.  See Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 411 (collecting cases affirming upward departures ranging from 165 to 380 percent).  Further, the district court \"checked\" the degree of its departure by calculating the hypothetical sentence Hardy would have received had he been sentenced under the November 1994 guidelines (121-151 months), on the theory that the Commission had since incorporated many of the offense-related characteristics that formed the bases for the district court's decision to depart in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Given Hardy's persistent ten-year history of violent anti-social behavior, as well as the dangerousness of his conduct on April 18, 1991, in possessing and abandoning a particularly dangerous firearm in a residential neighborhood, we cannot say that the degree of the departure imposed by the district court was not \"appropriate\" in the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unless otherwise indicated, we cite to the November 1990 guidelines in effect on the date of the offense of conviction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The four state-court convictions counted by the district court were:  (1) a 1985 conviction for cocaine possession;  (2) a 1988 conviction for assault and battery on a police officer;  (3) a 1990 conviction for drug possession;  and (4) a 1990 conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin at Lenox Street</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to the revised PSR, the 1985 assault and battery charges were based on evidence that Hardy, in a jealous rage, kicked his girlfriend in the head and upper body then punched her in the head before throwing her over a third-floor balcony.

Even assuming such a practice, which the government disputes, Hardy's reliance upon it would be objectively unreasonable given the unequivocal guideline provision that \"[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to a sentencing reduction under this section as a matter of right,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(c), not to mention the decisional law in this circuit, see United States v.

Since &#167; 3E1.1 makes clear that the district court must assess each defendant's protestations of remorse, it would be inconsistent with its spirit to permit defendants to withhold manifestations of remorse simply because the district court has not explicitly invited them.

We have been no more successful than Hardy in finding support for either of these conclusory contentions.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (invoking \"the settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).

Of course, the focus of the \"heartland\" inquiry is not nearly so broad.  Instead, sentencing courts are to inquire whether one reasonably would expect an unusual number of defendants convicted of firearm/ammunition possession to be gang members.  See, e.g., Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2052 (rejecting \"career loss\" as downward departure criterion for purposes of &#167; 2H1.4, since it is not \"unusual\" for many public officials convicted of civil rights violations to lose their jobs)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Hardy argues that the district court erred in this regard.  The government concedes that the court incorrectly enhanced the hypothetical offense level two levels by relying on the fact that one of Hardy's weapons had an obliterated serial number.  Thus, the correct hypothetical total offense level should have been 30, not 32.  The error was harmless, however, since the court also assigned Hardy a CHC I, Level 32, rather than CHC III, Level 30.  Both prescribe a sentencing range of 121-151 months</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Five Boston police officers in plain clothes, members of the Anti-gang Violence Unit, were on routine patrol at the time, and saw Raymond Moreno, Stephen Fernandes, and appellant Hardy run from the area where the shots had been fired.  The officers gave chase on foot.  Just before submitting to arrest, Moreno handed a long, dark, cylindrical object to Hardy, who kept on running through the residential neighborhood adjacent to the housing development.  Shortly after the officers overtook Hardy, but before he could be subjected to arrest, he tossed a loaded Browning .32 caliber semi-automatic pistol onto the ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Hardy's arrest, the officers retraced his likely route from the shooting scene to the arrest scene and found a fully-loaded, sawed-off, twelve-gauge, double-barrel shotgun planted barrel-up in the backyard garden of a residence occupied by a family with three young children.  Nearby, Fernandes was arrested while in possession of an unloaded Helwan 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol, later confirmed to be the firearm discharged at the Lenox Street Housing Development site where the police first observed Hardy and two associates.  Later, Hardy falsely denied knowing either Moreno or Fernandes, claimed to be living with his mother, and gave a false home address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

As Hardy's extensive criminal record included three violent felonies and one serious drug offense since 1985, the government gave notice that it intended to seek the mandatory minimum fifteen-year prison sentence authorized under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4.

Accordingly, the court determined upon a \"vertical\" upward departure as well, from Level 18, CHC VI (57-71 months) to Level 24, CHC VI (100-125 months).  The court gauged its vertical departure through reference to the 121-151 month (Level 32, CHC I) GSR which would have been applicable to Hardy under the then-current (i.e., November 1994) guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Ultimately, the court settled upon the 120-month prison sentence from which Hardy now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.

(n.3) (emphasis added).  The revised PSR discloses that Hardy, despite ample time and opportunity, has never truthfully admitted the facts underlying the offense of conviction, let alone subjectively manifested \"candor and authentic remorse.\"   See United States v. Wheelwright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551269\"><a href=\"/opinion/551269/united-states-v-john-wheelwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming Hardy had truthfully admitted the relevant facts, nothing in the commentary upon which he relies remotely indicates that a guilty plea, even combined with a truthful admission, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.3), gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility will follow.  Indeed, Hardy's prolonged reticence aside, the commentary explicitly states that even the \"significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility\" generated by \"a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission,\" id., \"may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.  A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.\"  Id. (1994) (emphasis added);  see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(c) &amp; comment.

We in turn accord great deference to the sentencing court's determination.  See id. comment.  (n.5);  United States v. Royer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536029\"><a href=\"/opinion/536029/united-states-v-marc-a-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Credibility and demeanor play a crucial role in determining whether a person is genuinely contrite,\" and \"the sentencing judge has the unique opportunity of observing the defendant ... and evaluating acceptance of responsibility in a live context.\").  Thus, nothing can come from Hardy's \"rebuttable presumption\" construct, both because it is legally unsound and because Hardy lied to the police and to a magistrate judge regarding his lack of prior association with codefendants Moreno and Fernandes, and gave a false home address which has never been recanted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Hardy contends that he reasonably refrained from pleading guilty until after he had returned to state court to set aside two of his predicate convictions, since the government's decision to invoke the ACCA otherwise would have exposed him to a possible life sentence and at least a fifteen-year sentence, instead of a ten-year maximum.  Consequently, he argues, the district court improperly relied on the delayed guilty plea as a basis for finding that he had not accepted responsibility for his crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far from clear that the statement made by the district court was intended to convey the message Hardy suggests.  Viewed in context, the statement may well have been intended merely as a narrative of the prolonged procedural travel of this case, during which Hardy never uttered a word remotely resembling remorse.  In all events, assuming the statement were to be interpreted as Hardy suggests, we conclude that any resulting error was harmless in that it did not affect Hardy's substantial rights, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a);  United States v. Curran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556392\"><a href=\"/opinion/556392/united-states-v-walter-f-curran/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1991), since the alternative basis for denying the requested &#167; 3E1.1 reduction was entirely valid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his arrest, Hardy lied when he told the police he had not known codefendant Moreno prior to April 18, 1991, whereas in fact Hardy and Moreno had shot Kenneth Walker in March 1991.  In addition, the record reveals that Hardy, after his arrest, lied about not having possessed a firearm, and gave police a false home address.  Undeterred, Hardy argues that a false statement to the police immediately after arrest--as distinguished from a misrepresentation to the probation office or the court after criminal proceedings have been commenced--should not be treated as a failure to accept responsibility.  We need venture no opinion on this matter, since Hardy cannot come within the proposed rule in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the revised PSR indicates that though Hardy first provided the false home address to the police, thereafter he repeated it to the United States Pretrial Services Department and a magistrate judge.  Moreover, Hardy lied about possessing and concealing the dangerous firearm (sawed off shotgun) rather than assisting in its recovery, and has never recanted.  Finally, he attempted to evade and resist arrest rather than surrender voluntarily.  By contrast, the applicable guideline commentary clearly identifies the kinds of conduct considered indicia of acceptance of responsibility:  a \"voluntary and truthful admission to authorities of involvement in the offense,\" a \"voluntary surrender to authorities promptly after commission of the offense,\" and \"voluntary assistance to authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the offense.\"   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.1(c)-(e)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize that it was especially appropriate in these circumstances for the district court to consider \"the timeliness of the defendant's conduct in manifesting ... acceptance of responsibility,\" see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.1(g)), particularly since Hardy failed even to request a continuance to challenge the predicate state court convictions before his first trial.   By ignoring this plain option, and failing to explain, Hardy put the government to the needless expense of trying him.  See United States v. De Leon Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195881\"><a href=\"/opinion/195881/united-states-v-de-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir.1995) (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, comment.  (n.2) (1994)).  Finally, the sentencing court assiduously searched the record and observed Hardy's in-court demeanor for any indication that he was truly remorseful.  Instead, it found only his unelucidated guilty plea, with no mention of remorse, and an extensive record of persisting criminal conduct \"inconsistent\" with genuine remorse.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Validity of the Departure Criteria</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guidelines prescribe two types of departure mechanisms.  Section 4A1.3 focuses primarily on past criminal conduct, and permits an upward departure if the defendant's pre-departure CHC, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1, \"does not adequately reflect the seriousness of [his] past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\"  Id. &#167; 4A1.3.  Normally, these section 4A1.3 departures are \"guided\" and horizontal.  That is, within the defendant's total offense level the court moves horizontally across the sentencing table through successively higher CHCs until it reaches an appropriate, or \"reflective\" sentencing range.  Only in extreme cases--those involving egregious past criminal conduct--may a section 4A1.3 departure exceed the GSR prescribed under CHC VI.  See United States v. Mendez-Colon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195155\"><a href=\"/opinion/195155/united-states-v-mendez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 190 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5K2.0, on the other hand, permits an upward departure if the district court finds \"an aggravating ... circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0 (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)).  The section 5K2.0 departure mechanism focuses primarily on \"unusual\" attributes of the offense of conviction, rather than any underrepresentation of past criminal conduct in the defendant's CHC. Section 5K2.0 departures are \"unguided,\" and functionally \"vertical,\" meaning that the sentencing court need not restrict itself to considering successively higher CHC ranges along the \"horizontal\" axis in the sentencing table, but may select whatever sentence appropriately reflects the \"unusual\" circumstances in the case.  See generally Bruce M. Selya &amp; Matthew R. Kipp, An Examination of Emerging Departure Jurisprudence Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 67 Notre Dame L.Rev. 1, 39-40 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy first argues that the district court committed an error of law by relying on the number and dangerousness of the weapons used by him and his two associates in the Lenox Street shooting spree as grounds for an upward departure.  He points out that the November 1990 guidelines expressly constitute the number of firearms a specific offense characteristic under section 2K2.2 (Unlawful Trafficking), but not under section 2K2.1 (Unlawful Possession), thereby implicitly rejecting the number of firearms as a ground for departure under section 2K2.1. See United States v. Enriquez-Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543796\"><a href=\"/opinion/543796/united-states-v-jorge-edmundo-enriquez-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></a></span>, 1361 (9th Cir.1990).  But see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1 (1994) (amended version, designating number of firearms as specific offense characteristic).  Hardy also notes that section 2K2.1(a)(1) and 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861 already provide a twelve-level sentencing enhancement for the increased risk inherent in possessing some types of firearms (e.g., Hardy's sawed-off shotgun), see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a), thereby suggesting that the Commission meant to foreclose departures based on the \"dangerousness\" of all other weapon types (e.g., Hardy's semi-automatic pistol).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the explicit consideration given to the number of firearms in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.2, a departure criterion cannot be deemed impermissible in all circumstances unless categorically foreclosed by the Commission.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2051.   The Commission \"d[id] not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\"  U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy pled guilty to certain firearm possession charges.  The reference to the number of firearms was made by the district court in the context of its discussion of the heightened dangerousness associated with the manner in which Hardy and his cohorts not only possessed but used their firearms.  See infra Section II.B.2(b);  cf.  Enriquez-Munoz, 906 F.2d at 1361 (rejecting departure based on number of weapons and defendant's intent to cause \"greater harm,\" where sentencing court made no finding of such intent, and purchase/sale of multiple weapons created no demonstrably greater harm).  The use and/or indiscriminate disposal of multiple weapons which took place in this case surely elevated their dangerousness well above the level associated with the simple possession of a single firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, rather than being categorically forbidden as a departure ground under section 2K2.1, the heightened dangerousness occasioned by the usage, and indiscriminate abandonment, of the firearms involved here is encouraged as a departure ground in appropriate circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>If a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.  The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it is used, and the extent to which it endangered others.  The discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial sentence increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.6 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that the Commission decided against making \"weapon type\" a specific offense characteristic under section 2K2.1 in no sense indicates that it intended to preclude a judicial determination that certain types of weapons are inherently more dangerous than others, but simply that possession of a particular type of weapon, in and of itself, is not invariably indicative of the defendant's intent.  For example, the guidelines permit a downward adjustment for the illegal possession of a firearm intended for recreational use only.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1, comment.  (n.2) (\"[S]ome rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some handguns may be suitable for recreation.  Therefore, the guideline is not based upon the type of weapon.\");   see also id.  &#167; 2K2.1(b)(1) (citing recreational intent as mitigating sentencing factor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the omission of a specific offense characteristic relating to \"weapon type\" falls far short of a categorical prohibition.  Accordingly, to the extent a sentencing court supportably finds that a defendant's choice of weapons, and the actual manner of its use, increased the danger to \"unusual\" levels, an upward departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.6 would be permissible.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, intro. comment.  (4)(b);  see also, e.g., United States v. Lebon, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Existence Vel Non of Departure Criteria</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next inquire whether the record facts adequately support each departure criterion relied upon by the district court.  DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1322;  see supra Section I.D. Hardy directly challenges the sentencing court's reliance on:  (i) the determination that CHC III would not adequately reflect either the seriousness of Hardy's criminal history or the likelihood of recidivism, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3;  and (ii) three \"unusual\" offense-related characteristics of the Lenox Street shooting incident, see id.  &#167; 5K2.0, specifically that Hardy's firearm/ammunition possession on April 18, 1991, facilitated his ongoing participation in gang-related activities;  the Lenox Street shooting occurred in a crowded, low-income neighborhood particularly vulnerable to crime;  and the unusual level of risk created by the number and types of firearms, as well as the manner of their use in the Lenox Street shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial deference is due a sentencing court's assessment that the cumulative circumstances are unusual enough to implicate a departure criterion, thereby removing the case from the \"heartland\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>[T]he district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing.  Whether a given factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases.  District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do....  \"To ignore the district court's special competence--about the 'ordinariness' or 'unusualness' of a particular case--would risk depriving the Sentencing Commission of an important source of information, namely, the reactions of the trial judge to the fact-specific circumstances of the case....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koon, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-47 (quoting United States v.

See supra note 3. He uninformatively contends that the only reason he did not claim actual innocence of these charges when he returned to state court was that his motions to vacate focused exclusively on the procedural infirmities at trial.  Second, he contends that the district court's recidivism ruling is not supported by the record.  He points out that he is no longer a young adult (i.e., in his early twenties or younger), thus not within the statistical class of criminal defendants most prone to recidivism, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, backg'd;  United States v.

Nor does Hardy allude on appeal to any exculpatory evidence relating to the vacated convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim fares no better, for it would have us disregard not only the two vacated convictions but also the cumulative evidence upon which the district court relied in determining that Level 18, CHC III, underrepresented the seriousness of Hardy's past conduct and the likelihood of recidivism.  Between 1987 and 1989, Hardy was arrested four times for assaults and/or kidnapping, involving violent attacks in which he variously used his hands and feet, a rock, a stick, a bottle, and a knife against his victims.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(e).  At the time of the offense of conviction, Hardy not only was on probation in connection with a prior drug conviction, but also on bail pending charges (assault with intent to murder and firearms possession) in connection with his and Moreno's shooting of Kenneth Walker.  See id.  &#167; 4A1.3 (departure factors may include whether offense of conviction was committed \"while on bail or pretrial release for another serious offense\");  United States v. Diaz-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196470\"><a href=\"/opinion/196470/united-states-v-diaz-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 952 (1st Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The Walker shooting occurred in the Lenox Street Housing Development a mere month prior to the offense of conviction.  See Figaro, 935 F.2d at 7 (\"[R]ecency of a prior offense may be considered an indicator of increased likelihood of recidivism, exacerbating the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history.\").  Given his recent, persistent, and escalating record of violent behavior, see United States v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195243\"><a href=\"/opinion/195243/united-states-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that departure was warranted where defendant's past criminal conduct demonstrated \"significantly unusual penchant for serious criminality\"), we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision that an upward departure was warranted because Hardy's pre-departure CHC underrepresented the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and the likelihood of recidivism.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-47 (holding that district court is entitled to \"substantial deference\" in its determination that particular facts of case implicate a departure factor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) Offense-Related Characteristics (&#167; 5K2.0)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we find little merit in the claim that the sentencing court abused its discretion in finding three \"unusual\" offense-related characteristics cumulatively adequate to remove Hardy's case from the \"heartland\" of section 2K2.1 cases.  Given their recognized utility and ubiquity in a very broad spectrum of criminal activities, firearms presumably may be possessed in circumstances posing widely divergent degrees of dangerousness.  Accordingly, it is not apparent to us that the Sentencing Commission attempted, let alone managed, to devise section 2K2.1 with a view to the extraordinary dangers posed by gang members indiscriminately shooting and discarding particularly dangerous firearms in crowded inner-city residential areas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hardy and his associates repeatedly discharged a semi-automatic weapon at nighttime within a crowded residential housing development and, while fleeing from the scene to evade arrest, Hardy planted a loaded sawed-off shotgun barrel-up in the backyard of a residence where children lived and played.  Without deciding whether it would suffice as an independent ground for departure, we think the district court, in these egregious circumstances, did not abuse its discretion by concluding that crowded, low-income, inner-city neighborhoods are likely as a rule to be more vulnerable to the hazards posed by such reckless and indiscriminate criminal uses of firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the record includes affidavits from law enforcement officers describing Hardy's, and his associates', lengthy affiliation with the Columbia Point Dogs, a Boston street gang with a conspicuous history of inter-gang violence and illicit drug distribution in the Lenox Street area.  The record further supports the conclusion that on April 18, 1991, Hardy and his associates possessed the semi-automatic weapons and sawed-off shotgun for the purpose of facilitating their gang's ongoing terrorization of the Lenox Street neighborhood in furtherance of its drug distribution operations.  See, e.g., United States v. Sweeting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561394\"><a href=\"/opinion/561394/united-states-v-anthony-leon-sweeting-and-joseph-leander-sweeting/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 966-67 (11th Cir.1991) (affirming defendant's ongoing connection to street gang as appropriate ground for departure);  accord United States v. Thomas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543641\"><a href=\"/opinion/543641/united-states-v-charles-thomas-aka-reginald-gardner-and-melvin-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 328 (7th Cir.1990).  Accordingly, we find no manifest abuse of discretion by the district court.  See Koon, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2046-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Reasonableness of Degree of Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hardy argues that the section 4A1.3 departure was unreasonable in degree as a matter of law, because the district court proceeded directly from Level 18, CHC III, to Level 18, CHC VI, without either considering or explaining why the sentencing range prescribed at CHC IV or CHC V was inadequate to reflect the seriousness of his past conduct or the likelihood of recidivism.  See United States v. Tropiano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691961\"><a href=\"/opinion/691961/united-states-v-daniel-michael-tropiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 162 (2d Cir.1995);  supra Section II.B.1 (contrasting \"unguided\" and \"guided\" departures).  He further argues that section 4A1.3 rarely permits a sentencing court to depart beyond the sentencing range prescribed by CHC VI based on an \"egregious\" past criminal record, and, as such, it constitutes a \"discouraged\" ground for departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not reach either of these arguments, since the departure decision was not founded on section 4A1.3 alone, cf., e.g., Fahm, 13 F.3d at 450 &amp; n. 2 (involving departure based exclusively on &#167; 4A1.3 criteria), but on both sections 4A1.3 and 5K2.0.  See United States v. Aymelek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 69-70 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that &#167;&#167; 5K2.0 and 4A1.3 need not be an \" 'either/or' proposition,\" and that both may be used to support a single departure decision).  The district court relied in part on some offense-related attributes (e.g., number and dangerousness of weapons) independently sufficient to justify an unguided vertical departure under section 5K2.0.  In determining such \"mixed\" departures, no useful purpose is served by insisting that the sentencing court adhere to all section 4A1.3 formalities, only to countenance its \"unguided\" discretion to make an \"appropriate\" non-horizontal departure under section 5K2.0.  See Figaro, 935 F.2d at 8-9 (rejecting \"leap-frogging\" argument in \"mixed\" &#167;&#167; 4A1.3-5K2.0 case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hardy's protestations notwithstanding, we cannot conclude that the degree of departure was unreasonable.  See DeMasi, 40 F.3d at 1322.   A sentencing court is not required to \"dissect its departure decision, explaining in mathematical or pseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice made.\"  United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 408 (1st Cir.1995).  Similarly, the reasonableness vel non of the degree of departure need \"not [ ] be determined by rigid adherence to a particular mechanistic formula, but by an evaluation of 'the overall aggregate of known circumstances.' \"  Figaro, 935 F.2d at 9 n. 2 (citations omitted).  While the departure in this case is indeed substantial (300%), we have affirmed larger ones.  See Rostoff, 53 F.3d at 411 (collecting cases affirming upward departures ranging from 165 to 380 percent).  Further, the district court \"checked\" the degree of its departure by calculating the hypothetical sentence Hardy would have received had he been sentenced under the November 1994 guidelines (121-151 months), on the theory that the Commission had since incorporated many of the offense-related characteristics that formed the bases for the district court's decision to depart in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Given Hardy's persistent ten-year history of violent anti-social behavior, as well as the dangerousness of his conduct on April 18, 1991, in possessing and abandoning a particularly dangerous firearm in a residential neighborhood, we cannot say that the degree of the departure imposed by the district court was not \"appropriate\" in the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unless otherwise indicated, we cite to the November 1990 guidelines in effect on the date of the offense of conviction</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The four state-court convictions counted by the district court were:  (1) a 1985 conviction for cocaine possession;  (2) a 1988 conviction for assault and battery on a police officer;  (3) a 1990 conviction for drug possession;  and (4) a 1990 conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin at Lenox Street</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> According to the revised PSR, the 1985 assault and battery charges were based on evidence that Hardy, in a jealous rage, kicked his girlfriend in the head and upper body then punched her in the head before throwing her over a third-floor balcony.

Even assuming such a practice, which the government disputes, Hardy's reliance upon it would be objectively unreasonable given the unequivocal guideline provision that \"[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to a sentencing reduction under this section as a matter of right,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(c), not to mention the decisional law in this circuit, see United States v.

Since &#167; 3E1.1 makes clear that the district court must assess each defendant's protestations of remorse, it would be inconsistent with its spirit to permit defendants to withhold manifestations of remorse simply because the district court has not explicitly invited them.

We have been no more successful than Hardy in finding support for either of these conclusory contentions.  See United States v.

Of course, the focus of the \"heartland\" inquiry is not nearly so broad.

Thus, the correct hypothetical total offense level should have been 30, not 32.
