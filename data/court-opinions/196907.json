Petitioner  has not shown\r\n\nany  external  cause  which prevented  him  from  raising his\r\n\npresent double jeopardy claim in his earlier habeas petition,\r\n\nand he  has not shown that  failure to address the  merits of\r\n\nhis  claim  will  result  in  a  fundamental  miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice.\r\n\n     Our   decision  would  be  the  same  under  either  the\r\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act of  1996, Pub.\r\n\nL. 104-132,  110 Stat.  1214 (April 24,  1996), or  the prior\r\n\nversion  of federal  habeas corpus  law, and  so we  need not\r\n\ndecide which version applies here.\r\n\n     Affirmed.
