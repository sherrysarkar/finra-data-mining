Claimant Hector  Figueroa appeals from\r                                \r\r\n\nthe judgment of the district court  upholding the decision of\r\n\nthe Secretary of  Health and  Human Services that  he is  not\r\n\nentitled to  Social Security disability  benefits.   Claimant\r\n\nraises two issues on appeal.  In regard to his alleged mental\r\n\nimpairment, we  essentially agree  with the district  court's\r\n\nreasoning,  so will not repeat  it here.   However, we decide\r\n\nthe  question  regarding  claimant's  asthma  on  a  slightly\r\n\ndifferent ground.\r\n\n          The record  does not support  claimant's contention\r\n\nthat he met the listing for asthma, section 3.03B of Appendix\r\n\n1.   Specifically, claimant has not shown that he experienced\r\n\nan  average of  six \"severe  attacks\" of  asthma per  year as\r\n\nrequired  by Section 3.03C.  In 1990, the evidence shows only\r\n\nthat  claimant was  seen  for \"emergency\"  treatment on  four\r\n\noccasions.  Even if  the number could be overlooked,  none of\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe asthma  attacks for which claimant  sought this treatment\r\n\nwas  shown  to have  lasted  over  one hour.    As  for 1991,\r\n\nclaimant arguably suffered more  than six \"severe attacks\" of\r\n\nasthma  (the  five visits  to  Dr. Campos  and  the three-day\r\n\nhospitalization).   However, as in 1990, there is no evidence\r                                                                \r\n\nin the record that  these attacks, aside from the  attack for\r\n\nwhich claimant was  hospitalized, lasted even  an hour.   The\r\n\nonly  asthma  attack for  which a  time  was reported  is the\r\n\nFebruary 25 visit to  Dr. Campos and this attack  lasted only\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n45  minutes.  Finally, in 1992, the record documents only one\r\n\nemergency treatment for an asthma attack.\r\n\n          Further,  there is  evidence  in the  record  which\r\n\nrebuts the existence of an impairment of listed severity.  \r\n\nFirst,  both Drs.  Rivera and  Campos --  claimant's treating\r\n\nphysicians  -- stated  that  claimant's  asthma responded  to\r\n\ntreatment.    See  Transcript,  at  202  (asthma  \"moderately\r                             \r\n\ncontrolled\" with medicine);  349 (asthma \"reversible\" with  a\r\n\nbronchodilator).  Another treating physician, Dr. Marcantoni,\r\n\nopined  only that claimant could not do his prior heavy work.\r                                                                   \r\n\nFinally,  the  RFC  assessments  from  1990,  1991  and  1992\r\n\nindicate  that claimant  can work  in areas  which have  good\r\n\nventilation  and which  are  free from  odors, dusts,  fumes,\r\n\ngases, wetness, humidity, and  extremes of temperature.  This\r\n\nevidence plainly contradicts the opinions of other physicians\r\n\nthat  claimant's  asthma   rendered  him  totally   disabled.\r\n\nConflicts in  the  evidence are  for the  Secretary, not  the\r\n\ncourts.

Secretary  of  Health and  Human\r                                                                         \r\n\nServices, 955 F.2d  765, 769  (1st Cir.  1991) (per  curiam).\r                    \r\n\nGiven  that the  ALJ's hypothetical  to  the VE  included the\r\n\nlimitations  outlined in  the RFC  assessments, his  decision\r\n\nthat claimant's asthma does not preclude him from working  is\r\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.
