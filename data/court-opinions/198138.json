Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Fabio A. Roman Garcia on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza-Torro,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Wayne G. Lewis, Assistant Regional\r\nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 2, 1998\r\n\n                                                  Per Curiam.  Claimant Jorge Faria appeals a district\r\ncourt order that upheld the denial of his claim for Social\r\nSecurity disability benefits.  Claimant maintains that he\r\nsuffers from a schizoaffective disorder that disabled him\r\nbefore his insured status expired in 1992.\r\n          Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the\r\nparties' briefs on appeal, we conclude that the Commissioner's\r\ndecision should be affirmed.  We reject claimant's contention\r\nthat the administrative law judge (ALJ) breached his duty to\r\ndevelop the record.  Claimant was represented by counsel.  When\r\na claimant is represented, the ALJ, \"should ordinarily be\r\nentitled to rely on claimant's counsel to structure and present\r\nthe claimant's case in a way that claimant's claims are\r\nadequately explored.\"  See Hawkins v. Chater, 113 F.3d 1162,\r\n1167 (10th Cir. 1997).  See also Sears v. Bowen, 840 F.2d 394,\r\n402 (7th Cir. 1988)(\"an ALJ is entitled to presume that\r\nclaimant represented by counsel in the administrative hearings\r\nhas made his best case\").  We will not fault the ALJ for\r\nfailing to secure Dr. Jimenez's treatment notes or ask further\r\nquestions, particularly where claimant has not shown how he was\r\nprejudiced by the ALJ's alleged shortcomings.  See, e.g.,\r\nNelson v. Apfel, 131 F.3d 1228, 1234 (7th Cir. 1998)(\"'Mere\r\nconjecture or speculation that additional evidence may be\r\nobtained ... is insufficient to warrant a remand.'\"(citation\r\nomitted)); Shannon v. Chater, 54 F.3d 484, 488 (8th Cir.\r\n1995)(\"Reversal due to [an ALJ's alleged] failure to develop\r\nthe record is only warranted where such failure is unfair or\r\nprejudicial.\").  \r\n   Claimant's remaining contentions are equally\r\nunavailing.  Given the dearth of evidence, medical and\r\notherwise, in the record, the ALJ's conclusion that claimant\r\nretained the ability to perform his past work was adequately\r\nsupported.  See Jones v. Chater, 65 F.3d 102, 104 (8th Cir.\r\n1995)(retrospective medical opinions are usually insufficient\r\nto establish disability absent corroboration of claimant's\r\ncondition during insured period by lay witnesses, such as\r\nfamily members); Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human\r\nServices, 955 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1991)(per curiam)(absence\r\nof evidence of sustained mental health treatment bolstered\r\nnondisability finding).  Claimant  plainly errs insofar as he\r\ncontends that he was not required to prove his impairment with\r\nobjective medical evidence.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \r\n423(d)(3)(defining physical or mental impairments as those\r\nwhich result from abnormalities demonstrable by medically\r\nacceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques); 20\r\nC.F.R. 404.1529, 404.1527(a)(1)(similar); 20 C.F.R. 404.1508\r\n(physical and mental impairments must be established by medical\r\nevidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory\r\nfindings).\r\n   In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r\n",
