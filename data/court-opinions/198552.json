EARLE RUGG, JR.,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n          Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJack W. Pirozzolo, Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot LLP on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Jennifer Zacks,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJuly 9, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record, defendant's\r\nbrief, and the government's motion for summary disposition, we\r\nconclude that argument would not be helpful.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R.\r\n27.1.\r\nThere is no merit in defendant's argument that, in setting the\r\namount of restitution, the district court failed to consider his\r\nability to pay.  The presentence investigation report adequately\r\ndetailed defendant's finances, and the district court was not\r\nrequired to make further express findings on the subject.  See\r\nUnited States v. Licausi, 167 F.3d 36, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1999).  \r\nAnd contrary to defendant's argument, the judgment, fairly\r\nread as a whole and in context, did not require immediate payment\r\nof the full amount of restitution.  See United States v. Merric,\r\n166 F.3d 406, 408 (1st Cir. 1999).  However, the \"schedule of\r\npayments\" included in the written judgment was not without\r\nambiguity, as it referred both to immediate payment and to an\r\nundetermined schedule for later payment.  On remand, the time or\r\nschedule for repayment should be clarified.  See 18 U.S.C. \r\n3663(f) (1994); U.S.S.G.  5E1.1 background (\"The restitution order\r\nshould specify the manner in which  . . . payment is to be made.\")\r\n(former version, Appendix C, amendment 571); United States v.\r\nTimilty, 148 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Lilly, 80\r\nF.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996); see also 18 U.S.C.  3664(f)(2).\r\nWe do not address the ex post facto question here, because the\r\nresult would be the same under either version of the restitution\r\nstatutes.  See Licausi, 167 F.3d at 52 n.4. \r\nThat portion of the judgment regarding the schedule for\r\npayment of restitution is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the\r\ndistrict court for further proceedings to clarify the time or\r\nschedule for repayment.  The judgment is affirmed in all other\r\nrespects.  The government's motion for summary disposition is\r\ngranted in part and denied in part accordingly.  \n",
