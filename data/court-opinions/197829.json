Lawrence Lanoue appeals\r                    GODBOLD, Senior Circuit Judge.\r                                                 \r\n\nfrom a  conviction of the unlawful  possession of a firearm  by a\r\n\nperson previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment\r\n\nfor  a  term  exceeding  one  year, in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  922(g)(1).  He was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the\r\n\nDistrict  of  Rhode Island  after  a  trial  by jury.  He  raises\r\n\nmultiple  issues including  1)improper venue,  2)double jeopardy,\r\n\n3)collateral estoppel,  4)the right to  have the attorney  of his\r\n\nchoosing,  and 5)vindictive prosecution.   We have  reviewed each\r\n\nassertion and affirm his conviction.\r\n\nI.  Factual Background and Procedural History\r          I.  Factual Background and Procedural History\r\n\n          A.  Lanoue's 1994 prosecution\r\n\n          Lanoue was prosecuted  in the District of  Rhode Island\r\n\nin 1994 for various crimes arising from the events that also gave\r\n\nrise  to the present prosecution.  Evidence presented at Lanoue's\r\n\n1994 trial demonstrated  the following facts.  On  the morning of\r\n\nDecember 23, 1993, Lanoue left his residence in Rhode Island  and\r\n\ntraveled  to   Bellingham,  Massachusetts.     On   the  way   he\r\n\nrendezvoused with Albert  Cole, and they proceeded  to Bellingham\r\n\nin a car that had been reported stolen.  These movements were the\r\n\nsubject of a large scale surveillance operation  that included at\r\n\nleast  three dozen  FBI agents  and members  of the  Rhode Island\r\n\nState Police.   Lanoue was  arrested in Bellingham in  a shopping\r\n\ncenter  parking lot  as he  approached  an unmarked  armored car.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nDuring the arrest Lanoue admitted to the arresting agents that he\r\n\nwas carrying a .38 caliber handgun on his person.\r\n\n          As a result of that arrest Lanoue and two codefendants,\r\n\nCole and Patrick Meade, were charged in  a seven-count indictment\r\n\nby a  grand jury sitting  in the District  of Rhode Island.   All\r\n\nthree were charged  in Count I with conspiracy  to commit federal\r\n\noffenses,  18  U.S.C.    371;  in  Count  II with  conspiracy  to\r\n\ninterfere with commerce by robbery,  Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.   1951;\r\n\nin Count III with attempt  to interfere with commerce by robbery,\r\n\nHobbs Act,  18 U.S.C.    1951;  and in  Count IV  with using  and\r\n\ncarrying  a firearm  during  and  in relation  to  an attempt  or\r\n\nconspiracy to  commit robbery,  18 U.S.C.    924(c)(1).   Count V\r\n\ncharged  Lanoue  and  Cole with  interstate  transportation  of a\r\n\nstolen motor vehicle, 18  U.S.C.   2312; Count VI charged  Lanoue\r\n\nand   Meade  with  possessing  firearms  and  ammunition  in  and\r\n\naffecting  commerce, each having  been previously convicted  of a\r\n\ncrime punishable by  imprisonment for a term  exceeding one year,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1)(2); and Count VII charged Lanoue alone with\r\n\ninterstate transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial\r\n\nnumber, 18  U.S.C.     922(k).    Counts   III,  IV  and  V  also\r\n\nexplicitly  charged the defendants  with aiding and  abetting. 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   2.\r\n\n          Count  VI was dismissed  by the government  because the\r\n\ndefendants had been  arrested in Massachusetts rather  than Rhode\r\n\nIsland  and prosecutors  anticipated  problems  with  venue.    A\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nredacted indictment was  filed with leave of court  on August 17,\r\n\n1994 that designated the original Count VII as Count VI. \r\n\n          The jury  convicted Lanoue  of Counts I,  V and  VI and\r\n\nacquitted him of the robbery-related  charges of Counts II,  III,\r\n\nand IV.   His codefendants Cole and  Meade were acquitted of  all\r\n\ncharges.  The court sentenced Lanoue to 175 months in prison.\r\n\n          Lanoue  appealed to  this court,  and  it reversed  his\r\n\nconvictions on Counts I and  VI after finding that the government\r\n\nhad failed to disclose a  taped conversation between Lanoue and a\r\n\nkey  witness, James  Carron, in  violation  of Fed.  R. Crim.  P.\r\n\n16(a)(1)(A)  and the  pre-trial  discovery order.    See U.S.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nLanoue, 71 F.3d 966 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                \r\n\n           Following this reversal  plea negotiations between the\r\n\nparties failed,  and the government  decided not to  retry Lanoue\r\n\nfor the same  crimes.  Instead, another District  of Rhode Island\r\n\ngrand  jury  returned  a   one-count  indictment  against  Lanoue\r\n\ncharging  him  with the     922(g)(1)  unlawful possession  of  a\r\n\nfirearm   charge  that  had  been  dismissed  from  the  original\r\n\nindictment.  Conviction  under   922(g)(1) carries  a minimum 15-\r\n\nyear mandatory sentence. \r\n\n          At Lanoue's second trial the jury returned a verdict of\r\n\nguilty on the  sole count.  Lanoue  was then sentenced to  a 235-\r\n\nmonth prison term. \r\n\nII.  Discussion\r          II.  Discussion\r\n\n          A.  Venue\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          Lanoue moved to dismiss  the firearm possession  charge\r\n\nfor lack of venue and for  a judgment of acquittal on grounds  of\r\n\nimproper venue.  The district  court denied both motions.  Lanoue\r\n\nadmits that the evidence proved  that he possessed the firearm in\r\n\nMassachusetts but  denies that the  crime also occurred  in Rhode\r\n\nIsland where he was tried.  \r\n\n          A defendant  in a  criminal case  has a  constitutional\r\n\nright to be tried in  a proper venue.   See U.S. v. Johnson,  323\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. 273,  275 (1944)(noting that two  constitutional provisions,\r\n\nArticle III,    2, cl. 3 and  the Sixth Amendment both  provide a\r\n\nright  to trial in the state  where the crime is committed); U.S.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Uribe, 890  F.2d 554, 558  (1st Cir. 1989);  see also Fed.  R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCrim.  P. 18 (codifying the constitutional guarantee by requiring\r\n\nprosecution in  the district  where the  offense was  committed).\r\n\nThe government bears the burden of  proof on the issue of  venue.\r\n\nVenue  is not an  element of the  offense, and it  must be proven\r\n\nonly by a preponderance of  the evidence.  U.S. v. Georgacarakos,\r                                                                          \r\n\n988 F.2d 1289, 1293 (1st Cir. 1993).  We review whether venue was\r\n\nproper  in the  light most  favorable to  the government  and the\r\n\njury's  verdict  to  determine whether  the  prosecution  met its\r\n\nburden.   U.S. v. Joselyn,  99 F.3d  1182, 1190 (1st  Cir. 1996),\r                                   \r\n\ncert. denied, Billmyer v. U.S., 117 S. Ct. 959 (1997). \r                                        \r\n\n          We  must look  to  the statute  defining  the crime  to\r\n\ndetermine the location of the crime for the purpose of venue.  If\r\n\nthe statute  \"does  not indicate  a  method for  determining  the\r\n\nlocation of the crime, . . . the location must be determined from\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe nature  of the crimes alleged and the  location of the act or\r\n\nacts constituting it.\"  Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d at 1293 (internal\r                                               \r\n\nquotation marks  and citations  omitted).  Where  the crime  is a\r\n\ncontinuing  crime and is  \"committed in  more than  one district,\r\n\n[it] may  be  . .  . prosecuted  in any  district  in which  such\r\n\noffense  was  begun,  continued,  or  completed.\"   18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3237(a).  To  determine the locations of the  continuing crime we\r\n\nmust  look  to  the  key   verbs  of  the  statute  in  question.\r\n\nGeorgacarakos, 988  F.2d at 1293.   18 U.S.C.    922(g) makes  it\r                       \r\n\nunlawful  for  a convicted  felon  to  \"possess in  or  affecting\r\n\ncommerce,  any firearm.\"  Only where  Lanoue actually possessed a\r\n\nfirearm would venue be proper.\r\n\n          The  government offered  evidence  to show  that Lanoue\r\n\npossessed  the firearm  in Rhode  Island.  First,  the government\r\n\noffered the testimony  of Lanoue from  his first trial  admitting\r\n\nthat the firearm,  a .38 caliber handgun, belonged  to him, which\r\n\nindicates  that he carried  it from his  home in Rhode  Island to\r\n\nMassachusetts  where he  was arrested.    Second, the  government\r\n\noffered the testimony  of an FBI surveillance  pilot who observed\r\n\nLanoue in  Rhode Island with  a firearm on  the day in  question.\r\n\nThird,  evidence  found  at Lanoue's  residence  in  Rhode Island\r\n\nincluded a gun cleaning kit used to clean a  .38 caliber handgun.\r\n\nThis evidence  was sufficient that a  jury could have  found by a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Lanoue did knowingly possess a\r\n\nfirearm in Rhode  Island.  Venue was appropriate  in Rhode Island\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nunder 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1),  and the district court did  not err\r\n\nin denying Lanoue's venue motions.\r\n\n          B.  Double Jeopardy\r\n\n          Lanoue contends that  his prosecution  under 18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  922(g)(1) violated  the Fifth  Amendment's prohibition  against\r\n\ndouble jeopardy.   We exercise de  novo review of  constitutional\r\n\nquestions \"such  as the  district court's denial  of a  motion to\r\n\ndismiss  . . .  on the grounds of  double jeopardy and collateral\r\n\nestoppel.\"  U.S.  v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18,  21 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1992).\r\n\n           For  double jeopardy  to attach  a  defendant must  be\r\n\ntried for  the same offense twice.  Offenses are not  the same if\r\n\nthey each  \"require[]  proof of  [an additional]  fact which  the\r\n\nother does not.\"  Blockburger v. U.S., 284 U.S.  299, 304 (1932).\r                                               \r\n\nThe Blockburger test looks to the elements of each offense rather\r                         \r\n\nthan to  the evidence used to prove these  elements.  See U.S. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMorris, 99 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1996). \r                \r\n\n          Section 922(g)(1) requires the government to prove that\r\n\nLanoue (1) was  previously convicted of a crime  punishable by an\r\n\nimprisonment  term  in  excess  of  one  year  and (2)  knowingly\r\n\npossessed a firearm (3) in or affecting commerce.  U.S. v. Lewis,\r                                                                          \r\n\n40 F.3d  1325, 1342 (1st  Cir. 1994).   The  essence of  Lanoue's\r\n\ncontention is  that his  earlier prosecution  under  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n922(k)  for  transporting  a weapon  with  an  obliterated serial\r\n\nnumber and under 18 U.S.C.   371 for conspiracy made  the current\r\n\nprosecution under 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1) duplicative.  He does not\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nclaim that either  of these offenses alone requires  proof of the\r\n\nsame  elements as   922(g)(1) but that  his prosecution for these\r\n\ntwo   offenses  in  conjunction  created  the  basis  for  double\r\n\njeopardy.   Lanoue asserts  that because the  prosecution offered\r\n\nevidence of each element  of   922(g)(1) during his first  trial,\r\n\neither  in  proving  the  conspiracy  charge or  in  proving  the\r\n\nobliterated  serial number charge,  it should be  barred from now\r\n\nprosecuting him under   922(g)(1). \r\n\n          Lanoue  ignores that  each offense  must be  considered\r\n\nseparately.  The  offense of obliterating a serial  number is not\r\n\nthe same  as possession of  a firearm by a  convicted felon; each\r\n\noffense requires  an element  of proof that  the other  does not.\r\n\nThe former requires that the serial number of the gun be removed,\r\n\nand  the latter  requires  a  previous  conviction  for  a  crime\r\n\npunishable by imprisonment for more than  one year.  Furthermore,\r\n\nalthough  the conspiracy charge  listed firearm possession  as an\r\n\novert act of  the conspiracy,1 a conspiracy to  commit a crime is\r\n\nnot the same offense as the substantive crime for double jeopardy\r\n\npurposes.  See U.S. v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 390-91 (1992).\r                                      \r\n\n          In  short,  it  does not  matter  that  the prosecutors\r\n\npresented the same evidence at the  first trial and at the second\r\n\nwhere he was  being tried for separate offenses.   His contention\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  Count I of the original indictment  charged the defendants with\r\nconspiracy to commit  six different underlying  federal offenses.\r\nOne of  these was  transporting firearms  possessed by  convicted\r\nfelons.    The  jury  was  instructed  that  it  could  find  the\r\ndefendants guilty of  the charge alleged in  Count I if  it found\r\nthem guilty of any one of the underlying overt acts. \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncomes very close  to advocating the \"same conduct\"  test that was\r\n\nbriefly adopted by the Supreme Court in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n508, 521 (1990),  but later rejected  in U.S. v. Dixon,  509 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n688,  712 (1994) (overruling Grady and readopting the Blockburger\r                                                                           \r\n\n\"same elements\" test  for double jeopardy).  See  also Morris, 99\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at  479-480  (\"[P]erformance  of  a  Blockburger   analysis\r                                                                \r\n\ncompletes the  judicial task  in a  successive prosecution  case.\r\n\nConsequently, the  appellants' 'same evidence'  argument fails.\")\r\n\n(citation  omitted).   Because the charged  offenses are  not the\r\n\nsame  under the Blockburger test, Lanoue's Fifth Amendment double\r                                     \r\n\njeopardy rights were not violated.\r\n\n          C.  Collateral Estoppel\r\n\n          As  an alternative  to  his double  jeopardy  assertion\r\n\nLanoue contends  that the  government  was collaterally  estopped\r\n\nfrom prosecuting him for the firearm possession charge.  Although\r\n\nthe doctrine  of collateral  estoppel \"is embodied  in the  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment guarantee  against double  jeopardy,\" Ashe  v. Swenson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n397  U.S. 436,  445 (1970), a  prosecution permissible  under the\r\n\nDouble Jeopardy  Clause may  be proscribed  under the  collateral\r\n\nestoppel  doctrine where a previous acquittal bars the litigation\r\n\nof facts essential to the government's case.  See Dixon, 509 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 710-11 n.15. \r\n\n          Specifically,  collateral  estoppel  requires  that  an\r\n\nissue of ultimate  fact has  been determined  in the  defendant's\r\n\nfavor in a prior prosecution between the same parties.   See Ashe\r                                                                           \r\n\n397  U.S. at  443; U.S. v.  Dray, 901  F.2d 1132, 1136  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n1990).    \"Where  it  is  impossible  to  determine  whether  the\r\n\nparticular  issue was previously resolved in a defendant's favor,\r\n\npreclusive effect must be denied.\"  Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n23.   The  burden of  demonstrating that  the issue  was actually\r\n\ndecided in the first prosecution rests upon the defendant.  Id. \r                                                                        \r\n\n          The doctrine  necessarily requires  that the  defendant\r\n\nwas acquitted  of at least  some charge in the  first prosecution\r\n\nbefore we can  find that an issue  was decided in his  favor that\r\n\nmight preclude the current prosecution.  Lanoue was acquitted  of\r\n\nthree charges  in his  first prosecution  and convicted  of three\r\n\nothers.2   Of the charges on  which Lanoue was acquitted only one\r\n\nhas  any  relation   to  the  issues  presented  in  the  present\r\n\nprosecution.  Count  IV charged Lanoue with using  and carrying a\r\n\nfirearm during  and in  relation to an  attempt or  conspiracy to\r\n\ncommit robbery.   The  jury could have  acquitted Lanoue  of this\r\n\ncharge for several reasons.   Only if it acquitted Lanoue because\r\n\nit  found that  he  did not  use  or carry  a  firearm would  the\r\n\nacquittal operate to collaterally estop  the present prosecution.\r\n\nHowever, it is much more likely that the jury acquitted Lanoue of\r\n\nCount IV  because it found  that there was  no attempt to  commit\r\n\nrobbery  rather than  because he  carried no  firearm.   Lanoue's\r\n\nconviction  on  Count  VI,  which  charged  him  with  interstate\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  Lanoue's convictions on  Counts I and VI were  later vacated by\r\nthis court.  U.S. v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966 (1st Cir. 1995).  The\r                                     \r\nreversal stemmed from the government's violation of its discovery\r\nobligations.  The  convictions were vacated with the  intent that\r\nLanoue  would be retried.   Id. at 984.   Therefore, this court's\r                                        \r\nprevious decision is  not an acquittal and does  not suggest that\r\nany issue of fact was resolved in Lanoue's favor.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ntransportation  of a firearm  with an obliterated  serial number,\r\n\nestablishes that the  jury found that Lanoue did in  fact carry a\r\n\nfirearm.\r\n\n          Lanoue  has  failed to  demonstrate  that  any ultimate\r\n\nissue of fact was determined in his  favor during his first trial\r\n\nthat would preclude the present prosecution.   The district court\r\n\ndid not err in denying Lanoue's collateral estoppel motion.\r\n\n          D.  Disqualification of Lanoue's counsel\r\n\n          Lanoue contends that his  conviction should be reversed\r\n\nbecause  he was denied the counsel  of his choice in violation of\r\n\nhis Sixth Amendment rights.  The Sixth Amendment right to counsel\r\n\nincludes the  right to  have an attorney  of one's  own choosing;\r\n\nhowever, this right is not absolute.  See U.S. v. Wheat, 486 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n153,  159 (1988).    The  court  disqualified  Lanoue's  original\r\n\nattorney, Thomas Briody,  on the government's motion and  after a\r\n\nhearing on  the issue.   The reason for the  disqualification was\r\n\nthat Briody had  represented Lanoue's  codefendant, Cole,  during\r\n\nthe first  trial.   Cole  was  acquitted  of all  charges.    The\r\n\ngovernment told the district  court that it might call  Cole as a\r\n\nwitness  to  testify on  whether  Lanoue possessed  a  firearm on\r\n\nDecember 23, 1993 and that a conflict of interest  could arise if\r\n\nBriody had  to cross-examine Cole.   Both Cole and  Briody waived\r\n\nany  right to conflict-free representation, and Cole submitted an\r\n\naffidavit that he did not know that Lanoue possessed a firearm on\r\n\nthe day  of his  arrest and had  no knowledge  concerning whether\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nLanoue possessed a firearm at any time prior to his arrest.   The\r\n\ngovernment offered  no reason,  other than  the possibility  that\r\n\nCole  might  have known  of  the firearm,  for  calling him  as a\r\n\nwitness.\r\n\n          We  review  decisions  to  disqualify  an attorney  for\r\n\nconflict  of  interest  for abuse  of  discretion.   Fiandaca  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCunningham, 827 F.2d 825,  828 (1st Cir. 1987).  A district court\r                    \r\n\ncan  disqualify a  defendant's  attorney  over  that  defendant's\r\n\nobjection where it  finds either an actual conflict  or a serious\r\n\npotential  conflict.   In Re:  Grand Jury  Proceedings, 859  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1021, 1023-24 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\n\n          The government cites numerous cases for the proposition\r\n\nthat an attorney's  representation of a client who  may be called\r\n\nas a witness  creates a serious potential for  conflict, but many\r\n\nof these cases  presented a greater  potential for conflict  than\r\n\nthis case.   See Wheat, 486  U.S. at  163-64 (\"Here the  District\r                                \r\n\nCourt was  confronted not simply  with an attorney who  wished to\r\n\nrepresent two coequal  defendants in  a straightforward  criminal\r\n\nprosecution;     rather,   Iredale  proposed   to  defend   three\r\n\nconspirators  of varying  stature in  a complex drug distribution\r\n\nscheme\");  U.S.  v.

If the attorney is allowed to continue\r\n\nand the  conflict does arise  then the defendant may  not receive\r\n\nthe representation  to  which he  is  entitled, resulting  in  an\r\n\nineffective assistance of counsel appeal.   The Supreme Court has\r\n\nrecognized the  \"willingness of  Courts of  Appeals to  entertain\r\n\nineffective[]   assistance  claims   from  defendants   who  have\r\n\nspecifically waived the  right to conflict-free counsel.\"   Wheat\r                                                                           \r\n\n486 U.S.  at 162.   This  dilemma creates  the need  for district\r\n\ncourts to carefully consider the  facts when deciding whether  to\r\n\ndisqualify.\r\n\n          The  district  court  in this  case  did  not make  the\r\n\ndecision to disqualify summarily.   It held a hearing and allowed\r\n\neach   side  to   present   its   arguments   for   and   against\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ndisqualification.  Other district courts might have reached . . .\r\n\nopposite  conclusions with equal justification, but that does not\r\n\nmean that one conclusion was 'right' and the other 'wrong . . . .\r\n\nThe  evaluation of  the facts  . .  .   of each  case  under this\r\n\nstandard must be  left primarily to the informed  judgment of the\r\n\ntrial court.\"   Id. at 164.  The district court did not abuse its\r                            \r\n\nconsiderable discretion in disqualifying Lanoue's attorney in the\r\n\nface of a potential conflict of interest.\r\n\n          E.  Vindictive Prosecution\r\n\n          Lanoue's most troubling assertion on appeal is that his\r\n\nprosecution under    922(g)(1) resulted from a  vindictive motive\r\n\non the  part of  Assistant United  States Attorney James  Leavey.\r\n\nLeavey has  prosecuted  Lanoue on  at least  two other  occasions\r\n\nbefore this trial.3   The first resulted in an acquittal.  Out of\r\n\nthe  six  counts  prosecuted  in  the  second  trial  Lanoue  was\r\n\nacquitted of three and convicted of three.   On appeal this court\r\n\nreversed two of  Lanoue's convictions after it  found that Leavey\r\n\nhad  withheld  evidence and  violated his  discovery obligations.\r\n\nSee Lanoue, 71 F.3d at 984. Leavey decided not to retry Lanoue on\r                    \r\n\nthose charges, instead prosecuting him on the   922(g)(1) charge,\r\n\nwhich he had previously decided to dismiss  for lack of venue.  A\r\n\nconviction under   922(g) carries a minimum sentence of 15 years.\r\n\nLanoue is  already serving a 19-year state sentence for violation\r\n\nof probation and a  five-year federal sentence for  his remaining\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  Leavey conceded that  actually he may have been  connected to a\r\nfourth  prosecution  of  Lanoue when  he  was  Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral for the State of Rhode Island in the late 1970s.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nconviction  in the  second prosecution.   He is 75  years old and\r\n\nsuffers from angina pectoris.  The 235-month sentence he received\r\n\nin his second  trial is substantially  longer than the  175-month\r\n\nsentence he  received in his  first trial, which was  reversed on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          A  vindictive  prosecution,   if  proved,  violates   a\r\n\ndefendant's Fifth  Amendment right to  due process.  See  U.S. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGoodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 372 (1982).  We  will reverse a conviction\r                 \r\n\nthat is  the result of  a vindictive prosecution where  the facts\r\n\nshow  an  actual  vindictiveness or  a  sufficient  likelihood of\r\n\nvindictiveness to  warrant such a  presumption.  See id.  at 373;\r                                                                 \r\n\nU.S. v. Marrapese,  826 F.2d 145,  147 (1st Cir.  1987).  If  the\r                           \r\n\ndefendant  creates a  presumption  of vindictiveness  the  burden\r\n\nshifts to  the government to  show that legitimate  reasons exist\r\n\nfor the prosecution.  See Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 376 n.8. \r                                           \r\n\n          Successful  assertions  of vindictive  prosecution  are\r\n\nmost  common  where  a  defendant  advances  some  procedural  or\r\n\nconstitutional  right and  is then  punished for  doing so.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBlackledge  v.  Perry,  417  U.S.  21,  28-9  (1974)  (Prosecutor\r                               \r\n\nimpermissibly obtained a felony indictment resulting in a five to\r\n\nseven-year  sentence after the defendant had received a six-month\r\n\nsentence for  an assault and  had exercised an absolute  right of\r\n\nappeal and to  trial de novo allowed under  North Carolina law.);\r\n\nbut  see Bordenkircher  v. Hayes,  434 U.S.  357, 365  (1978) (no\r                                          \r\n\nfinding of vindictive motive where prosecutor followed through on\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\na pretrial threat to increase  charges if defendant did not plead\r\n\nguilty).\r\n\n          Lanoue successfully appealed  his first conviction  and\r\n\nsentence, and he  refused to plead guilty to  the counts reversed\r\n\nin the first  appeal even though the prosecutor  warned that this\r\n\nrefusal might result in a reinstatement of the   922(g)(1) charge\r\n\nthat had  been  dismissed from  the  original indictment.4    The\r\n\nprosecutor sought an indictment for  the   922(g)(1) charge based\r\n\nupon the conduct that was the subject of the original indictment.\r\n\nThis one additional  charge carried a mandatory  minimum sentence\r\n\nthat  was larger  than  the original  sentence he  received after\r\n\nbeing convicted of three separate offenses in the first trial.\r\n\n          We  hold   that  Lanoue  did   not  show  prosecutorial\r\n\nvindictiveness, or a  likelihood of vindictiveness  sufficient to\r\n\ncreate a presumption and shift the burden to the government.  The\r\n\nfact that  the government  followed through on  a threat  it made\r\n\nduring  plea bargain negotiations does not, by itself, constitute\r\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct.  See  Bordenkircher, 434 U.S.  at 365.\r                                                        \r\n\nFurthermore,  even  if   Lanoue  had  raised  a   presumption  of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  During plea negotiations the government offered Lanoue a chance\r\nto  plead  guilty  to  the  charges  that  this  court  reversed,\r\npromising him  a maximum  ten-year sentence  to run  concurrently\r\nwith  the five-year sentence  he is  presently serving.   Because\r\nLanoue is  serving  the five-year  federal sentence  concurrently\r\nwith the 19-year  state sentence, this offer subjected  him to no\r\nadditional jail time  unless his state sentence  was shortened to\r\nless than ten  years.  Lanoue rejected this offer  insisting on a\r\nfive-year  concurrent sentence  for the  reversed  charges.   The\r\ngovernment warned  Lanoue that if  he did not accept  their offer\r\nthey   might  prosecute  him  on  the  15-year  minimum,  firearm\r\npossession  charge.     Lanoue  rejected  their  offer   and  the\r\nprosecutor followed through on his threat.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nvindictiveness,   the   government   adequately   rebutted   this\r\n\npresumption  by presenting  sufficient reasons  for bringing  the\r\n\nbelated   922(g)(1) charge. \r\n\n           We  recognize  that generally  where  a  defendant can\r\n\npoint to specific facts that raise a likelihood of vindictiveness\r\n\na district court must grant  an evidentiary hearing on the issue.\r\n\nSee U.S. v.  Adams, 870  F.2d 1140, 1146  (6th Cir. 1989)  (where\r                            \r\n\ncriminal defendant  presents evidence of  vindictive prosecution,\r\n\ndefendant is  entitled to  evidentiary hearing  and discovery  to\r\n\npermit her  to develop  defense); U.S. v.  Napue, 834  F.2d 1311,\r                                                          \r\n\n1329 (7th  Cir. 1987)(\"to obtain  an evidentiary hearing .  . . a\r\n\ndefendant must make a prima  facie case based on facts sufficient\r\n\nto  raise a  reasonable doubt  about  the prosecutor's  purpose\")\r\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\n\n          After reviewing the  record, we are satisfied  that the\r\n\ndistrict court held the equivalent of an evidentiary hearing.  It\r\n\nheard  Lanoue's  counsel  on  the   issue,  and  it  allowed  the\r\n\ngovernment to proceed by proffer.5   The memorandum of each party\r\n\nwas incorporated  into the record  of the case.   After reviewing\r\n\nthese memoranda, we find that they contain sufficient information\r\n\nthat allowed the  court to properly dismiss Lanoue's  motion.  In\r\n\nits memorandum the  government candidly explained the  reasons it\r\n\nprosecuted Lanoue under the firearm possession charge.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  The  district court allowed  the prosecutor's memorandum  to be\r\nincorporated  as a \"substantive document of his actual testimony\"\r\nexplaining his  reasons for  the instant  prosecution.   Lanoue's\r\ncounsel indicated  that this  arrangement was  satisfactory as  a\r\nmeans of establishing a factual record.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          The most important reason offered by the prosecutor was\r\n\nthat  he had  new evidence  on the    922(g)(1)  charge that  was\r\n\nunavailable when he  originally dismissed it.  See  U.S. v. Fiel,\r                                                                          \r\n\n35 F.3d  997, 1008  (4th Cir.  1994) (\"Where  the  change in  the\r\n\nindictment  is prompted 'by  newly discovered evidence supporting\r\n\nthe  imposition of  additional  counts  . .  .  a presumption  of\r\n\nvindictiveness  is not warranted.'\") (quoting U.S. v. Bryant, 770\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  1283, 1287 (5th  Cir. 1985)).   The    922(g)(1) charge was\r\n\noriginally dismissed  only because  the government  was concerned\r\n\nabout venue.  Lanoue's testimony at  his first trial, in which he\r\n\nadmitted  to  owning  the  firearm,  made  the  issue   of  venue\r\n\nimmaterial.  The government initially did not prosecute Lanoue on\r\n\nthe   922(g)(1) after it had  the new evidence because Lanoue had\r\n\nbeen sentenced to  14 years, which  it found to  be a  sufficient\r\n\nsentence for the  crimes.  It was not until that 14-year sentence\r\n\nwas  reduced on appeal that the government considered going forth\r\n\nwith its new evidence.  Second, the government explained that the\r\n\n  922(g)(1) charge was  easy to prosecute.  Faced with the choice\r\n\nof retrying  the two charges  reversed by this court,  which were\r\n\nmore factually  complex and  would require  extensive proof,6  or\r\n\ntrying Lanoue for  the relatively simple to prove firearm charge,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n  The convictions  reversed by this court were  for conspiracy to\r\ncommit various federal offenses  and interstate transportation of\r\na  stolen motor vehicle.  Both of  these crimes require the proof\r\nof several elements whereas   922(g)(1)  only requires proof that\r\nLanoue had  previously  been  convicted  of a  felony,  which  he\r\nconceded, and  that he  possessed a firearm.   Additionally,  the\r\ngovernment was concerned  that it would be  collaterally estopped\r\nfrom presenting some of the proof  it offered in the first  trial\r\nbecause Lanoue was aquitted of three of the original charges.  \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nit  chose the  latter.   Third,  the government  gave Lanoue  the\r\n\noption to  avoid prosecution  under   922(g)(1)  and the  15-year\r\n\nmandatory  sentence it requires.   Lanoue refused this offer when\r\n\nhe  turned  down  the  government's  attempt  to   reach  a  plea\r\n\nagreement, knowing  that  a prosecution  under   922(g)(1)  might\r\n\nensue.\r\n\n          These reasons were  presented to the district  court in\r\n\nthe government's  memorandum and  were made  part of  the record.\r\n\nThey are sufficient to overcome Lanoue's evidence that tended  to\r\n\nshow vindictiveness or a presumption thereof.  The district court\r\n\ndid not err in refusing to dismiss the charge.\r\n\nIII.  Conclusion\r          III.  Conclusion\r\n\n          We AFFIRM Lanoue's conviction of violating 18 U.S.C. \r                       AFFIRM\r\n\n  922(g)(1).\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n",

He was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island after a trial by jury.  He raises multiple issues including 1)improper venue, 2)double jeopardy, 3)collateral estoppel, 4)the right to have the attorney of his choosing, and 5)vindictive prosecution.  We have reviewed each assertion and affirm his conviction.I. Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Lanoue's 1994 prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue was prosecuted in the District of Rhode Island in 1994 for various crimes arising from the events that also gave rise to the present prosecution.  Evidence presented at Lanoue's 1994 trial demonstrated the following facts.  On the morning of December 23, 1993, Lanoue left his residence in Rhode Island and traveled to Bellingham, Massachusetts.  On the way he rendezvoused with Albert Cole, and they proceeded to Bellingham in a car that had been reported stolen.  These movements were the subject of a large scale surveillance operation that included at least three dozen FBI agents and members of the Rhode Island State Police.  Lanoue was arrested in Bellingham in a shopping center parking lot as he approached an unmarked armored car.  During the arrest Lanoue admitted to the arresting agents that he was carrying a .38 caliber handgun on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of that arrest Lanoue and two codefendants, Cole and Patrick Meade, were charged in a seven-count indictment by a grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island.  All three were charged in Count I with conspiracy to commit federal offenses, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371;  in Count II with conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951;  in Count III with attempt to interfere with commerce by robbery, Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951;  and in Count IV with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to an attempt or conspiracy to commit robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  Count V charged Lanoue and Cole with interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2312;  Count VI charged Lanoue and Meade with possessing firearms and ammunition in and affecting commerce, each having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1)(2);  and Count VII charged Lanoue alone with interstate transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k).  Counts III, IV and V also explicitly charged the defendants with aiding and abetting.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count VI was dismissed by the government because the defendants had been arrested in Massachusetts rather than Rhode Island and prosecutors anticipated problems with venue.  A redacted indictment was filed with leave of court on August 17, 1994 that designated the original Count VII as Count VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Lanoue of Counts I, V and VI and acquitted him of the robbery-related charges of Counts II, III, and IV.  His codefendants Cole and Meade were acquitted of all charges.  The court sentenced Lanoue to 175 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue appealed to this court, and it reversed his convictions on Counts I and VI after finding that the government had failed to disclose a taped conversation between Lanoue and a key witness, James Carron, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A) and the pre-trial discovery order.  See U.S. v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this reversal plea negotiations between the parties failed, and the government decided not to retry Lanoue for the same crimes.  Instead, another District of Rhode Island grand jury returned a one-count indictment against Lanoue charging him with the &#167; 922(g)(1) unlawful possession of a firearm charge that had been dismissed from the original indictment.  Conviction under &#167; 922(g)(1) carries a minimum 15-year mandatory sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Lanoue's second trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the sole count.  Lanoue was then sentenced to a 235-month prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Venue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue moved to dismiss the firearm possession charge for lack of venue and for a judgment of acquittal on grounds of improper venue.  The district court denied both motions.  Lanoue admits that the evidence proved that he possessed the firearm in Massachusetts but denies that the crime also occurred in Rhode Island where he was tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right to be tried in a proper venue.  See U.S. v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 275, 65 S.Ct. 249, 250, 89 L.Ed. 236 (1944)(noting that two constitutional provisions, Article III, &#167; 2, cl. 3 and the Sixth Amendment both provide a right to trial in the state where the crime is committed);  U.S. v. Uribe, 890 F.2d 554, 558 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 18 (codifying the constitutional guarantee by requiring prosecution in the district where the offense was committed).  The government bears the burden of proof on the issue of venue.  Venue is not an element of the offense, and it must be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence.  U.S. v. Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d 1289, 1293 (1st Cir.1993).  We review whether venue was proper in the light most favorable to the government and the jury's verdict to determine whether the prosecution met its burden.  U.S. v. Josleyn, 99 F.3d 1182, 1190 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, Billmyer v. U.S., --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 959, 136 L.Ed.2d 845 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must look to the statute defining the crime to determine the location of the crime for the purpose of venue.  If the statute \"does not indicate a method for determining the location of the crime, ... the location must be determined from the nature of the crimes alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\"  Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d at 1293 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Where the crime is a continuing crime and is \"committed in more than one district, [it] may be ... prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or completed.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3237(a).  To determine the locations of the continuing crime we must look to the key verbs of the statute in question.  Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d at 1293.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) makes it unlawful for a convicted felon to \"possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm.\"   Only where Lanoue actually possessed a firearm would venue be proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered evidence to show that Lanoue possessed the firearm in Rhode Island.  First, the government offered the testimony of Lanoue from his first trial admitting that the firearm, a .38 caliber handgun, belonged to him, which indicates that he carried it from his home in Rhode Island to Massachusetts where he was arrested.  Second, the government offered the testimony of an FBI surveillance pilot who observed Lanoue in Rhode Island with a firearm on the day in question.  Third, evidence found at Lanoue's residence in Rhode Island included a gun cleaning kit used to clean a .38 caliber handgun.  This evidence was sufficient that a jury could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that Lanoue did knowingly possess a firearm in Rhode Island.  Venue was appropriate in Rhode Island under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), and the district court did not err in denying Lanoue's venue motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue contends that his prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy.  We exercise de novo review of constitutional questions \"such as the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss ... on the grounds of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel.\"  U.S. v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For double jeopardy to attach a defendant must be tried for the same offense twice.  Offenses are not the same if they each \"require[ ] proof of [an additional] fact which the other does not.\"  Blockburger v. U.S., 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).  The Blockburger test looks to the elements of each offense rather than to the evidence used to prove these elements.  See U.S. v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 922(g)(1) requires the government to prove that Lanoue (1) was previously convicted of a crime punishable by an imprisonment term in excess of one year and (2) knowingly possessed a firearm (3) in or affecting commerce.  U.S. v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1342 (1st Cir.1994).  The essence of Lanoue's contention is that his earlier prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k) for transporting a weapon with an obliterated serial number and under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 for conspiracy made the current prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) duplicative.  He does not claim that either of these offenses alone requires proof of the same elements as &#167; 922(g)(1) but that his prosecution for these two offenses in conjunction created the basis for double jeopardy.  Lanoue asserts that because the prosecution offered evidence of each element of &#167; 922(g)(1) during his first trial, either in proving the conspiracy charge or in proving the obliterated serial number charge, it should be barred from now prosecuting him under &#167; 922(g)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue ignores that each offense must be considered separately.  The offense of obliterating a serial number is not the same as possession of a firearm by a convicted felon;  each offense requires an element of proof that the other does not.  The former requires that the serial number of the gun be removed, and the latter requires a previous conviction for a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.  Furthermore, although the conspiracy charge listed firearm possession as an overt act of the conspiracy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a conspiracy to commit a crime is not the same offense as the substantive crime for double jeopardy purposes.  See U.S. v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 390-91, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 1384-85, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, it does not matter that the prosecutors presented the same evidence at the first trial and at the second where he was being tried for separate offenses.  His contention comes very close to advocating the \"same conduct\" test that was briefly adopted by the Supreme Court in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 521, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 2093, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), but later rejected in U.S. v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 712, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2859, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993) (overruling Grady and readopting the Blockburger \"same elements\" test for double jeopardy).  See also Morris, 99 F.3d at 479-480 (\"[P]erformance of a Blockburger analysis completes the judicial task in a successive prosecution case.  Consequently, the appellants' 'same evidence' argument fails.\")  (citation omitted).  Because the charged offenses are not the same under the Blockburger test, Lanoue's Fifth Amendment double jeopardy rights were not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Collateral Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to his double jeopardy assertion Lanoue contends that the government was collaterally estopped from prosecuting him for the firearm possession charge.  Although the doctrine of collateral estoppel \"is embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy,\" Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 445, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1195, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), a prosecution permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause may be proscribed under the collateral estoppel doctrine where a previous acquittal bars the litigation of facts essential to the government's case.  See Dixon, 509 U.S. at 710-11 n. 15, 113 S.Ct. at 2863 n. 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, collateral estoppel requires that an issue of ultimate fact has been determined in the defendant's favor in a prior prosecution between the same parties.  See Ashe 397 U.S. at 443, 90 S.Ct. at 1194;  U.S. v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1136 (1st Cir.1990).  \"Where it is impossible to determine whether the particular issue was previously resolved in a defendant's favor, preclusive effect must be denied.\"  Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d at 23.   The burden of demonstrating that the issue was actually decided in the first prosecution rests upon the defendant.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine necessarily requires that the defendant was acquitted of at least some charge in the first prosecution before we can find that an issue was decided in his favor that might preclude the current prosecution.  Lanoue was acquitted of three charges in his first prosecution and convicted of three others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Of the charges on which Lanoue was acquitted only one has any relation to the issues presented in the present prosecution.  Count IV charged Lanoue with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to an attempt or conspiracy to commit robbery.  The jury could have acquitted Lanoue of this charge for several reasons.  Only if it acquitted Lanoue because it found that he did not use or carry a firearm would the acquittal operate to collaterally estop the present prosecution.  However, it is much more likely that the jury acquitted Lanoue of Count IV because it found that there was no attempt to commit robbery rather than because he carried no firearm.  Lanoue's conviction on Count VI, which charged him with interstate transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, establishes that the jury found that Lanoue did in fact carry a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue has failed to demonstrate that any ultimate issue of fact was determined in his favor during his first trial that would preclude the present prosecution.  The district court did not err in denying Lanoue's collateral estoppel motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Disqualification of Lanoue's counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue contends that his conviction should be reversed because he was denied the counsel of his choice in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.  The Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes the right to have an attorney of one's own choosing;  however, this right is not absolute.  See Wheat v. U.S., 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 1697, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988).  The court disqualified Lanoue's original attorney, Thomas Briody, on the government's motion and after a hearing on the issue.  The reason for the disqualification was that Briody had represented Lanoue's codefendant, Cole, during the first trial.  Cole was acquitted of all charges.  The government told the district court that it might call Cole as a witness to testify on whether Lanoue possessed a firearm on December 23, 1993 and that a conflict of interest could arise if Briody had to cross-examine Cole.  Both Cole and Briody waived any right to conflict-free representation, and Cole submitted an affidavit that he did not know that Lanoue possessed a firearm on the day of his arrest and had no knowledge concerning whether Lanoue possessed a firearm at any time prior to his arrest.  The government offered no reason, other than the possibility that Cole might have known of the firearm, for calling him as a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review decisions to disqualify an attorney for conflict of interest for abuse of discretion.  Fiandaca v. Cunningham, 827 F.2d 825, 828 (1st Cir.1987).  A district court can disqualify a defendant's attorney over that defendant's objection where it finds either an actual conflict or a serious potential conflict.  In Re:  Grand Jury Proceedings, 859 F.2d 1021, 1023-24 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cites numerous cases for the proposition that an attorney's representation of a client who may be called as a witness creates a serious potential for conflict, but many of these cases presented a greater potential for conflict than this case.  See Wheat, 486 U.S. at 163-64, 108 S.Ct. at 1699-1700 (\"Here the District Court was confronted not simply with an attorney who wished to represent two coequal defendants in a straightforward criminal prosecution;  rather, Iredale proposed to defend three conspirators of varying stature in a complex drug distribution scheme\");  U.S. v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1078-79 (3d Cir.)  (disqualification affirmed, but the attorney had represented several codefendants who continued to be involved in the case, one of whom refused to waive her rights), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 623, 136 L.Ed.2d 546 (1996);  U.S. v. McCutcheon, 86 F.3d 187, 189 (11th Cir.1996) (disqualification affirmed where codefendant refused to waive any rights);  U.S. v. Ross, 33 F.3d 1507, 1523 (11th Cir.1994) (earlier client did not waive any rights);  U.S. v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 932 (2d Cir.1993) (possibility existed that attorneys were accomplices in the crime, would themselves be called as witnesses, and that they had been inside counsel for entire Gambino crime family, of which the defendants were members);  but see In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 859 F.2d at 1024-26 (disqualification reversed where both the present client and the past client waived any right to conflict-free representation and court found no direct link between clients).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the facts of this case may well reach the outer limits of \"potential conflict,\" the potential for conflict is a matter that is uniquely factual and presents a special dilemma for trial courts.  If the attorney is allowed to continue and the conflict does arise then the defendant may not receive the representation to which he is entitled, resulting in an ineffective assistance of counsel appeal.  The Supreme Court has recognized the \"willingness of Courts of Appeals to entertain ineffective[ ] assistance claims from defendants who have specifically waived the right to conflict-free counsel.\"  Wheat 486 U.S. at 162, 108 S.Ct. at 1698-99.   This dilemma creates the need for district courts to carefully consider the facts when deciding whether to disqualify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in this case did not make the decision to disqualify summarily.  It held a hearing and allowed each side to present its arguments for and against disqualification.  \"Other district courts might have reached ... opposite conclusions with equal justification, but that does not mean that one conclusion was 'right' and the other 'wrong'....   The evaluation of the facts ... of each case under this standard must be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court.\"  Id. at 164, 108 S.Ct. at 1699-1700.   The district court did not abuse its considerable discretion in disqualifying Lanoue's attorney in the face of a potential conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Vindictive Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue's most troubling assertion on appeal is that his prosecution under &#167; 922(g)(1) resulted from a vindictive motive on the part of Assistant United States Attorney James Leavey.  Leavey has prosecuted Lanoue on at least two other occasions before this trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The first resulted in an acquittal.  Out of the six counts prosecuted in the second trial Lanoue was acquitted of three and convicted of three.  On appeal this court reversed two of Lanoue's convictions after it found that Leavey had withheld evidence and violated his discovery obligations.  See Lanoue, 71 F.3d at 984.   Leavey decided not to retry Lanoue on those charges, instead prosecuting him on the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge, which he had previously decided to dismiss for lack of venue.  A conviction under &#167; 922(g) carries a minimum sentence of 15 years.  Lanoue is already serving a 19-year state sentence for violation of probation and a five-year federal sentence for his remaining conviction in the second prosecution.  He is 75 years old and suffers from angina pectoris.  The 235-month sentence he received in his second trial is substantially longer than the 175-month sentence he received in his first trial, which was reversed on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A vindictive prosecution, if proved, violates a defendant's Fifth Amendment right to due process.  See U.S. v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 372, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2488, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982).  We will reverse a conviction that is the result of a vindictive prosecution where the facts show an actual vindictiveness or a sufficient likelihood of vindictiveness to warrant such a presumption.  See id. at 373, 102 S.Ct. at 2488-89;  U.S. v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir.1987).  If the defendant creates a presumption of vindictiveness the burden shifts to the government to show that legitimate reasons exist for the prosecution.  See Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 376 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. at 2490 n. 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Successful assertions of vindictive prosecution are most common where a defendant advances some procedural or constitutional right and is then punished for doing so.  See Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 28-9, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2102-03, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974) (Prosecutor impermissibly obtained a felony indictment resulting in a five to seven-year sentence after the defendant had received a six-month sentence for an assault and had exercised an absolute right of appeal and to trial de novo allowed under North Carolina law.);   but see Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 365, 98 S.Ct. 663, 669, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978) (no finding of vindictive motive where prosecutor followed through on a pretrial threat to increase charges if defendant did not plead guilty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue successfully appealed his first conviction and sentence, and he refused to plead guilty to the counts reversed in the first appeal even though the prosecutor warned that this refusal might result in a reinstatement of the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge that had been dismissed from the original indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The prosecutor sought an indictment for the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge based upon the conduct that was the subject of the original indictment.  This one additional charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence that was larger than the original sentence he received after being convicted of three separate offenses in the first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that Lanoue did not show prosecutorial vindictiveness, or a likelihood of vindictiveness sufficient to create a presumption and shift the burden to the government.  The fact that the government followed through on a threat it made during plea bargain negotiations does not, by itself, constitute prosecutorial misconduct.  See Bordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 365, 98 S.Ct. at 669.   Furthermore, even if Lanoue had raised a presumption of vindictiveness, the government adequately rebutted this presumption by presenting sufficient reasons for bringing the belated &#167; 922(g)(1) charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that generally where a defendant can point to specific facts that raise a likelihood of vindictiveness a district court must grant an evidentiary hearing on the issue.  See U.S. v. Adams, 870 F.2d 1140, 1146 (6th Cir.1989) (where criminal defendant presents evidence of vindictive prosecution, defendant is entitled to evidentiary hearing and discovery to permit her to develop defense);  U.S. v. Napue, 834 F.2d 1311, 1329 (7th Cir.1987)(\"to obtain an evidentiary hearing ... a defendant must make a prima facie case based on facts sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the prosecutor's purpose\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the district court held the equivalent of an evidentiary hearing.  It heard Lanoue's counsel on the issue, and it allowed the government to proceed by proffer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The memorandum of each party was incorporated into the record of the case.  After reviewing these memoranda, we find that they contain sufficient information that allowed the court to properly dismiss Lanoue's motion.  In its memorandum the government candidly explained the reasons it prosecuted Lanoue under the firearm possession charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most important reason offered by the prosecutor was that he had new evidence on the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge that was unavailable when he originally dismissed it.  See U.S. v. Fiel, 35 F.3d 997, 1008 (4th Cir.1994) (\"Where the change in the indictment is prompted 'by newly discovered evidence supporting the imposition of additional counts ... a presumption of vindictiveness is not warranted.' \")  (quoting U.S. v. Bryant, 770 F.2d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir.1985)).  The &#167; 922(g)(1) charge was originally dismissed only because the government was concerned about venue.  Lanoue's testimony at his first trial, in which he admitted to owning the firearm, made the issue of venue immaterial.  The government initially did not prosecute Lanoue on the &#167; 922(g)(1) after it had the new evidence because Lanoue had been sentenced to 14 years, which it found to be a sufficient sentence for the crimes.  It was not until that 14-year sentence was reduced on appeal that the government considered going forth with its new evidence.  Second, the government explained that the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge was easy to prosecute.  Faced with the choice of retrying the two charges reversed by this court, which were more factually complex and would require extensive proof,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> or trying Lanoue for the relatively simple to prove firearm charge, it chose the latter.  Third, the government gave Lanoue the option to avoid prosecution under &#167; 922(g)(1) and the 15-year mandatory sentence it requires.  Lanoue refused this offer when he turned down the government's attempt to reach a plea agreement, knowing that a prosecution under &#167; 922(g)(1) might ensue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These reasons were presented to the district court in the government's memorandum and were made part of the record.  They are sufficient to overcome Lanoue's evidence that tended to show vindictiveness or a presumption thereof.  The district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM Lanoue's conviction of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count I of the original indictment charged the defendants with conspiracy to commit six different underlying federal offenses.  One of these was transporting firearms possessed by convicted felons.  The jury was instructed that it could find the defendants guilty of the charge alleged in Count I if it found them guilty of any one of the underlying overt acts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Lanoue's convictions on Counts I and VI were later vacated by this court.  U.S. v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966 (1st Cir.1995).  The reversal stemmed from the government's violation of its discovery obligations.  The convictions were vacated with the intent that Lanoue would be retried.  Id. at 984.   Therefore, this court's previous decision is not an acquittal and does not suggest that any issue of fact was resolved in Lanoue's favor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Leavey conceded that actually he may have been connected to a fourth prosecution of Lanoue when he was Assistant Attorney General for the State of Rhode Island in the late 1970s</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> During plea negotiations the government offered Lanoue a chance to plead guilty to the charges that this court reversed, promising him a maximum ten-year sentence to run concurrently with the five-year sentence he is presently serving.  Because Lanoue is serving the five-year federal sentence concurrently with the 19-year state sentence, this offer subjected him to no additional jail time unless his state sentence was shortened to less than ten years.  Lanoue rejected this offer insisting on a five-year concurrent sentence for the reversed charges.  The government warned Lanoue that if he did not accept their offer they might prosecute him on the 15-year minimum, firearm possession charge.  Lanoue rejected their offer and the prosecutor followed through on his threat</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The district court allowed the prosecutor's memorandum to be incorporated as a \"substantive document of his actual testimony\" explaining his reasons for the instant prosecution.  Lanoue's counsel indicated that this arrangement was satisfactory as a means of establishing a factual record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The convictions reversed by this court were for conspiracy to commit various federal offenses and interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle.  Both of these crimes require the proof of several elements whereas &#167; 922(g)(1) only requires proof that Lanoue had previously been convicted of a felony, which he conceded, and that he possessed a firearm.  Additionally, the government was concerned that it would be collaterally estopped from presenting some of the proof it offered in the first trial because Lanoue was acquitted of three of the original charges</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

He was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island after a trial by jury.  He raises multiple issues including 1)improper venue, 2)double jeopardy, 3)collateral estoppel, 4)the right to have the attorney of his choosing, and 5)vindictive prosecution.  We have reviewed each assertion and affirm his conviction.I. Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Lanoue's 1994 prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue was prosecuted in the District of Rhode Island in 1994 for various crimes arising from the events that also gave rise to the present prosecution.  Evidence presented at Lanoue's 1994 trial demonstrated the following facts.  On the morning of December 23, 1993, Lanoue left his residence in Rhode Island and traveled to Bellingham, Massachusetts.  On the way he rendezvoused with Albert Cole, and they proceeded to Bellingham in a car that had been reported stolen.  These movements were the subject of a large scale surveillance operation that included at least three dozen FBI agents and members of the Rhode Island State Police.  Lanoue was arrested in Bellingham in a shopping center parking lot as he approached an unmarked armored car.  During the arrest Lanoue admitted to the arresting agents that he was carrying a .38 caliber handgun on his person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of that arrest Lanoue and two codefendants, Cole and Patrick Meade, were charged in a seven-count indictment by a grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island.  All three were charged in Count I with conspiracy to commit federal offenses, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371;  in Count II with conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951;  in Count III with attempt to interfere with commerce by robbery, Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951;  and in Count IV with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to an attempt or conspiracy to commit robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  Count V charged Lanoue and Cole with interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2312;  Count VI charged Lanoue and Meade with possessing firearms and ammunition in and affecting commerce, each having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1)(2);  and Count VII charged Lanoue alone with interstate transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k).  Counts III, IV and V also explicitly charged the defendants with aiding and abetting.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count VI was dismissed by the government because the defendants had been arrested in Massachusetts rather than Rhode Island and prosecutors anticipated problems with venue.  A redacted indictment was filed with leave of court on August 17, 1994 that designated the original Count VII as Count VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Lanoue of Counts I, V and VI and acquitted him of the robbery-related charges of Counts II, III, and IV.  His codefendants Cole and Meade were acquitted of all charges.  The court sentenced Lanoue to 175 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue appealed to this court, and it reversed his convictions on Counts I and VI after finding that the government had failed to disclose a taped conversation between Lanoue and a key witness, James Carron, in violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A) and the pre-trial discovery order.  See U.S. v. Lanoue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196477\"><a href=\"/opinion/196477/united-states-v-lanoue/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this reversal plea negotiations between the parties failed, and the government decided not to retry Lanoue for the same crimes.  Instead, another District of Rhode Island grand jury returned a one-count indictment against Lanoue charging him with the &#167; 922(g)(1) unlawful possession of a firearm charge that had been dismissed from the original indictment.  Conviction under &#167; 922(g)(1) carries a minimum 15-year mandatory sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Lanoue's second trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the sole count.  Lanoue was then sentenced to a 235-month prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Venue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue moved to dismiss the firearm possession charge for lack of venue and for a judgment of acquittal on grounds of improper venue.  The district court denied both motions.  Lanoue admits that the evidence proved that he possessed the firearm in Massachusetts but denies that the crime also occurred in Rhode Island where he was tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right to be tried in a proper venue.

Where the crime is a continuing crime and is \"committed in more than one district, [it] may be ... prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or completed.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3237(a).  To determine the locations of the continuing crime we must look to the key verbs of the statute in question.

First, the government offered the testimony of Lanoue from his first trial admitting that the firearm, a .38 caliber handgun, belonged to him, which indicates that he carried it from his home in Rhode Island to Massachusetts where he was arrested.  Second, the government offered the testimony of an FBI surveillance pilot who observed Lanoue in Rhode Island with a firearm on the day in question.  Third, evidence found at Lanoue's residence in Rhode Island included a gun cleaning kit used to clean a .38 caliber handgun.  This evidence was sufficient that a jury could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that Lanoue did knowingly possess a firearm in Rhode Island.  Venue was appropriate in Rhode Island under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), and the district court did not err in denying Lanoue's venue motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

U.S. v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195723\"><a href=\"/opinion/195723/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span>, 1342 (1st Cir.1994).  The essence of Lanoue's contention is that his earlier prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k) for transporting a weapon with an obliterated serial number and under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 for conspiracy made the current prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) duplicative.  He does not claim that either of these offenses alone requires proof of the same elements as &#167; 922(g)(1) but that his prosecution for these two offenses in conjunction created the basis for double jeopardy.  Lanoue asserts that because the prosecution offered evidence of each element of &#167; 922(g)(1) during his first trial, either in proving the conspiracy charge or in proving the obliterated serial number charge, it should be barred from now prosecuting him under &#167; 922(g)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue ignores that each offense must be considered separately.  The offense of obliterating a serial number is not the same as possession of a firearm by a convicted felon;  each offense requires an element of proof that the other does not.  The former requires that the serial number of the gun be removed, and the latter requires a previous conviction for a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.  Furthermore, although the conspiracy charge listed firearm possession as an overt act of the conspiracy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a conspiracy to commit a crime is not the same offense as the substantive crime for double jeopardy purposes.

Lanoue was acquitted of three charges in his first prosecution and convicted of three others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Of the charges on which Lanoue was acquitted only one has any relation to the issues presented in the present prosecution.  Count IV charged Lanoue with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to an attempt or conspiracy to commit robbery.  The jury could have acquitted Lanoue of this charge for several reasons.  Only if it acquitted Lanoue because it found that he did not use or carry a firearm would the acquittal operate to collaterally estop the present prosecution.  However, it is much more likely that the jury acquitted Lanoue of Count IV because it found that there was no attempt to commit robbery rather than because he carried no firearm.  Lanoue's conviction on Count VI, which charged him with interstate transportation of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, establishes that the jury found that Lanoue did in fact carry a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue has failed to demonstrate that any ultimate issue of fact was determined in his favor during his first trial that would preclude the present prosecution.

The Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes the right to have an attorney of one's own choosing;  however, this right is not absolute.  See Wheat v. U.S., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 159, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The reason for the disqualification was that Briody had represented Lanoue's codefendant, Cole, during the first trial.  Cole was acquitted of all charges.  The government told the district court that it might call Cole as a witness to testify on whether Lanoue possessed a firearm on December 23, 1993 and that a conflict of interest could arise if Briody had to cross-examine Cole.  Both Cole and Briody waived any right to conflict-free representation, and Cole submitted an affidavit that he did not know that Lanoue possessed a firearm on the day of his arrest and had no knowledge concerning whether Lanoue possessed a firearm at any time prior to his arrest.  The government offered no reason, other than the possibility that Cole might have known of the firearm, for calling him as a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review decisions to disqualify an attorney for conflict of interest for abuse of discretion.

If the attorney is allowed to continue and the conflict does arise then the defendant may not receive the representation to which he is entitled, resulting in an ineffective assistance of counsel appeal.  The Supreme Court has recognized the \"willingness of Courts of Appeals to entertain ineffective[ ] assistance claims from defendants who have specifically waived the right to conflict-free counsel.\"  Wheat 486 U.S. at 162, 108 S.Ct. at 1698-99.

Vindictive Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lanoue's most troubling assertion on appeal is that his prosecution under &#167; 922(g)(1) resulted from a vindictive motive on the part of Assistant United States Attorney James Leavey.  Leavey has prosecuted Lanoue on at least two other occasions before this trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The first resulted in an acquittal.  Out of the six counts prosecuted in the second trial Lanoue was acquitted of three and convicted of three.  On appeal this court reversed two of Lanoue's convictions after it found that Leavey had withheld evidence and violated his discovery obligations.  See Lanoue, 71 F.3d at 984.   Leavey decided not to retry Lanoue on those charges, instead prosecuting him on the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge, which he had previously decided to dismiss for lack of venue.  A conviction under &#167; 922(g) carries a minimum sentence of 15 years.  Lanoue is already serving a 19-year state sentence for violation of probation and a five-year federal sentence for his remaining conviction in the second prosecution.  He is 75 years old and suffers from angina pectoris.  The 235-month sentence he received in his second trial is substantially longer than the 175-month sentence he received in his first trial, which was reversed on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A vindictive prosecution, if proved, violates a defendant's Fifth Amendment right to due process.

See Bordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 365, 98 S.Ct. at 669.   Furthermore, even if Lanoue had raised a presumption of vindictiveness, the government adequately rebutted this presumption by presenting sufficient reasons for bringing the belated &#167; 922(g)(1) charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that generally where a defendant can point to specific facts that raise a likelihood of vindictiveness a district court must grant an evidentiary hearing on the issue.

Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520343\"><a href=\"/opinion/520343/united-states-v-alayne-b-adams-87-5388-mayo-l-coiner-87-5424/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>, 1146 (6th Cir.1989) (where criminal defendant presents evidence of vindictive prosecution, defendant is entitled to evidentiary hearing and discovery to permit her to develop defense);  U.S. v. Napue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498408\"><a href=\"/opinion/498408/united-states-v-irving-l-napue/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>, 1329 (7th Cir.1987)(\"to obtain an evidentiary hearing ... a defendant must make a prima facie case based on facts sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the prosecutor's purpose\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the district court held the equivalent of an evidentiary hearing.  It heard Lanoue's counsel on the issue, and it allowed the government to proceed by proffer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The memorandum of each party was incorporated into the record of the case.  After reviewing these memoranda, we find that they contain sufficient information that allowed the court to properly dismiss Lanoue's motion.  In its memorandum the government candidly explained the reasons it prosecuted Lanoue under the firearm possession charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most important reason offered by the prosecutor was that he had new evidence on the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge that was unavailable when he originally dismissed it.  See U.S. v. Fiel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678523\"><a href=\"/opinion/678523/united-states-v-ronald-allyn-fiel-united-states-of-america-v-todd-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, 1008 (4th Cir.1994) (\"Where the change in the indictment is prompted 'by newly discovered evidence supporting the imposition of additional counts ... a presumption of vindictiveness is not warranted.' \")  (quoting U.S. v. Bryant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457553\"><a href=\"/opinion/457553/united-states-v-barry-f-bryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (5th Cir.1985)).  The &#167; 922(g)(1) charge was originally dismissed only because the government was concerned about venue.  Lanoue's testimony at his first trial, in which he admitted to owning the firearm, made the issue of venue immaterial.  The government initially did not prosecute Lanoue on the &#167; 922(g)(1) after it had the new evidence because Lanoue had been sentenced to 14 years, which it found to be a sufficient sentence for the crimes.  It was not until that 14-year sentence was reduced on appeal that the government considered going forth with its new evidence.  Second, the government explained that the &#167; 922(g)(1) charge was easy to prosecute.  Faced with the choice of retrying the two charges reversed by this court, which were more factually complex and would require extensive proof,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> or trying Lanoue for the relatively simple to prove firearm charge, it chose the latter.  Third, the government gave Lanoue the option to avoid prosecution under &#167; 922(g)(1) and the 15-year mandatory sentence it requires.  Lanoue refused this offer when he turned down the government's attempt to reach a plea agreement, knowing that a prosecution under &#167; 922(g)(1) might ensue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These reasons were presented to the district court in the government's memorandum and were made part of the record.  They are sufficient to overcome Lanoue's evidence that tended to show vindictiveness or a presumption thereof.  The district court did not err in refusing to dismiss the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM Lanoue's conviction of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count I of the original indictment charged the defendants with conspiracy to commit six different underlying federal offenses.  One of these was transporting firearms possessed by convicted felons.  The jury was instructed that it could find the defendants guilty of the charge alleged in Count I if it found them guilty of any one of the underlying overt acts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Lanoue's convictions on Counts I and VI were later vacated by this court.  U.S. v. Lanoue, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196477\"><a href=\"/opinion/196477/united-states-v-lanoue/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995).  The reversal stemmed from the government's violation of its discovery obligations.  The convictions were vacated with the intent that Lanoue would be retried.  Id. at 984.   Therefore, this court's previous decision is not an acquittal and does not suggest that any issue of fact was resolved in Lanoue's favor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Leavey conceded that actually he may have been connected to a fourth prosecution of Lanoue when he was Assistant Attorney General for the State of Rhode Island in the late 1970s</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> During plea negotiations the government offered Lanoue a chance to plead guilty to the charges that this court reversed, promising him a maximum ten-year sentence to run concurrently with the five-year sentence he is presently serving.  Because Lanoue is serving the five-year federal sentence concurrently with the 19-year state sentence, this offer subjected him to no additional jail time unless his state sentence was shortened to less than ten years.  Lanoue rejected this offer insisting on a five-year concurrent sentence for the reversed charges.  The government warned Lanoue that if he did not accept their offer they might prosecute him on the 15-year minimum, firearm possession charge.  Lanoue rejected their offer and the prosecutor followed through on his threat</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The district court allowed the prosecutor's memorandum to be incorporated as a \"substantive document of his actual testimony\" explaining his reasons for the instant prosecution.  Lanoue's counsel indicated that this arrangement was satisfactory as a means of establishing a factual record</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The convictions reversed by this court were for conspiracy to commit various federal offenses and interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle.  Both of these crimes require the proof of several elements whereas &#167; 922(g)(1) only requires proof that Lanoue had previously been convicted of a felony, which he conceded, and that he possessed a firearm.  Additionally, the government was concerned that it would be collaterally estopped from presenting some of the proof it offered in the first trial because Lanoue was acquitted of three of the original charges</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
