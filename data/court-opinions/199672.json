Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                 Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                and Doumar, Senior District Judge.*\n\n\n\n     Edward C. Roy, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Gerard B.\nSullivan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n      *\n     Of   the    Eastern   District    of   Virginia,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\fOctober 1, 2001\n\n\n\n\n      -2-\n\f    PER CURIAM.    William Mott pled guilty to conspiracy to\n\n distribute cocaine base and aiding and abetting others to do\n\nthe same.    21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (1994); 18 U.S.C. § 2 (1994).\n\n    Mott appeals the decision of the District Court in its\n\n  application of the sentencing guidelines, arguing that the\n\n   Court erred when it:     1) established the amount of drugs\n\n   constituting relevant conduct; 2) increased Mott’s base\n\noffense level for use of a minor; and 3) denied Mott’s motion\n\nfor a downward departure.     For the reasons that follow, Mott’s\n\n                      sentence is affirmed.\n\nMott allowed various drug dealers to use his apartment to sell\n\n drugs while he was accepting drugs in payment.     This was how\n\n   he obtained his drugs as he was an addict.     One of these\n\n dealers was a 17-year-old boy named Benjamin Wilson, who was\n\narrested inside Mott’s apartment; Mott claims that he did not\n\nknow Wilson was a minor.     Upon arresting Mott and Wilson, the\n\npolice found 9.46 grams of cocaine base under a chair occupied\n\nby Wilson.    Mott claims that these drugs should not have been\n\n     utilized to determine his sentence for conspiracy to\n\n  distribute because they were intended for his own personal\n\n                                use.\n\nMott’s presentence report calculated his sentence as follows:\n\n Mott received a base offense level of 28 based on the amount\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fof crack cocaine involved in both his offense conduct and his\n\n relevant conduct. Mott’s offense level was then increased by\n\n two because he allowed a juvenile to sell cocaine base from\n\nhis apartment. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(6). Mott then received\n\n   a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility,\n\n see U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), a two-level decrease for his minor\n\nrole in the offense, see U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b), and a two-level\n\n  safety valve reduction. See U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2. Thus, Mott’s\n\n  total adjusted offense level was 23, and, with a criminal\n\nhistory category of I, Mott’s guideline range of imprisonment\n\n was 46 to 57 months.      The Court ultimately sentenced Mott to\n\n              46 months.    Mott appeals his sentence.\n\n On appeal, challenges to a district court’s factual findings\n\nin connection with sentencing hearings are reviewed for clear\n\n error. United States v. Santos-Batista, 239 F.3d 16, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).    A district court must include in its drug weight\n\n calculations the drugs involved in any uncharged transaction\n\nthat was “part of the same course of conduct or common scheme\n\n  or plan” as the charged conduct.      U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(2).\n\n    Moreover, in the case of “jointly undertaken criminal\n\n   activity,” such as in the instant case, the defendant is\n\nresponsible at sentencing for “all reasonably foreseeable acts\n\n    and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f undertaken criminal activity . . . that occurred during the\n\ncommission of the offense of conviction.”      Id. § 1B1.3(1)(B).\n\nThe district court employs the “preponderance of the evidence”\n\n  standard in making its drug quantity and relevant conduct\n\n          findings.    Santos-Batista, 239 F.3d at 21.\n\nThe undisputed facts establish that, as part of the conspiracy\n\n   to sell cocaine base from Mott’s apartment, Mott allowed\n\n Wilson and other dealers to use his apartment in return for\n\nfree cocaine base. The parties also agree that, shortly before\n\n  the search, Wilson made a sale of cocaine base from Mott’s\n\n apartment, as charged in Count 7 of the indictment, to which\n\n Mott pled guilty. The district judge rejected, as a factual\n\nmatter, the argument that the cocaine under Wilson’s chair was\n\n  not for sale, but was for Mott’s personal use.      Thus, the\n\ncocaine seized from beneath Wilson’s chair in Mott’s apartment\n\nwas properly attributable to Mott, for purposes of sentencing,\n\n  as part of the underlying distribution conspiracy, and the\n\n   district court did not commit clear error in making this\n\n                      factual determination.\n\n Mott next argues that the district court erred in imposing a\n\n  two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.4 upon making a\n\n   factual determination that Mott involved a minor in the\n\n commission of his offense.    Mott first contends that he was\n\n\n                                -5-\n\funaware of Wilson’s age; second, he says that he did not “use\n\n   or attempt to use a minor.”         Again, the district court’s\n\ndecision in that regard is reviewed for clear error.         Santos-\n\n                    Batista, 239 F.3d at 21.\n\n   The provision at issue states: “If the defendant used or\n\n attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to\n\n  commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of, or\n\n  apprehension for, the offense, increase [the base offense\n\nlevel] by 2 levels.” U.S.S.G. § 3B1.4.         As to the first point,\n\n Mott’s contention that he did not know Wilson was a minor is\n\n irrelevant.   There is no scienter element in this guideline,\n\n and no Court has seen fit to read one in.         See United States\n\nv. Gonzalez, 2001 WL 946335, *2 (9th Cir. 2001); United States\n\n v. McClain, 252 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir. 2001).         As to the\n\n second point, the First Circuit has held that an enhancement\n\n under § 3B1.4 may be based on the relevant conduct principle\n\n that defendants are responsible for the foreseeable acts of\n\ntheir co-conspirators.   United States v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11,\n\n26-28 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that a defendant head of a drug\n\n    conspiracy who did not personally employ minors in the\n\n  conspiracy was nonetheless responsible for the reasonably\n\nforeseeable employment of minors by his co-conspirators).            It\n\n follows that under §1B1.3 of the sentencing guidelines, Mott\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f  is liable for his unindicted co-conspirators’ foreseeable\n\nactions to use the minor Wilson for the drug sales which form\n\n     the basis of the conspiracy.    There was an adequate\n\nevidentiary basis for the trial judge to conclude that the use\n\nof Wilson was foreseeable to Mott.   Mott was aware that Wilson\n\n    was selling drugs from the apartment and agreed to it.\n\n   Finally, Mott claims that the district court should have\n\ngranted his motion for a downward departure on the basis that\n\n    1) he was addicted to cocaine base at the time of the\n\n offenses; 2) he was victimized by higher-level drug dealers;\n\n3) his offense conduct constituted “aberrant behavior” because\n\n he had previously been law-abiding; and 4) he suffered from\n\n extraordinary physical, mental, and emotional conditions due\n\n  to his cocaine addiction. Mott contends that the district\n\n court therefore abused its discretion by denying his motion,\n\nand that the district court improperly believed that it lacked\n\n    the authority to grant the downward departure motion.\n\n It is well settled that “[a] district court’s discretionary\n\n refusal to depart downward is unreviewable unless the court\n\nbelieved it lacked the authority to do so.” Patrick, 248 F.3d\n\n at 28. A defendant must show more than an arguable ambiguity\n\n  in a district court’s ruling denying a downward departure\n\nmotion to establish that the court acted in the belief that it\n\n\n                              -7-\n\flacked authority to depart.   United States v. Deleon, 187 F.3d\n\n                   60, 69 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nIn the present case, Mott does not even point to any ambiguity\n\nin the district court’s ruling. Nor could he. In the words of\n\n              the district court at sentencing:\n\n   I don’t believe you qualify for a downward departure. You\n    certainly have accepted responsibility, I have no way of\n knowing how sincere or genuine your acceptance is, but I take\n you at your word. You’ve accepted responsibility, and you got\n   credit for that. You had a relatively minor role in these\n offense [sic], and you got credit for that, too. You have had\n a good record up until now, but that doesn’t entitle you to a\n  downward departure. I don’t think your case is sufficiently\n  outside the heartland. It’s not sufficiently different from\nother cases like that that would warrant a downward departure.\n\n                   Sentencing Tran. 31-32.\n\nThe instant case is indistinguishable from Patrick, where the\n\nFirst Circuit affirmed a district court’s denial of a downward\n\n  departure motion where “the district court, exercising its\n\n discretion, found it inappropriate to depart because Patrick\n\nhad not identified any factors that took his case outside the\n\n           ‘heartland.’ ” Patrick, 248 F.3d. at 28.\n\n In sum, there is nothing in the district court’s explanation\n\n   for its denial of Mott’s downward departure motion that\n\nsuggests the district court thought or believed it lacked the\n\n   authority to depart. Consequently, this Court is without\n\n    authority to review the district court’s denial of the\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fdownward departure motion, and Mott’s appeal may not be\n\n               sustained on this basis.\n\n                       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                          -9-\n\f",

It’s not sufficiently different from\nother cases like that that would warrant a downward departure.\n\n                   Sentencing Tran. 31-32.\n\nThe instant case is indistinguishable from Patrick, where the\n\nFirst Circuit affirmed a district court’s denial of a downward\n\n  departure motion where “the district court, exercising its\n\n discretion, found it inappropriate to depart because Patrick\n\nhad not identified any factors that took his case outside the\n\n           ‘heartland.’ ” Patrick, 248 F.3d. at 28.\n\n In sum, there is nothing in the district court’s explanation\n\n   for its denial of Mott’s downward departure motion that\n\nsuggests the district court thought or believed it lacked the\n\n   authority to depart. Consequently, this Court is without\n\n    authority to review the district court’s denial of the\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fdownward departure motion, and Mott’s appeal may not be\n\n               sustained on this basis.\n\n                       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                          -9-\n\f</pre>",
