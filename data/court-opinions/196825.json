Stern,  United  States  Attorney,  Donald  L.  Cabell,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Pro se  petitioner David Malgeri  appeals a\r                                    \r\n\ndistrict  court order that summarily denied his motion to set\r\n\naside his  conviction and withdraw  his guilty plea  under 28\r\n\nU.S.C.   2255.   Malgeri pled  guilty to attempting to  rob a\r\n\nfederally  insured  bank in  violation  of  18 U.S.C.      2,\r\n\n2113(a),  and to  using  and carrying  a firearm  during that\r\n\nattempt in violation of 18 U.S.C.   924(c).  He contends that\r\n\nhis plea was not knowing  and voluntary because the  district\r\n\ncourt  failed to  warn him  about supervised release  and its\r\n\neffect  during his Rule 11 hearing.  In an apparent effort to\r\n\ndistinguish  this case  from United  States v.  Timmreck, 441\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 780 (1979)(holding that    2255 relief was not available\r\n\nto a prisoner who  alleged that the district court  failed to\r\n\nadvise him of a mandatory special parole term in violation of\r\n\nRule  11),  Malgeri  avers  that  he  was  wholly unaware  of\r\n\nsupervised  release  and  its  effect  throughout the  entire\r\n\ndistrict  court proceedings and  that he would  not have pled\r\n\nguilty had he been advised of supervised release.\r\n\n     Relying on Timmreck, the  district court concluded  that\r                                    \r\n\nMalgeri failed to state a cognizable habeas claim.  We agree.\r\n\nWe reject Malgeri's contention  that the district court erred\r\n\nin holding  that he  had  failed to  allege a  constitutional\r\n\nerror.  Malgeri cannot convert  a technical Rule 11 violation\r\n\ninto a  constitutional error simply  by averring that  he was\r\n\notherwise unaware  of supervised  release and would  not have\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npled guilty had he been so aware.  See, e.g., Lucas v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates,  963 F.2d 8, 12-15  (2d Cir. 1992);  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHolloway,  960 F.2d  1348,  1352-54 (8th  Cir. 1992);  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. DeLuca, 889 F.2d 503, 507-08 (3d Cir. 1989).1\r                                                                  1\r                            \r\n\n     Malgeri also argues  that he is entitled  to relief from\r\n\nhis firearm  conviction   because he did not \"use\"  a firearm\r\n\nas that term is construed in Bailey v. United States, 116  S.\r                                                                \r\n\nCt.  501  (1995).     The  record  discloses  that  Malgeri's\r\n\nconviction is fully supportable on the ground that he carried\r\n\nthe firearm.   See United States  v. Ramirez-Ferrer, 82  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1149,  1152 (1st Cir.  1996). Thus, Bailey  provides no basis\r                                                      \r\n\nfor relief.\r\n\n     In view  of the foregoing, the judgment  of the district\r\n\ncourt is summarily affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Malgeri also  claims that  he was prejudiced  because the\r               1\r\nplea  colloquy misled him to believe  that his sentence would\r\nnot exceed the 93-101  month guideline sentencing range (GSR)\r\nthat  the prosecutor  identified in  response to  the court's\r\nquestioning.  The record  refutes this  claim.   Malgeri pled\r\nguilty pursuant  to  an open  plea  agreement that  left  his\r\nsentence  entirely within  the court's discretion  within the\r\nstatutory maximum available under  the law.  Malgeri affirmed\r\nthat  he had not been  promised a particular  sentence at the\r\nRule  11  hearing.  The  court's  questions   concerning  the\r\napplicable GSR  in no way  imported a promise  that Malgeri's\r\nsentence  would not exceed that range.  Thus, Malgeri was not\r\nprejudiced by the plea colloquy. \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
