Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          We recount  only those  facts necessary to  resolve the\r\n\ninstant appeals.  On  January 25, 1995,  a grand jury returned  a\r\n\nthree-count indictment against the defendants, charging them with\r\n\naiding and  abetting  each other  in attempting  to possess  with\r\n\nintent  to  distribute  narcotics   in  violation  of  21  U.S.C.\r\n\n   841(a)(1),  943 and 18  U.S.C.    2; aiding and  abetting each\r\n\nother in attempting to import narcotics into the United States in\r\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.     952(a),  963 and 18  U.S.C.    2; and\r\n\naiding and abetting each other  in attempting to possess on board\r\n\na vessel of the United States with intent to distribute narcotics\r\nin violation of 46 U.S.C. App.   1903(a), (b)(2)(c), (f), (j) and\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   2.\r\n\n          At  trial, the government  elicited testimony from U.S.\r\n\nCustoms Service  air interdiction  officers who were  assigned to\r\n\nthree aircraft operating  off the southeast coast of  Puerto Rico\r\n\non the  night of January 4,  1995, and the morning  of January 5,\r\n\n1995.  The officers were investigating what was perceived to be a\r\n\nsuspicious  aircraft flying  with its  lights  off and  without a\r\n\nflight  plan  from  South  America  toward  Puerto   Rico.    The\r\n\ngovernment s  first witness  was  Leslie Robb,  who operated  the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nradar and Forward Looking Infrared camera ( FLIR )1 on one of the\r\n\naircraft,  Omaha 42.    Robb testified  that  after circling  for\r\n\nnearly forty  minutes, the  suspicious  aircraft dropped  several\r\nobjects into the water at 12:39 a.m. at a point approximately six\r\n\nmiles off the  coast of Patillas, Puerto Rico.  The splashes were\r\n\ncaptured  on a videotape of Omaha  42's FLIR, which was submitted\r\n\nto the jury as  evidence along with videotapes of  the FLIRs from\r\n\nthe  other  two aircraft.    The  videotapes included  the  radio\r\n\ncommunications among the air  interdiction officers and other law\r\n\nenforcement  personnel that  occurred contemporaneously  with the\r\n\nimages  produced  by  the  FLIRs.    These  radio  communications\r\n\nrevealed that  immediately before the airdrop  occurred, a vessel\r\n\nwas seen  flashing its  lights in  the area  near the  suspicious\r\n\naircraft, and that the aircraft which had turned its lights on at\r\n\nsome point before the airdrop turned them off shortly thereafter.\r\n\n          The government s  second witness, Raul  Antonio Rivera-\r\nCalleja  ( Rivera ), operated  the radar  and FLIR  systems on  a\r\n\nsecond  plane, Omaha 02,  which began looking  for marine targets\r\n\nafter the  airdrop  had occurred.   At  approximately 1:04  a.m.,\r\n\nRivera acquired  a vessel on  radar approximately two  miles from\r\n\nthe  site of  the airdrop.   This  target was  the only  one that\r\n\nRivera was able to locate  on his radar, which covered a  twenty-\r\n\nfive-mile  radius around  the  aircraft.   Rivera testified  that\r\n\nafter he had located the vessel on radar, his fellow crew members\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The FLIR produces video  images of objects based on the amount\r\nof  heat they emit.   The FLIR  can be integrated  with a plane s\r\nradar system to provide images of targets found on radar.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ninformed him that they saw no lights on the surface of the water,\r\n\nand that the vessel s navigation  lights had to have been  turned\r\n\noff.  Rivera  further testified that shortly after  acquiring the\r\nvessel on  radar, his  FLIR showed  two objects  floating in  the\r\n\nwater approximately twenty feet from the rear of the vessel.\r\n\n          The government s next witness, David  Cruciger, was the\r\n\npilot  in command of  Omaha 02.   Cruciger offered  the following\r\n\ndescription of the airdrop on direct examination:\r\n\n          Once again while flying  in this pattern,  we\r\n          received  information from  Omaha  42 that  a\r\n          drop  was  taking place  and  that they  were\r\n          seeing the splashes.   Chris Thorton [the co-\r\n          pilot aboard  Omaha 02] said  it, directed my\r\n          attention  out the  right-hand window  of the\r\n          aircraft.   I banked  the aircraft over  so I\r\n          could see out in that direction; and with the\r\n          aircraft banked, I  could see  down into  the\r\n          water a flashing light.   It was described by\r\n          Omaha 42.  As we watched the light, I saw  an\r\n          aircraft or what I believed to be an aircraft\r\n          turn on its navigation recognition lights and\r\n          fly at low altitude over the lights that were\r\n          flashing in the water.\r\nWhen  asked  during cross-examination  whether  he  had seen  the\r\n\nlights  before  the  drop   occurred,  Cruciger  stated  that  he\r\n\n believe[d] it was during the drop. \r\n\n          The government s fourth  witness, John Alpers, operated\r\n\nthe  radar and  FLIR  system on  the  third  aircraft, Omaha  38.\r\n\nAlpers testified that he located a vessel -- the same one next to\r\n\nwhich Rivera s  FLIR would later  detect two objects  floating in\r\n\nthe  water -- on radar at approximately 12:45 a.m., approximately\r\n\ntwo miles  from the site of  the airdrop, and that,  according to\r\n\nthe co-pilot  aboard Omaha 38,  all of  the vessel s lights  were\r\n\nout.  Alpers also testified  that although he located one  object\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\non  his radar that he believed to be  a reef, he located no other\r\n\nvessels on his twenty-five-mile radar.\r\n\n          The  government s witnesses  testified that  the vessel\r\nremained stationary from the time Alpers acquired it on his  FLIR\r\n\nat 12:54  a.m., approximately  three miles from  the site  of the\r\n\nairdrop, until a coast  guard helicopter arrived at approximately\r\n\n1:13  a.m.  and  shined a  bright  light  on  it.   They  further\r\n\ntestified that the  vessel began to  move toward shore after  the\r\n\ncoast guard  helicopter illuminated  it, and that  the defendants\r\n\nwere found  aboard the vessel  when it arrived on  shore and were\r\n\npromptly arrested.   Although no contraband was  found aboard the\r\n\ndefendants  vessel, the government introduced into  evidence four\r\n\nbales of  cocaine that were  found floating  in the water  in the\r\n\nvicinity  of  the  drop  site.   The  first  bale  was  found  at\r\n\napproximately 2:00 a.m.  on January 5, 1996, and  three more were\r\n\nfound at approximately 1:30 p.m. the same day  tied together with\r\nrope  of a  type found  on the  defendants  vessel.   Two  of the\r\n\ngovernment s  witnesses speculated  that, following  the airdrop,\r\n\nthe defendants had gathered the three bales that were found  tied\r\n\ntogether and, rather than bringing  the bales aboard, placed them\r\n\nin tow so as to facilitate disposal in the  event the defendants \r\n\nscheme was discovered.\r\n\n          The government also introduced into evidence a business\r\n\ncard found  in  defendant  Rivera-Santiago s  wallet,  which  was\r\n\ndiscovered  in  his  car,  bearing  the  coordinates  of  a  spot\r\n\napproximately seven miles away  from the site of the airdrop.  In\r\n\naddition, the government s  witnesses testified  that they  found\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ndefendant  Alamo-Silva s  Toyota  4-Runner  at  his  girlfriend s\r\n\nhouse, which  was accessible via a  pathway to the beach  and was\r\n\nlocated approximately one-quarter  of a mile away from  the point\r\nwhere the defendants arrived  on shore.  The keys to the 4-Runner\r\n\nwere found in the vehicle, which  was parked with its back to the\r\n\nwater and its rear seats folded down.   Finally, the government s\r\n\nevidence indicated  that the  registration number painted  on the\r\n\nback of  the vessel  on which  the defendants  were found,  which\r\n\nbelonged to  defendant Rivera-Santiago,  differed by two  letters\r\n\nfrom the number  under which the vessel had  been registered with\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.2\r\n\n          The defendants contended that  they were out fishing on\r\n\nthe night  of the  airdrop and  were simply  caught in  the wrong\r\n\nplace  at the  wrong time.   They  elicited testimony  concerning\r\n\nother vessels that might have been in the area at the time of the\r\n\nairdrop but were not detected on radar, including  a vessel found\r\nabandoned  on  shore on  the  morning of  January  5, 1995,  that\r\n\ncontained marijuana residue.  Rivera-Santiago testified that  his\r\n\nvessel  was operating without  navigation lights on  the night in\r\n\nquestion because the vessel s built-in navigation lights had been\r\n\ndamaged  on a previous occasion and  because he had stopped using\r\n\nthe portable navigation light he  had recently purchased for  the\r\n\nboat.  He explained that  the portable navigation light  wouldn t\r\n\nstay  fixed for  a long  time,  would  fall every  time the  boat\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   The boat  was registered under  registration number PR0645BB,\r\nbut bore the number PR0645DD.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\njumped, and  didn t work. 3  His testimony also indicated that he\r\n\nbegan fixing  one of  the engines  on the  boat at  approximately\r\n\n11:00 p.m. with only the aid of a flashlight, and that the vessel\r\nwas  already moving when  the coast  guard helicopter  arrived at\r\n\n1:13 a.m.  Finally,  the defendants elicited testimony concerning\r\n\nthe maximum speed of Rivera-Santiago s vessel, suggesting that it\r\n\nmight have been difficult for the boat to retrieve at least three\r\n\nbales  of cocaine  and  travel approximately  two  miles, as  the\r\n\ngovernment s evidence  suggested, during the  six-minute interval\r\n\nbetween  the  airdrop  and   the  time  Alpers  detected  Rivera-\r\n\nSantiago s vessel on radar.   They also argued this point to  the\r\n\njury.4\r\n\n          The jury  began deliberating  late in the  afternoon on\r\n\nApril 10, 1995, and, at 7:50 p.m. the following day, informed the\r\n\ntrial judge that  it was unable to reach a  verdict but wanted to\r\n\ncome back the next day to  continue its deliberations.  The  next\r\nmorning, the jury submitted the following message to the court:\r\n\n          We wish to obtain the following   information\r\nfrom the transcription notes to clarify some doubts:\r\n\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n3  During  the government s rebuttal,  the law enforcement  agent\r\nwho impounded  and operated the vessel  following the defendants \r\narrest  testified  that he  had  no  trouble  using the  portable\r\nnavigation light.\r\n\n4    Counsel  for  defendant Alamo-Silva  argued  during  closing\r\nargument that Rivera-Santiago s  vessel remained stationary  from\r\n12:45  a.m. until approximately 1:13 a.m.  However, our review of\r\nthe  record indicates,  and the  defendants   brief acknowledges,\r\nthat Alpers acquired the vessel on  radar approximately two miles\r\nfrom the site  of the airdrop at 12:45 a.m.,  and that he located\r\nthe vessel on his FLIR approximately three miles from the airdrop\r\nat 12:54 a.m., by which time the vessel had stopped moving.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n            1.  The  first time  the suspect  air craft\r\n                was detected  in the fishing  area (the\r\n                hour)\r\n\n            2.  The time of the air drop\r\n            3.  The time  the suspect  vessel was\r\n                detected in the fishing area\r\n\n            4.  If   there   were  any   sign  of\r\n                flashing lights  from the suspect\r\n                aircraft and suspect vessel.\r\n\nAfter  trial  counsel  for defendant  Alamo-Silva  unsuccessfully\r\n\nargued that  providing  answers to  any of  the jury s  questions\r\n\nwould invade the province  of the jury, the parties and the court\r\n\nagreed  on  the  responses to  the  first  three  questions.   In\r\n\nresponse to the fourth question, and at the government s request,\r\n\nthe trial  judge elected to read  back to the jury  part of David\r\n\nCruciger s testimony.   This decision came over the  objection of\r\n\ncounsel for each of the defendants.  Noting that Cruciger was the\r\n\nonly witness who testified that  he saw flashing lights,5 defense\r\ncounsel asked that  testimony from the witnesses who  did not see\r\n\nflashing lights be read into evidence, and further argued that it\r\n\nwas not clear what the jury meant by  suspect vessel. \r\n\n          The trial judge addressed the jury as follows:\r\n\n          I have your four questions.  Let  me say that\r\n          the answer to two  of your questions you have\r\n          to  see  the  [videotape  of  the]  FLIR; you\r\n          should see the FLIR.  But I m going to answer\r\n          two  questions.    The  first  -- your  first\r\n          question  is  the   first  time  the  suspect\r\n\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n5  Although  the audio  portion of the  FLIR videotapes  contains\r\nreferences to flashing lights from sea level and to a temporarily\r\nilluminated light on the suspect aircraft, Cruciger was  the only\r\nwitness  to testify  at  trial that  he  saw lights  from  either\r\nsource.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          aircraft  was detected  in the  fishing area,\r\n          the hour.  That you may look into the FLIRs.\r\n\n            Then  the  time  of the  airdrops,  there s\r\n          stipulation that it s 12:39 a.m., 12:39 a.m.,\r\n          time of the airdrop.\r\n            The  third question,  the time  the suspect\r\n          vessel was detected in the fishing area, that\r\n          you have to  look it  up in the  -- from  the\r\n          FLIR tapes.\r\n\n            Fourth -- I m going to answer that question\r\n          now -- if there --  if there were any sign of\r\n          flashing lights from the suspect aircraft and\r\n          the suspect vessel, I m going to read you the\r\n          testimony   of   David  Cruciger.      Listen\r\n          carefully. [The court reporter then read back\r\n          the    following   portion    of   Cruciger s\r\n          testimony.]:\r\n\n            Once again while  flying in this pattern,\r\n            we  received  information  from  Omaha 42\r\n            that  a drop  was taking  place  and that\r\n            they  were seeing  the  splashes.   Chris\r\n            Thorton,   Officer   Thorton   said   it,\r\n            directed my attention  out the right-hand\r\n            window  of the  aircraft.   I  banked the\r\n            aircraft over so I  could see out in that\r\n            direction; and with the  aircraft banked,\r\n            I  could   see  down  into  the  water  a\r                      flashing  light.    It was  described  by\r\n            Omaha 42.  As we watched the light, I saw\r\n            an aircraft  or what I believed  to be an\r\n            aircraft    turn   on    its   navigation\r\n            recognition   lights  and   fly   at  low\r\n            altitude  over   the  lights   that  were\r\n            flashing in the water.\r\n\n          [The trial  judge continued.]    Okay.   Very\r\n          well.  You may go back to your deliberations.\r\n\n          The   jury  returned   guilty   verdicts  against   the\r\n\ndefendants on all counts approximately  two hours after the trial\r\n\njudge answered  its questions,  apparently having eaten  lunch in\r\n\nthe interim.  Defendant Alamo-Silva  was sentenced to prison  for\r\n\n295 months.   Defendant  Rivera-Santiago was sentenced  to prison\r\n\nfor life.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n                         II.  Discussion\r                                   II.

We have previously\r\n\nnoted that  [u]ndeniably inherent in the constitutional guarantee\r\n\nof trial by  jury is the principle  that a court may  not step in\r\n\nand  direct  a  finding  of  contested  fact  in  favor  of   the\r\n\nprosecution  regardless  of how  overwhelmingly the evidence  may\r\n\npoint in that  direction.

Argentine, 814 F.2d at 787-\r                                                         \r\n\n88.\r\n\n          Our  analysis of the trial judge s answer to the jury s\r\nfourth  question in the  context of the  evidence elicited during\r\n\nthe course  of the  trial compels us  to conclude that  the trial\r\n\njudge usurped  the  jury s factfinding  role  as to  the  subject\r\n\nmatter  of  that  question,  and,  in  so   doing,  deprived  the\r\n\ndefendants  of their right  to trial by  jury.  In  reaching this\r\n\nconclusion, we  note that  two of  the  vices   we identified  in\r\n\nArgentine  are not present here.   First, the trial judge did not\r                   \r\n\nexpressly represent that the parties  had reached an agreement as\r\n\nto  the subject matter  of the  jury s question.   Second, rather\r\n\nthan   presenting  his   answer   to  the   jury s  question   as\r\n\n accomplished fact,  the  trial judge informed the  jury that the\r\n\nevidence  he was  recounting was  the  testimony of  a particular\r\n\nwitness.   See id. at 787.  However, it  is evident from a review\r                            \r\nof the record that the  substance of the court s answer  together\r\n\nwith the context in which it was delivered brought about the same\r\n\nprohibited result that we found in Argentine for three reasons.\r                                                      \r\n\n          First,  the  trial  judge   selected  only  a  part  of\r\n\nCruciger s  testimony given on  direct examination to  be read in\r\n\nresponse  to the jury s  question and,  in so  doing, necessarily\r\n\nsuggested to  the jury  that this  testimony would  provide  the \r\n\nanswer to the jury s question.  This suggestion had the effect of\r\n\nboth encouraging  the jury  to believe Cruciger  and discouraging\r\n\nthe jury  from  considering and  possibly  crediting  alternative\r\n\naccounts of  the  events surrounding  the  airdrop.   The  record\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ncontains   evidence   that   was  inconsistent   with,   if   not\r\n\ncontradictory to, Cruciger s assertion that he saw an exchange of\r\n\nlights  during the airdrop between the suspicious aircraft and an\r\nobject in the water.   For example,  Cruciger s testimony was  at\r\n\nodds with Rivera-Santiago s assertions that his vessel s built-in\r\n\nnavigation lights were not working and that he  had stopped using\r\n\nthe portable navigation light that he had recently purchased.  In\r\n\naddition, Cruciger testified on  direct examination that he began\r\n\nlooking for  flashes of  light from sea  level after  the suspect\r                                                              \r\n\naircraft had  begun  dropping objects  into  the water  and  then\r\n\nstated on cross-examination that he believed he saw lights during\r\n\nthe airdrop.    However,  the  audio  portion  of  the  videotape\r\n\nindicates  that  unidentified  air interdiction  officers  viewed\r\n\nflashing lights before any objects  were dropped, and contains no\r                                \r\n\nmention of lights from sea level during or after the airdrop.  At\r\n\na minimum,  these inconsistencies  raise questions about  when or\r\nwhether Cruciger  saw flashing lights from  sea level and,  if he\r\n\nsaw  lights, whether  those  lights came  from  Rivera-Santiago s\r\n\nvessel or from another vessel.\r\n\n          Second, the context  in which the trial  judge gave his\r\n\nresponse to the jury s fourth question had the  effect of placing\r\n\nhis  imprimatur  on  the  facts  contained  in  that  portion  of\r\n\nCruciger s  testimony  that  was  read  to   the  jury.    It  is\r\n\nsignificant that the jury was posing questions in order to obtain\r\n\ninformation  from  the  record   to  clarify  some doubts.     In\r\n\nanswering  the  first three  questions,  the  trial judge  either\r\n\nprovided  an unequivocal statement  of fact to  which the parties\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nhad stipulated (question no. 2) or directed  the jury to the FLIR\r\n\nvideotapes where  the answer  to their  questions could  be found\r\n\n(question nos.  1 &amp;  3).   However, in  responding to  the jury s\r\nfourth question the trial  judge began by  stating  I m going  to\r\n\nanswer  that  question now,   and  then  had part  of  Cruciger s\r\n\ntestimony read.   The net effect of what the  trial judge did was\r\n\nto  focus  the  jury s  attention  on  only  part  of  Cruciger s\r\n\ntestimony concerning flashing lights and away from other evidence\r\n\ngiven by Cruciger and others that was relevant to a resolution of\r\n\nthe doubts the jury expressed in its note about  the existence of\r\n\nflashing lights from the air and from sea level.\r\n\n          Finally, by referring the jury to Cruciger s testimony,\r\n\nthe trial judge suggested  to the jury that the   suspect vessel \r\n\n(the term used in the jury s question and throughout the trial to\r\n\ndescribe the  boat on which  the defendants were found),  and not\r\n\nanother vessel, was the source of the light that Cruciger claimed\r\nto  have  seen.   Although,  as noted  above,  Rivera and  Alpers\r\n\ntestified  that Rivera-Santiago s  vessel was  the only  one that\r\n\nshowed  up on radar  at the time  of the airdrop,  the defendants\r\n\npresented evidence  suggesting that  there were other  vessels in\r\n\nthe area.  The trial judge s answer to the  question confirmed an\r\n\nassumption inherent in the jury s question, i.e., that the vessel\r\n\nseen  flashing its  lights  was the  same   suspect vessel   that\r\n\nAlpers picked up on radar six minutes after the airdrop  occurred\r\n\nand approximately two miles away.\r\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons, we conclude  that the trial\r\n\njudge s  response  to  the  jury s fourth  question  invaded  the\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nprovince of  the jury.6  We  must next turn our  attention to the\r\n\nquestion  of whether  the district  court s error  can be  termed\r\n\n harmless.   As we noted in  Argentine, in cases involving errors\r                                                \r\nof constitutional dimension the harmless-error inquiry focuses on\r\n\nthe existence of a reasonable possibility that the error at issue\r\n\ninfluenced the jury in reaching the verdict.  Argentine, 814 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 789 (citing Fahy v.  Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87  (1963)).\r                                             \r\n\nPhrased  another   way,  we   must  now  determine   whether  the\r\n\nconstitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 789; see also Sullivan v.

Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45, 60 n.22 (1st Cir. 1995).7\r                     \r\n\n          As we have previously noted, the jury in its message to\r\n\nthe trial  judge sought specific factual  information  to clarify\r\n\nsome  doubts.    Therefore,  we  can  reasonably  infer from  the\r\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n6   While trial judges have discretion  as to the manner in which\r\nthey  respond to  questions from  a jury,  great caution  must be\r\nexercised  when a  jury asks  a  factual question  concerning the\r\nevidence in a case.  In view of the evidence presented during the\r\ntrial of this\r\ncase, an appropriate response to  the jury s question would  have\r\nbeen  an instruction  to  the  jury that  it  must  take its  own\r\nrecollection of the evidence.  See, e.g., Aubin,  961 F.2d at 983\r                                                         \r\n(trial judge did not abuse discretion where, in response to\r\nfactual question, he instructed  the jury that as finder  of fact\r\nit  was  its responsibility  to  weigh  and interpret  evidence);\r\nUnited States  v. Hyson, 721  F.2d 856,  865 (1st Cir.  1983) (no\r                                 \r\nabuse of discretion where, in response to factual question, judge\r\ndeclined to reread relevant testimony and instructed jury to make\r\nfindings based on its recollection of the evidence).\r\n\n7  The defendants  do not contend that the district court s error\r\nfalls  into the  narrow category  of constitutional  defects that\r\nforeclose all harmless error review.   See Arizona v. Fulminante,\r                                                                          \r\n499 U.S. 279, 306-12  (1991) (distinguishing between trial errors\r\nthat abridge  defendant s  constitutional rights  and  structural\r\ndefects affecting framework in which trial proceeds).\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\ncontext in which the jury asked the  fourth question that some or\r\n\nall of the jurors, after deliberating  for a little more than one\r\n\nday, entertained   some doubts   about the existence  of flashing\r\nlights  from the  suspect  aircraft  and  suspect  vessel.   That\r\n\nthe  jury had  doubts about  this  issue is  significant for  two\r\n\nreasons.    First, the  existence  or  non-existence of  flashing\r\n\nlights,  their  location,  their  source, and  their  timing  are\r\n\nmatters  that  were central  both  to  the government s  and  the\r\n\ndefendants  theories of the case.\r\n\n          Second, the manner in which the trial  judge culled the\r\n\nevidence  effectively determined  the outcome  of how  the jurors\r\n\nwould resolve  their doubts since they were directed to only part\r\n\nof  the  evidence  concerning  lights  (i.e.,  a portion  of  the\r\n\ntestimony of  the only witness  who testified that he saw lights)\r\n\ninstead  of being  instructed to  consider and  weigh all  of the\r\n\nevidence  relating  to  that  issue  adduced  at   trial.8    The\r\ndefendants  were entitled to  have their  theory of the  case, as\r\n\ndeveloped through  their evidence,  presented to the  jury on  an\r\n\nequal footing with the government s theory of the case.  This did\r\n\nnot occur because the trial judge s response tipped the scales in\r\n\nfavor of the government s theory. \r\n\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n8  The  defendants, who contended  they were  out fishing on  the\r\nnight  in question,  adduced  evidence that  they were  operating\r\nwithout  navigation  lights  because  the  built-in  lights  were\r\npreviously damaged  and the  portable navigation light  would not\r\nstay  fixed, that it was not unusual  for fishermen to be without\r\nlights, that there were  other vessels in the area  including one\r\nfound  on  shore  with marijuana  residue  in  it,  and that  the\r\ngovernment s time  line, i.e.,  the six-minute span  within which\r\ncertain  events   were  supposed   to  have  occurred,   was  not\r\nreasonable.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          We  also note that the jury  had expressed to the trial\r\n\njudge an inability to reach a verdict the night before posing its\r\n\nquestions  and  arrived  at   guilty  verdicts  two  hours  after\r\nreceiving  the  answers,  raising  an inference  that  the  trial\r\n\njudge s  response  influenced  the   verdicts.    While  such  an\r\n\ninference  in and of itself is  not controlling in our evaluation\r\n\nof harmless error, it is a  factor that can be weighed along with\r\n\nother factors.\r\n\n          We  have considered  the  trial judge s  error and  its\r\n\neffects,  as previously discussed,  in the context  of the entire\r\n\ntrial   record.       The   government    presented   significant\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence  pointing   to  the  defendants   guilt.\r\n\nHowever,  under the  applicable standard  the verdicts  can stand\r\n\nonly if we  find that the error was harmless  beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.  We cannot make such  a finding.  The government s case as\r\n\nto  the  identity  of  the   suspect  vessel   required  a  close\r\ncalculating and comparing of times, coordinates, and distances, a\r\n\nprocess  that might well have been shortcircuited by injection of\r\n\nthe incriminating aspect of the  evidence as to flashing  lights.\r\n\nWe conclude  that in  view  of the  context in  which the  fourth\r\n\nquestion was asked, the significance of the issue  raised by that\r\n\nquestion to the outcome of the case, the response that was given,\r\n\nand  the  context in  which the  response was  given, there  is a\r\n\nreasonable  possibility that  the error  at issue  influenced the\r\n\njury  in reaching  its verdicts  in  this case.   Therefore,  the\r\n\nverdicts cannot stand.\r\n\n          B.  Evidentiary Issues\r                    B.

Both\r\n\nwitnesses  testified that  they had  extensive experience  as air\r\n\ninterdiction  officers with  the U.S.  Customs Service,  and were\r\n\ncompetent  to testify as to the  behavior of objects dropped from\r\nan airplane.   Further,  the testimony  was helpful  both to  the\r\n\njury s understanding  of the likelihood that  two objects dropped\r\n\nfrom an airplane would be close together after the airdrop and to\r\n\nthe  jury s  resolution  of   the  question  of  the  defendants \r\n\ninvolvement in the airdrop.10\r\n\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n10   We reject the  defendants  contention that  the testimony of\r\nRivera and Alpers,  which suggested  to the jury  that the  bales\r\nmight have been dumped overboard,  was impermissibly inconsistent\r\nwith the testimony from  other government witnesses who suggested\r\nthat the  bales had been tied  together and placed in  tow.  This\r\ninconsistency  is  not  grounds  for the  exclusion  of  relevant\r\nevidence, but, rather,  is a  matter properly to  be explored  on\r\ncross-examination and ultimately to be resolved by the jury.\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n          Nor do  we  find error  in the  admission of  Escobar s\r\n\nstatement concerning the  numbers painted on the  back of Rivera-\r\n\nSantiago s  vessel.  Escobar testified at trial that, in addition\r\nto  other  law  enforcement  experience,  he  had  worked  for  a\r\n\nsmuggling unit of the U.S. Marshals Service for two years, during\r\n\nwhich  time  he  had   been  involved  in  approximately  fifteen\r\n\nmissions.    As  such,  he  was  entitled  to  draw  on  his  law\r\n\nenforcement  experience in  conveying  opinion  testimony to  the\r\n\njury.   Further, his testimony concerning the significance of the\r\n\nincorrect  registration number  was  helpful to  the jury,  which\r\n\nmight  not  have  been  aware  of  the  existence  of  a  central\r\n\nregistration  system   for  sea  vessels  similar   to  that  for\r\n\nautomobiles.11\r\n\n          However, we do find error in the trial judge s decision\r\n\nto permit  Escobar to testify  that the coordinates found  on the\r\n\nback of the business card were  pretty close   to the coordinates\r\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n11   Although the defendants rely  on United States v.

Ct. 1986 (1995), to support their argument,\r                       \r\nwe believe that Montas is distinguishable from the instant case. \r                                \r\nIn  Montas,  a  federal  drug  enforcement  agent  who  had  been\r                    \r\nqualified as an expert  testified that in ninety-nine percent  of\r\nthe cases in  which he had  worked that involved  the seizure  of\r\ndrugs at an  airport, the passenger  involved had been  traveling\r\nunder a false name.  He  further testified that it was   obvious \r\nthat a passenger  trying to smuggle drugs would use  a false name\r\nto  avoid  detection.   Id.  at  784.    In  concluding that  the\r                                     \r\nadmission  of  this testimony  was  likely  beyond the  limit  of\r\nadmissibility, we noted the  danger of unfair prejudice resulting\r\nfrom the use of an expert witness to corroborate the government s\r\ncase.   Id.  at 786.    However, the  risk of  prejudice that  we\r                     \r\nidentified in Montas is  less severe where, as here,  the witness\r                              \r\nhas  not been qualified as  an expert.   Moreover, unlike Montas,\r                                                                           \r\nthe testimony at  issue in the  instant case does  not suggest  a\r\ndefinite correlation between a suspicious characteristic and  any\r\nillegal activity.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nof  the  airdrop  site.    Immediately  prior  to  offering  this\r\n\nconclusion,  Escobar testified  that he  did not  understand what\r\n\nsome of the numbers  on the business card meant  and acknowledged\r\nthat he was   not an  expert in coordinates.    In addition,  his\r\n\ntestimony  that the coordinates  were  pretty  close  represented\r\n\nonly his characterization of the distance between the two points.\r\n\nAs  presented,  the  witness s testimony  lacked  an  appropriate\r\n\nfoundation and his conclusion  was of little  aid to the jury  in\r\n\nunderstanding the evidence.\r\n\n          The defendants  also challenge as  unfairly prejudicial\r\n\nand without foundation  the testimony of a  U.S. drug enforcement\r\n\nagent,  who, not having  been qualified  as an expert,  stated on\r\n\ndirect examination that the street value  of the cocaine found at\r\n\nsea may  have exceeded  $18 million.   However, we  have recently\r\n\nstated  that  [t]here is little dispute that such information may\r\n\naid  in proving intent to distribute.    United States v.

In addition,  in this case the evidence  was relevant to\r\n\nbolster  the government s claim  that a  smuggler would  not drop\r\n\nvaluable property into the water  unless a specific target was in\r\n\nthe  area.   Finally,  as we  noted  in Rivera,   DEA agents  are\r                                                        \r\n\nespecially  qualified, and need  not be certified  as experts, to\r\n\ntestify  about street  value.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount only those facts necessary to resolve the instant appeals.  On January 25, 1995, a grand jury returned a three-count indictment against the defendants, charging them with aiding and abetting each other in attempting to possess with intent to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 943 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2;  aiding and abetting each other in attempting to import narcotics into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 952(a), 963 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2;  and aiding and abetting each other in attempting to possess on board a vessel of the United States with intent to distribute narcotics in violation of 46 U.S.C.App. &#167; 1903(a), (b)(2)(c), (f), (j) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government elicited testimony from U.S. Customs Service air interdiction officers who were assigned to three aircraft operating off the southeast coast of Puerto Rico on the night of January 4, 1995, and the morning of January 5, 1995.  The officers were investigating what was perceived to be a suspicious aircraft flying with its lights off and without a flight plan from South America toward Puerto Rico.  The government's first witness was Leslie Robb, who operated the radar and Forward Looking Infrared camera (\"FLIR\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on one of the aircraft, Omaha 42.  Robb testified that after circling for nearly forty minutes, the suspicious aircraft dropped several objects into the water at 12:39 a.m. at a point approximately six miles off the coast of Patillas, Puerto Rico.  The splashes were captured on a videotape of Omaha 42's FLIR, which was submitted to the jury as evidence along with videotapes of the FLIRs from the other two aircraft.  The videotapes included the radio communications among the air interdiction officers and other law enforcement personnel that occurred contemporaneously with the images produced by the FLIRs.  These radio communications revealed that immediately before the airdrop occurred, a vessel was seen flashing its lights in the area near the suspicious aircraft, and that the aircraft which had turned its lights on at some point before the airdrop turned them off shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's second witness, Raul Antonio Rivera-Calleja (\"Rivera\"), operated the radar and FLIR systems on a second plane, Omaha 02, which began looking for marine targets after the airdrop had occurred.  At approximately 1:04 a.m., Rivera acquired a vessel on radar approximately two miles from the site of the airdrop.  This target was the only one that Rivera was able to locate on his radar, which covered a twenty-five-mile radius around the aircraft.  Rivera testified that after he had located the vessel on radar, his fellow crew members informed him that they saw no lights on the surface of the water, and that the vessel's navigation lights had to have been turned off.  Rivera further testified that shortly after acquiring the vessel on radar, his FLIR showed two objects floating in the water approximately twenty feet from the rear of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's next witness, David Cruciger, was the pilot in command of Omaha 02.  Cruciger offered the following description of the airdrop on direct examination:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Once again while flying in this pattern, we received information from Omaha 42 that a drop was taking place and that they were seeing the splashes.  Chris Thorton [the co-pilot aboard Omaha 02] said it, directed my attention out the right-hand window of the aircraft.  I banked the aircraft over so I could see out in that direction;  and with the aircraft banked, I could see down into the water a flashing light.  It was described by Omaha 42.  As we watched the light, I saw an aircraft or what I believed to be an aircraft turn on its navigation recognition lights and fly at low altitude over the lights that were flashing in the water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked during cross-examination whether he had seen the lights before the drop occurred, Cruciger stated that he \"believe[d] it was during the drop.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's fourth witness, John Alpers, operated the radar and FLIR system on the third aircraft, Omaha 38.  Alpers testified that he located a vessel--the same one next to which Rivera's FLIR would later detect two objects floating in the water--on radar at approximately 12:45 a.m., approximately two miles from the site of the airdrop, and that, according to the co-pilot aboard Omaha 38, all of the vessel's lights were out.  Alpers also testified that although he located one object on his radar that he believed to be a reef, he located no other vessels on his twenty-five-mile radar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's witnesses testified that the vessel remained stationary from the time Alpers acquired it on his FLIR at 12:54 a.m., approximately three miles from the site of the airdrop, until a coast guard helicopter arrived at approximately 1:13 a.m. and shined a bright light on it.  They further testified that the vessel began to move toward shore after the coast guard helicopter illuminated it, and that the defendants were found aboard the vessel when it arrived on shore and were promptly arrested.  Although no contraband was found aboard the defendants' vessel, the government introduced into evidence four bales of cocaine that were found floating in the water in the vicinity of the drop site.  The first bale was found at approximately 2:00 a.m. on January 5, 1996, and three more were found at approximately 1:30 p.m. the same day tied together with rope of a type found on the defendants' vessel.  Two of the government's witnesses speculated that, following the airdrop, the defendants had gathered the three bales that were found tied together and, rather than bringing the bales aboard, placed them in tow so as to facilitate disposal in the event the defendants' scheme was discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also introduced into evidence a business card found in defendant Rivera-Santiago's wallet, which was discovered in his car, bearing the coordinates of a spot approximately seven miles away from the site of the airdrop.  In addition, the government's witnesses testified that they found defendant Alamo-Silva's Toyota 4-Runner at his girlfriend's house, which was accessible via a pathway to the beach and was located approximately one-quarter of a mile away from the point where the defendants arrived on shore.  The keys to the 4-Runner were found in the vehicle, which was parked with its back to the water and its rear seats folded down.  Finally, the government's evidence indicated that the registration number painted on the back of the vessel on which the defendants were found, which belonged to defendant Rivera-Santiago, differed by two letters from the number under which the vessel had been registered with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants contended that they were out fishing on the night of the airdrop and were simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They elicited testimony concerning other vessels that might have been in the area at the time of the airdrop but were not detected on radar, including a vessel found abandoned on shore on the morning of January 5, 1995, that contained marijuana residue.  Rivera-Santiago testified that his vessel was operating without navigation lights on the night in question because the vessel's built-in navigation lights had been damaged on a previous occasion and because he had stopped using the portable navigation light he had recently purchased for the boat.  He explained that the portable navigation light \"wouldn't stay fixed for a long time,\" would fall every time the boat jumped, and \"didn't work.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  His testimony also indicated that he began fixing one of the engines on the boat at approximately 11:00 p.m. with only the aid of a flashlight, and that the vessel was already moving when the coast guard helicopter arrived at 1:13 a.m.  Finally, the defendants elicited testimony concerning the maximum speed of Rivera-Santiago's vessel, suggesting that it might have been difficult for the boat to retrieve at least three bales of cocaine and travel approximately two miles, as the government's evidence suggested, during the six-minute interval between the airdrop and the time Alpers detected Rivera-Santiago's vessel on radar.  They also argued this point to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury began deliberating late in the afternoon on April 10, 1995, and, at 7:50 p.m. the following day, informed the trial judge that it was unable to reach a verdict but wanted to come back the next day to continue its deliberations.  The next morning, the jury submitted the following message to the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wish to obtain the following information from the transcription notes to clarify some doubts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

In response to the fourth question, and at the government's request, the trial judge elected to read back to the jury part of David Cruciger's testimony.  This decision came over the objection of counsel for each of the defendants.  Noting that Cruciger was the only witness who testified that he saw flashing lights,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> defense counsel asked that testimony from the witnesses who did not see flashing lights be read into evidence, and further argued that it was not clear what the jury meant by \"suspect vessel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I have your four questions.

The Trial Judge's Response to the Jury's Fourth Question</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address the defendants' contention that the trial judge committed reversible error when, in response to the jury's fourth question, he selected a portion of Cruciger's testimony and had it read to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant in a criminal case the right to a trial by jury.  We have previously noted that \"[u]ndeniably inherent in the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury is the principle that a court may not step in and direct a finding of contested fact in favor of the prosecution 'regardless of how overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction.' \"  United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 788 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 573, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1355-56, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977)).  Although the district court may, at its discretion, reread testimony where the jury makes a request to have specific testimony reread, see, e.g., United States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 130, 136 L.Ed.2d 79 (1996);  United States v. Aubin, 961 F.2d 980, 983-84 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 886, 113 S.Ct. 248, 121 L.Ed.2d 180 (1992), we have noted that the culling of testimony in response to a jury's open-ended question may, \"in effect, make the court a finder of fact,\" see Aubin, 961 F.2d at 983 (quoting United States v. Almonte, 594 F.2d 261, 265 (1st Cir.1979)), and have found constitutional error where a district court's answer to a jury's factual question had the effect of mandating that the jury reach a conclusion on a particular issue.  Argentine, 814 F.2d at 787-88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of the trial judge's answer to the jury's fourth question in the context of the evidence elicited during the course of the trial compels us to conclude that the trial judge usurped the jury's factfinding role as to the subject matter of that question, and, in so doing, deprived the defendants of their right to trial by jury.  In reaching this conclusion, we note that two of the \"vices\" we identified in Argentine are not present here.  First, the trial judge did not expressly represent that the parties had reached an agreement as to the subject matter of the jury's question.  Second, rather than presenting his answer to the jury's question as \"accomplished fact,\" the trial judge informed the jury that the evidence he was recounting was the testimony of a particular witness.  See id. at 787.   However, it is evident from a review of the record that the substance of the court's answer together with the context in which it was delivered brought about the same prohibited result that we found in Argentine for three reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the trial judge selected only a part of Cruciger's testimony given on direct examination to be read in response to the jury's question and, in so doing, necessarily suggested to the jury that this testimony would provide \"the\" answer to the jury's question.  This suggestion had the effect of both encouraging the jury to believe Cruciger and discouraging the jury from considering and possibly crediting alternative accounts of the events surrounding the airdrop.  The record contains evidence that was inconsistent with, if not contradictory to, Cruciger's assertion that he saw an exchange of lights during the airdrop between the suspicious aircraft and an object in the water.  For example, Cruciger's testimony was at odds with Rivera-Santiago's assertions that his vessel's built-in navigation lights were not working and that he had stopped using the portable navigation light that he had recently purchased.  In addition, Cruciger testified on direct examination that he began looking for flashes of light from sea level after the suspect aircraft had begun dropping objects into the water and then stated on cross-examination that he believed he saw lights during the airdrop.  However, the audio portion of the videotape indicates that unidentified air interdiction officers viewed flashing lights before any objects were dropped, and contains no mention of lights from sea level during or after the airdrop.  At a minimum, these inconsistencies raise questions about when or whether Cruciger saw flashing lights from sea level and, if he saw lights, whether those lights came from Rivera-Santiago's vessel or from another vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the context in which the trial judge gave his response to the jury's fourth question had the effect of placing his imprimatur on the facts contained in that portion of Cruciger's testimony that was read to the jury.  It is significant that the jury was posing questions in order to obtain information from the record \"to clarify some doubts.\"   In answering the first three questions, the trial judge either provided an unequivocal statement of fact to which the parties had stipulated (question no. 2) or directed the jury to the FLIR videotapes where the answer to their questions could be found (question nos. 1 &amp; 3).  However, in responding to the jury's fourth question the trial judge began by stating \"I'm going to answer that question now,\" and then had part of Cruciger's testimony read.  The net effect of what the trial judge did was to focus the jury's attention on only part of Cruciger's testimony concerning flashing lights and away from other evidence given by Cruciger and others that was relevant to a resolution of the doubts the jury expressed in its note about the existence of flashing lights from the air and from sea level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, by referring the jury to Cruciger's testimony, the trial judge suggested to the jury that the \"suspect vessel\" (the term used in the jury's question and throughout the trial to describe the boat on which the defendants were found), and not another vessel, was the source of the light that Cruciger claimed to have seen.  Although, as noted above, Rivera and Alpers testified that Rivera-Santiago's vessel was the only one that showed up on radar at the time of the airdrop, the defendants presented evidence suggesting that there were other vessels in the area.  The trial judge's answer to the question confirmed an assumption inherent in the jury's question, i.e., that the vessel seen flashing its lights was the same \"suspect vessel\" that Alpers picked up on radar six minutes after the airdrop occurred and approximately two miles away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial judge's response to the jury's fourth question invaded the province of the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We must next turn our attention to the question of whether the district court's error can be termed \"harmless.\"   As we noted in Argentine, in cases involving errors of constitutional dimension the harmless-error inquiry focuses on the existence of a reasonable possibility that the error at issue influenced the jury in reaching the verdict.  Argentine, 814 F.2d at 789 (citing Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230-31, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963)).  Phrased another way, we must now determine whether the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id. at 789;  see also Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081-82, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993);  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827-28, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967);  United States v. Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45, 60 n. 22 (1st Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously noted, the jury in its message to the trial judge sought specific factual information \"to clarify some doubts.\"   Therefore, we can reasonably infer from the context in which the jury asked the fourth question that some or all of the jurors, after deliberating for a little more than one day, entertained \"some doubts\" about the existence of flashing lights from the \"suspect aircraft\" and \"suspect vessel.\"   That the jury had doubts about this issue is significant for two reasons.  First, the existence or non-existence of flashing lights, their location, their source, and their timing are matters that were central both to the government's and the defendants' theories of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the manner in which the trial judge culled the evidence effectively determined the outcome of how the jurors would resolve their doubts since they were directed to only part of the evidence concerning lights (i.e., a portion of the testimony of the only witness who testified that he saw lights) instead of being instructed to consider and weigh all of the evidence relating to that issue adduced at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The defendants were entitled to have their theory of the case, as developed through their evidence, presented to the jury on an equal footing with the government's theory of the case.  This did not occur because the trial judge's response tipped the scales in favor of the government's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the jury had expressed to the trial judge an inability to reach a verdict the night before posing its questions and arrived at guilty verdicts two hours after receiving the answers, raising an inference that the trial judge's response influenced the verdicts.  While such an inference in and of itself is not controlling in our evaluation of harmless error, it is a factor that can be weighed along with other factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the trial judge's error and its effects, as previously discussed, in the context of the entire trial record.  The government presented significant circumstantial evidence pointing to the defendants' guilt.  However, under the applicable standard the verdicts can stand only if we find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  We cannot make such a finding.  The government's case as to the identity of the \"suspect vessel\" required a close calculating and comparing of times, coordinates, and distances, a process that might well have been shortcircuited by injection of the incriminating aspect of the evidence as to flashing lights.  We conclude that in view of the context in which the fourth question was asked, the significance of the issue raised by that question to the outcome of the case, the response that was given, and the context in which the response was given, there is a reasonable possibility that the error at issue influenced the jury in reaching its verdicts in this case.  Therefore, the verdicts cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of the evidentiary issues raised by the defendants are likely to recur in the event of a retrial and therefore we will address those issues.  First, the defendants contest the admission of testimony from law enforcement officers who, not having been qualified as experts, offered opinion testimony at trial based on their experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Specifically, the defendants object to the testimony of John Alpers and Raul Rivera suggesting that items dropped from an airplane and not otherwise gathered together would have been further apart than the objects appearing on Rivera's FLIR behind the suspect vessel;  to U.S. customs agent Roberto Escobar's testimony suggesting that the reason a wrong number might be painted on the rear of a vessel would be to hinder law enforcement authorities from identifying its owner;  and to Escobar's characterization of the coordinates of the airdrop as being \"pretty close\" to those found on the back of the business card found in Rivera-Santiago's wallet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148 (1st Cir.1989), we noted that the \"modern trend favors the admission of opinion testimony [from lay witnesses], provided it is well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to cross-examination.\"  Id. at 157 (permitting drug user to express opinion that substance she found was cocaine).  We further explained that \"the individual experience and knowledge of a lay witness may establish his or her competence, without qualification as an expert, to express an opinion on a particular subject outside the realm of common knowledge.\"  Id.;  accord United States v. VonWillie, 59 F.3d 922, 929 (9th Cir.1995) (based on experience, police officer could testify as lay witness that it was common for drug traffickers to use weapons to protect drugs;  opinion was helpful to determination of whether defendant was involved in drug trafficking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we find no error in the admission of the opinions of Rivera and Alpers concerning the proximity of the bales to Rivera-Santiago's vessel.  Both witnesses testified that they had extensive experience as air interdiction officers with the U.S. Customs Service, and were competent to testify as to the behavior of objects dropped from an airplane.  Further, the testimony was helpful both to the jury's understanding of the likelihood that two objects dropped from an airplane would be close together after the airdrop and to the jury's resolution of the question of the defendants' involvement in the airdrop.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we find error in the admission of Escobar's statement concerning the numbers painted on the back of Rivera-Santiago's vessel.  Escobar testified at trial that, in addition to other law enforcement experience, he had worked for a smuggling unit of the U.S. Marshals Service for two years, during which time he had been involved in approximately fifteen missions.  As such, he was entitled to draw on his law enforcement experience in conveying opinion testimony to the jury.  Further, his testimony concerning the significance of the incorrect registration number was helpful to the jury, which might not have been aware of the existence of a central registration system for sea vessels similar to that for automobiles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we do find error in the trial judge's decision to permit Escobar to testify that the coordinates found on the back of the business card were \"pretty close\" to the coordinates of the airdrop site.  Immediately prior to offering this conclusion, Escobar testified that he did not understand what some of the numbers on the business card meant and acknowledged that he was \"not an expert in coordinates.\"   In addition, his testimony that the coordinates were \"pretty close\" represented only his characterization of the distance between the two points.  As presented, the witness's testimony lacked an appropriate foundation and his conclusion was of little aid to the jury in understanding the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also challenge as unfairly prejudicial and without foundation the testimony of a U.S. drug enforcement agent, who, not having been qualified as an expert, stated on direct examination that the street value of the cocaine found at sea may have exceeded $18 million.  However, we have recently stated that \"[t]here is little dispute that such information may aid in proving intent to distribute.\"  United States v. Rivera, 68 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 970, 133 L.Ed.2d 891 (1996).  In addition, in this case the evidence was relevant to bolster the government's claim that a smuggler would not drop valuable property into the water unless a specific target was in the area.  Finally, as we noted in Rivera, \"DEA agents are especially qualified, and need not be certified as experts, to testify about street value.\"  Id.  We see no error in the admission of this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the court has determined that the defendants' convictions must be vacated, there is no need to address the sentencing issues raised on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

See, e.g., Aubin, 961 F.2d at 983 (trial judge did not abuse discretion where, in response to factual question, he instructed the jury that as finder of fact it was its responsibility to weigh and interpret evidence);  United States v.

In Montas, a federal drug enforcement agent who had been qualified as an expert testified that in ninety-nine percent of the cases in which he had worked that involved the seizure of drugs at an airport, the passenger involved had been traveling under a false name.  He further testified that it was \"obvious\" that a passenger trying to smuggle drugs would use a false name to avoid detection.  Id. at 784.   In concluding that the admission of this testimony was likely beyond the limit of admissibility, we noted the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from the use of an expert witness to corroborate the government's case.  Id. at 786.   However, the risk of prejudice that we identified in Montas is less severe where, as here, the witness has not been qualified as an expert.  Moreover, unlike Montas, the testimony at issue in the instant case does not suggest a definite correlation between a suspicious characteristic and any illegal activity</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

On January 25, 1995, a grand jury returned a three-count indictment against the defendants, charging them with aiding and abetting each other in attempting to possess with intent to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 943 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2;  aiding and abetting each other in attempting to import narcotics into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 952(a), 963 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2;  and aiding and abetting each other in attempting to possess on board a vessel of the United States with intent to distribute narcotics in violation of 46 U.S.C.App. &#167; 1903(a), (b)(2)(c), (f), (j) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government elicited testimony from U.S. Customs Service air interdiction officers who were assigned to three aircraft operating off the southeast coast of Puerto Rico on the night of January 4, 1995, and the morning of January 5, 1995.  The officers were investigating what was perceived to be a suspicious aircraft flying with its lights off and without a flight plan from South America toward Puerto Rico.  The government's first witness was Leslie Robb, who operated the radar and Forward Looking Infrared camera (\"FLIR\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> on one of the aircraft, Omaha 42.  Robb testified that after circling for nearly forty minutes, the suspicious aircraft dropped several objects into the water at 12:39 a.m. at a point approximately six miles off the coast of Patillas, Puerto Rico.  The splashes were captured on a videotape of Omaha 42's FLIR, which was submitted to the jury as evidence along with videotapes of the FLIRs from the other two aircraft.  The videotapes included the radio communications among the air interdiction officers and other law enforcement personnel that occurred contemporaneously with the images produced by the FLIRs.  These radio communications revealed that immediately before the airdrop occurred, a vessel was seen flashing its lights in the area near the suspicious aircraft, and that the aircraft which had turned its lights on at some point before the airdrop turned them off shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's second witness, Raul Antonio Rivera-Calleja (\"Rivera\"), operated the radar and FLIR systems on a second plane, Omaha 02, which began looking for marine targets after the airdrop had occurred.  At approximately 1:04 a.m., Rivera acquired a vessel on radar approximately two miles from the site of the airdrop.  This target was the only one that Rivera was able to locate on his radar, which covered a twenty-five-mile radius around the aircraft.  Rivera testified that after he had located the vessel on radar, his fellow crew members informed him that they saw no lights on the surface of the water, and that the vessel's navigation lights had to have been turned off.  Rivera further testified that shortly after acquiring the vessel on radar, his FLIR showed two objects floating in the water approximately twenty feet from the rear of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's next witness, David Cruciger, was the pilot in command of Omaha 02.  Cruciger offered the following description of the airdrop on direct examination:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Once again while flying in this pattern, we received information from Omaha 42 that a drop was taking place and that they were seeing the splashes.  Chris Thorton [the co-pilot aboard Omaha 02] said it, directed my attention out the right-hand window of the aircraft.  I banked the aircraft over so I could see out in that direction;  and with the aircraft banked, I could see down into the water a flashing light.  It was described by Omaha 42.  As we watched the light, I saw an aircraft or what I believed to be an aircraft turn on its navigation recognition lights and fly at low altitude over the lights that were flashing in the water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked during cross-examination whether he had seen the lights before the drop occurred, Cruciger stated that he \"believe[d] it was during the drop.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's fourth witness, John Alpers, operated the radar and FLIR system on the third aircraft, Omaha 38.  Alpers testified that he located a vessel--the same one next to which Rivera's FLIR would later detect two objects floating in the water--on radar at approximately 12:45 a.m., approximately two miles from the site of the airdrop, and that, according to the co-pilot aboard Omaha 38, all of the vessel's lights were out.  Alpers also testified that although he located one object on his radar that he believed to be a reef, he located no other vessels on his twenty-five-mile radar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's witnesses testified that the vessel remained stationary from the time Alpers acquired it on his FLIR at 12:54 a.m., approximately three miles from the site of the airdrop, until a coast guard helicopter arrived at approximately 1:13 a.m. and shined a bright light on it.  They further testified that the vessel began to move toward shore after the coast guard helicopter illuminated it, and that the defendants were found aboard the vessel when it arrived on shore and were promptly arrested.  Although no contraband was found aboard the defendants' vessel, the government introduced into evidence four bales of cocaine that were found floating in the water in the vicinity of the drop site.  The first bale was found at approximately 2:00 a.m. on January 5, 1996, and three more were found at approximately 1:30 p.m. the same day tied together with rope of a type found on the defendants' vessel.  Two of the government's witnesses speculated that, following the airdrop, the defendants had gathered the three bales that were found tied together and, rather than bringing the bales aboard, placed them in tow so as to facilitate disposal in the event the defendants' scheme was discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also introduced into evidence a business card found in defendant Rivera-Santiago's wallet, which was discovered in his car, bearing the coordinates of a spot approximately seven miles away from the site of the airdrop.  In addition, the government's witnesses testified that they found defendant Alamo-Silva's Toyota 4-Runner at his girlfriend's house, which was accessible via a pathway to the beach and was located approximately one-quarter of a mile away from the point where the defendants arrived on shore.  The keys to the 4-Runner were found in the vehicle, which was parked with its back to the water and its rear seats folded down.  Finally, the government's evidence indicated that the registration number painted on the back of the vessel on which the defendants were found, which belonged to defendant Rivera-Santiago, differed by two letters from the number under which the vessel had been registered with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants contended that they were out fishing on the night of the airdrop and were simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They elicited testimony concerning other vessels that might have been in the area at the time of the airdrop but were not detected on radar, including a vessel found abandoned on shore on the morning of January 5, 1995, that contained marijuana residue.  Rivera-Santiago testified that his vessel was operating without navigation lights on the night in question because the vessel's built-in navigation lights had been damaged on a previous occasion and because he had stopped using the portable navigation light he had recently purchased for the boat.  He explained that the portable navigation light \"wouldn't stay fixed for a long time,\" would fall every time the boat jumped, and \"didn't work.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  His testimony also indicated that he began fixing one of the engines on the boat at approximately 11:00 p.m. with only the aid of a flashlight, and that the vessel was already moving when the coast guard helicopter arrived at 1:13 a.m.  Finally, the defendants elicited testimony concerning the maximum speed of Rivera-Santiago's vessel, suggesting that it might have been difficult for the boat to retrieve at least three bales of cocaine and travel approximately two miles, as the government's evidence suggested, during the six-minute interval between the airdrop and the time Alpers detected Rivera-Santiago's vessel on radar.  They also argued this point to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury began deliberating late in the afternoon on April 10, 1995, and, at 7:50 p.m. the following day, informed the trial judge that it was unable to reach a verdict but wanted to come back the next day to continue its deliberations.  The next morning, the jury submitted the following message to the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We wish to obtain the following information from the transcription notes to clarify some doubts:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

In response to the fourth question, and at the government's request, the trial judge elected to read back to the jury part of David Cruciger's testimony.  This decision came over the objection of counsel for each of the defendants.  Noting that Cruciger was the only witness who testified that he saw flashing lights,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> defense counsel asked that testimony from the witnesses who did not see flashing lights be read into evidence, and further argued that it was not clear what the jury meant by \"suspect vessel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge addressed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I have your four questions.

Argentine, 814 F.2d at 787-88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of the trial judge's answer to the jury's fourth question in the context of the evidence elicited during the course of the trial compels us to conclude that the trial judge usurped the jury's factfinding role as to the subject matter of that question, and, in so doing, deprived the defendants of their right to trial by jury.  In reaching this conclusion, we note that two of the \"vices\" we identified in Argentine are not present here.  First, the trial judge did not expressly represent that the parties had reached an agreement as to the subject matter of the jury's question.  Second, rather than presenting his answer to the jury's question as \"accomplished fact,\" the trial judge informed the jury that the evidence he was recounting was the testimony of a particular witness.  See id. at 787.   However, it is evident from a review of the record that the substance of the court's answer together with the context in which it was delivered brought about the same prohibited result that we found in Argentine for three reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the trial judge selected only a part of Cruciger's testimony given on direct examination to be read in response to the jury's question and, in so doing, necessarily suggested to the jury that this testimony would provide \"the\" answer to the jury's question.  This suggestion had the effect of both encouraging the jury to believe Cruciger and discouraging the jury from considering and possibly crediting alternative accounts of the events surrounding the airdrop.  The record contains evidence that was inconsistent with, if not contradictory to, Cruciger's assertion that he saw an exchange of lights during the airdrop between the suspicious aircraft and an object in the water.  For example, Cruciger's testimony was at odds with Rivera-Santiago's assertions that his vessel's built-in navigation lights were not working and that he had stopped using the portable navigation light that he had recently purchased.  In addition, Cruciger testified on direct examination that he began looking for flashes of light from sea level after the suspect aircraft had begun dropping objects into the water and then stated on cross-examination that he believed he saw lights during the airdrop.  However, the audio portion of the videotape indicates that unidentified air interdiction officers viewed flashing lights before any objects were dropped, and contains no mention of lights from sea level during or after the airdrop.  At a minimum, these inconsistencies raise questions about when or whether Cruciger saw flashing lights from sea level and, if he saw lights, whether those lights came from Rivera-Santiago's vessel or from another vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the context in which the trial judge gave his response to the jury's fourth question had the effect of placing his imprimatur on the facts contained in that portion of Cruciger's testimony that was read to the jury.  It is significant that the jury was posing questions in order to obtain information from the record \"to clarify some doubts.\"   In answering the first three questions, the trial judge either provided an unequivocal statement of fact to which the parties had stipulated (question no. 2) or directed the jury to the FLIR videotapes where the answer to their questions could be found (question nos. 1 &amp; 3).  However, in responding to the jury's fourth question the trial judge began by stating \"I'm going to answer that question now,\" and then had part of Cruciger's testimony read.  The net effect of what the trial judge did was to focus the jury's attention on only part of Cruciger's testimony concerning flashing lights and away from other evidence given by Cruciger and others that was relevant to a resolution of the doubts the jury expressed in its note about the existence of flashing lights from the air and from sea level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, by referring the jury to Cruciger's testimony, the trial judge suggested to the jury that the \"suspect vessel\" (the term used in the jury's question and throughout the trial to describe the boat on which the defendants were found), and not another vessel, was the source of the light that Cruciger claimed to have seen.  Although, as noted above, Rivera and Alpers testified that Rivera-Santiago's vessel was the only one that showed up on radar at the time of the airdrop, the defendants presented evidence suggesting that there were other vessels in the area.  The trial judge's answer to the question confirmed an assumption inherent in the jury's question, i.e., that the vessel seen flashing its lights was the same \"suspect vessel\" that Alpers picked up on radar six minutes after the airdrop occurred and approximately two miles away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial judge's response to the jury's fourth question invaded the province of the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  We must next turn our attention to the question of whether the district court's error can be termed \"harmless.\"   As we noted in Argentine, in cases involving errors of constitutional dimension the harmless-error inquiry focuses on the existence of a reasonable possibility that the error at issue influenced the jury in reaching the verdict.  Argentine, 814 F.2d at 789 (citing Fahy v. Connecticut, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106699\"><a href=\"/opinion/106699/fahy-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 86-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106699\"><a href=\"/opinion/106699/fahy-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Trenkler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196186\"><a href=\"/opinion/196186/united-states-v-trenkler/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 60 n. 22 (1st Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously noted, the jury in its message to the trial judge sought specific factual information \"to clarify some doubts.\"   Therefore, we can reasonably infer from the context in which the jury asked the fourth question that some or all of the jurors, after deliberating for a little more than one day, entertained \"some doubts\" about the existence of flashing lights from the \"suspect aircraft\" and \"suspect vessel.\"   That the jury had doubts about this issue is significant for two reasons.  First, the existence or non-existence of flashing lights, their location, their source, and their timing are matters that were central both to the government's and the defendants' theories of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the manner in which the trial judge culled the evidence effectively determined the outcome of how the jurors would resolve their doubts since they were directed to only part of the evidence concerning lights (i.e., a portion of the testimony of the only witness who testified that he saw lights) instead of being instructed to consider and weigh all of the evidence relating to that issue adduced at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The defendants were entitled to have their theory of the case, as developed through their evidence, presented to the jury on an equal footing with the government's theory of the case.  This did not occur because the trial judge's response tipped the scales in favor of the government's theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the jury had expressed to the trial judge an inability to reach a verdict the night before posing its questions and arrived at guilty verdicts two hours after receiving the answers, raising an inference that the trial judge's response influenced the verdicts.  While such an inference in and of itself is not controlling in our evaluation of harmless error, it is a factor that can be weighed along with other factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the trial judge's error and its effects, as previously discussed, in the context of the entire trial record.  The government presented significant circumstantial evidence pointing to the defendants' guilt.  However, under the applicable standard the verdicts can stand only if we find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  We cannot make such a finding.  The government's case as to the identity of the \"suspect vessel\" required a close calculating and comparing of times, coordinates, and distances, a process that might well have been shortcircuited by injection of the incriminating aspect of the evidence as to flashing lights.  We conclude that in view of the context in which the fourth question was asked, the significance of the issue raised by that question to the outcome of the case, the response that was given, and the context in which the response was given, there is a reasonable possibility that the error at issue influenced the jury in reaching its verdicts in this case.  Therefore, the verdicts cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several of the evidentiary issues raised by the defendants are likely to recur in the event of a retrial and therefore we will address those issues.  First, the defendants contest the admission of testimony from law enforcement officers who, not having been qualified as experts, offered opinion testimony at trial based on their experience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Specifically, the defendants object to the testimony of John Alpers and Raul Rivera suggesting that items dropped from an airplane and not otherwise gathered together would have been further apart than the objects appearing on Rivera's FLIR behind the suspect vessel;  to U.S. customs agent Roberto Escobar's testimony suggesting that the reason a wrong number might be painted on the rear of a vessel would be to hinder law enforcement authorities from identifying its owner;  and to Escobar's characterization of the coordinates of the airdrop as being \"pretty close\" to those found on the back of the business card found in Rivera-Santiago's wallet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Paiva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534182\"><a href=\"/opinion/534182/united-states-v-james-earl-paiva/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989), we noted that the \"modern trend favors the admission of opinion testimony [from lay witnesses], provided it is well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to cross-examination.\"  Id. at 157 (permitting drug user to express opinion that substance she found was cocaine).  We further explained that \"the individual experience and knowledge of a lay witness may establish his or her competence, without qualification as an expert, to express an opinion on a particular subject outside the realm of common knowledge.\"  Id.;  accord United States v. VonWillie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699271\"><a href=\"/opinion/699271/united-states-v-christopher-fredrick-vonwillie-aka-christopher-fred/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 929 (9th Cir.1995) (based on experience, police officer could testify as lay witness that it was common for drug traffickers to use weapons to protect drugs;  opinion was helpful to determination of whether defendant was involved in drug trafficking).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we find no error in the admission of the opinions of Rivera and Alpers concerning the proximity of the bales to Rivera-Santiago's vessel.  Both witnesses testified that they had extensive experience as air interdiction officers with the U.S. Customs Service, and were competent to testify as to the behavior of objects dropped from an airplane.  Further, the testimony was helpful both to the jury's understanding of the likelihood that two objects dropped from an airplane would be close together after the airdrop and to the jury's resolution of the question of the defendants' involvement in the airdrop.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we find error in the admission of Escobar's statement concerning the numbers painted on the back of Rivera-Santiago's vessel.  Escobar testified at trial that, in addition to other law enforcement experience, he had worked for a smuggling unit of the U.S. Marshals Service for two years, during which time he had been involved in approximately fifteen missions.  As such, he was entitled to draw on his law enforcement experience in conveying opinion testimony to the jury.  Further, his testimony concerning the significance of the incorrect registration number was helpful to the jury, which might not have been aware of the existence of a central registration system for sea vessels similar to that for automobiles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we do find error in the trial judge's decision to permit Escobar to testify that the coordinates found on the back of the business card were \"pretty close\" to the coordinates of the airdrop site.  Immediately prior to offering this conclusion, Escobar testified that he did not understand what some of the numbers on the business card meant and acknowledged that he was \"not an expert in coordinates.\"   In addition, his testimony that the coordinates were \"pretty close\" represented only his characterization of the distance between the two points.  As presented, the witness's testimony lacked an appropriate foundation and his conclusion was of little aid to the jury in understanding the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also challenge as unfairly prejudicial and without foundation the testimony of a U.S. drug enforcement agent, who, not having been qualified as an expert, stated on direct examination that the street value of the cocaine found at sea may have exceeded $18 million.  However, we have recently stated that \"[t]here is little dispute that such information may aid in proving intent to distribute.\"  United States v. Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196345\"><a href=\"/opinion/196345/united-states-v-guzman-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></span> (1996).  In addition, in this case the evidence was relevant to bolster the government's claim that a smuggler would not drop valuable property into the water unless a specific target was in the area.  Finally, as we noted in Rivera, \"DEA agents are especially qualified, and need not be certified as experts, to testify about street value.\"  Id.  We see no error in the admission of this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

See, e.g., Aubin, 961 F.2d at 983 (trial judge did not abuse discretion where, in response to factual question, he instructed the jury that as finder of fact it was its responsibility to weigh and interpret evidence);  United States v.

In Montas, a federal drug enforcement agent who had been qualified as an expert testified that in ninety-nine percent of the cases in which he had worked that involved the seizure of drugs at an airport, the passenger involved had been traveling under a false name.  He further testified that it was \"obvious\" that a passenger trying to smuggle drugs would use a false name to avoid detection.  Id. at 784.   In concluding that the admission of this testimony was likely beyond the limit of admissibility, we noted the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from the use of an expert witness to corroborate the government's case.  Id. at 786.   However, the risk of prejudice that we identified in Montas is less severe where, as here, the witness has not been qualified as an expert.  Moreover, unlike Montas, the testimony at issue in the instant case does not suggest a definite correlation between a suspicious characteristic and any illegal activity</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
