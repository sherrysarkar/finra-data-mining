In  it, the United States attempts\r\n\nto convict a foreign corporation under the Sherman Act, a federal\r\n\nantitrust  statute, alleging  that price-fixing  activities which\r\n\ntook place entirely in Japan  are prosecutable because they  were\r\n\nintended  to have, and did  in fact have,  substantial effects in\r\n\nthis  country.   The  district court,  declaring that  a criminal\r\n\nantitrust   prosecution   could   not    be   based   on   wholly\r\n\nextraterritorial conduct,  dismissed the indictment.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Nippon  Paper Indus.  Co., 944  F. Supp. 55  (D. Mass.\r                                              \r\n\n1996).  We reverse.\r\n\nI.  JUST THE FAX\r          I.  JUST THE FAX\r\n\n          Since the district court granted the defendant's motion\r\n\nto dismiss for failure  to state a prosecutable offense,  we draw\r\n\nour account of the  pertinent events from the well-pleaded  facts\r\n\nin  the indictment itself.   See United States  v. National Dairy\r                                                                           \r\n\nProds. Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 33 n.2 (1963).\r                      \r\n\n          In 1995, a  federal grand jury handed  up an indictment\r\n\nnaming  as a defendant Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd. (NPI), a\r\n\nJapanese  manufacturer  of  facsimile  paper.1    The  indictment\r\n\nalleges that in 1990 NPI and certain unnamed  coconspirators held\r\n\na number of meetings in Japan which culminated in an agreement to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  grand jury  also named another  Japanese manufacturer,\r\nJujo  Paper  Co.,  Ltd. (Jujo),  as  a  codefendant.   Two  years\r\nearlier,  however,  NPI  had  been  formed  and,  the  government\r\nalleges, had assumed Jujo's assets and  liabilities.  Because the\r\nissue of successor liability is not before us, we treat NPI as if\r\nit were the sole defendant  and as if it, rather than  Jujo, were\r\nalleged to have committed the acts described in the indictment.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nfix the price of thermal fax paper throughout North America.  NPI\r\n\nand other manufacturers who were  privy to the scheme purportedly\r\n\naccomplished their  objective by selling  the paper  in Japan  to\r\n\nunaffiliated trading  houses on condition that  the latter charge\r\n\nspecified  (inflated) prices for the paper when they resold it in\r\n\nNorth  America.   The trading  houses then  shipped and  sold the\r\n\npaper to their subsidiaries in the United States who in turn sold\r\n\nit to  American  consumers at  swollen  prices.   The  indictment\r\n\nfurther relates that, in  1990 alone, NPI sold thermal  fax paper\r\n\nworth  approximately  $6,100,000  for  eventual import  into  the\r\n\nUnited States; and  that in order  to ensure  the success of  the\r\n\nventure, NPI  monitored the paper  trail and  confirmed that  the\r\n\nprices  charged to  end users  were those  that it  had arranged.\r\n\nThese  activities,  the  indictment  posits,  had  a  substantial\r\n\nadverse effect  on commerce in the United States and unreasonably\r\n\nrestrained  trade in violation of Section One of the Sherman Act,\r\n\n15 U.S.C.   1 (1994).\r\n\n          NPI  moved  to  dismiss  because, inter  alia,  if  the\r                                                                 \r\n\nconduct attributed to NPI occurred at all, it took place entirely\r\n\nin Japan, and,  thus, the  indictment failed to  limn an  offense\r\n\nunder Section One  of the  Sherman Act.   The government  opposed\r\n\nthis initiative on two  grounds.  First, it claimed that  the law\r\n\ndeserved a less grudging reading and that, properly read, Section\r\n\nOne  of the  Sherman  Act applied  criminally  to wholly  foreign\r\n\nconduct as long as that conduct produced substantial and intended\r\n\neffects  within the United States.   Second, it  claimed that the\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nindictment,  too,  deserved a  less  grudging  reading and  that,\r\n\nproperly  read,  the  bill   alleged  a  vertical  conspiracy  in\r\n\nrestraint  of   trade  that   involved  overt  acts   by  certain\r\n\ncoconspirators within the United States.  Accepting a restrictive\r\n\nreading of  both  the statute  and the  indictment, the  district\r\n\ncourt dismissed the case.  See United States v. NPI, 944 F. Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\nat 64-66.  This appeal followed.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          We  begin     and  end     with  the  overriding  legal\r\n\nquestion.2     Because   this  question   is  one   of  statutory\r\n\nconstruction, we review de  novo the holding that Section  One of\r\n\nthe Sherman Act does not cover wholly extraterritorial conduct in\r\n\nthe criminal context.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462,\r                                                             \r\n\n471-72 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Our analysis  proceeds in  moieties.  We  first present\r\n\nthe historical  context in which this  important question arises.\r\n\nWe move next to the specifics of the case.\r\n\n                  A.  An Historical Perspective.\r                            A.  An Historical Perspective.\r                                                         \r\n\n          Our  law   has  long  presumed   that  \"legislation  of\r\n\nCongress, unless  a contrary  intent appears,  is meant  to apply\r\n\nonly within  the territorial jurisdiction of  the United States.\"\r\n\nEEOC  v. Arabian  American  Oil Co.,  499  U.S. 244,  248  (1991)\r                                             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Inasmuch as we hold  that activities committed abroad which\r\nhave a substantial and  intended effect within the United  States\r\nmay form the basis  for a criminal prosecution under  Section One\r\nof  the  Sherman  Act,  we  need  not  address  the  government's\r\nalternative  argument that  the indictment  in this  case alleges\r\nthat  some  overt acts  in  furtherance  of  the conspiracy  were\r\nperpetrated in the United States.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n(citation  omitted).   In  this  context, the  Supreme  Court has\r\n\ncharged inquiring  courts with  determining whether  Congress has\r\n\nclearly expressed an affirmative  desire to apply particular laws\r\n\nto conduct that occurs  beyond the borders of the  United States.\r\n\nSee id.\r                 \r\n\n          The earliest  Supreme  Court  case  which  undertook  a\r\n\ncomparable  task in  respect to  Section One  of the  Sherman Act\r\n\ndetermined  that the presumption  against extraterritoriality had\r\n\nnot been  overcome.  In American Banana  Co. v. United Fruit Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n213  U.S. 347 (1909), the Court considered the application of the\r\n\nSherman Act in  a civil action concerning  conduct which occurred\r\n\nentirely  in Central America and which  had no discernible effect\r\n\non  imports to  the United  States.   Starting with  what Justice\r\n\nHolmes  termed \"the  general and  almost universal  rule\" holding\r\n\n\"that the  character of  an act  as  lawful or  unlawful must  be\r\n\ndetermined wholly  by the  law of  the country  where the  act is\r\n\ndone,\" id. at 356,  and the ancillary proposition that,  in cases\r                    \r\n\nof  doubt, a  statute should  be \"confined  in its  operation and\r\n\neffect to  the territorial  limits  over which  the lawmaker  has\r\n\ngeneral  and legitimate power,\" id.  at 357, the  Court held that\r                                             \r\n\nthe defendant's actions abroad were not proscribed by the Sherman\r\n\nAct.\r\n\n          Our  jurisprudence is  precedent-based, but  it is  not\r\n\nstatic.  By 1945, a different court saw a very similar problem in\r\n\na  somewhat softer light.   In United  States v.  Aluminum Co. of\r                                                                           \r\n\nAm., 148 F.2d  416 (2d  Cir. 1945) (Alcoa),  the Second  Circuit,\r                                                   \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsitting  as  a  court  of  last  resort,  see  15  U.S.C.      29\r                                                       \r\n\n(authorizing designation of a court of appeals as a court of last\r\n\nresort  for  certain  antitrust  cases), mulled  a  civil  action\r\n\nbrought under Section One against a Canadian corporation for acts\r\n\ncommitted  entirely abroad  which,  the government  averred,  had\r\n\nproduced  substantial anticompetitive  effects within  the United\r\n\nStates.    The Alcoa  court read  American Banana  narrowly; that\r                                                           \r\n\ncase, Judge Learned Hand wrote, stood only for the principle that\r\n\n\"[w]e should not impute to Congress an intent to punish  all whom\r\n\nits  courts  can catch,  for  conduct which  has  no consequences\r\n\nwithin  the  United  States.\"   Id.  at  443.    But a  sovereign\r                                             \r\n\nordinarily can  impose liability for conduct  outside its borders\r\n\nthat  produces consequences within them, and while considerations\r\n\nof  comity argue against  applying Section  One to  situations in\r\n\nwhich no  effect within the  United States has  been shown    the\r\n\nAmerican  Banana scenario    the  statute, properly  interpreted,\r                          \r\n\ndoes  proscribe  extraterritorial acts  which  were  \"intended to\r\n\naffect imports  [to the United States] and did affect them.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  444.   On  the facts  of  Alcoa, therefore,  the  presumption\r                                             \r\n\nagainst  extraterritoriality had  been overcome, and  the Sherman\r\n\nAct had been violated.  See id. at 444-45.\r                                         \r\n\n          Any perceived tension between American Banana and Alcoa\r                                                                           \r\n\nwas eased by the  Supreme Court's most recent exploration  of the\r\n\nSherman Act's  extraterritorial reach.  In Hartford Fire Ins. Co.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. California, 509 U.S. 764 (1993), the Justices endorsed Alcoa's\r                                                                         \r\n\ncore holding, permitting civil antitrust claims under Section One\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nto go forward despite  the fact that the actions  which allegedly\r\n\nviolated Section  One occurred entirely  on British soil.   While\r\n\nnoting   American  Banana's   initial   disagreement  with   this\r                                   \r\n\nproposition, the Hartford Fire  Court deemed it \"well established\r                                        \r\n\nby now that  the Sherman Act applies to foreign  conduct that was\r\n\nmeant  to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect\r\n\nin  the United  States.\"   Id. at  796.   The conduct  alleged, a\r                                        \r\n\nLondon-based conspiracy  to alter the American  insurance market,\r\n\nmet that benchmark.3  See id.\r                                       \r\n\n          To sum  up, the  case law now  conclusively establishes\r\n\nthat civil antitrust actions predicated on wholly foreign conduct\r\n\nwhich has an intended and substantial effect in the United States\r\n\ncome  within Section One's jurisdictional  reach.  In arriving at\r\n\nthis conclusion, we take no view of the government's asseveration\r\n\nthat  the  Foreign  Trade  Antitrust  Improvements  Act  of  1982\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3As  NPI reminds  us,  four Justices  dissented in  Hartford\r                                                                           \r\nFire.    This  is  cold  comfort,  however,  for  the  dissenters\r              \r\nexpressed  complete  agreement  with   the  majority's  view   on\r\nextraterritoriality.

By the same token, NPI's attempt to distinguish\r\nHartford Fire on  the ground that  the defendants there  conceded\r                       \r\nthe United  States' jurisdiction over their conduct fails for two\r\nreasons.\r\n      In the first place, the assertion is no more than a play on\r\nwords.  The  majority opinion  in Hartford Fire  stated that  the\r                                                         \r\ndistrict court  \"undoubtedly\"  had jurisdiction  over  the  civil\r\nclaims, \"as the  London reinsurers apparently  concede.\"  Id.  at\r                                                                       \r\n795.   It is obvious, therefore, that jurisdiction did not depend\r\non   the  concession;   to  the   contrary,  jurisdiction   would\r\n\"undoubtedly\"  have existed in any  event.  In  the second place,\r\none  of the  London  defendants did  not  join in  this  apparent\r\nconcession,  but the  Court  nonetheless  held  that  defendant's\r\nforeign conduct to be within the Sherman Act's proscriptive ambit\r\nbecause it was part of a scheme which \"was intended to and did in\r\nfact  produce  a substantial  effect  on  the American  insurance\r\nmarket.\"  Id. at 795 n.21.\r                       \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n(FTAIA), 15  U.S.C.   6a (1994), makes  manifest Congress' intent\r\n\nto  apply  the Sherman  Act  extraterritorially.   The  FTAIA  is\r\n\ninelegantly phrased  and the court  in Hartford Fire  declined to\r                                                              \r\n\nplace any weight on it.

This\r\n\nis  largely  uncharted terrain;  we  are  aware of  no  authority\r\n\ndirectly on point, and the parties have cited none.\r\n\n          Be that as  it may,  one datum sticks  out like a  sore\r\n\nthumb:  in both criminal and civil cases,  the claim that Section\r\n\nOne applies extraterritorially is  based on the same language  in\r\n\nthe  same  section  of  the  same   statute:    \"Every  contract,\r\n\ncombination  in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in\r\n\nrestraint  of trade or commerce among the several States, or with\r\n\nforeign nations,  is declared  to be  illegal.\"   15 U.S.C.    1.\r\n\nWords may sometimes be chameleons, possessing different shades of\r\n\nmeaning in  different contexts, see,  e.g., Hanover  Ins.

Here, however,  we need not rely on common sense alone;\r\n\naccepted  canons  of statutory  construction  point  in the  same\r\n\ndirection.    It is  a  fundamental  interpretive principle  that\r\n\nidentical words or terms used in  different parts of the same act\r\n\nare  intended  to have  the same  meaning.

Thus,\r\n\nunless some special  circumstance obtains in this  case, there is\r\n\nno principled way in which we can uphold the order of dismissal.\r\n\n          NPI and its  amicus, the Government of Japan, urge that\r\n\nspecial  reasons   exist  for   measuring  Section  One's   reach\r\n\ndifferently  in  a  criminal context.    We  have  reviewed their\r\n\nexhortations and found  them hollow.   We discuss  the five  most\r\n\npromising theses below.  The rest do not require comment.\r\n\n          1.  Lack of Precedent.  NPI and its amicus make much of\r                    1.  Lack of Precedent.\r                                         \r\n\nthe fact that this appears to be the first criminal case in which\r\n\nthe  United States  endeavors  to extend  Section  One to  wholly\r\n\nforeign conduct.   We are not  impressed.  There is  a first time\r\n\nfor everything, and  the absence of  earlier criminal actions  is\r\n\nprobably more  a demonstration of the  increasingly global nature\r\n\nof  our economy than proof  that Section One  cannot cover wholly\r\n\nforeign conduct in the criminal milieu.\r\n\n          Moreover,   this  argument   overstates  the   lack  of\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nprecedent.  There is, for example, solid authority for applying a\r\n\nstate's criminal  statute to  conduct occurring  entirely outside\r\n\nthe state's borders.  See Strassheim v. Daily,  221 U.S. 280, 285\r                                                       \r\n\n(1911)  (Holmes,  J.)

It is not  much of a stretch to\r\n\napply  this  same  principle  internationally,  especially  in  a\r\n\nshrinking world.  See, e.g., Chua  Han Mow v.

To\r\n\nbe sure, the Bowman  Court, dealing with a charged  conspiracy to\r                             \r\n\ndefraud, warned that if  the criminal law \"is  to be extended  to\r\n\ninclude  those   [crimes]   committed  outside   of  the   strict\r\n\nterritorial jurisdiction, it is natural for Congress to say so in\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nthe statute, and failure  to do so  will negative the purpose  of\r\n\nCongress in this  regard.\"   Id. at 98.

The passage to which  they pin their hopes\r\n\nstates:\r\n\n          [I]n the case of regulatory statutes that may\r\n          give   rise  to   both  civil   and  criminal\r\n          liability,   such   as   the  United   States\r\n          antitrust and securities  laws, the  presence\r\n          of   substantial    foreign   elements   will\r\n          ordinarily   weigh  against   application  of\r\n          criminal law.    In such  cases,  legislative\r\n          intent to subject conduct outside the state's\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          territory to its criminal law should be found\r\n          only  on the  basis  of express  statement or\r\n          clear implication.\r\n\nId.  at    403 cmt.  f.   We believe  that this  statement merely\r             \r\n\nreaffirms the classic  presumption against extraterritoriality   \r\n\nno  more,  no less.    After  all, nothing  in  the  text of  the\r\n\nRestatement proper contradicts the government's interpretation of\r\n\nSection One.   See, e.g.,  id. at    402(1)(c) (explaining  that,\r                                        \r\n\nsubject  only to a general requirement of reasonableness, a state\r\n\nhas jurisdiction to proscribe \"conduct outside its territory that\r\n\nhas  or  is  intended  to  have  substantial  effect  within  its\r\n\nterritory\");5 id.  at    415(2) (\"Any  agreement in  restraint of\r                           \r\n\nUnited States trade that is made outside of the United States . .\r\n\n.

In view of the  fact\r\n\nthat the Supreme  Court deems it \"well  established\" that Section\r\n\nOne  of  the  Sherman  Act  applies  to  wholly foreign  conduct,\r\n\nHartford Fire,  509 U.S.  at 796,  we effectively are  foreclosed\r                       \r\n\nfrom trying to tease an ambiguity  out of Section One relative to\r\n\nits extraterritorial  application.    Accordingly,  the  rule  of\r\n\nlenity plays no part in the instant case.\r\n\n          5.   Comity.   International comity is  a doctrine that\r                    5.

Comity is more an  aspiration than a fixed\r\n\nrule, more a matter of grace than a matter of obligation.  In all\r\n\nevents,  its growth in the  antitrust sphere has  been stunted by\r\n\nHartford Fire, in which the  Court suggested that comity concerns\r                       \r\n\nwould operate  to defeat  the  exercise of  jurisdiction only  in\r\n\nthose  few  cases  in which  the  law  of  the foreign  sovereign\r\n\nrequired a defendant  to act  in a manner  incompatible with  the\r\n\nSherman  Act  or in  which  full compliance  with  both statutory\r\n\nschemes was impossible.

The conduct with which NPI  is charged is\r\n\nillegal  under   both  Japanese   and   American  laws,   thereby\r\n\nalleviating any founded concern about NPI being whipsawed between\r\n\nseparate sovereigns.  And, moreover, to the extent that comity is\r\n\ninformed by general principles of reasonableness, see Restatement\r                                                               \r\n\n(Third)  of Foreign  Relations Law    403, the  indictment lodged\r\n\nagainst  NPI  is well  within the  pale.   In it,  the government\r\n\ncharges  that the  defendant orchestrated  a conspiracy  with the\r\n\nobject of rigging prices in the United States.  If the government\r\n\ncan  prove these charges, we see no tenable reason why principles\r\n\nof comity should shield NPI from  prosecution.  We live in an age\r\n\nof international commerce, where  decisions reached in one corner\r\n\nof  the world can reverberate around  the globe in less time than\r\n\nit takes  to tell the tale.  Thus,  a ruling in NPI's favor would\r\n\ncreate  perverse incentives  for  those who  would use  nefarious\r\n\nmeans to influence  markets in the United  States, rewarding them\r\n\nfor erecting  as many  territorial firewalls as  possible between\r\n\ncause and effect.\r\n\n          We  need go  no  further.

The next question\r\n\n  to  be asked  is whether  there is  any persuasive  reason to\r\n\n  believe that, with regard  to wholly foreign conduct, Section\r\n\n  One in the criminal context is not co-extensive with  Section\r\n\n  One in the civil context.\r\n\n            In answering this  second question, courts must  be\r\n\n  careful to  determine  whether this  construction of  Section\r\n\n  One's   criminal   reach   conforms   with    principles   of\r\n\n  international  law.   \"It  has  been  a  maxim  of  statutory\r\n\n  construction  since the  decision in  Murray v.

This case does present a new  interpretation.  We\r               \r\n\n  are  told this is the  first instance in  which the executive\r\n\n  branch has chosen to interpret the criminal provisions of the\r\n\n  Sherman Act  as reaching conduct wholly  committed outside of\r\n\n  this country's borders.\r\n\n            Changing economic conditions,  as well as different\r\n\n  political  agendas, mean  that antitrust policies  may change\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n  from   administration   to  administration.      The  present\r\n\n  administration  has  promulgated  new  Antitrust  Enforcement\r\n\n  Guidelines   for   International   Operations  which   \"focus\r\n\n  primarily on  situations in which the Sherman  Act will grant\r\n\n  jurisdiction and  when the  United States will  exercise that\r\n\n  jurisdiction\"   internationally.

The instant\r                                                   \r\n\n  case is likely a result of this policy.\r\n\n            It  is  with  this  context in  mind  that  we must\r\n\n  determine if  the exercise of jurisdiction  occasioned by the\r\n\n  decision  of  the executive  branch of  the United  States is\r\n\n  proper in this case.  While courts, including this one, speak\r\n\n  of   determining   congressional  intent   when  interpreting\r\n\n  statutes,  the  meaning of  the  antitrust  laws has  emerged\r\n\n  through   the  relationship  among   all  three  branches  of\r\n\n  government.  In this criminal case, it is  our responsibility\r\n\n  to ensure that the  executive's interpretation of the Sherman\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n  Act does not conflict  with other legal principles, including\r\n\n  principles of international law.\r\n\n            That  question  requires  examination   beyond  the\r\n\n  language  of  Section One  of  the Sherman  Act.   It  is, of\r\n\n  course,  generally true  that,  as a  principle of  statutory\r\n\n  interpretation, the same language should be read the same way\r\n\n  in all contexts  to which the language applies.   But this is\r\n\n  not  invariably true.   New content is  sometimes ascribed to\r\n\n  statutory  terms depending  upon  context.   Cf. Robinson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n  Shell  Oil  Co., 117  S.

As NPI\r\n\n  and  the Government of Japan point out, the Supreme Court has\r\n\n  held  that Section One of the Sherman Act, which defines both\r\n\n  criminal and  civil  violations  with  one  general  phrase,8\r\n\n  \"should  be construed as including intent as an element\" of a\r\n\n  criminal violation.

It  is then worth  asking about the effect  of the\r\n\n  international  law which  Congress presumably  also  meant to\r\n\n  respect.\r\n\n            The content of international  law is determined \"by\r\n\n  reference 'to  the customs  and usages of  civilized nations,\r\n\n  and,  as evidence  of  these, to  the  works of  jurists  and\r\n\n  commentators.'\"  Hilao v.

Indeed, most  people recognize  a distinction\r\n\n  between civil and criminal liability; that the law of nations\r\n\n  should do so as well is not surprising.10  And while Hartford\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Fire  and  earlier judicial  decisions  have  found that  the\r                \r\n\n  antitrust  laws do apply,  in the  civil context,  to foreign\r\n\n  conduct,  this  antitrust  common  law  is  not  the  express\r\n\n  statement of legislative intent that the Restatement suggests\r\n\n  may be appropriate in the criminal context.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  10.  Enforcement of criminal  laws against foreign  nationals\r\n  for  conduct  on  foreign  soil  may  affect  this  country's\r\n  relationship with the foreign  country in somewhat  different\r\n  ways than would  a civil  action.  Congress  could choose  to\r\n  provide  more  explicit guidance  to  the  executive and  the\r\n  courts  in this area if it is concerned about such impacts on\r\n  foreign relations.\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\n            Also relevant to the present inquiry is section 415\r\n\n  (2), which states that:\r\n\n            Any  agreement  in  restraint  of  United\r\n            States trade that is  made outside of the\r\n            United   States,   and  any   conduct  or\r\n            agreement in restraint of such trade that\r\n            is carried out  predominantly outside  of\r\n            the  United  States, are  subject  to the\r\n            jurisdiction to prescribe  of the  United\r\n            States, if  a  principal purpose  of  the\r\n            conduct or agreement is to interfere with\r\n            the commerce of the United States and the\r\n            agreement  or conduct has  some effect on\r\n            that commerce.\r\n\n  Restatement   415(2).   Comment a to Section 415  states that\r                       \r\n\n  the reasonableness principles articulated in Section 403 must\r\n\n  still be satisfied.  See id cmt. a.\r                                       \r\n\n            Application  of these principles  to the indictment\r\n\n  at  issue here leads to  the conclusion that  the exercise of\r\n\n  jurisdiction  is  reasonable in  this  case.   Here,  raising\r\n\n  prices in the United States and Canada was not only a purpose\r                                                                 \r\n\n  of  the   alleged  conspiracy,   it  was   the purpose,  thus\r                                                          \r\n\n  satisfying  Section  415's  \"principal purpose\"  requirement.\r\n\n  Moreover,  Section  415's  requirement  of \"some  effect\"  on\r\n\n  United  States markets  is  amply met  here.   The indictment\r\n\n  alleges that NPI  sold $ 6.1  million of fax  paper into  the\r\n\n  United States during   1990, approximately the period covered\r\n\n  by the charged conspiracy.  In 1990, total sales of fax paper\r\n\n  in  North America  were  approximately $100  million.   NPI's\r\n\n  price increases  thus affected  a not insignificant  share of\r\n\n  the United States market.\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n            These same factors weigh heavily in the Section 403\r\n\n  reasonableness analysis.  Because only North American markets\r\n\n  were  targeted,   the United  States' interest  in combatting\r\n\n  this  activity  appears  to  be  greater  than  the  Japanese\r\n\n  interest, which may only  be the general interest of  a state\r\n\n  in having  its industries  comport with foreign  legal norms.\r\n\n  Japan  has no  interest in  protecting Japanese  consumers in\r\n\n  this case as they were unaffected by  the alleged conspiracy.\r\n\n  The United  States, in  contrast, has  a  strong interest  in\r\n\n  protecting United States consumers,  who were affected by the\r\n\n  increase in prices.   In this situation, it may  be that only\r\n\n  the  United States  has  sufficient incentive  to pursue  the\r\n\n  alleged wrongdoers, thereby providing the necessary deterrent\r\n\n  to similar anticompetitive behavior.   In another case, where\r\n\n  the  consumers of the situs nation were injured as well, that\r\n\n  state's  interest in regulating anticompetitive conduct might\r\n\n  be stronger than it is here.\r\n\n            Other Section 403 factors  also counsel in favor of\r\n\n  the exercise of  jurisdiction here.   The  effects on  United\r\n\n  States markets  were foreseeable and direct.   The Government\r\n\n  of Japan  acknowledges that  antitrust regulation is  part of\r\n\n  the  international  legal system,  and  NPI  does not  really\r\n\n  assert that it  has justified expectations that  were hurt by\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\n  the regulation.11 The only factor  counseling against finding\r\n\n  that  the United States' antitrust laws apply to this conduct\r\n\n  is the fact that the situs  of the conduct was Japan and that\r\n\n  the    principals   were   Japanese   corporations.      This\r\n\n  consideration is inherent in the nature of jurisdiction based\r\n\n  on effects of conduct, where the situs  of the conduct is, by\r\n\n  definition, always a  foreign country.   This alone does  not\r\n\n  tip the balance against jurisdiction.\r\n\n            For these  reasons, I agree with  the majority that\r\n\n  the district court erred in dismissing the indictment.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  11.   While  criminal prosecution may come as a surprise, NPI\r\n  should  have  known  that  civil  antitrust  liability  could\r\n  include  treble  damages.   A corporation  found guilty  of a\r\n  criminal  violation of Section One  is subject to  a fine not\r\n  exceeding $ 10 million.   See 15 U.S.C.   2.   Treble damages\r                                         \r\n  obviously do not include a similar cap.   \r\n\n                                32\r\r\n",

(NPI), a\r\n\nJapanese  manufacturer  of  facsimile  paper.1    The  indictment\r\n\nalleges that in 1990 NPI and certain unnamed  coconspirators held\r\n\na number of meetings in Japan which culminated in an agreement to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  grand jury  also named another  Japanese manufacturer,\r\nJujo  Paper  Co.,  Ltd. (Jujo),  as  a  codefendant.   Two  years\r\nearlier,  however,  NPI  had  been  formed  and,  the  government\r\nalleges, had assumed Jujo's assets and  liabilities.  Because the\r\nissue of successor liability is not before us, we treat NPI as if\r\nit were the sole defendant  and as if it, rather than  Jujo, were\r\nalleged to have committed the acts described in the indictment.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nfix the price of thermal fax paper throughout North America.  NPI\r\n\nand other manufacturers who were  privy to the scheme purportedly\r\n\naccomplished their  objective by selling  the paper  in Japan  to\r\n\nunaffiliated trading  houses on condition that  the latter charge\r\n\nspecified  (inflated) prices for the paper when they resold it in\r\n\nNorth  America.   The trading  houses then  shipped and  sold the\r\n\npaper to their subsidiaries in the United States who in turn sold\r\n\nit to  American  consumers at  swollen  prices.   The  indictment\r\n\nfurther relates that, in  1990 alone, NPI sold thermal  fax paper\r\n\nworth  approximately  $6,100,000  for  eventual import  into  the\r\n\nUnited States; and  that in order  to ensure  the success of  the\r\n\nventure, NPI  monitored the paper  trail and  confirmed that  the\r\n\nprices  charged to  end users  were those  that it  had arranged.\r\n\nThese  activities,  the  indictment  posits,  had  a  substantial\r\n\nadverse effect  on commerce in the United States and unreasonably\r\n\nrestrained  trade in violation of Section One of the Sherman Act,\r\n\n15 U.S.C.   1 (1994).\r\n\n          NPI  moved  to  dismiss  because, inter  alia,  if  the\r                                                                 \r\n\nconduct attributed to NPI occurred at all, it took place entirely\r\n\nin Japan, and,  thus, the  indictment failed to  limn an  offense\r\n\nunder Section One  of the  Sherman Act.   The government  opposed\r\n\nthis initiative on two  grounds.  First, it claimed that  the law\r\n\ndeserved a less grudging reading and that, properly read, Section\r\n\nOne  of the  Sherman  Act applied  criminally  to wholly  foreign\r\n\nconduct as long as that conduct produced substantial and intended\r\n\neffects  within the United States.   Second, it  claimed that the\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nindictment,  too,  deserved a  less  grudging  reading and  that,\r\n\nproperly  read,  the  bill   alleged  a  vertical  conspiracy  in\r\n\nrestraint  of   trade  that   involved  overt  acts   by  certain\r\n\ncoconspirators within the United States.  Accepting a restrictive\r\n\nreading of  both  the statute  and the  indictment, the  district\r\n\ncourt dismissed the case.  See United States v. NPI, 944 F.

Starting with  what Justice\r\n\nHolmes  termed \"the  general and  almost universal  rule\" holding\r\n\n\"that the  character of  an act  as  lawful or  unlawful must  be\r\n\ndetermined wholly  by the  law of  the country  where the  act is\r\n\ndone,\" id. at 356,  and the ancillary proposition that,  in cases\r                    \r\n\nof  doubt, a  statute should  be \"confined  in its  operation and\r\n\neffect to  the territorial  limits  over which  the lawmaker  has\r\n\ngeneral  and legitimate power,\" id.  at 357, the  Court held that\r                                             \r\n\nthe defendant's actions abroad were not proscribed by the Sherman\r\n\nAct.\r\n\n          Our  jurisprudence is  precedent-based, but  it is  not\r\n\nstatic.

In arriving at\r\n\nthis conclusion, we take no view of the government's asseveration\r\n\nthat  the  Foreign  Trade  Antitrust  Improvements  Act  of  1982\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3As  NPI reminds  us,  four Justices  dissented in  Hartford\r                                                                           \r\nFire.

By the same token, NPI's attempt to distinguish\r\nHartford Fire on  the ground that  the defendants there  conceded\r                       \r\nthe United  States' jurisdiction over their conduct fails for two\r\nreasons.\r\n      In the first place, the assertion is no more than a play on\r\nwords.  The  majority opinion  in Hartford Fire  stated that  the\r                                                         \r\ndistrict court  \"undoubtedly\"  had jurisdiction  over  the  civil\r\nclaims, \"as the  London reinsurers apparently  concede.\"  Id.  at\r                                                                       \r\n795.   It is obvious, therefore, that jurisdiction did not depend\r\non   the  concession;   to  the   contrary,  jurisdiction   would\r\n\"undoubtedly\"  have existed in any  event.  In  the second place,\r\none  of the  London  defendants did  not  join in  this  apparent\r\nconcession,  but the  Court  nonetheless  held  that  defendant's\r\nforeign conduct to be within the Sherman Act's proscriptive ambit\r\nbecause it was part of a scheme which \"was intended to and did in\r\nfact  produce  a substantial  effect  on  the American  insurance\r\nmarket.\"  Id. at 795 n.21.\r                       \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n(FTAIA), 15  U.S.C.   6a (1994), makes  manifest Congress' intent\r\n\nto  apply  the Sherman  Act  extraterritorially.   The  FTAIA  is\r\n\ninelegantly phrased  and the court  in Hartford Fire  declined to\r                                                              \r\n\nplace any weight on it.

This\r\n\nis  largely  uncharted terrain;  we  are  aware of  no  authority\r\n\ndirectly on point, and the parties have cited none.\r\n\n          Be that as  it may,  one datum sticks  out like a  sore\r\n\nthumb:  in both criminal and civil cases,  the claim that Section\r\n\nOne applies extraterritorially is  based on the same language  in\r\n\nthe  same  section  of  the  same   statute:    \"Every  contract,\r\n\ncombination  in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in\r\n\nrestraint  of trade or commerce among the several States, or with\r\n\nforeign nations,  is declared  to be  illegal.\"   15 U.S.C.    1.\r\n\nWords may sometimes be chameleons, possessing different shades of\r\n\nmeaning in  different contexts, see,  e.g., Hanover  Ins.

The  words of\r\n\nSection  One have not changed since the Hartford Fire Court found\r                                                               \r\n\nthat they clearly  evince Congress' intent  to apply the  Sherman\r\n\nAct  extraterritorially  in  civil   actions,  and  it  would  be\r\n\ndisingenuous  for us  to pretend  that the  words had  lost their\r\n\nclarity simply  because this  is  a criminal  proceeding.   Thus,\r\n\nunless some special  circumstance obtains in this  case, there is\r\n\nno principled way in which we can uphold the order of dismissal.\r\n\n          NPI and its  amicus, the Government of Japan, urge that\r\n\nspecial  reasons   exist  for   measuring  Section  One's   reach\r\n\ndifferently  in  a  criminal context.    We  have  reviewed their\r\n\nexhortations and found  them hollow.   We discuss  the five  most\r\n\npromising theses below.  The rest do not require comment.\r\n\n          1.  Lack of Precedent.  NPI and its amicus make much of\r                    1.  Lack of Precedent.\r                                         \r\n\nthe fact that this appears to be the first criminal case in which\r\n\nthe  United States  endeavors  to extend  Section  One to  wholly\r\n\nforeign conduct.   We are not  impressed.  There is  a first time\r\n\nfor everything, and  the absence of  earlier criminal actions  is\r\n\nprobably more  a demonstration of the  increasingly global nature\r\n\nof  our economy than proof  that Section One  cannot cover wholly\r\n\nforeign conduct in the criminal milieu.\r\n\n          Moreover,   this  argument   overstates  the   lack  of\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nprecedent.  There is, for example, solid authority for applying a\r\n\nstate's criminal  statute to  conduct occurring  entirely outside\r\n\nthe state's borders.  See Strassheim v.

In view of the  fact\r\n\nthat the Supreme  Court deems it \"well  established\" that Section\r\n\nOne  of  the  Sherman  Act  applies  to  wholly foreign  conduct,\r\n\nHartford Fire,  509 U.S.  at 796,  we effectively are  foreclosed\r                       \r\n\nfrom trying to tease an ambiguity  out of Section One relative to\r\n\nits extraterritorial  application.

Comity is more an  aspiration than a fixed\r\n\nrule, more a matter of grace than a matter of obligation.  In all\r\n\nevents,  its growth in the  antitrust sphere has  been stunted by\r\n\nHartford Fire, in which the  Court suggested that comity concerns\r                       \r\n\nwould operate  to defeat  the  exercise of  jurisdiction only  in\r\n\nthose  few  cases  in which  the  law  of  the foreign  sovereign\r\n\nrequired a defendant  to act  in a manner  incompatible with  the\r\n\nSherman  Act  or in  which  full compliance  with  both statutory\r\n\nschemes was impossible.   See Hartford Fire, 509 U.S.  at 798-99;\r                                                     \r\n\nsee  also Kenneth  W.

Accordingly, the Hartford Fire Court  gave short\r                                                         \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nshrift to the  defendants' entreaty that  the conduct leading  to\r\n\nantitrust liability  was perfectly  legal in the  United Kingdom.\r\n\nSee Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 798-99.\r                           \r\n\n          In  this case the  defendant's comity-based argument is\r\n\neven more attenuated.   The conduct with which NPI  is charged is\r\n\nillegal  under   both  Japanese   and   American  laws,   thereby\r\n\nalleviating any founded concern about NPI being whipsawed between\r\n\nseparate sovereigns.  And, moreover, to the extent that comity is\r\n\ninformed by general principles of reasonableness, see Restatement\r                                                               \r\n\n(Third)  of Foreign  Relations Law    403, the  indictment lodged\r\n\nagainst  NPI  is well  within the  pale.   In it,  the government\r\n\ncharges  that the  defendant orchestrated  a conspiracy  with the\r\n\nobject of rigging prices in the United States.  If the government\r\n\ncan  prove these charges, we see no tenable reason why principles\r\n\nof comity should shield NPI from  prosecution.  We live in an age\r\n\nof international commerce, where  decisions reached in one corner\r\n\nof  the world can reverberate around  the globe in less time than\r\n\nit takes  to tell the tale.  Thus,  a ruling in NPI's favor would\r\n\ncreate  perverse incentives  for  those who  would use  nefarious\r\n\nmeans to influence  markets in the United  States, rewarding them\r\n\nfor erecting  as many  territorial firewalls as  possible between\r\n\ncause and effect.\r\n\n          We  need go  no  further.

This case does present a new  interpretation.  We\r               \r\n\n  are  told this is the  first instance in  which the executive\r\n\n  branch has chosen to interpret the criminal provisions of the\r\n\n  Sherman Act  as reaching conduct wholly  committed outside of\r\n\n  this country's borders.\r\n\n            Changing economic conditions,  as well as different\r\n\n  political  agendas, mean  that antitrust policies  may change\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n  from   administration   to  administration.      The  present\r\n\n  administration  has  promulgated  new  Antitrust  Enforcement\r\n\n  Guidelines   for   International   Operations  which   \"focus\r\n\n  primarily on  situations in which the Sherman  Act will grant\r\n\n  jurisdiction and  when the  United States will  exercise that\r\n\n  jurisdiction\"   internationally.      Brockbank,   The   1995\r                                                                         \r\n\n  International  Antitrust  Guidelines:   The  Reach  of   U.S.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  Antitrust  Law Continues to Expand, 2 J.

The   new  Guidelines  reflect   a  stronger\r\n\n  enforcement stance  than earlier versions  of the Guidelines,\r\n\n  and  have been described as a \"warning to foreign governments\r\n\n  and  enterprises that  the  [antitrust enforcement]  Agencies\r\n\n  intend  to  actively  pursue restraints  on  trade  occurring\r\n\n  abroad  that  adversely  affect American  markets  or  damage\r\n\n  American exporting opportunities.\"  Id. at *21.   The instant\r                                                   \r\n\n  case is likely a result of this policy.\r\n\n            It  is  with  this  context in  mind  that  we must\r\n\n  determine if  the exercise of jurisdiction  occasioned by the\r\n\n  decision  of  the executive  branch of  the United  States is\r\n\n  proper in this case.  While courts, including this one, speak\r\n\n  of   determining   congressional  intent   when  interpreting\r\n\n  statutes,  the  meaning of  the  antitrust  laws has  emerged\r\n\n  through   the  relationship  among   all  three  branches  of\r\n\n  government.  In this criminal case, it is  our responsibility\r\n\n  to ensure that the  executive's interpretation of the Sherman\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n  Act does not conflict  with other legal principles, including\r\n\n  principles of international law.\r\n\n            That  question  requires  examination   beyond  the\r\n\n  language  of  Section One  of  the Sherman  Act.   It  is, of\r\n\n  course,  generally true  that,  as a  principle of  statutory\r\n\n  interpretation, the same language should be read the same way\r\n\n  in all contexts  to which the language applies.   But this is\r\n\n  not  invariably true.   New content is  sometimes ascribed to\r\n\n  statutory  terms depending  upon  context.   Cf.

Congress  could choose  to\r\n  provide  more  explicit guidance  to  the  executive and  the\r\n  courts  in this area if it is concerned about such impacts on\r\n  foreign relations.\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\n            Also relevant to the present inquiry is section 415\r\n\n  (2), which states that:\r\n\n            Any  agreement  in  restraint  of  United\r\n            States trade that is  made outside of the\r\n            United   States,   and  any   conduct  or\r\n            agreement in restraint of such trade that\r\n            is carried out  predominantly outside  of\r\n            the  United  States, are  subject  to the\r\n            jurisdiction to prescribe  of the  United\r\n            States, if  a  principal purpose  of  the\r\n            conduct or agreement is to interfere with\r\n            the commerce of the United States and the\r\n            agreement  or conduct has  some effect on\r\n            that commerce.\r\n\n  Restatement   415(2).   Comment a to Section 415  states that\r                       \r\n\n  the reasonableness principles articulated in Section 403 must\r\n\n  still be satisfied.  See id cmt. a.\r                                       \r\n\n            Application  of these principles  to the indictment\r\n\n  at  issue here leads to  the conclusion that  the exercise of\r\n\n  jurisdiction  is  reasonable in  this  case.   Here,  raising\r\n\n  prices in the United States and Canada was not only a purpose\r                                                                 \r\n\n  of  the   alleged  conspiracy,   it  was   the purpose,  thus\r                                                          \r\n\n  satisfying  Section  415's  \"principal purpose\"  requirement.\r\n\n  Moreover,  Section  415's  requirement  of \"some  effect\"  on\r\n\n  United  States markets  is  amply met  here.   The indictment\r\n\n  alleges that NPI  sold $ 6.1  million of fax  paper into  the\r\n\n  United States during   1990, approximately the period covered\r\n\n  by the charged conspiracy.  In 1990, total sales of fax paper\r\n\n  in  North America  were  approximately $100  million.   NPI's\r\n\n  price increases  thus affected  a not insignificant  share of\r\n\n  the United States market.\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n            These same factors weigh heavily in the Section 403\r\n\n  reasonableness analysis.  Because only North American markets\r\n\n  were  targeted,   the United  States' interest  in combatting\r\n\n  this  activity  appears  to  be  greater  than  the  Japanese\r\n\n  interest, which may only  be the general interest of  a state\r\n\n  in having  its industries  comport with foreign  legal norms.\r\n\n  Japan  has no  interest in  protecting Japanese  consumers in\r\n\n  this case as they were unaffected by  the alleged conspiracy.\r\n\n  The United  States, in  contrast, has  a  strong interest  in\r\n\n  protecting United States consumers,  who were affected by the\r\n\n  increase in prices.   In this situation, it may  be that only\r\n\n  the  United States  has  sufficient incentive  to pursue  the\r\n\n  alleged wrongdoers, thereby providing the necessary deterrent\r\n\n  to similar anticompetitive behavior.   In another case, where\r\n\n  the  consumers of the situs nation were injured as well, that\r\n\n  state's  interest in regulating anticompetitive conduct might\r\n\n  be stronger than it is here.\r\n\n            Other Section 403 factors  also counsel in favor of\r\n\n  the exercise of  jurisdiction here.   The  effects on  United\r\n\n  States markets  were foreseeable and direct.   The Government\r\n\n  of Japan  acknowledges that  antitrust regulation is  part of\r\n\n  the  international  legal system,  and  NPI  does not  really\r\n\n  assert that it  has justified expectations that  were hurt by\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\n  the regulation.11 The only factor  counseling against finding\r\n\n  that  the United States' antitrust laws apply to this conduct\r\n\n  is the fact that the situs  of the conduct was Japan and that\r\n\n  the    principals   were   Japanese   corporations.      This\r\n\n  consideration is inherent in the nature of jurisdiction based\r\n\n  on effects of conduct, where the situs  of the conduct is, by\r\n\n  definition, always a  foreign country.   This alone does  not\r\n\n  tip the balance against jurisdiction.\r\n\n            For these  reasons, I agree with  the majority that\r\n\n  the district court erred in dismissing the indictment.\r\n\n                      \r                                \r\n\n  11.   While  criminal prosecution may come as a surprise, NPI\r\n  should  have  known  that  civil  antitrust  liability  could\r\n  include  treble  damages.   A corporation  found guilty  of a\r\n  criminal  violation of Section One  is subject to  a fine not\r\n  exceeding $ 10 million.   See 15 U.S.C.   2.   Treble damages\r                                         \r\n  obviously do not include a similar cap.   \r\n\n                                32\r\r\n</pre>",
