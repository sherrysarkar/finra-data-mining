Challenging the constitutional\n\nsufficiency       of    the   process   employed         by    the     government     in\n\nforfeiting       two    motor    vehicles,     petitioner-appellant             Manuel\n\nGonzález-González (González) moved in the district court for\n\nrecovery of the seized property.               See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e).\n\nThe district court properly treated González's Rule 41(e) motion\n\nas a civil complaint and summarily dismissed it.                              González\n\nappeals.       Sua sponte dismissals are strong medicine, and should\n\nbe dispensed sparingly.           Given the circumstances of this case,\n\na sua sponte dismissal cannot be justified.                       Consequently, we\n\nvacate     the     lower      court's   order      and        remand    for    further\n\nproceedings.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               The record is sketchy, and we paste together the facts\n\nsurrounding       the   forfeitures     as    best   we       can.      We    take   the\n\ncontroverted facts — at least, those controverted facts that are\n\nneither inherently incredible nor flatly contradicted by the\n\nrecord — in the light most favorable to González's theory of the\n\ncase.    See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 99 (1976); Dartmouth\n\nReview v. Dartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n               A decade ago, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\n\nmounted    a     full-court     press   in    an   endeavor       to    dismantle     an\n\nextensive drug-smuggling operation headquartered in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fSee United States v. González-González, 136 F.3d 6, 7-8 (1st\n\nCir.   1998)    (providing    an     account    of    the    ring's   illegal\n\nactivities and the government's response).                  On September 29,\n\n1993, a federal grand jury handed up a sealed indictment that\n\ncharged González and fifteen other individuals with a myriad of\n\noffenses, including importation of large quantities of cocaine\n\nand marijuana, as well as conspiracy to possess and distribute\n\nboth drugs.      See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846, 952.              The indictment\n\nalso charged González with several counts of money laundering.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1956.      The government based four such counts, in\n\npart, on the testimony of a cooperating witness who said that\n\nGonzález had dipped into drug proceeds to fund the purchase of\n\nfour motor vehicles (two Mitsubishi Monteros and two Toyota\n\nCorollas).      He added that one of González's confederates had\n\nprovided false names and addresses for use in registering the\n\nvehicles.\n\n            On October 5, 1993, the district court unsealed the\n\nindictment.     The FBI promptly arrested eleven of the sixteen\n\ndefendants and seized the two cars at issue here — a 1993\n\nMontero   and   a   1993   Corolla   —   from   individuals     residing   in\n\nTrujillo Alto.      The agents furnished each of these individuals\n\nwith a notice that outlined the basis for the seizure and the\n\nprocedure for contesting forfeiture.                 Subsequent appraisals\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\findicate that, when seized, the Montero was worth approximately\n\n$25,300 and the Corolla approximately $13,900.            See 21 C.F.R. §\n\n1316.74    (providing    for    post-seizure   appraisals    of   property\n\nslated for forfeiture).\n\n            Despite the indictment, González eluded arrest.            That\n\nwas not surprising; in 1980, he had been indicted for narcotics\n\noffenses, but not apprehended, in the Southern District of\n\nFlorida.    He remained a fugitive and was convicted in absentia\n\nin the Florida case.           González was still at large when the\n\ngovernment proceeded, in the winter of 1993-1994, to effect an\n\nadministrative forfeiture of the confiscated automobiles.               See\n\n21 U.S.C. § 881.\n\n            As a first step, the United States sent notice by\n\ncertified    mail   to    the     persons   named   on    the     vehicles'\n\nregistrations, at the addresses specified thereon.                  See 19\n\nU.S.C. § 1607(a) (directing, in relevant part, that \"[w]ritten\n\nnotice of seizure together with information on the applicable\n\nprocedures [for contesting forfeiture] shall be sent to each\n\nparty who appears to have an interest in the seized article\").\n\nEach notice explained the reasons for both the seizure and the\n\nplanned    forfeiture,    detailed    the   appropriate    procedure    for\n\ncontesting forfeiture, and designated March 14, 1994 as the\n\ndeadline for taking preventative action.            These letters were\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fmailed on January 26, 1994, but there is nothing in the record\n\nto indicate whether they reached their intended destinations.\n\n            On February 13, 20, and 27, the government published\n\na notice of the forfeiture proceedings in consecutive Sunday\n\neditions    of    the   New    York    Times.      See   id.   (requiring    such\n\npublication in a newspaper of general circulation).                   The notice\n\nallowed thirty days from the date of the first publication\n\nwithin which to request relief from the planned forfeiture.1 See\n\n21 C.F.R. § 1316.79.          On April 20, 1994, both cars were declared\n\nforfeit to the United States.                 See 19 U.S.C. § 1609(a); 21\n\nC.F.R. § 1316.77(b).\n\n            The government acknowledges that it gave no personal\n\nnotice to González, but asserts that FBI agents were unable to\n\nlocate him until August 10, 1994 (when they finally arrested him\n\nin Miami).       González demurs, alleging that the government knew\n\nall along where he was living (or, alternatively, where notice\n\nby   mail   could    efficaciously       be     given    to   him).    Moreover,\n\ntestimony    at     González's        bail    hearing    indicates    that   the\n\ngovernment may have known his whereabouts but eschewed an arrest\n\n\n\n      1\n     Although the record does not contain a copy of the\npublished notice, we take the dates of publication and the\ndescription of the text from the declaration of forfeiture. We\nassume, on the same basis, that the contents of the published\nnotice complied with the applicable regulations. See 21 C.F.R.\n§ 1316.75(b).\n\n                                        -6-\n\ffor   some      time    in   order      to     avoid     compromising    a    related\n\ninvestigation.\n\n             On    November        2,   1994,      the   government     obtained      a\n\nsuperseding indictment which, despite other modifications, left\n\nthe four money laundering counts intact.                    On January 17, 1995,\n\nGonzález moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that\n\nforfeiture        of   the   two    cars      constituted    punishment      for   the\n\noffenses     charged     (and,      therefore,       that   the   Double     Jeopardy\n\nClause barred prosecution).                   The district court denied the\n\nmotion.      After a nineteen-day trial, a jury found González\n\nguilty on all counts and the district court sentenced him to\n\nlife imprisonment.            We affirmed the conviction and sentence.\n\nGonzález-González, 136 F.3d at 7.\n\n             Nearly six years after the initial seizure of the two\n\nvehicles and more than five years after the administrative\n\nforfeiture proceedings had been completed, González filed a pro\n\nse motion for return of the automobiles or, in lieu thereof,\n\ntheir cash value when seized.                      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e)\n\n(authorizing \"[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful . . . seizure\n\nor by the deprivation of property\" to move \"for the return of\n\nthe property on the ground that such person is entitled to\n\nlawful possession of [it]\").                 In this motion (filed on July 19,\n\n1999),     he      argued     that      the     notices     of    forfeiture       were\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fconstitutionally          defective      since     the    government     knew     his\n\nwhereabouts at the time and failed to make any real effort to\n\nnotify him by mail or otherwise.                    On August 18, 1999, the\n\ndistrict court, acting sua sponte, rejected González's entreaty\n\nwithout comment.          González now appeals from the court's summary\n\ndenial of both his original motion for return of property and\n\nhis subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n          In       the    pages   that    follow,    we    limn   the    nature    of\n\nadministrative       forfeiture        proceedings,       elaborate     the   notice\n\nrequired to satisfy due process, and verify the posture in which\n\nthis appeal arises.          We then resolve the instant dispute.\n\n\n\n              A.   Administrative Forfeiture Proceedings.\n\n          Congress has provided for the civil forfeiture of money\n\nor property traceable to the avails of drug trafficking.                      See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 881(a)(6).          To facilitate such forfeitures, Congress\n\nincorporated by explicit reference the venerable procedures for\n\ncivil forfeiture set out in the customs laws.                     Id. § 881(d).\n\nUnder this regimen, the government may forfeit property worth\n\n$500,000 or less administratively.                 See 19 U.S.C. § 1607.           If\n\nthe government chooses to travel this path, it must publish\n\nnotice   of    its       intent   to     forfeit    the    property     for     three\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fsuccessive weeks and supplement that publication by sending\n\nwritten notice to any party known to have an interest in the\n\nproperty.    Id. § 1607(a); 21 C.F.R. § 1316.75.\n\n            The giving of notice shifts the burden of going forward\n\nto those persons who persist in claiming an interest in the\n\nproperty.    Claimants have twenty days from the first published\n\nnotice within which to file claims.           19 U.S.C. § 1608.      A timely\n\nclaim, accompanied by a cost bond, aborts the administrative\n\nprocess and forces the government to proceed in court.               See id.;\n\nsee also 21 C.F.R. § 1316.76(b).            If no interested party files\n\nsuch a claim, however, the government can proceed to declare the\n\nproperty forfeit without judicial intervention.                 See 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1609.\n\n            Despite    Congress's    erection     of    this   framework   for\n\nadministrative forfeitures, the judiciary continues to play a\n\nlimited role in such matters.              Pertinently, district courts\n\nretain the authority to entertain constitutional challenges to\n\nadministrative forfeitures.          See United States v. Giraldo, 45\n\nF.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam);                   see also United\n\nStates v. Mosquera, 845 F.2d 1122, 1126 (1st Cir. 1988) (per\n\ncuriam)   (noting     that    district   courts   have    federal    question\n\njurisdiction    over    due    process     challenges    to    administrative\n\nforfeitures).          The    fact   that     a   claimant       cloaks    his\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fconstitutional challenge in the garb of a Rule 41(e) motion does\n\nnot alter this reality; in that event, the court simply will\n\ntreat such a motion as a civil complaint.             Giraldo, 45 F.3d at\n\n511.\n\n                           B.   Reasonable Notice.\n\n              The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states that\n\n\"[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or\n\nproperty, without due process of law.\"              U.S. Const. amend. V.\n\nThese words require \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the\n\ncircumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of\n\n[a legal] action and afford them an opportunity to present their\n\nobjections.\"         Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339\n\nU.S.   306,    314    (1950).      Accordingly,   \"[t]he    essence    of    due\n\nprocess is the requirement that a person in jeopardy of serious\n\nloss [be given] notice of the case against him and opportunity\n\nto meet it.\"         Matthews v.    Eldridge 424 U.S. 319, 348 (1976)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Consistent with these precepts, due process, in the\n\nforfeiture      context,    minimally    requires    that    the    government\n\nprovide an individual with \"notice and an opportunity to be\n\nheard\" before confiscating his property.            United States v. James\n\nDaniel Good Real Prop., 510 U.S. 43, 46 (1993).                    Because due\n\nprocess   is     an    infinitely     flexible    concept,    there     is   no\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\finfallible test for determining the adequacy of notice in any\n\nparticular situation.           The touchstone is reasonableness:                the\n\ngovernment must afford notice sensibly calculated to inform the\n\ninterested party of the contemplated forfeiture and to offer him\n\na fair chance to present his claim of entitlement.                   See Mullane,\n\n339 U.S. at 314.        Whether the notice actually given is or is not\n\nreasonable      invariably      depends    on   the    circumstances        of   the\n\nindividual case.         See Garcia v. Meza, 235 F.3d 287, 291 (7th\n\nCir. 2000); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)\n\n(explaining      that    due     process      \"calls   for    such     procedural\n\nprotections as the particular situation demands\").\n\n           That    said,       the   precedents    shed   some      light   on   the\n\ngovernment's obligation to notify parties in interest.                           For\n\ninstance, the case law has begun to define what the government\n\nmust do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison\n\ninmate.   See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home\n\naddress   and    place    of    immurement);      Giraldo,     45    F.3d   at   511\n\n(noting that would-be confiscator must take affirmative steps to\n\nlocate owner who is in government custody).                  Even fugitives may\n\nbe entitled to efforts at personal notice.                See United States v.\n\nRodgers, 108 F.3d 1247, 1253-54 (10th Cir. 1997) (declaring\n\nattempted notice to fugitive unreasonable when sent to invalid\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\faddress and not sent to known residence).              The precedents also\n\nsuggest the value of a pragmatic approach to issues of notice.\n\nIf, say, an interested party has actual knowledge of ongoing\n\nforfeiture proceedings from other sources, inadequacies in the\n\nnotice afforded by the government will not work a deprivation of\n\ndue process.    Whiting, 231 F.3d at 74.\n\n                  C.    The District Court's Order.\n\n           Because the criminal case no longer was pending when\n\nGonzález     sought    relief    from    forfeiture,     the   lower   court\n\nappropriately treated González's Rule 41(e) motion as a civil\n\ncomplaint.     See Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511.            Thus, the government\n\nhad sixty days to reply to it.          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(3)(A).\n\nThe court, however, did not wait for the government to respond;\n\nit issued what amounted to an order of dismissal before the\n\ngovernment    acted    (and     well    before   the    sixty-day   deadline\n\narrived).2     Consequently, we have no choice but to treat the\n\ncourt's summary order as a sua sponte dismissal.\n\n\n     2González argues that the response time had expired because\nthe district court's local rules allow only ten days to reply to\na motion. See D.P.R. R. 311(5). That rule, however, specifies\nthe general response time for motions, not for civil complaints.\nGonzález happily took advantage of the district court's\nwillingness to exercise jurisdiction by treating his Rule 41(e)\nmotion as a civil complaint, and he cannot now argue that the\ntime limit for answering a complaint was inapposite. After all,\n\"[h]aving one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in\nthis circuit.\" United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st\nCir. 1985).\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            The type of sua sponte dismissal here at issue — a\n\ndismissal on the court's own initiative, without affording the\n\nplaintiff either notice or an opportunity to be heard — is\n\ndisfavored in federal practice.     If a defendant files a motion\n\nto dismiss for failure to state a claim, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6), the plaintiff, as a practical matter, has notice of\n\nthe motion and an opportunity to amend the complaint as of\n\nright, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).        But where, as here, a court\n\njettisons an action sua sponte, the dismissal deprives the\n\nplaintiff of these core protections.         Thus, the standard for\n\nupholding such a sua sponte dismissal is more rigorous than the\n\n\"failure to state a claim\" standard of Rule 12(b)(6).              Cf.\n\nNeitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989) (explaining that\n\nsua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 is warranted only if\n\na complaint is \"based on an indisputably meritless legal theory\"\n\nor is \"clearly baseless\").\n\n            This does not mean, of course, that every sua sponte\n\ndismissal    entered   without   prior   notice   to   the   plaintiff\n\nautomatically must be reversed.     If it is crystal clear that the\n\nplaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would\n\nbe futile, then a sua sponte dismissal may stand.            Curley v.\n\nPerry, 246 F.3d 1278, 1281-82 (10th Cir. 2001); Wyatt v. City of\n\nBoston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994); Smith v. Boyd, 945\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fF.2d 1041, 1043 (8th Cir. 1991); Shockley v. Jones, 823 F.2d\n\n1068, 1072-73 (7th Cir. 1987).    But haste makes waste, and it\n\nwill be the rare case in which a sua sponte dismissal — at\n\nleast, a sua sponte dismissal without leave to amend —      will be\n\nupheld.   See Razzoli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 230 F.2d 371,\n\n377 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Perez v. Ortiz, 849 F.2d 793, 797 (2d Cir.\n\n1988); Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, 482 F.2d 372, 374 (1st Cir.\n\n1973); see also Clorox Co. v. Proctor & Gamble Comm'l Co., 228\n\nF.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2000) (emphasizing that considerations of\n\n\"basic fairness,\" as well as \"sound prudential reasons,\" counsel\n\nagainst most uses of the power to dismiss cases sua sponte).\n\n          In short, sua sponte dismissals are risky business.\n\nWe will uphold a sua sponte order of dismissal only if the\n\nallegations contained in the complaint, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, are patently meritless and beyond\n\nall hope of redemption.    We must measure the district court's\n\ndismissal of González's Rule 41(e) motion by this yardstick.\n\n                      D.   The Bottom Line.\n\n          We afford de novo review to orders for sua sponte\n\ndismissal.   Cf. Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d\n\n12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying de novo review to an order of\n\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)).       The United States argues that\n\nthe lower court's order survives such review.     Its central theme\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fis that we should pay no heed to González's allegations because\n\nthe record itself refutes them.       This argument lacks force.\n\nGonzález's allegations are reasonably specific and the nisi\n\nprius roll, in its present sparsely developed form, provides\n\nlittle more than food for speculation.\n\n          We need not rehearse every pertinent detail, for one\n\nexample will suffice.    A crucial area of dispute involves the\n\nextent of the government's knowledge, in late 1993 and early\n\n1994, anent González's whereabouts.    González has made specific\n\nassertions that the FBI knew his whereabouts all along; that, at\n\nany rate, the agents had available to them addresses at which\n\nnotice might effectively have been given to him; and that the\n\ngovernment disregarded this knowledge, preferring instead to\n\ngive notice to the vehicle custodians (whom it had every reason\n\nto believe were mere straws) and to send letters to addresses\n\nthat its own informant had disclosed were contrived.\n\n          The government, in its brief and at oral argument,\n\noffers a much different version of the facts.   It claims that it\n\ncould not locate González even to arrest him, let alone to\n\nnotify him of the commencement of forfeiture proceedings, and\n\nthat it did not know how to ensure that he receive personal\n\nnotice.   In a nutshell, the government says that it did the best\n\nthat it could.\n\n\n                              -15-\n\f           These dueling versions of the facts set the parties on\n\na collision course.           That, in turn, ends this aspect of our\n\ninquiry.       While it is curious to think that the government\n\neffectively could serve notice on a fugitive, the law required\n\nthe district court, before essaying a sua sponte dismissal, to\n\nassume the truth of González's fact-specific averments.                          If the\n\ngovernment knew how to notify González directly and did not\n\nutilize that information, notification given in hand to the\n\ncars' custodians (known by the government to be placeholders)\n\nand   mailed    to    the    cars'        registered      owners    (known      by   the\n\ngovernment to be fictitious persons) might well fall short of\n\nthe   constitutional          minimum,         even     when     coupled      with   the\n\npublication     of    a    notice    in    a    newspaper       that,    in   fairness,\n\nGonzález was unlikely to read.                 See United States v. Woodall, 12\n\nF.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"When the government has actual\n\nknowledge of an interested party's whereabouts at the time\n\nforfeiture     is    commenced,      failure       to    direct    the     statutorily\n\nrequired personal notice to that address cannot be considered\n\ncompliance     with       either    the    statute      or     minimum   due    process\n\nstandards.\").         Further       proceedings         are    needed    to    permit   a\n\nreasoned resolution of this factual conflict.\n\n           The government has a fallback position.                            It argues\n\nthat, regardless of what the FBI knew, the record conclusively\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\fdemonstrates that González had actual notice of the seizure.\n\nBuilding   on    this   foundation,    the    government,   citing   United\n\nStates v. One 1987 Jeep Wrangler Auto., 972 F.2d 472, 482 (2d\n\nCir. 1992), posits that the district court's disposition was\n\njustified because actual knowledge of a seizure precludes a\n\nnotice-based constitutional challenge to an ensuing forfeiture.\n\n           We reject this proposition.           Assuming, arguendo, that\n\nthe government can show actual notice of the vehicles' seizure\n\non González's part at the relevant time, the Second Circuit\n\napparently      has   retreated   from     its   earlier    precedent   and\n\nintimated that actual knowledge of forfeiture is required to\n\nexcuse a due process shortfall.        See Ikelionwu v. United States,\n\n150 F.3d 233, 238 (2d Cir. 1998).            Wholly apart from the Second\n\nCircuit's view, we ourselves believe that the actual knowledge\n\nrequired to defeat a notice-based due process challenge is\n\nadvance notice-in-fact of forfeiture proceedings, as opposed to\n\nnotice-in-fact of seizure.          See Whiting, 231 F.3d at 74 (so\n\nstating, albeit in dictum).         Here, González asserts that he was\n\nnot aware of the forfeiture until the end of 1994 (well after\n\nthe   forfeiture      proceedings     were    complete).      Because   the\n\ngovernment identifies nothing in the record which categorically\n\ncontradicts that assertion, a sua sponte dismissal cannot be\n\njustified on the basis of actual knowledge.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f             The government makes a last-ditch effort to preserve\n\nits district court victory.            Pointing to the five-and-one-\n\nquarter year gap between the forfeiture of the cars and the\n\ncommencement of this action, the government asseverates that\n\nGonzález's complaint is barred by laches.                This asseveration\n\nneed not detain us.            Laches is an affirmative defense.           K-\n\nMart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 911 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)    (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)).         Accordingly, the burden\n\nof proving it rests with its proponent.            See id.      There is no\n\nprincipled     way    that   the   district     court,     without    better\n\ninformation than it had before it in August of 1999, could grant\n\njudgment for the government on such a factbound theory.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further.     González invites us to declare\n\nthe    forfeiture    void,   whereas   the    government    invites   us   to\n\nconfirm its validity.        We decline both invitations.         The facts\n\nasserted in the Rule 41(e) motion, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to González, invite skepticism, but we cannot say that\n\nthey reveal a patently meritless claim.             That means that the\n\ndistrict court's sua sponte order for dismissal cannot endure.\n\nIt    does   not   mean,   however,    that   González     is   entitled   to\n\njudgment.     Since the district court foreclosed the government\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\ffrom telling its side of the story, we must remand the case for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n            On    remand,   the   court       should    fix     a    time       for   the\n\ngovernment to respond to the complaint and, in due course,\n\nshould determine whether, in the particular circumstances of\n\nthis case, the government's efforts to notify González of the\n\nforfeiture proceedings were reasonable.                If the court finds that\n\nthe   government's    actions     did    not    attain        the   constitutional\n\nminimum,    the    court    should     then     consider       the    government's\n\naffirmative      defenses   (including         but   not      limited      to    actual\n\nknowledge    and   laches).       We    take    no     view    on    any    of    these\n\nquestions.\n\n\n\nVacated and remanded.        No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is sketchy, and we paste together the facts surrounding the forfeitures as best we can. We take the controverted facts - at least, those controverted facts that are neither inherently incredible nor flatly contradicted by the record - in the light most favorable to Gonzaalez's theory of the case. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 99 (1976); Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decade ago, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) mounted a full-court press in an endeavor to dismantle an extensive drug-smuggling operation headquartered in Puerto Rico. See United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d 6, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1998) (providing an account of the ring's illegal activities and the government's response). On September 29, 1993, a federal grand jury handed up a sealed indictment that charged Gonzalez and fifteen other individuals with a myriad of offenses, including importation of large quantities of cocaine and marijuana, as well as conspiracy to possess and distribute both drugs. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 841, 846, 952. The indictment also charged Gonzalez with several counts of money laundering. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956. The government based four such counts, in part, on the testimony of a cooperating witness who said that Gonzalez had dipped into drug proceeds to fund the purchase of four motor vehicles (two Mitsubishi Monteros and two Toyota Corollas). He added that one of Gonzalez's confederates had provided false names and addresses for use in registering the vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1993, the district court unsealed the indictment. The FBI promptly arrested eleven of the sixteen defendants and seized the two cars at issue here - a 1993 Montero and a 1993 Corolla - from individuals residing in Trujillo Alto. The agents furnished each of these individuals with a notice that outlined the basis for the seizure and the procedure for contesting forfeiture. Subsequent appraisals indicate that, when seized, the Montero was worth approximately $25,300 and the Corolla approximately $13,900. See 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.74 (providing for post-seizure appraisals of property slated for forfeiture).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the indictment, Gonzalez eluded arrest. That was not surprising; in 1980, he had been indicted for narcotics offenses, but not apprehended, in the Southern District of Florida. He remained a fugitive and was convicted in absentia in the Florida case. Gonzalez was still at large when the government proceeded, in the winter of 1993-1994, to effect an administrative forfeiture of the confiscated automobiles. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 881.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a first step, the United States sent notice by certified mail to the persons named on the vehicles' registrations, at the addresses specified thereon. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1607(a) (directing, in relevant part, that \"[w]ritten notice of seizure together with information on the applicable procedures [for contesting forfeiture] shall be sent to each party who appears to have an interest in the seized article\"). Each notice explained the reasons for both the seizure and the planned forfeiture, detailed the appropriate procedure for contesting forfeiture, and designated March 14, 1994 as the deadline for taking preventative action. These letters were mailed on January 26, 1994, but there is nothing in the record to indicate whether they reached their intended destinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 20, and 27, the government published a notice of the forfeiture proceedings in consecutive Sunday editions of the New York Times. See id. (requiring such publication in a newspaper of general circulation). The notice allowed thirty days from the date of the first publication within which to request relief from the planned forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.79. On April 20, 1994, both cars were declared forfeit to the United States. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1609(a); 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.77(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government acknowledges that it gave no personal notice to Gonzalez, but asserts that FBI agents were unable to locate him until August 10, 1994 (when they finally arrested him in Miami). Gonzalez demurs, alleging that the government knew all along where he was living (or, alternatively, where notice by mail could efficaciously be given to him). Moreover, testimony at Gonzalez's bail hearing indicates that the government may have known his whereabouts but eschewed an arrest for some time in order to avoid compromising a related investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1994, the government obtained a superseding indictment which, despite other modifications, left the four money laundering counts intact. On January 17, 1995, Gonzalez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that forfeiture of the two cars constituted punishment for the offenses charged (and, therefore, that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred prosecution). The district court denied the motion. After a nineteen-day trial, a jury found Gonzalez guilty on all counts and the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment. We affirmed the conviction and sentence. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly six years after the initial seizure of the two vehicles and more than five years after the administrative forfeiture proceedings had been completed, Gonzalez filed a pro se motion for return of the automobiles or, in lieu thereof, their cash value when seized. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e) (authorizing \"[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful . . . seizure or by the deprivation of property\" to move \"for the return of the property on the ground that such person is entitled to lawful possession of [it]\"). In this motion (filed on July 19, 1999), he argued that the notices of forfeiture were constitutionally defective since the government knew his whereabouts at the time and failed to make any real effort to notify him by mail or otherwise. On August 18, 1999, the district court, acting sua sponte, rejected Gonzalez's entreaty without comment. Gonzalez now appeals from the court's summary denial of both his original motion for return of property and his subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the pages that follow, we limn the nature of administrative forfeiture proceedings, elaborate the notice required to satisfy due process, and verify the posture in which this appeal arises.

Administrative Forfeiture Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has provided for the civil forfeiture of money or property traceable to the avails of drug trafficking. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 881(a)(6). To facilitate such forfeitures, Congress incorporated by explicit reference the venerable procedures for civil forfeiture set out in the customs laws. Id. &#167;&#167; 881(d). Under this regimen, the government may forfeit property worth $500,000 or less administratively. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1607. If the government chooses to travel this path, it must publish notice of its intent to forfeit the property for three successive weeks and supplement that publication by sending written notice to any party known to have an interest in the property. Id. &#167;&#167; 1607(a); 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The giving of notice shifts the burden of going forward to those persons who persist in claiming an interest in the property. Claimants have twenty days from the first published notice within which to file claims. 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1608. A timely claim, accompanied by a cost bond, aborts the administrative process and forces the government to proceed in court. See id.; see also 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.76(b). If no interested party files such a claim, however, the government can proceed to declare the property forfeit without judicial intervention. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1609.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Congress's erection of this framework for administrative forfeitures, the judiciary continues to play a limited role in such matters. Pertinently, district courts retain the authority to entertain constitutional challenges to administrative forfeitures. See United States v. Giraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam); see also United States v. Mosquera, 845 F.2d 1122, 1126 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam) (noting that district courts have federal question jurisdiction over due process challenges to administrative forfeitures). The fact that a claimant cloaks his constitutional challenge in the garb of a Rule 41(e) motion does not alter this reality; in that event, the court simply will treat such a motion as a civil complaint. Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonable Notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states that \"[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. These words require \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of [a legal] action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\" Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950). Accordingly, \"[t]he essence of due process is the requirement that a person in jeopardy of serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.\" Matthews v. Eldridge 424 U.S. 319, 348 (1976) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these precepts, due process, in the forfeiture context, minimally requires that the government provide an individual with \"notice and an opportunity to be heard\" before confiscating his property. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop., 510 U.S. 43, 46 (1993). Because due process is an infinitely flexible concept, there is no infallible test for determining the adequacy of notice in any particular situation. The touchstone is reasonableness: the government must afford notice sensibly calculated to inform the interested party of the contemplated forfeiture and to offer him a fair chance to present his claim of entitlement. See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v. Meza, 235 F.3d 287, 291 (7th Cir. 2000); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972) (explaining that due process \"calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the precedents shed some light on the government's obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurement); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be confiscator must take affirmative steps to locate owner who is in government custody). Even fugitives may be entitled to efforts at personal notice. See United States v. Rodgers, 108 F.3d 1247, 1253-54 (10th Cir. 1997) (declaring attempted notice to fugitive unreasonable when sent to invalid address and not sent to known residence). The precedents also suggest the value of a pragmatic approach to issues of notice. If, say, an interested party has actual knowledge of ongoing forfeiture proceedings from other sources, inadequacies in the notice afforded by the government will not work a deprivation of due process. Whiting, 231 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The District Court's Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the criminal case no longer was pending when Gonzalez sought relief from forfeiture, the lower court appropriately treated Gonzalez's Rule 41(e) motion as a civil complaint. See Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511. Thus, the government had sixty days to reply to it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(3)(A). The court, however, did not wait for the government to respond; it issued what amounted to an order of dismissal before the government acted (and well before the sixty-day deadline arrived).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, we have no choice but to treat the court's summary order as a sua sponte dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The type of sua sponte dismissal here at issue - a dismissal on the court's own initiative, without affording the plaintiff either notice or an opportunity to be heard - is disfavored in federal practice. If a defendant files a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the plaintiff, as a practical matter, has notice of the motion and an opportunity to amend the complaint as of right, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). But where, as here, a court jettisons an action sua sponte, the dismissal deprives the plaintiff of these core protections. Thus, the standard for upholding such a sua sponte dismissal is more rigorous than the \"failure to state a claim\" standard of Rule 12(b)(6). Cf. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989) (explaining that sua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1915 is warranted only if a complaint is \"based on an indisputably meritless legal theory\" or is \"clearly baseless\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, of course, that every sua sponte dismissal entered without prior notice to the plaintiff automatically must be reversed. If it is crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would be futile, then a sua sponte dismissal may stand. Curley v. Perry, 246 F.3d 1278, 1281-82 (10th Cir. 2001); Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994); Smith v. Boyd, 945 F.2d 1041, 1043 (8th Cir. 1991); Shockley v. Jones, 823 F.2d 1068, 1072-73 (7th Cir. 1987). But haste makes waste, and it will be the rare case in which a sua sponte dismissal - at least, a sua sponte dismissal without leave to amend - will be upheld. See Razzoli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 230 F.2d 371, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Perez v. Ortiz, 849 F.2d 793, 797 (2d Cir. 1988); Literature, Inc. v. Quinn, 482 F.2d 372, 374 (1st Cir. 1973); see also Clorox Co. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Comm'l Co., 228 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2000) (emphasizing that considerations of \"basic fairness,\" as well as \"sound prudential reasons,\" counsel against most uses of the power to dismiss cases sua sponte).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, sua sponte dismissals are risky business. We will uphold a sua sponte order of dismissal only if the allegations contained in the complaint, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption. We must measure the district court's dismissal of Gonzalez's Rule 41(e) motion by this yardstick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The Bottom Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford de novo review to orders for sua sponte dismissal. Cf. Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying de novo review to an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)). The United States argues that the lower court's order survives such review. Its central theme is that we should pay no heed to Gonzalez's allegations because the record itself refutes them. This argument lacks force. Gonzalez's allegations are reasonably specific and the nisi prius roll, in its present sparsely developed form, provides little more than food for speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not rehearse every pertinent detail, for one example will suffice. A crucial area of dispute involves the extent of the government's knowledge, in late 1993 and early 1994, anent Gonzalez's whereabouts. Gonzalez has made specific assertions that the FBI knew his whereabouts all along; that, at any rate, the agents had available to them addresses at which notice might effectively have been given to him; and that the government disregarded this knowledge, preferring instead to give notice to the vehicle custodians (whom it had every reason to believe were mere straws) and to send letters to addresses that its own informant had disclosed were contrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, in its brief and at oral argument, offers a much different version of the facts. It claims that it could not locate Gonzalez even to arrest him, let alone to notify him of the commencement of forfeiture proceedings, and that it did not know how to ensure that he receive personal notice. In a nutshell, the government says that it did the best that it could.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These dueling versions of the facts set the parties on a collision course. That, in turn, ends this aspect of our inquiry. While it is curious to think that the government effectively could serve notice on a fugitive, the law required the district court, before essaying a sua sponte dismissal, to assume the truth of Gonzalez's fact-specific averments. If the government knew how to notify Gonzalez directly and did not utilize that information, notification given in hand to the cars' custodians (known by the government to be placeholders) and mailed to the cars' registered owners (known by the government to be fictitious persons) might well fall short of the constitutional minimum, even when coupled with the publication of a notice in a newspaper that, in fairness, Gonzalez was unlikely to read. See United States v. Woodall, 12 F.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"When the government has actual knowledge of an interested party's whereabouts at the time forfeiture is commenced, failure to direct the statutorily required personal notice to that address cannot be considered compliance with either the statute or minimum due process standards.\"). Further proceedings are needed to permit a reasoned resolution of this factual conflict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has a fallback position. It argues that, regardless of what the FBI knew, the record conclusively demonstrates that Gonzalez had actual notice of the seizure. Building on this foundation, the government, citing United States v. One 1987 Jeep Wrangler Auto., 972 F.2d 472, 482 (2d Cir. 1992), posits that the district court's disposition was justified because actual knowledge of a seizure precludes a notice-based constitutional challenge to an ensuing forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this proposition. Assuming, arguendo, that the government can show actual notice of the vehicles' seizure on Gonzalez's part at the relevant time, the Second Circuit apparently has retreated from its earlier precedent and intimated that actual knowledge of forfeiture is required to excuse a due process shortfall. See Ikelionwu v. United States, 150 F.3d 233, 238 (2d Cir. 1998). Wholly apart from the Second Circuit's view, we ourselves believe that the actual knowledge required to defeat a notice-based due process challenge is advance notice-in-fact of forfeiture proceedings, as opposed to notice-in-fact of seizure. See Whiting, 231 F.3d at 74 (so stating, albeit in dictum). Here, Gonzalez asserts that he was not aware of the forfeiture until the end of 1994 (well after the forfeiture proceedings were complete). Because the government identifies nothing in the record which categorically contradicts that assertion, a sua sponte dismissal cannot be justified on the basis of actual knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government makes a last-ditch effort to preserve its district court victory. Pointing to the five-and-one-quarter year gap between the forfeiture of the cars and the commencement of this action, the government asseverates that Gonzalez's complaint is barred by laches. This asseveration need not detain us. Laches is an affirmative defense. K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 911 (1st Cir. 1989) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). Accordingly, the burden of proving it rests with its proponent. See id. There is no principled way that the district court, without better information than it had before it in August of 1999, could grant judgment for the government on such a fact bound theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Gonzalez invites us to declare the forfeiture void, whereas the government invites us to confirm its validity. We decline both invitations. The facts asserted in the Rule 41(e) motion, taken in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, invite skepticism, but we cannot say that they reveal a patently meritless claim. That means that the district court's sua sponte order for dismissal cannot endure. It does not mean, however, that Gonzalez is entitled to judgment. Since the district court foreclosed the government from telling its side of the story, we must remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the court should fix a time for the government to respond to the complaint and, in due course, should determine whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, the government's efforts to notify Gonzalez of the forfeiture proceedings were reasonable. If the court finds that the government's actions did not attain the constitutional minimum, the court should then consider the government's affirmative defenses (including but not limited to actual knowledge and laches). We take no view on any of these questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded.

See D.P.R. R. 311(5). That rule, however, specifies the general response time for motions, not for civil complaints. Gonzalez happily took advantage of the district court's willingness to exercise jurisdiction by treating his Rule 41(e) motion as a civil complaint, and he cannot now argue that the time limit for answering a complaint was inapposite. After all, \"[h]aving one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\" United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

See United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1998) (providing an account of the ring's illegal activities and the government's response). On September 29, 1993, a federal grand jury handed up a sealed indictment that charged Gonzalez and fifteen other individuals with a myriad of offenses, including importation of large quantities of cocaine and marijuana, as well as conspiracy to possess and distribute both drugs. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 841, 846, 952. The indictment also charged Gonzalez with several counts of money laundering. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956. The government based four such counts, in part, on the testimony of a cooperating witness who said that Gonzalez had dipped into drug proceeds to fund the purchase of four motor vehicles (two Mitsubishi Monteros and two Toyota Corollas). He added that one of Gonzalez's confederates had provided false names and addresses for use in registering the vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 1993, the district court unsealed the indictment. The FBI promptly arrested eleven of the sixteen defendants and seized the two cars at issue here - a 1993 Montero and a 1993 Corolla - from individuals residing in Trujillo Alto. The agents furnished each of these individuals with a notice that outlined the basis for the seizure and the procedure for contesting forfeiture. Subsequent appraisals indicate that, when seized, the Montero was worth approximately $25,300 and the Corolla approximately $13,900. See 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.74 (providing for post-seizure appraisals of property slated for forfeiture).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the indictment, Gonzalez eluded arrest. That was not surprising; in 1980, he had been indicted for narcotics offenses, but not apprehended, in the Southern District of Florida. He remained a fugitive and was convicted in absentia in the Florida case. Gonzalez was still at large when the government proceeded, in the winter of 1993-1994, to effect an administrative forfeiture of the confiscated automobiles. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 881.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a first step, the United States sent notice by certified mail to the persons named on the vehicles' registrations, at the addresses specified thereon. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1607(a) (directing, in relevant part, that \"[w]ritten notice of seizure together with information on the applicable procedures [for contesting forfeiture] shall be sent to each party who appears to have an interest in the seized article\"). Each notice explained the reasons for both the seizure and the planned forfeiture, detailed the appropriate procedure for contesting forfeiture, and designated March 14, 1994 as the deadline for taking preventative action. These letters were mailed on January 26, 1994, but there is nothing in the record to indicate whether they reached their intended destinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 20, and 27, the government published a notice of the forfeiture proceedings in consecutive Sunday editions of the New York Times. See id. (requiring such publication in a newspaper of general circulation). The notice allowed thirty days from the date of the first publication within which to request relief from the planned forfeiture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.79. On April 20, 1994, both cars were declared forfeit to the United States. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1609(a); 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.77(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government acknowledges that it gave no personal notice to Gonzalez, but asserts that FBI agents were unable to locate him until August 10, 1994 (when they finally arrested him in Miami). Gonzalez demurs, alleging that the government knew all along where he was living (or, alternatively, where notice by mail could efficaciously be given to him). Moreover, testimony at Gonzalez's bail hearing indicates that the government may have known his whereabouts but eschewed an arrest for some time in order to avoid compromising a related investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 2, 1994, the government obtained a superseding indictment which, despite other modifications, left the four money laundering counts intact. On January 17, 1995, Gonzalez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that forfeiture of the two cars constituted punishment for the offenses charged (and, therefore, that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred prosecution). The district court denied the motion. After a nineteen-day trial, a jury found Gonzalez guilty on all counts and the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment. We affirmed the conviction and sentence.

See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e) (authorizing \"[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful . . . seizure or by the deprivation of property\" to move \"for the return of the property on the ground that such person is entitled to lawful possession of [it]\"). In this motion (filed on July 19, 1999), he argued that the notices of forfeiture were constitutionally defective since the government knew his whereabouts at the time and failed to make any real effort to notify him by mail or otherwise. On August 18, 1999, the district court, acting sua sponte, rejected Gonzalez's entreaty without comment. Gonzalez now appeals from the court's summary denial of both his original motion for return of property and his subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 881(a)(6). To facilitate such forfeitures, Congress incorporated by explicit reference the venerable procedures for civil forfeiture set out in the customs laws. Id. &#167;&#167; 881(d). Under this regimen, the government may forfeit property worth $500,000 or less administratively. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1607. If the government chooses to travel this path, it must publish notice of its intent to forfeit the property for three successive weeks and supplement that publication by sending written notice to any party known to have an interest in the property. Id. &#167;&#167; 1607(a); 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The giving of notice shifts the burden of going forward to those persons who persist in claiming an interest in the property.

A timely claim, accompanied by a cost bond, aborts the administrative process and forces the government to proceed in court. See id.; see also 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.76(b). If no interested party files such a claim, however, the government can proceed to declare the property forfeit without judicial intervention. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1609.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Congress's erection of this framework for administrative forfeitures, the judiciary continues to play a limited role in such matters. Pertinently, district courts retain the authority to entertain constitutional challenges to administrative forfeitures. See United States v. Giraldo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195842\"><a href=\"/opinion/195842/united-states-v-giraldo/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 511 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam); see also United States v.

The fact that a claimant cloaks his constitutional challenge in the garb of a Rule 41(e) motion does not alter this reality; in that event, the court simply will treat such a motion as a civil complaint.

V. These words require \"notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of [a legal] action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\" Mullane v.

Accordingly, \"[t]he essence of due process is the requirement that a person in jeopardy of serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.\" Matthews v. Eldridge <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 348 (1976) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these precepts, due process, in the forfeiture context, minimally requires that the government provide an individual with \"notice and an opportunity to be heard\" before confiscating his property. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112914\"><a href=\"/opinion/112914/united-states-v-james-daniel-good-real-property/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (1993). Because due process is an infinitely flexible concept, there is no infallible test for determining the adequacy of notice in any particular situation. The touchstone is reasonableness: the government must afford notice sensibly calculated to inform the interested party of the contemplated forfeiture and to offer him a fair chance to present his claim of entitlement. See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v. Meza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771473\"><a href=\"/opinion/771473/floriberto-garcia-and-galilia-rivera-v-gus-meza-special-agent/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 291 (7th Cir. 2000); cf.

Brewer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108606\"><a href=\"/opinion/108606/morrissey-v-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 481 (1972) (explaining that due process \"calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the precedents shed some light on the government's obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199151\"><a href=\"/opinion/199151/whiting-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurement); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be confiscator must take affirmative steps to locate owner who is in government custody). Even fugitives may be entitled to efforts at personal notice. See United States v. Rodgers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737508\"><a href=\"/opinion/737508/united-states-v-joe-earl-rodgers/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></a></span>, 1253-54 (10th Cir. 1997) (declaring attempted notice to fugitive unreasonable when sent to invalid address and not sent to known residence). The precedents also suggest the value of a pragmatic approach to issues of notice. If, say, an interested party has actual knowledge of ongoing forfeiture proceedings from other sources, inadequacies in the notice afforded by the government will not work a deprivation of due process. Whiting, 231 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The District Court's Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the criminal case no longer was pending when Gonzalez sought relief from forfeiture, the lower court appropriately treated Gonzalez's Rule 41(e) motion as a civil complaint. See Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511. Thus, the government had sixty days to reply to it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(3)(A). The court, however, did not wait for the government to respond; it issued what amounted to an order of dismissal before the government acted (and well before the sixty-day deadline arrived).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, we have no choice but to treat the court's summary order as a sua sponte dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The type of sua sponte dismissal here at issue - a dismissal on the court's own initiative, without affording the plaintiff either notice or an opportunity to be heard - is disfavored in federal practice. If a defendant files a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the plaintiff, as a practical matter, has notice of the motion and an opportunity to amend the complaint as of right, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). But where, as here, a court jettisons an action sua sponte, the dismissal deprives the plaintiff of these core protections. Thus, the standard for upholding such a sua sponte dismissal is more rigorous than the \"failure to state a claim\" standard of Rule 12(b)(6). Cf. Neitzke v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112254\"><a href=\"/opinion/112254/neitzke-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 327 (1989) (explaining that sua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1915 is warranted only if a complaint is \"based on an indisputably meritless legal theory\" or is \"clearly baseless\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, of course, that every sua sponte dismissal entered without prior notice to the plaintiff automatically must be reversed. If it is crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would be futile, then a sua sponte dismissal may stand. Curley v. Perry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161006\"><a href=\"/opinion/161006/curley-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, 1281-82 (10th Cir. 2001); Wyatt v.

But haste makes waste, and it will be the rare case in which a sua sponte dismissal - at least, a sua sponte dismissal without leave to amend - will be upheld. See Razzoli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></span>, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Perez v.

We will uphold a sua sponte order of dismissal only if the allegations contained in the complaint, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are patently meritless and beyond all hope of redemption. We must measure the district court's dismissal of Gonzalez's Rule 41(e) motion by this yardstick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The Bottom Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We afford de novo review to orders for sua sponte dismissal. Cf. Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197817\"><a href=\"/opinion/197817/beddall-v-state-street-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying de novo review to an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)). The United States argues that the lower court's order survives such review. Its central theme is that we should pay no heed to Gonzalez's allegations because the record itself refutes them. This argument lacks force. Gonzalez's allegations are reasonably specific and the nisi prius roll, in its present sparsely developed form, provides little more than food for speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not rehearse every pertinent detail, for one example will suffice. A crucial area of dispute involves the extent of the government's knowledge, in late 1993 and early 1994, anent Gonzalez's whereabouts. Gonzalez has made specific assertions that the FBI knew his whereabouts all along; that, at any rate, the agents had available to them addresses at which notice might effectively have been given to him; and that the government disregarded this knowledge, preferring instead to give notice to the vehicle custodians (whom it had every reason to believe were mere straws) and to send letters to addresses that its own informant had disclosed were contrived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, in its brief and at oral argument, offers a much different version of the facts. It claims that it could not locate Gonzalez even to arrest him, let alone to notify him of the commencement of forfeiture proceedings, and that it did not know how to ensure that he receive personal notice. In a nutshell, the government says that it did the best that it could.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These dueling versions of the facts set the parties on a collision course. That, in turn, ends this aspect of our inquiry. While it is curious to think that the government effectively could serve notice on a fugitive, the law required the district court, before essaying a sua sponte dismissal, to assume the truth of Gonzalez's fact-specific averments. If the government knew how to notify Gonzalez directly and did not utilize that information, notification given in hand to the cars' custodians (known by the government to be placeholders) and mailed to the cars' registered owners (known by the government to be fictitious persons) might well fall short of the constitutional minimum, even when coupled with the publication of a notice in a newspaper that, in fairness, Gonzalez was unlikely to read. See United States v. Woodall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659374\"><a href=\"/opinion/659374/united-states-v-norman-ray-woodall/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 794 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"When the government has actual knowledge of an interested party's whereabouts at the time forfeiture is commenced, failure to direct the statutorily required personal notice to that address cannot be considered compliance with either the statute or minimum due process standards.\"). Further proceedings are needed to permit a reasoned resolution of this factual conflict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has a fallback position. It argues that, regardless of what the FBI knew, the record conclusively demonstrates that Gonzalez had actual notice of the seizure. Building on this foundation, the government, citing United States v. One 1987 Jeep Wrangler Auto., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588807\"><a href=\"/opinion/588807/united-states-of-america-drug-enforcement-agency-v-in-re-one-1987-jeep/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 482 (2d Cir. 1992), posits that the district court's disposition was justified because actual knowledge of a seizure precludes a notice-based constitutional challenge to an ensuing forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this proposition. Assuming, arguendo, that the government can show actual notice of the vehicles' seizure on Gonzalez's part at the relevant time, the Second Circuit apparently has retreated from its earlier precedent and intimated that actual knowledge of forfeiture is required to excuse a due process shortfall. See Ikelionwu v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756443\"><a href=\"/opinion/756443/michael-ikelionwu-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 238 (2d Cir. 1998). Wholly apart from the Second Circuit's view, we ourselves believe that the actual knowledge required to defeat a notice-based due process challenge is advance notice-in-fact of forfeiture proceedings, as opposed to notice-in-fact of seizure. See Whiting, 231 F.3d at 74 (so stating, albeit in dictum). Here, Gonzalez asserts that he was not aware of the forfeiture until the end of 1994 (well after the forfeiture proceedings were complete). Because the government identifies nothing in the record which categorically contradicts that assertion, a sua sponte dismissal cannot be justified on the basis of actual knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government makes a last-ditch effort to preserve its district court victory. Pointing to the five-and-one-quarter year gap between the forfeiture of the cars and the commencement of this action, the government asseverates that Gonzalez's complaint is barred by laches. This asseveration need not detain us. Laches is an affirmative defense. K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524046\"><a href=\"/opinion/524046/k-mart-corporation-v-oriental-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 911 (1st Cir. 1989) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). Accordingly, the burden of proving it rests with its proponent. See id. There is no principled way that the district court, without better information than it had before it in August of 1999, could grant judgment for the government on such a fact bound theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Gonzalez invites us to declare the forfeiture void, whereas the government invites us to confirm its validity. We decline both invitations. The facts asserted in the Rule 41(e) motion, taken in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, invite skepticism, but we cannot say that they reveal a patently meritless claim. That means that the district court's sua sponte order for dismissal cannot endure. It does not mean, however, that Gonzalez is entitled to judgment. Since the district court foreclosed the government from telling its side of the story, we must remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the court should fix a time for the government to respond to the complaint and, in due course, should determine whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, the government's efforts to notify Gonzalez of the forfeiture proceedings were reasonable. If the court finds that the government's actions did not attain the constitutional minimum, the court should then consider the government's affirmative defenses (including but not limited to actual knowledge and laches). We take no view on any of these questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vacated and remanded. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the record does not contain a copy of the published notice, we take the dates of publication and the description of the text from the declaration of forfeiture. We assume, on the same basis, that the contents of the published notice complied with the applicable regulations. See 21 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1316.75(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Gonzalez argues that the response time had expired because the district court's local rules allow only ten days to reply to a motion. See D.P.R. R. 311(5). That rule, however, specifies the general response time for motions, not for civil complaints. Gonzalez happily took advantage of the district court's willingness to exercise jurisdiction by treating his Rule 41(e) motion as a civil complaint, and he cannot now argue that the time limit for answering a complaint was inapposite. After all, \"[h]aving one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\" United States v.
