Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Gerald Jones on brief pro se.\n     David M.

We affirm the judgment substantially\n\nfor the reasons set forth in the district court's December\n\n6,   2000   order    of   dismissal,          adding       only   the   following\n\ncomments.      In an effort to avoid the statute-of-limitations\n\nbar, plaintiff for the first time on appeal invokes Mass.\n\nGen.    Laws   ch.   260,    §    32.         That    provision     permits    the\n\nrefiling, within one year, of a duly commenced action that\n\nwas dismissed \"for any matter of form.\"                       It is a remedial\n\nmeasure     \"declar[ing]      that      where        the   plaintiff    has   been\n\ndefeated by some matter not affecting the merits, some\n\ndefect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new\n\nprocess, the statute [of limitations] shall not prevent him\n\nfrom doing so.\"      Coffin v. Cottle, 33 Mass. (16 Pick.) 383,\n\n386 (1835) (describing predecessor statute).\n\n            We find this statute inapplicable here for at least\n\nthree     reasons.        First,        the    district       court     dismissed\n\nplaintiff's initial action in part because he had filed no\n\nopposition to defendants' motions to dismiss.                         That is not\n\na \"matter of form.\"         See, e.g., Cumming v. Jacobs, 130 Mass.\n\n419, 421 (1881) (holding that dismissal for failure to\n\nprosecute did not so qualify, and noting that predecessor\n\nstatute \"was not intended to encourage default or negligence\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f in the prosecution or conduct of a suit\"); King v. Bradlees,\n\n Inc.,   1991    WL   204342,   at      *2   (Mass.   App.     Div.   1991)\n\n (concluding that dismissal because of counsel's failure to\n\n appear at pretrial conference was not matter of form); see\n\n also Loomer v. Dionne, 338 Mass. 348, 352 (1959) (noting, in\n\n course of finding statute applicable, that there was \"no\n\n default    or   other   neglect   in      the   prosecution   ...    as   in\n\n Cumming\").\n\n             Second, the dismissal in the first action was also\n\n based in part on plaintiff's failure to state a claim.                That\n\n was an adjudication on the merits, as to which \"principles\n\n of res judicata apply and [ch. 260, § 32] ... has no\n\n pertinence.\"      Liberace v. Conway, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 45\n\n (1991).1\n\n             Finally, plaintiff's second suit was not filed\n\n \"within one year after the dismissal\" of his first suit, as\n\n the statute requires.      We need not decide whether, in a case\n\n where an appeal has been pursued, that period ordinarily\n\n begins to run at the time the lower court acts or at the\n\n\n    1   There is no suggestion that the district court declined\nto exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any pendant state law\nclaims--a type of dismissal that is deemed a \"matter of form.\"\nSee, e.g., Liberace, 31 Mass. App. Ct. at 42-45. Plaintiff's\nfirst complaint did not purport to contain any such claims. And\nthe court's dismissal, in any event, was with prejudice across\nthe board.\n\n                                     -3-\n\ftime the appellate court does so.   Here, plaintiff filed no\n\ntimely notice of appeal in his first suit and no timely\n\nmotion to extend the time for appeal.     The one-year period\n\nthus commenced, at the latest, on the date the appeal period\n\nexpired and the judgment became final--well over one year\n\nbefore his second action was filed.\n\n         Affirmed.
