Specifically,  he\r\n\nchallenges  the denial of his motions  relating to jury selection\r\n\nand jury instructions, the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\r\n\nhis conviction,  and sentencing considerations.   For the reasons\r\n\ndiscussed  below, we  reverse  the denial  of  Royal's motion  to\r\n\ninspect  the master  jury  wheel and  remand  to allow  Royal  to\r\n\ninspect the master jury wheel and other relevant records.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n                         Factual History\r                                   Factual History\r\n\n          We  briefly   sketch  out   the  bare  facts   of  this\r\n\nconspiracy, providing facts related specifically to Royal as they\r\n\nbecome relevant.    Considering the  evidence in  the light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the verdict,  United States v. Kayne, 90  F.3d 7, 13\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996), the jury could have found the following.  EZ-EM,\r\n\nInc., was  a distributorship  for Andover Tractor  Trailer School\r\n\n(\"ATTS\"),  a  correspondence  school in  Methuen,  Massachusetts.\r\n\nATTS was  party to  a  program participation  agreement with  the\r\n\nDepartment of Education to participate in the PELL grant program,\r\n\nthe Guaranteed  Student Loan program,  the Plus program,  and the\r\n\nSupplemental Loans  for Students  program.  Under  the agreement,\r\n\nATTS must require a maximum time frame in which students complete\r\n\na  course with  a minimum  grade average.   ATTS  entered  into a\r\n\nseries of distributors' agreements whereby each distributor would\r\n\nrefer students to enroll in ATTS's program.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          Darryl Simmes,  the financial  aid officer for  ATTS at\r\n\nEZ-EM, testified that  he also  acted as a  recruiter for  EZ-EM.\r\n\nSimmes worked at ALAT,  another distributor affiliated with ATTS,\r\n\nprior to joining EZ-EM.   Simmes testified that, at  ALAT, when a\r\n\nstudent he recruited did not meet the minimum requirements of the\r\n\nprogram, he falsified the student's application to make it appear\r\n\nthat  he  met those  requirements.    These minimum  requirements\r\n\nincluded possessing  a driver's  license and making  less than  a\r\n\ncertain income  to be eligible for financial  aid.  Later, at EZ-\r\n\nEM, Simmes  would contact  a student he  had recruited to  sign a\r\n\nstudent loan check made  out to both the student and  the school.\r\n\nThese  students were  told  that they  would  not incur  debt  by\r\n\nsigning the check and, often, later found that they had defaulted\r\n\non loans  they were not  aware they  had taken out.   During  the\r\n\ncourse  of EZ-EM's  existence,  the  distributorship enrolled  at\r\n\nleast 150 students.\r\n\n          Sometimes, EZ-EM provided students  with a set of exams\r\n\nincluding answers,  requesting  that a  newly registered  student\r\n\nsign off on the exams.  Other times, the tests  were forwarded to\r\n\nthe student already completed.  The completed forms would then be\r\n\nreturned to ATTS.   EZ-EM also supplied students with  answers to\r\n\nlater lessons, sometimes  mailing these lessons to students.  EZ-\r\n\nEM would inform students that they must sign the lessons or  risk\r\n\nbeing thrown out of  the program.  Employees  of EZ-EM paid  some\r\n\nstudents to  enroll  in the  ATTS  program.   ATTS paid  EZ-EM  a\r\n\ncommission of $600-$700 per student enrolled.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                        Procedural History\r                                  Procedural History\r\n\n          A  grand jury  indicted Royal  on October  7, 1992,  on\r\n\ncharges of conspiracy  to commit  mail fraud in  violation of  18\r\n\nU.S.C.    371, mail fraud in  violation of 18 U.S.C.    1341, and\r\n\naiding and abetting in violation  of 18 U.S.C.   2.  On March 13,\r\n\n1995,  the scheduled  day  of trial,  a petit  jury venire  of 53\r\n\nappeared for impanelment.   Royal, a black male, orally  moved to\r\n\nstrike  the jury  venire.   The  court  granted this  motion  and\r\n\nrescheduled the trial for one week from that date.\r\n\n          On March 15, Royal filed a motion to inspect the master\r\n\njury wheel for the years  from 1993 to 1995.  The  following day,\r\n\nRoyal filed a Motion to Strike Jury Venire, which argued that the\r\n\ndistrict's  jury  selection plan  systematically  excludes blacks\r\n\nfrom the jury pool.  The district court  deferred ruling on these\r\n\nmotions until Royal could  make a proffer demonstrating that  the\r\n\njury plan systematically excluded blacks.\r\n\n          On  March 20,  1995,  trial commenced  in the  district\r\n\ncourt.  After viewing  the jury venire, Royal renewed  his motion\r\n\nto strike  the jury venire.   Royal  further moved for  a hearing\r\n\nwith respect to the inadequacies of the Amended Jury Plan for the\r\n\nEastern Division of the  District of Massachusetts (\"Amended Jury\r\n\nPlan\").  In support  of his various motions, Royal  submitted two\r\n\naffidavits from Dr. Gordon Sutton,  Professor of Sociology at the\r\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts at  Amherst, which contended that the\r\n\nAmended  Jury  Plan  systematically  excluded  blacks  and  other\r\n\nminorities from the  jury venire.  The district  court determined\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nthat  it did  not have statutory  authorization to  implement the\r\n\nremedy Royal suggested -- supplementing the jury venire such that\r\n\nit would provide  a fair  cross-section of the  community --  and\r\n\ndenied Royal's motions.\r\n\n          Following  the close  of  the government's  case, Royal\r\n\nmoved  for judgment  of acquittal  on all  counts.   The district\r\n\ncourt  granted  the motion  only as  to  Count 24,  charging mail\r\n\nfraud.  After a six day  trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts\r\n\non one  count of conspiracy and eight  counts of mail fraud, with\r\n\nverdicts of  not guilty  on four counts  of mail fraud.   Royal's\r\n\nsentence  included 27 months  imprisonment, 36  months supervised\r\n\nrelease, and restitution of $30,000.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n                        I.

Louisiana, 419 U.S.  522, 528 (1975).  That  same right\r                             \r\n\nis ensured by the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968.

Bailey, 76  F.3d 320,  321 (10th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 116 S. Ct. 1889 (1996).\r                             \r\n\n          At  the first  hearing,  held on  March  15, 1995,  the\r\n\ndistrict court stated  that the request before it was essentially\r\n\na  request  for an  evidentiary hearing  to  extend the  scope of\r\n\nrequested evidence to include discovery of the master jury wheel.\r\n\nThe court then placed the burden on Royal to show \"by a factually\r\n\nsupportable submission  that there  is some reasonable  basis for\r\n\nsupposing  that the matters you're  asking to get  into will have\r\n\nsome material bearing  upon a decision I am to make.\"  Transcript\r\n\nof  hearing,  March  15, 1995,  at  6.    Because  Royal made  no\r\n\nfactually supportable  showing of relevance  and materiality, the\r\n\ndistrict court denied the motion to inspect.\r\n\n          On  a second motion  to inspect  the jury  records, the\r\n\ndistrict court  suggested that, in order to inspect the requested\r\n\nrecords, Royal  was required to make  a showing that he  would be\r\n\nable  to satisfy the three prongs  of Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n357  (1979).   Under Duren, in  order to establish  a prima facie\r                                    \r\n\nviolation of  the fair cross-section  requirement, \"the defendant\r\n\nmust  show (1)  that  the  group  alleged to  be  excluded  is  a\r\n\n'distinctive' group in the community; (2) that the representation\r\n\nof this group  in venires from which  juries are selected is  not\r\n\nfair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons  in\r\n\nthe community;  and (3) that  this underrepresentation is  due to\r\n\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\"\r\n\nId.  at 364.   The  district court  expressed concern  that Royal\r             \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nwould  not  be  able  to  satisfy  the  third  prong  by  showing\r\n\nsystematic  exclusion.   Accordingly,  it  deferred ruling  until\r\n\nRoyal  could make  a  showing that  would  enable the  court  \"to\r\n\ndetermine  whether we  are  doing something  that is  potentially\r\n\nuseful  or  instead  doing  something  that's  just  a  waste  of\r\n\nresources  because  it  will   not  be  useful  in  any   event.\"\r\n\nTranscript of Hearing, March 17, 1995, at 15-16.\r\n\n          Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to\r\n\na  jury  selected from  a  source  fairly representative  of  the\r\n\ncommunity.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nTest, 420  U.S. at 30.   Before voir  dire examination  or within\r              \r\n\nseven days after the defendant could  have discovered the grounds\r\n\nfor a challenge, a  defendant may move to dismiss  the indictment\r\n\nor stay  the proceedings for  substantial failure to  comply with\r\n\nthe  provisions of the title.  28  U.S.C.   1867(a).  The statute\r\n\nrequires that the challenge be  accompanied by \"a sworn statement\r\n\nof  facts which, if true, would  constitute a substantial failure\r\n\nto comply with\" these provisions.  28 U.S.C.   1867(d).  Relevant\r\n\nto our inquiry here, subsection (f) of section 1867 provides that\r\n\n\"[t]he  parties . . . shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          selecting  the petit  jury,  the court  shall\r\n          stay the proceedings pending the selection of\r\n          a petit jury in conformity with this title. .\r\n          . .\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            (f)  The contents of records or papers used\r\n          by the jury commission or clerk in connection\r\n          with the  jury selection process shall not be\r\n          disclosed,  except  pursuant to  the district\r\n          court  plan or  as  may be  necessary in  the\r\n          preparation or presentation of a motion under\r\n          subsection (a) . . . of this section . . .  .\r\n          The  parties in  a case  shall be  allowed to\r\n          inspect, reproduce, and  copy such records or\r\n          papers at  all  reasonable times  during  the\r\n          preparation   and   pendency   of    such   a\r\n          motion. . . .\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   1867 (1994).\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncopy  such records or papers  at all reasonable  times during the\r\n\npreparation and pendency of such a motion.\"  28 U.S.C.   1867(f).\r\n\nIt is this particular subsection with which the Supreme Court was\r\n\nconcerned in Test and which is dispositive of Royal's challenge.\r                           \r\n\n          In  Test, the  district  court denied  the  defendant's\r                            \r\n\nmotion to  inspect the jury selection records pursuant to section\r\n\n1867(e).   Test,  420 U.S. at  29.  The  Supreme Court determined\r                         \r\n\nthat the  language in subsection (e)  established \"essentially an\r\n\nunqualified right  to inspect  jury  lists.\"   Id. at  30.   This\r                                                            \r\n\ninterpretation was supported \"not  only by the plain text  of the\r\n\nstatute, but  also by the  statute's overall purpose  of insuring\r\n\n'grand  and petit  juries selected  at random  from a  fair cross\r\n\nsection of the community.'\"  Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C.   1861).  The\r                                          \r\n\nCourt  admonished that, without  such access, a  litigant will be\r\n\nunable  to determine whether he has a meritorious claim.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nWe adhere to and  apply the Supreme Court's determination  that a\r\n\ndefendant,  such  as   Royal,  challenging  the  jury   selection\r\n\nprocedures has an unqualified right to inspect jury records.\r\n\n          Because the  right of access to  jury selection records\r\n\nis \"unqualified,\" a district  court may not premise the  grant or\r\n\ndenial of a  motion to inspect upon a showing of probable success\r\n\non  the merits of a  challenge to the  jury selection provisions.\r\n\nSee  Test,  420 U.S.  at  30.   Although  the  burden  is on  the\r                   \r\n\ndefendant  to establish  a prima  facie case  of unconstitutional\r\n\nexclusion,  see United States  v. Pion, 25  F.3d 18,  22 n.4 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 115 S.

To avail  himself of the\r\n\nright of access to  jury selection records, a litigant  need only\r\n\nallege  that he  is  preparing a  motion  to challenge  the  jury\r\n\nselection process.  See United States v. Alden, 776 F.2d 771, 773\r                                                        \r\n\n(8th  Cir.  1985).    The  district court,  therefore,  erred  in\r\n\nrequiring  Royal to  make a  showing of  probable success  on the\r\n\nmerits of his jury selection challenge as a condition of granting\r\n\naccess to the records.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  a  district  court  may  not   require  a\r\n\ndefendant requesting  access to jury selection  records to submit\r\n\nwith that request  \"a sworn  statement of facts  which, if  true,\r\n\nwould  constitute  a  substantial  failure  to  comply  with  the\r\n\nprovisions  of this title.\"  28 U.S.C.   1867(d).  The procedural\r\n\nmechanisms of  the jury  selection provisions require  the moving\r\n\nparty to submit a sworn statement to support a motion to strike a\r\n\njury venire  or challenge the  selection processes; such  a sworn\r\n\nstatement  is not  required to  support a  motion to  inspect the\r\n\nrecords.  See  id.  The  Supreme Court has  established that  the\r                            \r\n\nright of access is \"unqualified.\"  The Eighth Circuit, faced with\r\n\nan appeal of the nature of Royal's, recognized that,\r\n\n          [a]lthough the district  court's analysis  is\r\n          persuasive, the district court is not free to\r\n          establish   additional    requirements   that\r\n          defendants must  meet in order to gain access\r\n          to jury selection records.  The Supreme Court\r\n          has  unequivocally stated  that the  right to\r\n          inspect   these   records   is   'essentially\r\n          unqualified' and is  conditioned only in  the\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          manner  set forth  in the  statute.   Test v.\r                                                              \r\n          United States, 420 U.S. at 30.\r                                 \r\n\nAlden,  776 F.2d  at 775.   Thus,  while the  district court  may\r               \r\n\nestablish reasonable procedures whereby  the inspection may  take\r\n\nplace, the district  court does not have  discretion to formulate\r\n\nadditional requirements beyond those  established by the statute.\r\n\nId.\r             \r\n\n          Nevertheless, we find that  this error does not require\r\n\nthat we reverse Royal's  conviction.  Rather, we remand  the case\r\n\nwith  instructions to allow  Royal access  to \"[t]he  contents of\r\n\nrecords  or  papers  used by  the  jury  commission  or clerk  in\r\n\nconnection with the jury selection process,\" 28 U.S.C.   1867(f),\r\n\nin order to support a motion to strike the jury venire.  If Royal\r\n\ndetermines that the Amended Jury Plan violates the jury selection\r\n\nprocedures  required under  the statute,  he may  move for  a new\r\n\ntrial under 28 U.S.C.   1867(a).   See United States v.  Marcano-\r                                                                           \r\n\nGarc a, 622 F.2d  12, 18 (1st Cir. 1980).   If the district court\r                \r\n\nfinds that the  Amended Jury Plan violates the constitutional and\r\n\nstatutory  requirements, the  court may  order a  new trial.   28\r\n\nU.S.C.   1867(d).\r\n\n          B.   The Evidentiary Hearing\r                    B    The Evidentiary Hearing\r                                                \r\n\n          As a  remedy  for the  allegedly unconstitutional  jury\r\n\nselection  process, Royal  seeks  an evidentiary  hearing on  the\r\n\nmerits  of his  claim.   As we  noted  above, the  district court\r\n\ntreated Royal's motion to strike the jury venire as a request for\r\n\nan evidentiary hearing regarding the contents of the  master jury\r\n\nwheel.   The district  court sought  from Royal  a  showing by  a\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nfactually supportable submission that  the documents Royal sought\r\n\nwould have a material bearing on the jury selection challenge.\r\n\n          In  the normal  motions  context, a  \"party seeking  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing must  carry a fairly  heavy burden.\"   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).  When a judge\r                          \r\n\ndenies a  party's request for  an evidentiary hearing,  we review\r\n\nthat determination for  abuse of  discretion.   United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nJim nez  Mart nez, 83  F.3d 488,  498 (1st  Cir. 1996);  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

However, Royal's motion\r                                           \r\n\nwas  made  without the  benefit of  information  to which  he was\r\n\nentitled as a matter of law.   On remand, if Royal is able to use\r\n\nthis  information on the jury selection process to show a factual\r\n\ndispute  that, if  resolved in  his favor,  would entitle  him to\r\n\nrelief, then he would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.\r\n\n          C.

At this time, our consideration of  the\r\n\nmerits of his  challenge would  be premature.   We remand to  the\r\n\ndistrict court Royal's  jury selection challenge  so that it  may\r\n\nreview Royal's claim in  the first instance, after a  full record\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nhas been developed.

We do not pass on\r\n\nthe merits of Royal's claim.\r\n\n            II.  Jury Instruction on Conspiracy Charge\r                      II.  Jury Instruction on Conspiracy Charge\r                                                                \r\n\n          Royal  contends   that   the  district   court's   jury\r\n\ninstruction on the  charge of  conspiracy was in  error and  that\r\n\nerror  lessened  the  government's   burden  of  proof  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt.  In deciding whether the trial court submitted\r\n\nerroneous instructions  to the  jury, we \"determine  whether [the\r\n\ninstruction]  tended  to  confuse  or  mislead  the  jury  on the\r\n\ncontrolling issues.\"  Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n337,  353 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 937 (1990).  We\r                                                 \r\n\nconsider the instructions \"as  a whole; portions of it are not to\r\n\nbe treated in isolation.\"  Id.  We find that the instructions, as\r                                        \r\n\na  whole, were not erroneous.   In fact,  as discussed below, the\r\n\ndouble intent  instruction may  have heightened  the government's\r\n\nburden.  Consequently, not only did the instruction not prejudice\r\n\nRoyal, it in fact benefitted Royal.  There was no error.\r\n\n          The statutory  provision under which  Royal was charged\r\n\nfinds a  violation of the law \"[i]f  two or more persons conspire\r\n\neither to commit  any offense  against the United  States, or  to\r\n\ndefraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or\r\n\nfor any purpose,  and one or more  of such persons do any  act to\r\n\neffect the object  of the conspiracy .  . . .\"   18 U.S.C.    371\r\n\n(1966).    The  district court's  instruction  on  the charge  of\r\n\nconspiracy was, in pertinent part, as follows:\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n            In order to establish that the defendant is\r\n          guilty  of  this  charge of  conspiracy,  the\r\n          Government   must   prove   these   essential\r\n          elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\r\n\n            First:   That two or more persons knowingly\r\n          conspired,  combined or  agreed to  commit an\r\n          offense  against  the   United  States,   the\r\n          purpose of  which was to  commit mail  fraud,\r\n          and  that  the   conspiracy  was  formed   or\r\n          existing at or about  the time alleged in the\r\n          indictment.\r\n\n            Second:   That the defendant  knowingly and\r\n          intentionally   became   a   member  of   the\r\n          conspiracy.\r\n\n            Third:    That  one  of   the  conspirators\r\n          knowingly did some  act to effect the  object\r\n          of the conspiracy.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            The  intent that the  Government must prove\r\n          beyond  reasonable  doubt  to  establish  the\r\n          charge  of  conspiracy  in  this case  is  an\r\n          intent  to   defraud   as  alleged   in   the\r\n          indictment.   It  is not  necessary, however,\r\n          for the Government to  prove an intent on the\r\n          part of  the defendant to  participate in all\r\n          parts or aspects of the conspiracy.\r\n\n                              * * *\r\n\n            There are  two  aspects of  the intent  the\r\n          Government  must  prove  beyond a  reasonable\r\n          doubt.\r\n\n            First, the Government must prove the intent\r\n          to agree to be a member of the conspiracy.\r\n\n            Second,  the  Government  must   prove  the\r\n          intent to participate in the commission of at\r\n          least one of the substantive offenses.\r\n\nTranscript  at 6-49--6-54.   Royal,  in his  brief, sets  out the\r\n\nfollowing portion  of the  instructions in  support of  his claim\r\n\nthat the district court erred in its instructions to the  jury on\r\n\nthe required intent of conspiracy:\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n            It  is not  required  that  the  Government\r\n          prove, in  order to establish  the conspiracy\r\n          offense, that the defendant had the intent to\r\n          commit  personally  all  of  the  substantive\r\n          crimes  that  were within  the object  of the\r\n          conspiracy.      Stated   another  way,   the\r\n          requirement is that the Government prove both\r\n          an  intent to  agree to  be a  member of  the\r\n          conspiracy  and  an  intent   to  participate\r\n          personally in the commission  of at least one\r\n          of the substantive offenses.\r\n\nId.  at 6-54.    Reviewing this  instruction,  we find  that  the\r             \r\n\ndistrict court's  instructions, by using language  that imposes a\r\n\nhigher  burden on the government  than the law  requires, did not\r\n\nprejudice Royal.   Therefore,  reversal of Royal's  conviction is\r\n\nnot warranted.\r\n\n          Royal claims that this  court has applied two different\r\n\ndefinitions of conspiracy, and  that the district court's attempt\r\n\nto  reconcile the conspiracy precedents led to the error of which\r\n\nhe now complains.   Royal  contends that the  controlling law  in\r\n\nthis circuit requires the government to prove that Royal intended\r\n\nto enter into  the agreement forming the conspiracy  and intended\r\n\nto commit the substantive offense.  In so arguing, Royal misreads\r\n\nthis court's precedents.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court has said that \"[i]n a conspiracy, two\r\n\ndifferent types  of intent are  generally required  -- the  basic\r\n\nintent to agree, which is necessary to establish the existence of\r\n\nthe conspiracy, and the more traditional intent to effectuate the\r\n\nobject of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. United States Gypsum\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 438  U.S. 422, 443 n.20  (1978).  It is  by now well-settled\r             \r\n\nthat  the government need  not prove that  the defendant intended\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\npersonally to commit  the substantive crime  or crimes that  were\r\n\nthe object of the  conspiracy.

The  district court's  instruction that  \"the government\r\n\nmust  prove the  intent to  participate in  the commission  of at\r\n\nleast  one  of  the   substantive  offenses\"  was,  if  anything,\r\n\ngenerous, and we find no error prejudicing Royal's rights.\r\n\n                III.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                                           \r\n\n          Finding   that  the  legal   principles  were  properly\r\n\npresented  to  the jury,  we turn  to  Royal's argument  that the\r\n\nevidence  was  insufficient   to  sustain  his   convictions  for\r\n\nconspiracy and mail fraud.   Royal contends first that  there was\r\n\nno  evidence of his knowledge of the conspiracy and \"virtually no\r\n\nevidence\" that he engaged in fraudulent conduct in furtherance of\r\n\nthe  conspiracy to  defraud the  government  and the  students he\r\n\nenrolled in the program.   Royal also argues that  the government\r\n\nfailed to  prove that he had  the specific intent to  defraud the\r\n\nDepartment  of  Education  required  to support  his  mail  fraud\r\n\nconviction.  We first review the evidence presented to the jury.\r\n\n          \"In  assessing a  challenge to  the sufficiency  of the\r\n\nevidence, we 'review the record to determine whether the evidence\r\n\nand  reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the\r\n\nlight most favorable to  the prosecution, would allow  a rational\r\n\njury  to determine beyond  a reasonable doubt  that the defendant\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n[was]  guilty as charged.'\"   United States v.

Ct. 1550 (1994)).\r\n\n          Drawing  all  reasonable  inferences  in  favor  of the\r\n\nverdict, the  jury could have  found the following  about Royal's\r\n\ninvolvement in the EZ-EM conspiracy.  Appellant    Royal    began\r\n\nworking for EZ-EM in December 1988.  At the beginning of 1989, he\r\n\nreplaced  Darryl  Simmes as  financial  aid  officer at  EZ-EM  a\r\n\nposition  paid by  ATTS.   At  the time  he  held that  position,\r\n\nfinancial   aid  officers  were   prohibited  from   engaging  in\r\n\nrecruitment activities.   While serving as  financial aid officer\r\n\nat EZ-EM Royal also engaged in recruitment activities.\r\n\n          For each student he enrolled in the ATTS program, Royal\r\n\nreceived  a $100-$125  commission.   For  this commission,  Royal\r\n\nwould pay  current students to bring  in others to enroll  in the\r\n\nprogram.   Royal  also paid  students to  enroll in  the program.\r\n\nRoyal was given a copy of the answers to provide students to help\r\n\nthem complete the  ten lessons required  upon enrollment.   Royal\r\n\nwas aware  that many of the students who signed up did not intend\r\n\nto complete the ATTS program, but merely signed up to receive the\r\n\ntwenty dollars he  paid them.  Because  of this, he often  either\r\n\ngave  students  copies  of  the answer  sheets  or  completed the\r\n\nstudents' tests himself.  Royal gave at least two students copies\r\n\nof  the  answers to  the  tractor  trailer correspondence  course\r\n\nlessons,  which were completed and  sent to ATTS.   Sometimes, he\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\ninstructed students to change a few of the answers so that  their\r\n\ntest scores would  not consistently equal one  hundred.  Although\r\n\nthe first set of lessons were provided when  a student signed up,\r\n\nthereafter the  tests and  sometimes the  answers were mailed  to\r\n\nstudents.\r\n\n          A student receiving federal  financial aid for the ATTS\r\n\nprogram was required  to have received  no prior federal  student\r\n\nloans.   When  signing  up  students  for  financial  aid,  Royal\r\n\ninstructed those who  had previous federal student  loan debt not\r\n\nto  list  the debt  on their  financial  aid applications.   Upon\r\n\nRoyal's arrival  at EZ-EM  Darryl Simmes  explained to  Royal the\r\n\nprocedure by  which student loan  checks would  be signed,  which\r\n\nincluded  paying  others  to  assist  the  school  in  getting  a\r\n\n\"reluctant  student\" to  sign  a check.    At times,  Royal  paid\r\n\nstudents twenty dollars  to sign  the loan checks.   Royal  would\r\n\nsometimes explain to students  that, by signing the  loan checks,\r\n\nthey  would  be  able to  return  the  checks  and eliminate  the\r\n\nindebtedness.     In  addition,   Royal  obtained  the  endorsing\r\n\nsignatures  of students on the  back of student  loan checks that\r\n\nthey did not  know they were  endorsing or would  be liable  for.\r\n\nThe  students often were not  told when they  entered the program\r\n\nthat they would  have to pay up  front or that they  would need a\r\n\nloan  prior to moving  on to the  next level of  the course work.\r\n\nRoyal told  one student  that the  check was  being sent back  to\r\n\nATTS, but that EZ-EM needed his signature to send it back.  Royal\r\n\ndid not inform him that he would incur debt by signing the check.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nTwo  other  students  later   received  statements  in  the  mail\r\n\nreferring  to a loan that they had  unknowingly taken out.  Royal\r\n\naccompanied recruiters  whose role it  was to  talk the  students\r\n\ninto  signing  over  the  loan  checks  to  the  school.    These\r\n\nrecruiters, however, did not explain to the students that signing\r\n\nthe loan checks would result in their incurring debt.  Royal also\r\n\nwitnessed Emmet Cotter,  the owner of  EZ-EM, using a  flashlight\r\n\nand  later a xerox machine to trace student signatures on various\r\n\ndocuments.  At one  point, Cotter also requested that  Royal sign\r\n\nthree checks totalling $30,000 so that Royal could be paid.\r\n\n          Royal signed up students for the tractor trailer course\r\n\nwho  did not have valid  drivers' licenses.   When this occurred,\r\n\nRoyal would simply  make up  a driver's license  number.   Simmes\r\n\nexplained  to Royal that,  when he recruited  students, he should\r\n\nleave blank  responses on the applications of students who stated\r\n\nthat  they did  not  have a  driver's license  or  that they  had\r\n\npreviously obtained financial aid.  Cotter explained to Royal how\r\n\nto  make up  a  driver's license  number,  which Royal  did  when\r\n\nfilling out applications for those students who did not possess a\r\n\ndriver's  license.     He  completed  applications   using  false\r\n\ninformation, including misstating an applicant's criminal record.\r\n\n          A.   Conspiracy Charge\r                    A.   Conspiracy Charge\r                                          \r\n\n          The evidence  on this record sufficiently  supports the\r\n\njury's guilty verdict on  the conspiracy charge.  The  conspiracy\r\n\ncount charged Royal with engaging in a conspiracy \"[t]o knowingly\r\n\ndevise and execute a scheme and artifice to obtain money by means\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nof false  and fraudulent pretenses, representations  and promises\r\n\nand, for the purpose  of executing and attempting to  execute the\r\n\nscheme,\" engaging in mail fraud.  As will  be discussed below, we\r\n\nfind  the evidence sufficient to convict Royal of mail fraud, the\r\n\nsubstantive offense charged in this conspiracy.\r\n\n          In  order to prove a conspiracy under section\r\n          371, the government must prove  the existence\r\n          of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of\r\n          and  voluntary participation  in it,  and the\r\n          commission of an overt  act in furtherance of\r\n          the agreement.  . . . The  agreement need not\r\n          be proved  to have been explicit,  and may be\r\n          proved by circumstantial evidence.\r\n\nUnited  States v. Frankhauser, 80  F.3d 641, 653  (1st Cir. 1996)\r                                       \r\n\n(citations  omitted).    To prove  voluntary  participation,  the\r\n\ngovernment must prove that  the defendant had an intent  to agree\r\n\nand an  intent to effectuate the  object of the conspiracy.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPiper, 35 F.3d at 615; see also Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653.  \"To\r                                                     \r\n\nuphold a conviction, the  court need not believe that  no verdict\r\n\nother than a guilty  verdict could sensibly be reached,  but must\r\n\nonly  satisfy itself that the  guilty verdict finds  support in a\r\n\nplausible rendition of the record.\"  United  States v. Echeverri,\r                                                                          \r\n\n982  F.2d 675,  677  (1st  Cir.  1993)  (citations  and  internal\r\n\nquotations omitted).\r\n\n          The  evidence  here,  taken  together  and drawing  all\r\n\nreasonable inferences therefrom,  supports Royal's conviction for\r\n\nconspiracy.   The jury  could  have concluded  that a  conspiracy\r\n\nexisted  whereby the  employees of  EZ-EM defrauded  the students\r\n\nwhom  they  signed up  for student  loans  and, in  that process,\r\n\nutilized  the United States' mails.   Furthermore, the jury could\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nhave  found that  Royal  intended  to  agree  to  engage  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy  and   intended  to  effectuate  the   object  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy.    Based on  the  circumstantial  evidence, including\r\n\ntestimony that  Royal  engaged  in acts  in  furtherance  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy,  that he described  to others his  fraudulent acts in\r\n\nfurtherance of  the conspiracy,  and gained financially  from his\r\n\nown  acts  and  those  of  his co-conspirators,  the  jury  could\r\n\nconclude  that  Royal  had  an  intent  to  agree  with  his  co-\r\n\nconspirators.   In addition,  from the  evidence that  Royal paid\r\n\nstudents  to enroll in the program, paid students to sign student\r\n\nloan  checks,  told students  who  signed  loan checks  that,  by\r\n\nsigning  the check,  they  would not  incur debt,  forged student\r                                              \r\n\ndrivers' license numbers, and misstated students' past government\r\n\nloan history and criminal records, the jury  could have concluded\r\n\nthat he did so with an  intent to defraud these students and used\r\n\nthe  mails  in  doing  so.    All  of  these  served  as acts  in\r\n\nfurtherance  of the conspiracy to  defraud.  Here,  Royal did not\r\n\nmerely know  of his fellow  employees' illegal activities.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., United States v. Soto, 716 F.2d 989, 991-92 (2d Cir. 1983).\r                                     \r\n\nRoyal took steps necessary  to effectuate the illegal conspiracy.\r\n\nAccordingly,  Royal's  conviction  on  the  conspiracy  count  is\r\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence.\r\n\n          B.   Mail Fraud\r                    B.   Mail Fraud\r                                   \r\n\n          Second, Royal complains  that his convictions on  eight\r\n\ncounts of mail fraud  were not supported by  sufficient evidence.\r\n\n\"To prove mail . .  . fraud, the government must prove,  beyond a\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nreasonable  doubt:    (1)  the defendant's  knowing  and  willing\r\n\nparticipation in  a scheme or  artifice to defraud  with specific\r\n\nintent  to  defraud, and  (2)  the use  of  the mails  .  .  . in\r\n\nfurtherance of the  scheme.\"   United States v.  Sawyer, 85  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996).   \"The defendant need not instigate the\r\n\nscheme  so  long as  he willfully  participates  in it,  with the\r\n\nknowledge of its fraudulent nature and with the intent to achieve\r\n\nits  illicit objectives.\"  United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885,\r                                                            \r\n\n891-92 (1st Cir.  1993).   A particular defendant  need not  have\r\n\nplaced a specific item into the mails.  It is enough that the use\r\n\nof  the  mails took  place in  the  ordinary course  of business,\r\n\nPereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8 (1954), or was reasonably\r                                  \r\n\nforeseeable as a result  of the conspiracy participants' actions,\r\n\nYefsky, 994 F.2d at 892.\r                \r\n\n          Here, documents  in which  Royal included  misstated or\r\n\nfraudulent information were sent to ATTS.   Even if Royal did not\r\n\nplace those documents  into the  mails, it follows  that, in  the\r\n\nordinary  course  of  business,  admissions  and federal  student\r\n\nfinancial aid applications  completed by Royal  would be sent  to\r\n\nATTS, the  information from those  applications would be  sent to\r\n\nthe  Department of  Education,  and information  from the  school\r\n\nwould be sent to the students.  It also follows that student loan\r\n\nchecks would  be sent  through the mails.   The  jury could  have\r\n\nreasonably found that it was reasonably foreseeable by Royal that\r\n\nthe mails would be utilized to perpetrate this scheme to defraud.\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          The scheme to defraud in this case consisted of actions\r\n\non the part of  EZ-EM employees to convince  students to sign  up\r\n\nfor  the ATTS program, apply for federal student loans, loans for\r\n\nwhich  they sometimes did not  qualify, incur debt  that they did\r\n\nnot realize they would be obligated to repay, and to mislead some\r\n\nstudents to believe that  they would not incur debt  by endorsing\r\n\nthe  loan  checks.    As  a  result  of  these  acts,  ATTS  paid\r\n\ncommissions to EZ-EM.   From these commissions, the  employees of\r\n\nEZ-EM  who perpetrated the acts to defraud the students were paid\r\n\nsalaries or commissions.   The jury  could reasonably have  found\r\n\nthat  these acts constituted a scheme to defraud the students EZ-\r\n\nEM enrolled in ATTS.\r\n\n          Royal  contends  that the  government  was required  to\r\n\nprove  that  he had  the specific  intent  to defraud  the United\r\n\nStates Department of Education.   Although the indictment against\r\n\nRoyal charges him  with \"a  scheme to defraud  the United  States\r\n\nDepartment  of  Education,  and  the   students  and  prospective\r\n\nstudents  of ATTS,\" the government was not required to prove that\r\n\nhe intended to defraud  the Department of Education specifically.\r\n\nThe statute requires only that there be a scheme to  defraud, see\r                                                                           \r\n\n18  U.S.C.   1341,  and we  have  required only  a  showing of  a\r\n\nspecific intent to  defraud.

The jury  could have reasonably found\r\n\nthat Royal had a specific intent to engage in a scheme to defraud\r\n\nthe students.  This is all that is  required.  Royal's conviction\r\n\non the  mail fraud  counts is supported  by sufficient  evidence.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nBecause  the government  met its  burden by  showing a  scheme to\r\n\ndefraud  the students, we do  not address whether  it also proved\r\n\nthat Royal had  a specific  intent to defraud  the Department  of\r\n\nEducation.\r\n\n            IV.

The\r                                \r\n\nrecord   on  which   the   district  court   based  its   factual\r\n\ndetermination  of  Royal's  role  in this  offense  supports  the\r\n\nfinding that Royal was neither a minimal nor a minor participant.\r\n\nRoyal's role in the  EZ-EM operation was integral.   He recruited\r\n\nstudents  for a program for which EZ-EM, and in turn Royal, would\r\n\nreceive  monetary commissions.   Royal  falsified information  on\r\n\nschool applications  and federal  student loan applications.   He\r\n\nwas  responsible  for   obtaining  student  signatures  endorsing\r\n\nstudent  loan  checks.    Indeed,  Royal  even  misled  some into\r\n\nbelieving that by endorsing  the check they would be  relieved of\r\n\nany indebtedness.   All of these acts were integral to the scheme\r\n\nto   defraud  the   students  and   the  co-conspirators   gained\r\n\nfinancially as a result.  The district court also was entitled to\r\n\nfind that Royal had  knowledge of and intent to further the scope\r\n\nand  all aspects of  the conspiracy.

Royal's\r                            \r\n\nburden is  a heavy one and  although he may consider  his role in\r\n\nthe offense more comparable to that  found in the cases he cites,\r\n\nthe  district court found otherwise.  \"[W]here there is more than\r\n\none plausible  view of the circumstances,  the sentencing court's\r\n\nchoice   among   supportable  alternatives   cannot   be  clearly\r\n\nerroneous.\"   United States v.

See  U.S.S.G.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  2F1.1(b)(2)(A).  Royal maintains that the trial testimony shows\r\n\nthat he was \"merely an office attendant\" at EZ-EM and that he was\r\n\nnot  present when  the \"principal  planners\" met  to discuss  the\r\n\nscheme.\r\n\n          The Commentary  to section  2F1.1 refers the  reader to\r\n\nthe definition of \"more  than minimal planning\" set forth  in the\r\n\nCommentary to section 1B1.1.  There, \"more than minimal planning\"\r\n\nis defined as \"more  planning than typical for commission  of the\r\n\noffense  in a simple form.\"   U.S.S.G.    1B1.1, application note\r\n\n1(f).  \"'More  than minimal  planning' is deemed  present in  any\r\n\ncase involving repeated acts over a period of time,  unless it is\r\n\nclear that each instance was purely opportune.\"  Id.\r                                                              \r\n\n          \"[W]e  are not  inclined to reverse  a finding  of more\r\n\nthan minimal planning unless  the evidence compels the conclusion\r\n\nthat the  defendant's actions were  purely opportune or  'spur of\r\n\nthe moment.'\"   United States v.

The\r\n\nsentencing  court  was entitled  to  find,  under the  definition\r\n\nprovided by  the guidelines,  that Royal's  repeated acts in  the\r\n\ncourse of  this conspiracy  required more than  minimal planning.\r\n\nThe district  court did not  err in making a  departure upward to\r\n\ntake this into account.\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\n                      V.

Restitution Order\r                                                     \r\n\n          Royal makes  two arguments challenging the  validity of\r\n\nthe district court's restitution order.  Royal contends  that the\r\n\norder of  restitution  in  the amount  of  $30,000  lacked  legal\r\n\nsupport because  it  attributes more  losses  to him  than  those\r\n\ncaused  by the counts for which  he was convicted.  Royal further\r\n\nmaintains that the  order was  improper because he  is unable  to\r\n\nrepay such a large amount.   The district court has the authority\r\n\nto impose restitution under  Title 18 of the United  States Code,\r\n\nsections 3663 and 3664.\r\n\n          Royal's  first  contention  amounts  to  the following.\r\n\nBecause  his  convictions  included  four counts  of  mail  fraud\r\n\nrelating to the mailing  of only four loan checks, he should only\r\n\nbe  required  to pay  restitution in  the  total amount  of those\r\n\nchecks, $9870.   In the  alternative, Royal argues  that, if  his\r\n\nconviction for  conspiracy is included in  the restitution order,\r\n\nthe  total loss reasonably foreseeable to him would be the amount\r\n\nof checks  that passed through EZ-EM during the time he worked at\r\n\nthe Niagara Falls operation.   Royal claims this amount  would be\r\n\nno  more than $17,272.50.  Based on this analysis, Royal contends\r\n\nthat the restitution order of $30,000 was excessive.\r\n\n          At  the time  of  Royal's criminal  acts, a  sentencing\r\n\ncourt could  impose  restitution only  for losses  caused by  the\r\n\ndefendant's  offense or  offenses.   18 U.S.C.    3663;  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nHughey  v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 414 (1990); United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Camuti,  78 F.3d  738, 746  (1st  Cir. 1996).   Although  this\r                   \r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nauthority  under  the  statute   was  subsequently  broadened  by\r\n\ncongressional amendment  to require  restitution to  include harm\r\n\nresulting from \"the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of\r\n\nthe  scheme, conspiracy, or pattern,\"  see 18 U.S.C.   3663(a)(2)\r                                                    \r\n\n(Supp.  1996), the amendments  do not  apply retroactively.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCamuti, 78 F.3d at  746.  Accordingly, under the  applicable law,\r                \r\n\nRoyal is  correct in  arguing  that he  may  be ordered  to  make\r\n\nrestitution only  for the  \"loss caused by  the specific  conduct\r\n\nthat is the  basis of the  offense of conviction.\"   Hughey,  495\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. at 413.\r\n\n          We have previously held that restitution may be imposed\r\n\nfor a mail fraud conviction \"only if it stems from a  transaction\r\n\nlinked to  a specific mailing.\"   Camuti, 78 F.3d at  746.  While\r                                                  \r\n\nthe amount attributable to the specific mailings  for which Royal\r\n\nwas  convicted may amount to only $9870, Royal was also convicted\r\n\nof  conspiracy  to defraud  the Department  of Education  and the\r\n\nstudents  of ATTS.  In  the sentencing context,  one convicted of\r\n\nconspiracy may be held liable for the acts of his co-conspirators\r\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable,\r\n\nas  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  explicitly  provide.    U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  1b1.3(a)(1)(B);  see also  United States  v. O'Connor,  28 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n218, 222 (1st  Cir. 1994).   Thus, the  district court may  order\r\n\nRoyal to pay restitution not only for an amount equivalent to the\r\n\nfour student loan checks  involved in the mail fraud  counts, but\r\n\nalso for any other reasonably foreseeable loss caused by Royal or\r\n\nhis co-conspirators acting in furtherance of this conspiracy.\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\n          Royal  has argued  that the  district court  improperly\r\n\nbased  its loss  determination on  defaults caused  by acts  that\r\n\noccurred in 1988, prior to the time in the last one or two months\r\n\nof 1988 when he joined the Niagara Falls conspiracy.   It is true\r\n\nthat  \"[b]y definition,  acts  that occurred  before a  defendant\r\n\nenters  a conspiracy  cannot be  foreseeable.\"  United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBalogun, 989  F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1993).   And upon a review of\r                 \r\n\nthe  sentencing hearing  transcript,  it  indeed appears  unclear\r\n\nwhether the sentencing court took into account acts that occurred\r\n\nprior to Royal's involvement.  But the record also indicates that\r\n\nRoyal  waived  this objection  in  the  district court,  and  any\r\n\nhypothetical  error in the calculation  of loss does  not rise to\r\n\nthe  level of plain error.  See  United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n655, 659  (1st Cir. 1995), cert.  denied,    U.S.   ,  116 S. Ct.\r                                                  \r\n\n1366 (1996).\r\n\n          Although Royal extensively challenged  the government's\r\n\ncalculation of the  reasonably foreseeable  loss attributable  to\r\n\nhim,  he  never  argued  that  the  loss  calculation  improperly\r\n\nincluded  losses  connected  with   acts  prior  to  his  initial\r\n\ninvolvement.  Having failed to  raise this objection below, Royal\r\n\nis now bound to demonstrate that any error  affected \"substantial\r\n\nrights.\"  Id.  But this seems doubtful -- the  district court set\r                       \r\n\nthe total amount of restitution at $500,000,  but ordered partial\r\n\nrestitution of  only $30,000 because of Royal's lack of financial\r\n\nresources.    Even   if  the  court   had  excluded  all   losses\r\n\nattributable to  acts from  1988, it seems  implausible that  the\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\ncourt's total restitution figure would have dropped from $500,000\r\n\nto less than $30,000.  Because any possible error here falls well\r\n\nshort  of the standard for considering  waived claims, we decline\r\n\nto remand the restitution determination.\r\n\n          Finally,  Royal's contention that  the district court's\r\n\nrestitution order is in  error because Royal lacks the  financial\r\n\nresources necessary to repay the amount imposed is without merit.\r\n\nWe have  noted in the past  that, although a court  must consider\r\n\nthe   financial  situation   of  the   defendant  when   imposing\r\n\nrestitution, see 18 U.S.C.    3664(a), it need not  make specific\r                          \r\n\nfindings  regarding  the defendant's  finances  \"so  long as  the\r\n\nrecord on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or\r\n\notherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\"\r\n\nUnited States  v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir. 1993).  The\r                                  \r\n\nrecord adequately reflects the  district court's consideration of\r\n\nRoyal's  financial  ability to  make  restitution.   Indeed,  the\r\n\ndistrict court lowered the amount of restitution from $500,000 to\r\n\n$30,000   in   light    of   Royal's   financial   circumstances.\r\n\nFurthermore,  the court  noted that  if Royal  is unable  to make\r\n\nrestitution in  full during the  course of his  prison employment\r\n\nand  thereafter  during  the period  of  his  parole,  he has  no\r\n\nobligation.    \"Although  we  agree  that  the  evidence  in  the\r\n\npresentence  report may  not be  able to  support a  finding that\r\n\n[Royal]  has the ability to  pay restitution in  that amount, the\r\n\nstatute  does not require such  a finding; it  requires only that\r\n\nthe district court consider the defendant's financial resource as\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\na factor in arriving at the figure.\"  United States v.

We find that  the sentencing court\r\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by imposing restitution here.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          Based  on the  foregoing  considerations, we  affirm in\r                                                                  affirm\r                                                                        \r\n\npart and reverse and remand in part.\r                   reverse     remand\r                                     \r\n\n          So ordered.\r                              \r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n",

Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, United States v. Kayne, 90 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1996), the jury could have found the following. EZ-EM, Inc., was a distributorship for Andover Tractor Trailer School (\"ATTS\"), a correspondence school in Methuen, Massachusetts. ATTS was party to a program participation agreement with the Department of Education to participate in the PELL grant program, the Guaranteed Student Loan program, the Plus program, and the Supplemental Loans for Students program. Under the agreement, ATTS must require a maximum time frame in which students complete a course with a minimum grade average. ATTS entered into a series of distributors' agreements whereby each distributor would refer students to enroll in ATTS's program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Darryl Simmes, the financial aid officer for ATTS at EZ-EM, testified that he also acted as a recruiter for EZ-EM. Simmes worked at ALAT, another distributor affiliated with ATTS, prior to joining EZ-EM. Simmes testified that, at ALAT, when a student he recruited did not meet the minimum requirements of the program, he falsified the student's application to make it appear that he met those requirements. These minimum requirements included possessing a driver's license and making less than a certain income to be eligible for financial aid. Later, at EZ-EM, Simmes would contact a student he had recruited to sign a student loan check made out to both the student and the school. These students were told that they would not incur debt by signing the check and, often, later found that they had defaulted on loans they were not aware they had taken out. During the course of EZ-EM's existence, the distributorship enrolled at least 150 students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometimes, EZ-EM provided students with a set of exams including answers, requesting that a newly registered student sign off on the exams. Other times, the tests were forwarded to the student already completed. The completed forms would then be returned to ATTS. EZ-EM also supplied students with answers to later lessons, sometimes mailing these lessons to students. EZ-EM would inform students that they must sign the lessons or risk being thrown out of the program. Employees of EZ-EM paid some students to enroll in the ATTS program. ATTS paid EZ-EM a commission of $600-$700 per student enrolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury indicted Royal on October 7, 1992, on charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 371, mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 1341, and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 2. On March 13, 1995, the scheduled day of trial, a petit jury venire of 53 appeared for impanelment. Royal, a black male, orally moved to strike the jury venire. The court granted this motion and rescheduled the trial for one week from that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, Royal filed a motion to inspect the master jury wheel for the years from 1993 to 1995. The following day, Royal filed a Motion to Strike Jury Venire, which argued that the district's jury selection plan systematically excludes blacks from the jury pool. The district court deferred ruling on these motions until Royal could make a proffer demonstrating that the jury plan systematically excluded blacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 1995, trial commenced in the district court. After viewing the jury venire, Royal renewed his motion to strike the jury venire. Royal further moved for a hearing with respect to the inadequacies of the Amended Jury Plan for the Eastern Division of the District of Massachusetts (\"Amended Jury Plan\"). In support of his various motions, Royal submitted two affidavits from Dr. Gordon Sutton, Professor of Sociology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, which contended that the Amended Jury Plan systematically excluded blacks and other minorities from the jury venire. The district court determined that it did not have statutory authorization to implement the remedy Royal suggested -- supplementing the jury venire such that it would provide a fair cross-section of the community -- and denied Royal's motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the close of the government's case, Royal moved for judgment of acquittal on all counts. The district court granted the motion only as to Count 24, charging mail fraud. After a six day trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of mail fraud, with verdicts of not guilty on four counts of mail fraud. Royal's sentence included 27 months imprisonment, 36 months supervised release, and restitution of $30,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Jury Selection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Royal asserts that he was unconstitutionally denied his right to a jury selected at random from a fair cross-section of the community, as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 528 (1975). That same right is ensured by the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968. See 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1861 et seq. (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Inspect the Master Jury Wheel Records</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To the extent that [Royal's] contentions rest on statutory interpretations, we review the district court's denial of [Royal's] motion de novo. . . . The district court's factual findings, however, will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\" United States v. Bailey, 76 F.3d 320, 321 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 1889 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the first hearing, held on March 15, 1995, the district court stated that the request before it was essentially a request for an evidentiary hearing to extend the scope of requested evidence to include discovery of the master jury wheel. The court then placed the burden on Royal to show \"by a factually supportable submission that there is some reasonable basis for supposing that the matters you're asking to get into will have some material bearing upon a decision I am to make.\" Transcript of hearing, March 15, 1995, at 6. Because Royal made no factually supportable showing of relevance and materiality, the district court denied the motion to inspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a second motion to inspect the jury records, the district court suggested that, in order to inspect the requested records, Royal was required to make a showing that he would be able to satisfy the three prongs of Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979). Under Duren, in order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement, \"the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a 'distinctive' group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this under-representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\" Id. at 364. The district court expressed concern that Royal would not be able to satisfy the third prong by showing systematic exclusion. Accordingly, it deferred ruling until Royal could make a showing that would enable the court \"to determine whether we are doing something that is potentially useful or instead doing something that's just a waste of resources because it will not be useful in any event.\" Transcript of Hearing, March 17, 1995, at 15-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a jury selected from a source fairly representative of the community. See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527-28 (1975). Section 1867 of Title 28<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> establishes \"the exclusive means by which a person accused of a Federal crime . . . may challenge any jury on the ground that such jury was not selected in conformity with the provisions of [the Title].\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(e) (1994). In Test v. United States, 420 U.S. 28 (1975), the Supreme Court interpreted the relevant statutory language of section 1867. See Test, 420 U.S. at 30. Before voir dire examination or within seven days after the defendant could have discovered the grounds for a challenge, a defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings for substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the title. 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(a). The statute requires that the challenge be accompanied by \"a sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with\" these provisions. 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(d). Relevant to our inquiry here, subsection (f) of section 1867 provides that \"[t]he parties . . . shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and copy such records or papers at all reasonable times during the preparation and pendency of such a motion.\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(f). It is this particular subsection with which the Supreme Court was concerned in Test and which is dispositive of Royal's challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Test, the district court denied the defendant's motion to inspect the jury selection records pursuant to section 1867(e). Test, 420 U.S. at 29. The Supreme Court determined that the language in subsection (e) established \"essentially an unqualified right to inspect jury lists.\" Id. at 30. This interpretation was supported \"not only by the plain text of the statute, but also by the statute's overall purpose of insuring 'grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community.'\" Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1861). The Court admonished that, without such access, a litigant will be unable to determine whether he has a meritorious claim. See id. We adhere to and apply the Supreme Court's determination that a defendant, such as Royal, challenging the jury selection procedures has an unqualified right to inspect jury records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the right of access to jury selection records is \"unqualified,\" a district court may not premise the grant or denial of a motion to inspect upon a showing of probable success on the merits of a challenge to the jury selection provisions. See Test, 420 U.S. at 30. Although the burden is on the defendant to establish a prima facie case of unconstitutional exclusion, see United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18, 22 n.4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 326 (1994), the right of access to the jury selection records is a precursor to this burden and is intended to provide the defendant with the evidence necessary to mount a proper showing. To avail himself of the right of access to jury selection records, a litigant need only allege that he is preparing a motion to challenge the jury selection process. See United States v. Alden, 776 F.2d 771, 773 (8th Cir. 1985). The district court, therefore, erred in requiring Royal to make a showing of probable success on the merits of his jury selection challenge as a condition of granting access to the records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, a district court may not require a defendant requesting access to jury selection records to submit with that request \"a sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title.\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(d). The procedural mechanisms of the jury selection provisions require the moving party to submit a sworn statement to support a motion to strike a jury venire or challenge the selection processes; such a sworn statement is not required to support a motion to inspect the records. See id. The Supreme Court has established that the right of access is \"unqualified.\" The Eighth Circuit, faced with an appeal of the nature of Royal's, recognized that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]lthough the district court's analysis is persuasive, the district court is not free to establish additional requirements that defendants must meet in order to gain access to jury selection records. The Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the right to inspect these records is 'essentially unqualified' and is conditioned only in the manner set forth in the statute. Test v. United States, 420 U.S. at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alden, 776 F.2d at 775. Thus, while the district court may establish reasonable procedures whereby the inspection may take place, the district court does not have discretion to formulate additional requirements beyond those established by the statute. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we find that this error does not require that we reverse Royal's conviction. Rather, we remand the case with instructions to allow Royal access to \"[t]he contents of records or papers used by the jury commission or clerk in connection with the jury selection process,\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(f), in order to support a motion to strike the jury venire. If Royal determines that the Amended Jury Plan violates the jury selection procedures required under the statute, he may move for a new trial under 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(a). See United States v. Marcano-Garca, 622 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1980). If the district court finds that the Amended Jury Plan violates the constitutional and statutory requirements, the court may order a new trial. 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a remedy for the allegedly unconstitutional jury selection process, Royal seeks an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his claim. As we noted above, the district court treated Royal's motion to strike the jury venire as a request for an evidentiary hearing regarding the contents of the master jury wheel. The district court sought from Royal a showing by a factually supportable submission that the documents Royal sought would have a material bearing on the jury selection challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal motions context, a \"party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden.\" United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993). When a judge denies a party's request for an evidentiary hearing, we review that determination for abuse of discretion. United States v. Jim  nez Martnez, 83 F.3d 488, 498 (1st Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Garca, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that a criminal defendant \"is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing upon demand\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court denied the motion for a hearing because it found that Royal failed to show that he could meet the third prong of the Duren test. However, Royal's motion was made without the benefit of information to which he was entitled as a matter of law. On remand, if Royal is able to use this information on the jury selection process to show a factual dispute that, if resolved in his favor, would entitle him to relief, then he would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion to Strike the Jury Venire</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Royal was erroneously denied access to the jury selection documents, his arguments in support of his challenge are not fully developed. At this time, our consideration of the merits of his challenge would be premature. We remand to the district court Royal's jury selection challenge so that it may review Royal's claim in the first instance, after a full record has been developed. See Davidson v. Sullivan, 942 F.2d 90, 96 (1st Cir. 1991) (adopting a similar posture). We do not pass on the merits of Royal's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Jury Instruction on Conspiracy Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal contends that the district court's jury instruction on the charge of conspiracy was in error and that error lessened the government's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In deciding whether the trial court submitted erroneous instructions to the jury, we \"determine whether [the instruction] tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.\" Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 353 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 937 (1990). We consider the instructions \"as a whole; portions of it are not to be treated in isolation.\" Id. We find that the instructions, as a whole, were not erroneous. In fact, as discussed below, the double intent instruction may have heightened the government's burden. Consequently, not only did the instruction not prejudice Royal, it in fact benefitted Royal. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory provision under which Royal was charged finds a violation of the law \"[i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 371 (1966). The district court's instruction on the charge of conspiracy was, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish that the defendant is guilty of this charge of conspiracy, the Government must prove these essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First: That two or more persons knowingly conspired, combined or agreed to commit an offense against the United States, the purpose of which was to commit mail fraud, and that the conspiracy was formed or existing at or about the time alleged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second: That the defendant knowingly and intentionally became a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third: That one of the conspirators knowingly did some act to effect the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intent that the Government must prove beyond reasonable doubt to establish the charge of conspiracy in this case is an intent to defraud as alleged in the indictment. It is not necessary, however, for the Government to prove an intent on the part of the defendant to participate in all parts or aspects of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two aspects of the intent the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Government must prove the intent to agree to be a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Government must prove the intent to participate in the commission of at least one of the substantive offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript at 6-49 -- 6-54. Royal, in his brief, sets out the following portion of the instructions in support of his claim that the district court erred in its instructions to the jury on the required intent of conspiracy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not required that the Government prove, in order to establish the conspiracy offense, that the defendant had the intent to commit personally all of the substantive crimes that were within the object of the conspiracy. Stated another way, the requirement is that the Government prove both an intent to agree to be a member of the conspiracy and an intent to participate personally in the commission of at least one of the substantive offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 6-54. Reviewing this instruction, we find that the district court's instructions, by using language that imposes a higher burden on the government than the law requires, did not prejudice Royal. Therefore, reversal of Royal's conviction is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal claims that this court has applied two different definitions of conspiracy, and that the district court's attempt to reconcile the conspiracy precedents led to the error of which he now complains. Royal contends that the controlling law in this circuit requires the government to prove that Royal intended to enter into the agreement forming the conspiracy and intended to commit the substantive offense. In so arguing, Royal misreads this court's precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has said that \"[i]n a conspiracy, two different types of intent are generally required -- the basic intent to agree, which is necessary to establish the existence of the conspiracy, and the more traditional intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 443 n.20 (1978). It is by now well-settled that the government need not prove that the defendant intended personally to commit the substantive crime or crimes that were the object of the conspiracy. United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1118 (1995). Piper plainly refutes Royal's argument that he was entitled to an instruction that he intended to commit multiple acts of mail fraud. The district court's instruction that \"the government must prove the intent to participate in the commission of at least one of the substantive offenses\" was, if anything, generous, and we find no error prejudicing Royal's rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the legal principles were properly presented to the jury, we turn to Royal's argument that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for conspiracy and mail fraud. Royal contends first that there was no evidence of his knowledge of the conspiracy and \"virtually no evidence\" that he engaged in fraudulent conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud the government and the students he enrolled in the program. Royal also argues that the government failed to prove that he had the specific intent to defraud the Department of Education required to support his mail fraud conviction. We first review the evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we 'review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant [was] guilty as charged.'\" United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied sub nom., __ U.S. __, 114 S. Ct. 1550 (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, the jury could have found the following about Royal's involvement in the EZ-EM conspiracy. Appellant Royal began working for EZ-EM in December 1988. At the beginning of 1989, he replaced Darryl Simmes as financial aid officer at EZ-EM a position paid by ATTS. At the time he held that position, financial aid officers were prohibited from engaging in recruitment activities. While serving as financial aid officer at EZ-EM Royal also engaged in recruitment activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For each student he enrolled in the ATTS program, Royal received a $100-$125 commission. For this commission, Royal would pay current students to bring in others to enroll in the program. Royal also paid students to enroll in the program. Royal was given a copy of the answers to provide students to help them complete the ten lessons required upon enrollment. Royal was aware that many of the students who signed up did not intend to complete the ATTS program, but merely signed up to receive the twenty dollars he paid them. Because of this, he often either gave students copies of the answer sheets or completed the students' tests himself. Royal gave at least two students copies of the answers to the tractor trailer correspondence course lessons, which were completed and sent to ATTS. Sometimes, he instructed students to change a few of the answers so that their test scores would not consistently equal one hundred. Although the first set of lessons were provided when a student signed up, thereafter the tests and sometimes the answers were mailed to students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A student receiving federal financial aid for the ATTS program was required to have received no prior federal student loans. When signing up students for financial aid, Royal instructed those who had previous federal student loan debt not to list the debt on their financial aid applications. Upon Royal's arrival at EZ-EM Darryl Simmes explained to Royal the procedure by which student loan checks would be signed, which included paying others to assist the school in getting a \"reluctant student\" to sign a check. At times, Royal paid students twenty dollars to sign the loan checks. Royal would sometimes explain to students that, by signing the loan checks, they would be able to return the checks and eliminate the indebtedness. In addition, Royal obtained the endorsing signatures of students on the back of student loan checks that they did not know they were endorsing or would be liable for. The students often were not told when they entered the program that they would have to pay up front or that they would need a loan prior to moving on to the next level of the course work. Royal told one student that the check was being sent back to ATTS, but that EZ-EM needed his signature to send it back. Royal did not inform him that he would incur debt by signing the check. Two other students later received statements in the mail referring to a loan that they had unknowingly taken out. Royal accompanied recruiters whose role it was to talk the students into signing over the loan checks to the school. These recruiters, however, did not explain to the students that signing the loan checks would result in their incurring debt. Royal also witnessed Emmet Cotter, the owner of EZ-EM, using a flashlight and later a xerox machine to trace student signatures on various documents. At one point, Cotter also requested that Royal sign three checks totalling $30,000 so that Royal could be paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal signed up students for the tractor trailer course who did not have valid drivers' licenses. When this occurred, Royal would simply make up a driver's license number. Simmes explained to Royal that, when he recruited students, he should leave blank responses on the applications of students who stated that they did not have a driver's license or that they had previously obtained financial aid. Cotter explained to Royal how to make up a driver's license number, which Royal did when filling out applications for those students who did not possess a driver's license. He completed applications using false information, including misstating an applicant's criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Conspiracy Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on this record sufficiently supports the jury's guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge. The conspiracy count charged Royal with engaging in a conspiracy \"[t]o knowingly devise and execute a scheme and artifice to obtain money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises and, for the purpose of executing and attempting to execute the scheme,\" engaging in mail fraud. As will be discussed below, we find the evidence sufficient to convict Royal of mail fraud, the substantive offense charged in this conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove a conspiracy under section 371, the government must prove the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of and voluntary participation in it, and the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. . . . The agreement need not be proved to have been explicit, and may be proved by circumstantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). To prove voluntary participation, the government must prove that the defendant had an intent to agree and an intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. See Piper, 35 F.3d at 615; see also Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653. \"To uphold a conviction, the court need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.\" United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here, taken together and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, supports Royal's conviction for conspiracy. The jury could have concluded that a conspiracy existed whereby the employees of EZ-EM defrauded the students whom they signed up for student loans and, in that process, utilized the United States' mails. Furthermore, the jury could have found that Royal intended to agree to engage in the conspiracy and intended to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. Based on the circumstantial evidence, including testimony that Royal engaged in acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, that he described to others his fraudulent acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, and gained financially from his own acts and those of his co-conspirators, the jury could conclude that Royal had an intent to agree with his co-conspirators. In addition, from the evidence that Royal paid students to enroll in the program, paid students to sign student loan checks, told students who signed loan checks that, by signing the check, they would not incur debt, forged student drivers' license numbers, and misstated students' past government loan history and criminal records, the jury could have concluded that he did so with an intent to defraud these students and used the mails in doing so. All of these served as acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud. Here, Royal did not merely know of his fellow employees' illegal activities. See, e.g., United States v. Soto, 716 F.2d 989, 991-92 (2d Cir. 1983). Royal took steps necessary to effectuate the illegal conspiracy. Accordingly, Royal's conviction on the conspiracy count is supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Mail Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Royal complains that his convictions on eight counts of mail fraud were not supported by sufficient evidence. \"To prove mail . . . fraud, the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails . . . in furtherance of the scheme.\" United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996). \"The defendant need not instigate the scheme so long as he willfully participates in it, with the knowledge of its fraudulent nature and with the intent to achieve its illicit objectives.\" United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 891-92 (1st Cir. 1993). A particular defendant need not have placed a specific item into the mails. It is enough that the use of the mails took place in the ordinary course of business, Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8 (1954), or was reasonably foreseeable as a result of the conspiracy participants' actions, Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 892.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, documents in which Royal included misstated or fraudulent information were sent to ATTS. Even if Royal did not place those documents into the mails, it follows that, in the ordinary course of business, admissions and federal student financial aid applications completed by Royal would be sent to ATTS, the information from those applications would be sent to the Department of Education, and information from the school would be sent to the students. It also follows that student loan checks would be sent through the mails. The jury could have reasonably found that it was reasonably foreseeable by Royal that the mails would be utilized to perpetrate this scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme to defraud in this case consisted of actions on the part of EZ-EM employees to convince students to sign up for the ATTS program, apply for federal student loans, loans for which they sometimes did not qualify, incur debt that they did not realize they would be obligated to repay, and to mislead some students to believe that they would not incur debt by endorsing the loan checks. As a result of these acts, ATTS paid commissions to EZ-EM. From these commissions, the employees of EZ-EM who perpetrated the acts to defraud the students were paid salaries or commissions. The jury could reasonably have found that these acts constituted a scheme to defraud the students EZ-EM enrolled in ATTS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal contends that the government was required to prove that he had the specific intent to defraud the United States Department of Education. Although the indictment against Royal charges him with \"a scheme to defraud the United States Department of Education, and the students and prospective students of ATTS,\" the government was not required to prove that he intended to defraud the Department of Education specifically. The statute requires only that there be a scheme to defraud, see 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 1341, and we have required only a showing of a specific intent to defraud. United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 723 (1st Cir. 1996). The jury could have reasonably found that Royal had a specific intent to engage in a scheme to defraud the students. This is all that is required. Royal's conviction on the mail fraud counts is supported by sufficient evidence. Because the government met its burden by showing a scheme to defraud the students, we do not address whether it also proved that Royal had a specific intent to defraud the Department of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Application of Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal next directs several challenges at the district court's application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We review a district court's factual determinations under the guidelines for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1993). We address each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mitigating Role -- Section 3B1.2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal contends that his role in the commission of this conspiracy was of such a lesser degree of culpability than his co-conspirators' that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a downward departure. \"We first note that defendants are not automatically entitled to a downward adjustment, whatever their role in the crime.\" Balogun, 989 F.2d at 22-23. The Sentencing Guidelines allow a four level departure for one who is a minimal participant, meant to apply to those \"defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\" U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2, application note 1. This departure is meant to be used infrequently. U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2, application note 2. The Guidelines allow a two level departure for one who is a minor participant in the criminal activity; this departure is meant to apply to \"any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2, application note 3. Where the defendant's conduct falls between these two levels of culpability, a downward departure of three levels may be awarded. U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The defendant has the burden of showing that he is entitled to a reduction in his offense level under Section(s) 3B1.2 . . . . On appeal, the defendant must establish that the district court's determination was clearly erroneous.\" United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 706, 716 (1st Cir. 1995). The record on which the district court based its factual determination of Royal's role in this offense supports the finding that Royal was neither a minimal nor a minor participant. Royal's role in the EZ-EM operation was integral. He recruited students for a program for which EZ-EM, and in turn Royal, would receive monetary commissions. Royal falsified information on school applications and federal student loan applications. He was responsible for obtaining student signatures endorsing student loan checks. Indeed, Royal even misled some into believing that by endorsing the check they would be relieved of any indebtedness. All of these acts were integral to the scheme to defraud the students and the co-conspirators gained financially as a result. The district court also was entitled to find that Royal had knowledge of and intent to further the scope and all aspects of the conspiracy. We cannot find that Royal played a less significant role or that he was less culpable than his co-conspirators in effecting the scheme to defraud. See, e.g., Santiago-Gonz lez, 66 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 1995). Based on these findings, we cannot say that the district court's sentencing determination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal compares his situation to cases in which conspirators were granted downward departures. In those cases, the sentencing court determined that the defendant's role in the commission of the crime was minimal or minor. See, e.g., United States v. Mu  oz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1238 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied sub nom., __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 1164 (1995); United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 490 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1120 (1994); United States v. De La Cruz, 996 F.2d 1307, 1314-15 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 936 (1993); United States v. DiIorio, 948 F.2d 1, 3-6 (1st Cir. 1991). Royal's burden is a heavy one and although he may consider his role in the offense more comparable to that found in the cases he cites, the district court found otherwise. \"[W]here there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\" United States v. Santiago-Gonz lez, 66 F.3d at 7. Royal claims that the only evidence offered against him at trial was that \"he worked in the Niagara Falls office of ATTS and met some of the government's witnesses when they visited the office.\" Royal's attempt to put his own spin on the facts does not render the district court's determination clearly erroneous. Each of Royal's acts was an integral part of the scheme to defraud and the sentencing court was not clearly erroneous in denying Royal's requested downward departure under the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. More than Minimal Planning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal complains that the district court improperly adjusted upward two levels because Royal's acts and role in the offense required more than minimal planning. See U.S.S.G. Section(s) 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). Royal maintains that the trial testimony shows that he was \"merely an office attendant\" at EZ-EM and that he was not present when the \"principal planners\" met to discuss the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commentary to section 2F1.1 refers the reader to the definition of \"more than minimal planning\" set forth in the Commentary to section 1B1.1. There, \"more than minimal planning\" is defined as \"more planning than typical for commission of the offense in a simple form.\" U.S.S.G. Section(s) 1B1.1, application note 1(f). \"'More than minimal planning' is deemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]e are not inclined to reverse a finding of more than minimal planning unless the evidence compels the conclusion that the defendant's actions were purely opportune or 'spur of the moment.'\" United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 459 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 80 (1994). We find that here, the complex scheme to defraud and Royal's conduct in furtherance of it were not purely opportune and, therefore, meet the definition of \"more than minimal planning.\" The trial testimony demonstrates that Royal engaged in several repeated fraudulent acts in furtherance of this conspiracy. The sentencing court was entitled to find, under the definition provided by the guidelines, that Royal's repeated acts in the course of this conspiracy required more than minimal planning. The district court did not err in making a departure upward to take this into account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal makes two arguments challenging the validity of the district court's restitution order. Royal contends that the order of restitution in the amount of $30,000 lacked legal support because it attributes more losses to him than those caused by the counts for which he was convicted. Royal further maintains that the order was improper because he is unable to repay such a large amount. The district court has the authority to impose restitution under Title 18 of the United States Code, sections 3663 and 3664.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal's first contention amounts to the following. Because his convictions included four counts of mail fraud relating to the mailing of only four loan checks, he should only be required to pay restitution in the total amount of those checks, $9870. In the alternative, Royal argues that, if his conviction for conspiracy is included in the restitution order, the total loss reasonably foreseeable to him would be the amount of checks that passed through EZ-EM during the time he worked at the Niagara Falls operation. Royal claims this amount would be no more than $17,272.50. Based on this analysis, Royal contends that the restitution order of $30,000 was excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Royal's criminal acts, a sentencing court could impose restitution only for losses caused by the defendant's offense or offenses. 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 3663; see also Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 414 (1990); United States v. Camuti, 78 F.3d 738, 746 (1st Cir. 1996). Although this authority under the statute was subsequently broadened by congressional amendment to require restitution to include harm resulting from \"the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern,\" see 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 3663(a)(2) (Supp. 1996), the amendments do not apply retroactively. See Camuti, 78 F.3d at 746. Accordingly, under the applicable law, Royal is correct in arguing that he may be ordered to make restitution only for the \"loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.\" Hughey, 495 U.S. at 413.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that restitution may be imposed for a mail fraud conviction \"only if it stems from a transaction linked to a specific mailing.\" Camuti, 78 F.3d at 746. While the amount attributable to the specific mailings for which Royal was convicted may amount to only $9870, Royal was also convicted of conspiracy to defraud the Department of Education and the students of ATTS. In the sentencing context, one convicted of conspiracy may be held liable for the acts of his co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable, as the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly provide. U.S.S.G. Section(s) 1b1.3(a)(1)(B); see also United States v. O'Connor, 28 F.3d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1994). Thus, the district court may order Royal to pay restitution not only for an amount equivalent to the four student loan checks involved in the mail fraud counts, but also for any other reasonably foreseeable loss caused by Royal or his co-conspirators acting in furtherance of this conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal has argued that the district court improperly based its loss determination on defaults caused by acts that occurred in 1988, prior to the time in the last one or two months of 1988 when he joined the Niagara Falls conspiracy. It is true that \"[b]y definition, acts that occurred before a defendant enters a conspiracy cannot be foreseeable.\" United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1993). And upon a review of the sentencing hearing transcript, it indeed appears unclear whether the sentencing court took into account acts that occurred prior to Royal's involvement. But the record also indicates that Royal waived this objection in the district court, and any hypothetical error in the calculation of loss does not rise to the level of plain error. See United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655, 659 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct. 1366 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Royal extensively challenged the government's calculation of the reasonably foreseeable loss attributable to him, he never argued that the loss calculation improperly included losses connected with acts prior to his initial involvement. Having failed to raise this objection below, Royal is now bound to demonstrate that any error affected \"substantial rights.\" Id. But this seems doubtful --the district court set the total amount of restitution at $500,000, but ordered partial restitution of only $30,000 because of Royal's lack of financial resources. Even if the court had excluded all losses attributable to acts from 1988, it seems implausible that the court's total restitution figure would have dropped from $500,000 to less than $30,000. Because any possible error here falls well short of the standard for considering waived claims, we decline to remand the restitution determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Royal's contention that the district court's restitution order is in error because Royal lacks the financial resources necessary to repay the amount imposed is without merit. We have noted in the past that, although a court must consider the financial situation of the defendant when imposing restitution, see 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 3664(a), it need not make specific findings regarding the defendant's finances \"so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\" United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir. 1993). The record adequately reflects the district court's consideration of Royal's financial ability to make restitution. Indeed, the district court lowered the amount of restitution from $500,000 to $30,000 in light of Royal's financial circumstances. Furthermore, the court noted that if Royal is unable to make restitution in full during the course of his prison employment and thereafter during the period of his parole, he has no obligation. \"Although we agree that the evidence in the presentence report may not be able to support a finding that [Royal] has the ability to pay restitution in that amount, the statute does not require such a finding; it requires only that the district court consider the defendant's financial resource as a factor in arriving at the figure.\" United States v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1995). We find that the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion by imposing restitution here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing considerations, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 1867 of Title 28 states, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>(a) In criminal cases, before the voir dire begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier, the defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings against him on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury. . . .</p>\n        <p>* * *</p>\n        <p>(d) Upon motion filed under subsection (a) . . . of this section, containing a sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title, the moving party shall be entitled to present in support of such motion the testimony of the jury commission or clerk, if available, any relevant records and papers not public or otherwise available used by the jury commissioner or clerk, and any other relevant evidence. . . .

Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, United States v. Kayne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196888\"><a href=\"/opinion/196888/united-states-v-kayne/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1996), the jury could have found the following. EZ-EM, Inc., was a distributorship for Andover Tractor Trailer School (\"ATTS\"), a correspondence school in Methuen, Massachusetts. ATTS was party to a program participation agreement with the Department of Education to participate in the PELL grant program, the Guaranteed Student Loan program, the Plus program, and the Supplemental Loans for Students program. Under the agreement, ATTS must require a maximum time frame in which students complete a course with a minimum grade average. ATTS entered into a series of distributors' agreements whereby each distributor would refer students to enroll in ATTS's program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Darryl Simmes, the financial aid officer for ATTS at EZ-EM, testified that he also acted as a recruiter for EZ-EM. Simmes worked at ALAT, another distributor affiliated with ATTS, prior to joining EZ-EM. Simmes testified that, at ALAT, when a student he recruited did not meet the minimum requirements of the program, he falsified the student's application to make it appear that he met those requirements. These minimum requirements included possessing a driver's license and making less than a certain income to be eligible for financial aid. Later, at EZ-EM, Simmes would contact a student he had recruited to sign a student loan check made out to both the student and the school. These students were told that they would not incur debt by signing the check and, often, later found that they had defaulted on loans they were not aware they had taken out.

EZ-EM also supplied students with answers to later lessons, sometimes mailing these lessons to students. EZ-EM would inform students that they must sign the lessons or risk being thrown out of the program. Employees of EZ-EM paid some students to enroll in the ATTS program.

Section(s) 371, mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 1341, and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 2. On March 13, 1995, the scheduled day of trial, a petit jury venire of 53 appeared for impanelment. Royal, a black male, orally moved to strike the jury venire. The court granted this motion and rescheduled the trial for one week from that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, Royal filed a motion to inspect the master jury wheel for the years from 1993 to 1995. The following day, Royal filed a Motion to Strike Jury Venire, which argued that the district's jury selection plan systematically excludes blacks from the jury pool. The district court deferred ruling on these motions until Royal could make a proffer demonstrating that the jury plan systematically excluded blacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, 1995, trial commenced in the district court. After viewing the jury venire, Royal renewed his motion to strike the jury venire. Royal further moved for a hearing with respect to the inadequacies of the Amended Jury Plan for the Eastern Division of the District of Massachusetts (\"Amended Jury Plan\"). In support of his various motions, Royal submitted two affidavits from Dr. Gordon Sutton, Professor of Sociology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, which contended that the Amended Jury Plan systematically excluded blacks and other minorities from the jury venire. The district court determined that it did not have statutory authorization to implement the remedy Royal suggested -- supplementing the jury venire such that it would provide a fair cross-section of the community -- and denied Royal's motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the close of the government's case, Royal moved for judgment of acquittal on all counts. The district court granted the motion only as to Count 24, charging mail fraud. After a six day trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of mail fraud, with verdicts of not guilty on four counts of mail fraud. Royal's sentence included 27 months imprisonment, 36 months supervised release, and restitution of $30,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

The court then placed the burden on Royal to show \"by a factually supportable submission that there is some reasonable basis for supposing that the matters you're asking to get into will have some material bearing upon a decision I am to make.\" Transcript of hearing, March 15, 1995, at 6. Because Royal made no factually supportable showing of relevance and materiality, the district court denied the motion to inspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a second motion to inspect the jury records, the district court suggested that, in order to inspect the requested records, Royal was required to make a showing that he would be able to satisfy the three prongs of Duren v. Missouri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109965\"><a href=\"/opinion/109965/duren-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (1979). Under Duren, in order to establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement, \"the defendant must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a 'distinctive' group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this under-representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\" Id. at 364. The district court expressed concern that Royal would not be able to satisfy the third prong by showing systematic exclusion. Accordingly, it deferred ruling until Royal could make a showing that would enable the court \"to determine whether we are doing something that is potentially useful or instead doing something that's just a waste of resources because it will not be useful in any event.\" Transcript of Hearing, March 17, 1995, at 15-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a jury selected from a source fairly representative of the community. See Taylor v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109133\"><a href=\"/opinion/109133/taylor-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 527-28 (1975). Section 1867 of Title 28<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> establishes \"the exclusive means by which a person accused of a Federal crime . . . may challenge any jury on the ground that such jury was not selected in conformity with the provisions of [the Title].\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(e) (1994). In Test v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109180\"><a href=\"/opinion/109180/test-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span> (1975), the Supreme Court interpreted the relevant statutory language of section 1867. See Test, 420 U.S. at 30. Before voir dire examination or within seven days after the defendant could have discovered the grounds for a challenge, a defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings for substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the title. 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(a). The statute requires that the challenge be accompanied by \"a sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with\" these provisions. 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(d). Relevant to our inquiry here, subsection (f) of section 1867 provides that \"[t]he parties . . . shall be allowed to inspect, reproduce, and copy such records or papers at all reasonable times during the preparation and pendency of such a motion.\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(f). It is this particular subsection with which the Supreme Court was concerned in Test and which is dispositive of Royal's challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Test, the district court denied the defendant's motion to inspect the jury selection records pursuant to section 1867(e). Test, 420 U.S. at 29. The Supreme Court determined that the language in subsection (e) established \"essentially an unqualified right to inspect jury lists.\" Id. at 30. This interpretation was supported \"not only by the plain text of the statute, but also by the statute's overall purpose of insuring 'grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair cross section of the community.'\" Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1861). The Court admonished that, without such access, a litigant will be unable to determine whether he has a meritorious claim. See id. We adhere to and apply the Supreme Court's determination that a defendant, such as Royal, challenging the jury selection procedures has an unqualified right to inspect jury records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the right of access to jury selection records is \"unqualified,\" a district court may not premise the grant or denial of a motion to inspect upon a showing of probable success on the merits of a challenge to the jury selection provisions. See Test, 420 U.S. at 30. Although the burden is on the defendant to establish a prima facie case of unconstitutional exclusion, see United States v. Pion, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670674\"><a href=\"/opinion/670674/united-states-v-rene-m-pion/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 n.4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></span> (1994), the right of access to the jury selection records is a precursor to this burden and is intended to provide the defendant with the evidence necessary to mount a proper showing. To avail himself of the right of access to jury selection records, a litigant need only allege that he is preparing a motion to challenge the jury selection process. See United States v. Alden, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460370\"><a href=\"/opinion/460370/united-states-v-terrance-karl-alden/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span>, 773 (8th Cir. 1985). The district court, therefore, erred in requiring Royal to make a showing of probable success on the merits of his jury selection challenge as a condition of granting access to the records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, a district court may not require a defendant requesting access to jury selection records to submit with that request \"a sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title.\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(d). The procedural mechanisms of the jury selection provisions require the moving party to submit a sworn statement to support a motion to strike a jury venire or challenge the selection processes; such a sworn statement is not required to support a motion to inspect the records. See id. The Supreme Court has established that the right of access is \"unqualified.\" The Eighth Circuit, faced with an appeal of the nature of Royal's, recognized that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]lthough the district court's analysis is persuasive, the district court is not free to establish additional requirements that defendants must meet in order to gain access to jury selection records. The Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the right to inspect these records is 'essentially unqualified' and is conditioned only in the manner set forth in the statute. Test v. United States, 420 U.S. at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alden, 776 F.2d at 775. Thus, while the district court may establish reasonable procedures whereby the inspection may take place, the district court does not have discretion to formulate additional requirements beyond those established by the statute. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we find that this error does not require that we reverse Royal's conviction. Rather, we remand the case with instructions to allow Royal access to \"[t]he contents of records or papers used by the jury commission or clerk in connection with the jury selection process,\" 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(f), in order to support a motion to strike the jury venire. If Royal determines that the Amended Jury Plan violates the jury selection procedures required under the statute, he may move for a new trial under 28 U.S.C. Section(s) 1867(a). See United States v. Marcano-Garca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378219\"><a href=\"/opinion/378219/united-states-v-pablo-marcano-garcia-and-nydia-cuevas-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1980).

The Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a remedy for the allegedly unconstitutional jury selection process, Royal seeks an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his claim. As we noted above, the district court treated Royal's motion to strike the jury venire as a request for an evidentiary hearing regarding the contents of the master jury wheel. The district court sought from Royal a showing by a factually supportable submission that the documents Royal sought would have a material bearing on the jury selection challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal motions context, a \"party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden.\" United States v.

However, Royal's motion was made without the benefit of information to which he was entitled as a matter of law. On remand, if Royal is able to use this information on the jury selection process to show a factual dispute that, if resolved in his favor, would entitle him to relief, then he would be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

At this time, our consideration of the merits of his challenge would be premature.

Jury Instruction on Conspiracy Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal contends that the district court's jury instruction on the charge of conspiracy was in error and that error lessened the government's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In deciding whether the trial court submitted erroneous instructions to the jury, we \"determine whether [the instruction] tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.\" Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></span>, 353 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></span> (1990). We consider the instructions \"as a whole; portions of it are not to be treated in isolation.\" Id. We find that the instructions, as a whole, were not erroneous. In fact, as discussed below, the double intent instruction may have heightened the government's burden. Consequently, not only did the instruction not prejudice Royal, it in fact benefitted Royal. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory provision under which Royal was charged finds a violation of the law \"[i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 371 (1966). The district court's instruction on the charge of conspiracy was, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish that the defendant is guilty of this charge of conspiracy, the Government must prove these essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First: That two or more persons knowingly conspired, combined or agreed to commit an offense against the United States, the purpose of which was to commit mail fraud, and that the conspiracy was formed or existing at or about the time alleged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second: That the defendant knowingly and intentionally became a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third: That one of the conspirators knowingly did some act to effect the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intent that the Government must prove beyond reasonable doubt to establish the charge of conspiracy in this case is an intent to defraud as alleged in the indictment. It is not necessary, however, for the Government to prove an intent on the part of the defendant to participate in all parts or aspects of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two aspects of the intent the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Government must prove the intent to agree to be a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Government must prove the intent to participate in the commission of at least one of the substantive offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Transcript at 6-49 -- 6-54. Royal, in his brief, sets out the following portion of the instructions in support of his claim that the district court erred in its instructions to the jury on the required intent of conspiracy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not required that the Government prove, in order to establish the conspiracy offense, that the defendant had the intent to commit personally all of the substantive crimes that were within the object of the conspiracy. Stated another way, the requirement is that the Government prove both an intent to agree to be a member of the conspiracy and an intent to participate personally in the commission of at least one of the substantive offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 6-54. Reviewing this instruction, we find that the district court's instructions, by using language that imposes a higher burden on the government than the law requires, did not prejudice Royal. Therefore, reversal of Royal's conviction is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal claims that this court has applied two different definitions of conspiracy, and that the district court's attempt to reconcile the conspiracy precedents led to the error of which he now complains. Royal contends that the controlling law in this circuit requires the government to prove that Royal intended to enter into the agreement forming the conspiracy and intended to commit the substantive offense. In so arguing, Royal misreads this court's precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has said that \"[i]n a conspiracy, two different types of intent are generally required -- the basic intent to agree, which is necessary to establish the existence of the conspiracy, and the more traditional intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.\" United States v.

It is by now well-settled that the government need not prove that the defendant intended personally to commit the substantive crime or crimes that were the object of the conspiracy. United States v.

The district court's instruction that \"the government must prove the intent to participate in the commission of at least one of the substantive offenses\" was, if anything, generous, and we find no error prejudicing Royal's rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the legal principles were properly presented to the jury, we turn to Royal's argument that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for conspiracy and mail fraud. Royal contends first that there was no evidence of his knowledge of the conspiracy and \"virtually no evidence\" that he engaged in fraudulent conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud the government and the students he enrolled in the program.

Appellant Royal began working for EZ-EM in December 1988. At the beginning of 1989, he replaced Darryl Simmes as financial aid officer at EZ-EM a position paid by ATTS. At the time he held that position, financial aid officers were prohibited from engaging in recruitment activities. While serving as financial aid officer at EZ-EM Royal also engaged in recruitment activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For each student he enrolled in the ATTS program, Royal received a $100-$125 commission. For this commission, Royal would pay current students to bring in others to enroll in the program. Royal also paid students to enroll in the program. Royal was given a copy of the answers to provide students to help them complete the ten lessons required upon enrollment. Royal was aware that many of the students who signed up did not intend to complete the ATTS program, but merely signed up to receive the twenty dollars he paid them. Because of this, he often either gave students copies of the answer sheets or completed the students' tests himself. Royal gave at least two students copies of the answers to the tractor trailer correspondence course lessons, which were completed and sent to ATTS. Sometimes, he instructed students to change a few of the answers so that their test scores would not consistently equal one hundred. Although the first set of lessons were provided when a student signed up, thereafter the tests and sometimes the answers were mailed to students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A student receiving federal financial aid for the ATTS program was required to have received no prior federal student loans. When signing up students for financial aid, Royal instructed those who had previous federal student loan debt not to list the debt on their financial aid applications. Upon Royal's arrival at EZ-EM Darryl Simmes explained to Royal the procedure by which student loan checks would be signed, which included paying others to assist the school in getting a \"reluctant student\" to sign a check. At times, Royal paid students twenty dollars to sign the loan checks. Royal would sometimes explain to students that, by signing the loan checks, they would be able to return the checks and eliminate the indebtedness. In addition, Royal obtained the endorsing signatures of students on the back of student loan checks that they did not know they were endorsing or would be liable for. The students often were not told when they entered the program that they would have to pay up front or that they would need a loan prior to moving on to the next level of the course work. Royal told one student that the check was being sent back to ATTS, but that EZ-EM needed his signature to send it back. Royal did not inform him that he would incur debt by signing the check. Two other students later received statements in the mail referring to a loan that they had unknowingly taken out. Royal accompanied recruiters whose role it was to talk the students into signing over the loan checks to the school. These recruiters, however, did not explain to the students that signing the loan checks would result in their incurring debt. Royal also witnessed Emmet Cotter, the owner of EZ-EM, using a flashlight and later a xerox machine to trace student signatures on various documents. At one point, Cotter also requested that Royal sign three checks totalling $30,000 so that Royal could be paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal signed up students for the tractor trailer course who did not have valid drivers' licenses. When this occurred, Royal would simply make up a driver's license number. Simmes explained to Royal that, when he recruited students, he should leave blank responses on the applications of students who stated that they did not have a driver's license or that they had previously obtained financial aid. Cotter explained to Royal how to make up a driver's license number, which Royal did when filling out applications for those students who did not possess a driver's license. He completed applications using false information, including misstating an applicant's criminal record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Conspiracy Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence on this record sufficiently supports the jury's guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge. The conspiracy count charged Royal with engaging in a conspiracy \"[t]o knowingly devise and execute a scheme and artifice to obtain money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises and, for the purpose of executing and attempting to execute the scheme,\" engaging in mail fraud. As will be discussed below, we find the evidence sufficient to convict Royal of mail fraud, the substantive offense charged in this conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove a conspiracy under section 371, the government must prove the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of and voluntary participation in it, and the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. . . . The agreement need not be proved to have been explicit, and may be proved by circumstantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Frankhauser, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196693\"><a href=\"/opinion/196693/united-states-v-frankhauser/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 653 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). To prove voluntary participation, the government must prove that the defendant had an intent to agree and an intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. See Piper, 35 F.3d at 615; see also Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653. \"To uphold a conviction, the court need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.\" United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here, taken together and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, supports Royal's conviction for conspiracy. The jury could have concluded that a conspiracy existed whereby the employees of EZ-EM defrauded the students whom they signed up for student loans and, in that process, utilized the United States' mails. Furthermore, the jury could have found that Royal intended to agree to engage in the conspiracy and intended to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. Based on the circumstantial evidence, including testimony that Royal engaged in acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, that he described to others his fraudulent acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, and gained financially from his own acts and those of his co-conspirators, the jury could conclude that Royal had an intent to agree with his co-conspirators. In addition, from the evidence that Royal paid students to enroll in the program, paid students to sign student loan checks, told students who signed loan checks that, by signing the check, they would not incur debt, forged student drivers' license numbers, and misstated students' past government loan history and criminal records, the jury could have concluded that he did so with an intent to defraud these students and used the mails in doing so. All of these served as acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud. Here, Royal did not merely know of his fellow employees' illegal activities. See, e.g., United States v. Soto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424687\"><a href=\"/opinion/424687/united-states-v-evelyn-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 991-92 (2d Cir. 1983). Royal took steps necessary to effectuate the illegal conspiracy. Accordingly, Royal's conviction on the conspiracy count is supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Mail Fraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Royal complains that his convictions on eight counts of mail fraud were not supported by sufficient evidence. \"To prove mail . . . fraud, the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails . . . in furtherance of the scheme.\" United States v. Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir. 1996). \"The defendant need not instigate the scheme so long as he willfully participates in it, with the knowledge of its fraudulent nature and with the intent to achieve its illicit objectives.\" United States v. Yefsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 891-92 (1st Cir. 1993). A particular defendant need not have placed a specific item into the mails. It is enough that the use of the mails took place in the ordinary course of business, Pereira v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105186\"><a href=\"/opinion/105186/pereira-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1954), or was reasonably foreseeable as a result of the conspiracy participants' actions, Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 892.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, documents in which Royal included misstated or fraudulent information were sent to ATTS. Even if Royal did not place those documents into the mails, it follows that, in the ordinary course of business, admissions and federal student financial aid applications completed by Royal would be sent to ATTS, the information from those applications would be sent to the Department of Education, and information from the school would be sent to the students. It also follows that student loan checks would be sent through the mails. The jury could have reasonably found that it was reasonably foreseeable by Royal that the mails would be utilized to perpetrate this scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme to defraud in this case consisted of actions on the part of EZ-EM employees to convince students to sign up for the ATTS program, apply for federal student loans, loans for which they sometimes did not qualify, incur debt that they did not realize they would be obligated to repay, and to mislead some students to believe that they would not incur debt by endorsing the loan checks. As a result of these acts, ATTS paid commissions to EZ-EM. From these commissions, the employees of EZ-EM who perpetrated the acts to defraud the students were paid salaries or commissions. The jury could reasonably have found that these acts constituted a scheme to defraud the students EZ-EM enrolled in ATTS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal contends that the government was required to prove that he had the specific intent to defraud the United States Department of Education. Although the indictment against Royal charges him with \"a scheme to defraud the United States Department of Education, and the students and prospective students of ATTS,\" the government was not required to prove that he intended to defraud the Department of Education specifically. The statute requires only that there be a scheme to defraud, see 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 1341, and we have required only a showing of a specific intent to defraud. United States v. Sawyer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196785\"><a href=\"/opinion/196785/united-states-v-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir. 1996). The jury could have reasonably found that Royal had a specific intent to engage in a scheme to defraud the students. This is all that is required. Royal's conviction on the mail fraud counts is supported by sufficient evidence. Because the government met its burden by showing a scheme to defraud the students, we do not address whether it also proved that Royal had a specific intent to defraud the Department of Education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Application of Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal next directs several challenges at the district court's application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We review a district court's factual determinations under the guidelines for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. United States v. Balogun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1993). We address each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mitigating Role -- Section 3B1.2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal contends that his role in the commission of this conspiracy was of such a lesser degree of culpability than his co-conspirators' that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a downward departure. \"We first note that defendants are not automatically entitled to a downward adjustment, whatever their role in the crime.\" Balogun, 989 F.2d at 22-23. The Sentencing Guidelines allow a four level departure for one who is a minimal participant, meant to apply to those \"defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\" U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2, application note 1. This departure is meant to be used infrequently. U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2, application note 2. The Guidelines allow a two level departure for one who is a minor participant in the criminal activity; this departure is meant to apply to \"any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2, application note 3. Where the defendant's conduct falls between these two levels of culpability, a downward departure of three levels may be awarded. U.S.S.G. Section(s) 3B1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The defendant has the burden of showing that he is entitled to a reduction in his offense level under Section(s) 3B1.2 . . . . On appeal, the defendant must establish that the district court's determination was clearly erroneous.\" United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196443\"><a href=\"/opinion/196443/united-states-v-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 716 (1st Cir. 1995). The record on which the district court based its factual determination of Royal's role in this offense supports the finding that Royal was neither a minimal nor a minor participant. Royal's role in the EZ-EM operation was integral. He recruited students for a program for which EZ-EM, and in turn Royal, would receive monetary commissions. Royal falsified information on school applications and federal student loan applications. He was responsible for obtaining student signatures endorsing student loan checks. Indeed, Royal even misled some into believing that by endorsing the check they would be relieved of any indebtedness. All of these acts were integral to the scheme to defraud the students and the co-conspirators gained financially as a result. The district court also was entitled to find that Royal had knowledge of and intent to further the scope and all aspects of the conspiracy. We cannot find that Royal played a less significant role or that he was less culpable than his co-conspirators in effecting the scheme to defraud. See, e.g., Santiago-Gonz lez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196311\"><a href=\"/opinion/196311/united-states-v-santiago-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1995). Based on these findings, we cannot say that the district court's sentencing determination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal compares his situation to cases in which conspirators were granted downward departures. In those cases, the sentencing court determined that the defendant's role in the commission of the crime was minimal or minor. See, e.g., United States v. Mu  oz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1238 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied sub nom., __ U.S. __, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Innamorati, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 490 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></span> (1994); United States v.

Royal's burden is a heavy one and although he may consider his role in the offense more comparable to that found in the cases he cites, the district court found otherwise. \"[W]here there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\" United States v. Santiago-Gonz lez, 66 F.3d at 7. Royal claims that the only evidence offered against him at trial was that \"he worked in the Niagara Falls office of ATTS and met some of the government's witnesses when they visited the office.\" Royal's attempt to put his own spin on the facts does not render the district court's determination clearly erroneous. Each of Royal's acts was an integral part of the scheme to defraud and the sentencing court was not clearly erroneous in denying Royal's requested downward departure under the guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. More than Minimal Planning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal complains that the district court improperly adjusted upward two levels because Royal's acts and role in the offense required more than minimal planning. See U.S.S.G. Section(s) 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). Royal maintains that the trial testimony shows that he was \"merely an office attendant\" at EZ-EM and that he was not present when the \"principal planners\" met to discuss the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commentary to section 2F1.1 refers the reader to the definition of \"more than minimal planning\" set forth in the Commentary to section 1B1.1. There, \"more than minimal planning\" is defined as \"more planning than typical for commission of the offense in a simple form.\" U.S.S.G. Section(s) 1B1.1, application note 1(f). \"'More than minimal planning' is deemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]e are not inclined to reverse a finding of more than minimal planning unless the evidence compels the conclusion that the defendant's actions were purely opportune or 'spur of the moment.'\" United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 459 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom., __ U.S. __, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></span> (1994). We find that here, the complex scheme to defraud and Royal's conduct in furtherance of it were not purely opportune and, therefore, meet the definition of \"more than minimal planning.\" The trial testimony demonstrates that Royal engaged in several repeated fraudulent acts in furtherance of this conspiracy. The sentencing court was entitled to find, under the definition provided by the guidelines, that Royal's repeated acts in the course of this conspiracy required more than minimal planning. The district court did not err in making a departure upward to take this into account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Restitution Order</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal makes two arguments challenging the validity of the district court's restitution order. Royal contends that the order of restitution in the amount of $30,000 lacked legal support because it attributes more losses to him than those caused by the counts for which he was convicted. Royal further maintains that the order was improper because he is unable to repay such a large amount. The district court has the authority to impose restitution under Title 18 of the United States Code, sections 3663 and 3664.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal's first contention amounts to the following. Because his convictions included four counts of mail fraud relating to the mailing of only four loan checks, he should only be required to pay restitution in the total amount of those checks, $9870. In the alternative, Royal argues that, if his conviction for conspiracy is included in the restitution order, the total loss reasonably foreseeable to him would be the amount of checks that passed through EZ-EM during the time he worked at the Niagara Falls operation. Royal claims this amount would be no more than $17,272.50. Based on this analysis, Royal contends that the restitution order of $30,000 was excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Royal's criminal acts, a sentencing court could impose restitution only for losses caused by the defendant's offense or offenses. 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 3663; see also Hughey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112428\"><a href=\"/opinion/112428/hughey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 414 (1990); United States v. Camuti, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196627\"><a href=\"/opinion/196627/united-states-v-camuti/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 746 (1st Cir. 1996). Although this authority under the statute was subsequently broadened by congressional amendment to require restitution to include harm resulting from \"the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern,\" see 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 3663(a)(2) (Supp. 1996), the amendments do not apply retroactively. See Camuti, 78 F.3d at 746. Accordingly, under the applicable law, Royal is correct in arguing that he may be ordered to make restitution only for the \"loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.\" Hughey, 495 U.S. at 413.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that restitution may be imposed for a mail fraud conviction \"only if it stems from a transaction linked to a specific mailing.\" Camuti, 78 F.3d at 746. While the amount attributable to the specific mailings for which Royal was convicted may amount to only $9870, Royal was also convicted of conspiracy to defraud the Department of Education and the students of ATTS. In the sentencing context, one convicted of conspiracy may be held liable for the acts of his co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy that are reasonably foreseeable, as the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly provide. U.S.S.G. Section(s) 1b1.3(a)(1)(B); see also United States v. O'Connor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195444\"><a href=\"/opinion/195444/united-states-v-oconnor/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir. 1994). Thus, the district court may order Royal to pay restitution not only for an amount equivalent to the four student loan checks involved in the mail fraud counts, but also for any other reasonably foreseeable loss caused by Royal or his co-conspirators acting in furtherance of this conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal has argued that the district court improperly based its loss determination on defaults caused by acts that occurred in 1988, prior to the time in the last one or two months of 1988 when he joined the Niagara Falls conspiracy. It is true that \"[b]y definition, acts that occurred before a defendant enters a conspiracy cannot be foreseeable.\" United States v. Balogun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1993). And upon a review of the sentencing hearing transcript, it indeed appears unclear whether the sentencing court took into account acts that occurred prior to Royal's involvement. But the record also indicates that Royal waived this objection in the district court, and any hypothetical error in the calculation of loss does not rise to the level of plain error. See United States v. Winter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196418\"><a href=\"/opinion/196418/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 659 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1366</span></span> (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Royal extensively challenged the government's calculation of the reasonably foreseeable loss attributable to him, he never argued that the loss calculation improperly included losses connected with acts prior to his initial involvement. Having failed to raise this objection below, Royal is now bound to demonstrate that any error affected \"substantial rights.\" Id. But this seems doubtful --the district court set the total amount of restitution at $500,000, but ordered partial restitution of only $30,000 because of Royal's lack of financial resources. Even if the court had excluded all losses attributable to acts from 1988, it seems implausible that the court's total restitution figure would have dropped from $500,000 to less than $30,000. Because any possible error here falls well short of the standard for considering waived claims, we decline to remand the restitution determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Royal's contention that the district court's restitution order is in error because Royal lacks the financial resources necessary to repay the amount imposed is without merit. We have noted in the past that, although a court must consider the financial situation of the defendant when imposing restitution, see 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 3664(a), it need not make specific findings regarding the defendant's finances \"so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his consideration of those factors.\" United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 618 (1st Cir. 1993). The record adequately reflects the district court's consideration of Royal's financial ability to make restitution. Indeed, the district court lowered the amount of restitution from $500,000 to $30,000 in light of Royal's financial circumstances. Furthermore, the court noted that if Royal is unable to make restitution in full during the course of his prison employment and thereafter during the period of his parole, he has no obligation. \"Although we agree that the evidence in the presentence report may not be able to support a finding that [Royal] has the ability to pay restitution in that amount, the statute does not require such a finding; it requires only that the district court consider the defendant's financial resource as a factor in arriving at the figure.\" United States v. Newman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195935\"><a href=\"/opinion/195935/united-states-v-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1995). We find that the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion by imposing restitution here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing considerations, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 1867 of Title 28 states, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>(a) In criminal cases, before the voir dire begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier, the defendant may move to dismiss the indictment or stay the proceedings against him on the ground of substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title in selecting the grand or petit jury. . . .</p>\n        <p>* * *</p>\n        <p>(d) Upon motion filed under subsection (a) . . . of this section, containing a sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of this title, the moving party shall be entitled to present in support of such motion the testimony of the jury commission or clerk, if available, any relevant records and papers not public or otherwise available used by the jury commissioner or clerk, and any other relevant evidence. . . .
