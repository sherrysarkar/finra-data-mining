Relying     primarily          upon\n\ndevelopments that occurred after he had filed his notice of\n\nappeal, defendant-appellant Felix Mateo invites us to vacate the\n\n121-month incarcerative sentence that the district court imposed\n\nfor his admitted involvement in drug-trafficking activities.\n\nFinding the new matter irrelevant and discerning no error in the\n\ncourt's sentencing determinations, we decline the invitation.\n\n            Our standard of review in this sentencing appeal is\n\nfamiliar:        we     scrutinize        the      district      court's         legal\n\ndeterminations (including its application of the sentencing\n\nguidelines) de novo and check its factual determinations for\n\nclear error.     United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st\n\nCir.   1992).     In    carrying    out     this     function,        we    glean   the\n\npertinent    facts     from   the   record      of    the   change-of-plea          and\n\ndisposition      hearings,        supplemented         by      the         presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSI Report).              See United States v. Dietz,\n\n950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            In   the     spring     of    1998,       the      Drug        Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) began to ponder the appellant's role in\n\ndrug trafficking in and around Dorchester, Massachusetts.                           This\n\naspect of the DEA's investigation culminated in the appellant's\n\narrest on January 5, 1999.          Two days later, a federal grand jury\n\nindicted the appellant and several confederates for a wide\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fvariety of drug-trafficking offenses.             The charges against the\n\nappellant included possession of cocaine, cocaine base, and\n\nheroin with intent to distribute, as well as conspiracy.                  See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846.\n\n             The appellant originally maintained his innocence, but\n\nchanged his plea on January 27, 2000.             The probation department\n\nprepared the PSI Report.          It determined that the combination of\n\ndrugs attributable to the appellant resulted in a base offense\n\nlevel   of    34,   and    then    applied    a   three-level       credit   for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.             See USSG §3E1.1.        It also noted\n\nthe applicability of a ten-year minimum mandatory sentence,\n\ngiven   the    quantity    of     drugs   involved.         See    21   U.S.C.   §\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(iii).        The appellant did not challenge any of these\n\nsubsidiary determinations.\n\n             Even   so,     the     PSI      Report   was         not   entirely\n\nuncontroversial.          It    concluded     that    the     appellant,     who\n\npreviously had been convicted in a Massachusetts state court on\n\na narcotics charge, was still under a criminal justice sentence\n\nrelated to that charge when he committed the instant offenses.\n\nThis finding dictated the assessment of two additional criminal\n\nhistory points, see USSG §4A1.1(d), which not only sufficed to\n\nmove the appellant into a higher criminal history category (CHC)\n\nbut also rendered him ineligible for the so-called \"safety\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fvalve\" provision, USSG §5C1.2 (and, thus, for relief from the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence).1\n\n          The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nAugust 25, 2000.        The appellant argued that he should be in a\n\nlesser CHC (and, accordingly, eligible for the safety valve).\n\nIn mounting this argument, he asseverated that the supposed\n\nbasis for the additional criminal history points — the existence\n\nof an outstanding probation violation warrant stemming from his\n\nprior state-court conviction — was insupportable because the\n\nwarrant   had    been    issued    erroneously.         The    district   court\n\nrejected this reasoning; concluded that the warrant was, indeed,\n\noutstanding; ruled that the appellant therefore had committed\n\nthe   offenses   of     conviction   while   under      a   criminal   justice\n\nsentence; and increased the appellant's criminal history score.\n\nThe   court   then    used   the   higher    CHC   to    fix    the   guideline\n\nsentencing range (121-151 months) and imposed a sentence at the\n\nnadir of the range.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      We have explained before how the safety valve operates.\nE.g., United States v. Ortiz-Santiagó, 211 F.3d 146, 150-51 (1st\nCir. 2000). We also have explained how the addition of criminal\nhistory points can affect the duration of a defendant's\nsentence. E.g., United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 316 (1st\nCir. 1997); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47-48\n(1st Cir. 1989). It would serve no useful purpose to rehearse\nthose explanations here.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           In this venue, the appellant concentrates his fire on\n\nthe lower court's determination that he was under a criminal\n\njustice sentence when he committed the offenses of conviction —\n\na determination that adversely affected his guideline sentencing\n\nrange and, in the bargain, rendered him ineligible for relief\n\nfrom the ten-year mandatory minimum.             To explain the etiology of\n\nthe determination, we must retreat to April 11, 1995.                     On that\n\ndate, the appellant appeared before the West Roxbury District\n\nCourt on a heroin distribution charge.                    The court imposed a\n\nsuspended sentence, but placed him on probation for two years\n\n(until April 11, 1997).\n\n           Despite this show of leniency, the appellant apparently\n\nfailed to meet with his probation officer after April of 1996.\n\nThis   lapse     interrupted    the     scheduled     termination         of   his\n\nprobation and, on June 4, 1997, the state court issued a default\n\nwarrant    for    the   appellant's         apprehension.         Because      the\n\nappellant's probation had not been terminated and the default\n\nwarrant was still outstanding on the date that he appeared for\n\nsentencing in the instant case, Judge Saris treated him as being\n\nunder an unfulfilled criminal justice sentence and boosted his\n\ncriminal     history    score   accordingly.          See      USSG     §4A1.1(d)\n\n(directing     the   district   court       to   \"[a]dd    2   points    [to   the\n\ndefendant's criminal history score] if the defendant committed\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthe instant office while under any criminal justice sentence,\n\nincluding probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment,\n\nwork release, or escape status\"); id. §4A1.2(m) (stating that an\n\noutstanding warrant qualifies as a criminal justice sentence for\n\npurposes of section 4A1.1(d) \"even if [the underlying] sentence\n\nwould   have   expired    absent      such     warrant\");     see     also   id.\n\n§4A1.1(d),     comment.   (n.4)       (explaining     the    effect     of     an\n\noutstanding probation violation warrant in language identical to\n\nthat used in section 4A1.2(m)).\n\n          Subsequent to sentencing, the appellant filed a notice\n\nof appeal.     He also moved to rearrange the legal landscape,\n\nreturning to the West Roxbury District Court and filing a motion\n\nto terminate probation.        On January 10, 2001, a state judge\n\ngranted the motion and ended the appellant's probation \"nunc pro\n\ntunc to April 11, 1997.\"       Emphasizing this order and asserting\n\nthat the default warrant never should have issued, the appellant\n\nassigns error to the district court's determination that he was\n\nunder a criminal justice sentence at the time he perpetrated the\n\noffenses of conviction.\n\n          It    is   beyond   cavil    that,    in   the    typical    case,    a\n\ndefendant who commits a crime while subject to an outstanding\n\nviolation warrant is deemed to be under a criminal justice\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fsentence for purposes of USSG §4A1.1(d).2      See United States v.\n\nAnderson, 184 F.3d 479, 480-81 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied,\n\n528 U.S. 1091 (2000).      That is true even if the underlying\n\nsentence, as originally pronounced, would by its terms have\n\nexpired but for the violation.    See United States v. Camilo, 71\n\nF.3d 984, 986 (1st Cir. 1995); see also USSG §4A1.1(d), comment.\n\n(n.4).    The pivotal question, then, is whether the nunc pro tunc\n\norder of the West Roxbury District Court somehow alters that\n\nresult.    There are two basic reasons why it does not.\n\n           In the first place, the appellant, by resting his\n\nargument on a matter that arose only after sentence was imposed\n\nin the federal district court, seeks to invalidate the district\n\ncourt's judgment on the basis of a proffer that he did not make\n\nbelow (indeed, the nunc pro tunc order did not exist on the date\n\nof the disposition hearing).           We long have adhered to the\n\ngeneral principle that new matter may not be introduced for the\n\nfirst time in the court of appeals, see, e.g., Smith & Wesson v.\n\nUnited States, 782 F.2d 1078, 1084 (1st Cir. 1986);         United\n\nStates v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983), and we\n\nsee no reason to deviate from that general principle here.\n\n\n\n    2Of course, the prior sentence must otherwise be countable\ntoward the defendant's criminal history score. United States v.\nCamilo, 71 F.3d 984, 987 (1st Cir. 1995). That condition does\nnot present a problem here.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f            Indeed, the principle applies with particular force in\n\nthis instance.      At the disposition hearing, defense counsel\n\nsuggested that he might attempt to secure a ruling from the West\n\nRoxbury District Court as to the validity of the warrant, and\n\nJudge Saris specifically invited him to return \"within a year\"\n\nshould anything significant occur.3 Notwithstanding this express\n\ninvitation, the appellant never brought the nunc pro tunc order\n\nto the attention of the district court; rather, he attempted to\n\nleap-frog that court and use the order as a weapon of appellate\n\nadvocacy.     We will not honor that tactic:      the checks and\n\nbalances inherent in our multi-tiered judicial system would be\n\nset askew were we to do so.\n\n            In all events, under the federal sentencing guidelines\n\npost-sentencing maneuvers ordinarily cannot be used as history-\n\naltering devices.     Consequently, even were we to consider the\n\nnunc pro tunc order, the appellant would not be advantaged.      A\n\ndefendant's CHC is to be calculated at the time of sentencing,\n\nsee United States v. Cox, 934 F.2d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. 1991),\n\nand nothing in the sentencing guidelines suggests that it should\n\nbe modified, after sentence has been pronounced, because of a\n\nsubsequent action taken by a state court.\n\n\n\n    3 The district court no doubt had in mind the filing of a\npetition for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                -9-\n\f            We are left, then, with this scenario.              When the\n\nappellant appeared for sentencing in the instant case, his\n\nstate-court probationary term had not been concluded and a\n\ndefault warrant was outstanding.         On the face of things, the\n\nappellant    was   under   a   prior   unfulfilled   criminal    justice\n\nsentence — a circumstance that constituted a proper predicate\n\nfor the assessment of two additional criminal history points.\n\nSee USSG §§4A1.1(d), 4A1.2(m).         That ends the matter, for the\n\nquestion of whether an individual is under a criminal justice\n\nsentence for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question\n\nof federal law, see Camilo, 71 F.3d at 987; United States v.\n\nRenfrew, 957 F.2d 525, 526 (8th Cir. 1992) — and federal law\n\ndictates that the district court take the state-court record as\n\nit finds it.4\n\n            The appellant has a fallback position. He argues that,\n\nleaving the nunc pro tunc order to one side, the state court\n\nerred in issuing the default warrant, and that an erroneously\n\nissued warrant should not be held against him. In Camilo, 71\n\nF.3d at 987, we left open the question of whether defects in a\n\nstate warrant process might be considered by the sentencing\n\n\n\n    4While there may be exceptions for state-court convictions\nobtained in violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel, cf. Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 490-93\n(1994), the appellant makes no such claim.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcourt.     Other courts, however, have held unequivocally that\n\n(with possible exceptions not implicated here, see supra note 4)\n\nthe sentencing guidelines do not compel district courts to\n\ninquire beyond the face of the state-court record, let alone to\n\nmake after-the-fact evaluations of the correctness vel non of\n\nthe decisions of state-court officials.                 See Anderson, 184 F.3d\n\nat 481 (\"In determining whether an outstanding violation warrant\n\ntriggers a two-point increase, the Guidelines do not require us\n\nto   assess    the    state    authorities'       diligence   in   executing   a\n\nviolation warrant.\"); United States v. Elmore, 108 F.3d 23, 27\n\n(3d Cir. 1997) (\"The plain language of the Guidelines indicates\n\nthat two points are to be added whenever an outstanding warrant\n\nis in existence, regardless of whether the warrant is stale\n\npursuant      to     state    law   at    the    time    of   sentencing,   and\n\nirrespective of whether state authorities have been lax in\n\nattempting to execute the warrant.\"); see also United States v.\n\nCorrea, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[J]udicial inquiry\n\ninto   a   defendant's        criminal    past    for   sentencing   purposes,\n\nproperly conceived, requires only a snapshot of the surface, not\n\nan archeological dig.          Thus, when a federal court is obliged to\n\ntabulate a defendant's criminal history score for sentencing\n\npurposes, limiting the requisite inquiry to the formal record .\n\n. . strikes the right balance.\").                Based on these authorities,\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fwe hold that in determining whether to add criminal history\n\npoints under USSG §4A1.1(d), a sentencing court ordinarily is\n\nnot required to look beyond the face of the state-court record,\n\nbut, rather, may give weight to an outstanding warrant without\n\ninquiring into the validity of that warrant.5\n\n            We need go no further.    It is clear from the records\n\npresented to the district court that, at the time of sentencing,\n\na warrant was outstanding in regard to the appellant's failure\n\nto satisfy the terms of his state-court probation.    The district\n\ncourt was free to accept the state-court docket as it stood, and\n\nthe district court's determination was not undermined by the\n\nstate court's later issuance of a nunc pro tunc order vitiating\n\nthe warrant.    Under these circumstances, it hardly can be said\n\nthat the district court erred either in adding points to the\n\nappellant's criminal history score under USSG §4A1.1(d) or in\n\ndeclaring him ineligible to reap the benefits of the safety\n\nvalve provision.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n    5The government, citing cases such as Commonwealth v.\nOdoardi, 489 N.E.2d 674, 678-79 (Mass. 1986), and Commonwealth\nv. Sawicki, 339 N.E.2d 740, 742-44 (Mass. 1975), urges us to\nfind that the default warrant here was validly issued under\nMassachusetts law. We have no occasion to reach this question\nand, consequently, we express no opinion on it.\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

In mounting this argument, he asseverated that the supposed basis for the additional criminal history points -- the existence of an outstanding probation violation warrant stemming from his prior state-court conviction -- was insupportable because the warrant had been issued erroneously. The district court rejected this reasoning; concluded that the warrant was, indeed, outstanding; ruled that the appellant therefore had committed the offenses of conviction while under a criminal justice sentence; and increased the appellant's criminal history score. The court then used the higher CHC to fix the guideline sentencing range (121-151 months) and imposed a sentence at the nadir of the range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant concentrates his fire on the lower court's determination that he was under a criminal justice sentence when he committed the offenses of conviction -- a determination that adversely affected his guideline sentencing range and, in the bargain, rendered him ineligible for relief from the ten-year mandatory minimum. To explain the etiology of the determination, we must retreat to April 11, 1995. On that date, the appellant appeared before the West Roxbury District Court on a heroin distribution charge. The court imposed a suspended sentence, but placed him on probation for two years (until April 11, 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this show of leniency, the appellant apparently failed to meet with his probation officer after April of 1996. This lapse interrupted the scheduled termination of his probation and, on June 4, 1997, the state court issued a default warrant for the appellant's apprehension. Because the appellant's probation had not been terminated and the default warrant was still outstanding on the date that he appeared for sentencing in the instant case, Judge Saris treated him as being under an unfulfilled criminal justice sentence and boosted his criminal history score accordingly. See USSG &#167;4A1.1(d) (directing the district court to \"[a]dd 2 points [to the defendant's criminal history score] if the defendant committed the instant office while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status\"); id. &#167;4A1.2(m) (stating that an outstanding warrant qualifies as a criminal justice sentence for purposes of section 4A1.1(d) \"even if [the underlying] sentence would have expired absent such warrant\"); see also id. &#167;4A1.1(d), comment.

He also moved to rearrange the legal landscape, returning to the West Roxbury District Court and filing a motion to terminate probation. On January 10, 2001, a state judge granted the motion and ended the appellant's probation \"nunc pro tunc to April 11, 1997.\" Emphasizing this order and asserting that the default warrant never should have issued, the appellant assigns error to the district court's determination that he was under a criminal justice sentence at the time he perpetrated the offenses of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond cavil that, in the typical case, a defendant who commits a crime while subject to an outstanding violation warrant is deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for purposes of USSG &#167;4A1.1(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See United States v. Anderson, 184 F.3d 479, 480-81 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1091 (2000). That is true even if the underlying sentence, as originally pronounced, would by its terms have expired but for the violation. See United States v. Camilo, 71 F.3d 984, 986 (1st Cir. 1995); see also USSG &#167;4A1.1(d), comment. (n.4). The pivotal question, then, is whether the nunc pro tunc order of the West Roxbury District Court somehow alters that result. There are two basic reasons why it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the appellant, by resting his argument on a matter that arose only after sentence was imposed in the federal district court, seeks to invalidate the district court's judgment on the basis of a proffer that he did not make below (indeed, the nunc pro tunc order did not exist on the date of the disposition hearing). We long have adhered to the general principle that new matter may not be introduced for the first time in the court of appeals, see, e.g., Smith &amp; Wesson v. United States, 782 F.2d 1078, 1084 (1st Cir. 1986); United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983), and we see no reason to deviate from that general principle here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the principle applies with particular force in this instance. At the disposition hearing, defense counsel suggested that he might attempt to secure a ruling from the West Roxbury District Court as to the validity of the warrant, and Judge Saris specifically invited him to return \"within a year\" should anything significant occur.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Notwithstanding this express invitation, the appellant never brought the nunc pro tunc order to the attention of the district court; rather, he attempted to leap-frog that court and use the order as a weapon of appellate advocacy. We will not honor that tactic: the checks and balances inherent in our multi-tiered judicial system would be set askew were we to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, under the federal sentencing guidelines post-sentencing maneuvers ordinarily cannot be used as history-altering devices. Consequently, even were we to consider the nunc pro tunc order, the appellant would not be advantaged. A defendant's CHC is to be calculated at the time of sentencing, see United States v. Cox, 934 F.2d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. 1991), and nothing in the sentencing guidelines suggests that it should be modified, after sentence has been pronounced, because of a subsequent action taken by a state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are left, then, with this scenario. When the appellant appeared for sentencing in the instant case, his state-court probationary term had not been concluded and a default warrant was outstanding. On the face of things, the appellant was under a prior unfulfilled criminal justice sentence -- a circumstance that constituted a proper predicate for the assessment of two additional criminal history points. See USSG &#167;&#167;4A1.1(d), 4A1.2(m). That ends the matter, for the question of whether an individual is under a criminal justice sentence for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question of federal law, see Camilo, 71 F.3d at 987; United States v. Renfrew, 957 F.2d 525, 526 (8th Cir. 1992) -- and federal law dictates that the district court take the state-court record as it finds it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position. He argues that, leaving the nunc pro tunc order to one side, the state court erred in issuing the default warrant, and that an erroneously issued warrant should not be held against him. In Camilo, 71 F.3d at 987, we left open the question of whether defects in a state warrant process might be considered by the sentencing court. Other courts, however, have held unequivocally that (with possible exceptions not implicated here, see supra note 4) the sentencing guidelines do not compel district courts to inquire beyond the face of the state-court record, let alone to make after-the-fact evaluations of the correctness vel non of the decisions of state-court officials. See Anderson, 184 F.3d at 481 (\"In determining whether an outstanding violation warrant triggers a two-point increase, the Guidelines do not require us to assess the state authorities' diligence in executing a violation warrant.\"); United States v. Elmore, 108 F.3d 23, 27 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"The plain language of the Guidelines indicates that two points are to be added whenever an outstanding warrant is in existence, regardless of whether the warrant is stale pursuant to state law at the time of sentencing, and irrespective of whether state authorities have been lax in attempting to execute the warrant.\"); see also United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[J]udicial inquiry into a defendant's criminal past for sentencing purposes, properly conceived, requires only a snapshot of the surface, not an archeological dig. Thus, when a federal court is obliged to tabulate a defendant's criminal history score for sentencing purposes, limiting the requisite inquiry to the formal record . . . strikes the right balance.\"). Based on these authorities, we hold that in determining whether to add criminal history points under USSG &#167;4A1.1(d), a sentencing court ordinarily is not required to look beyond the face of the state-court record, but, rather, may give weight to an outstanding warrant without inquiring into the validity of that warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. It is clear from the records presented to the district court that, at the time of sentencing, a warrant was outstanding in regard to the appellant's failure to satisfy the terms of his state-court probation. The district court was free to accept the state-court docket as it stood, and the district court's determination was not undermined by the state court's later issuance of a nunc pro tunc order vitiating the warrant. Under these circumstances, it hardly can be said that the district court erred either in adding points to the appellant's criminal history score under USSG &#167;4A1.1(d) or in declaring him ineligible to reap the benefits of the safety valve provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have explained before how the safety valve operates.

In carrying out this function, we glean the pertinent facts from the record of the change-of-plea and disposition hearings, supplemented by the presentence investigation report (PSI Report). See United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began to ponder the appellant's role in drug trafficking in and around Dorchester, Massachusetts. This aspect of the DEA's investigation culminated in the appellant's arrest on January 5, 1999. Two days later, a federal grand jury indicted the appellant and several confederates for a wide variety of drug-trafficking offenses. The charges against the appellant included possession of cocaine, cocaine base, and heroin with intent to distribute, as well as conspiracy. See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant originally maintained his innocence, but changed his plea on January 27, 2000. The probation department prepared the PSI Report. It determined that the combination of drugs attributable to the appellant resulted in a base offense level of 34, and then applied a three-level credit for acceptance of responsibility. See USSG &#167;3E1.1. It also noted the applicability of a ten-year minimum mandatory sentence, given the quantity of drugs involved. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). The appellant did not challenge any of these subsidiary determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, the PSI Report was not entirely uncontroversial. It concluded that the appellant, who previously had been convicted in a Massachusetts state court on a narcotics charge, was still under a criminal justice sentence related to that charge when he committed the instant offenses. This finding dictated the assessment of two additional criminal history points, see USSG &#167;4A1.1(d), which not only sufficed to move the appellant into a higher criminal history category (CHC) but also rendered him ineligible for the so-called \"safety valve\" provision, USSG &#167;5C1.2 (and, thus, for relief from the mandatory minimum sentence).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened the disposition hearing on August 25, 2000.

Renfrew, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578300\"><a href=\"/opinion/578300/united-states-v-kenneth-douglas-renfrew/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 526 (8th Cir. 1992) -- and federal law dictates that the district court take the state-court record as it finds it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position. He argues that, leaving the nunc pro tunc order to one side, the state court erred in issuing the default warrant, and that an erroneously issued warrant should not be held against him. In Camilo, 71 F.3d at 987, we left open the question of whether defects in a state warrant process might be considered by the sentencing court. Other courts, however, have held unequivocally that (with possible exceptions not implicated here, see supra note 4) the sentencing guidelines do not compel district courts to inquire beyond the face of the state-court record, let alone to make after-the-fact evaluations of the correctness vel non of the decisions of state-court officials. See Anderson, 184 F.3d at 481 (\"In determining whether an outstanding violation warrant triggers a two-point increase, the Guidelines do not require us to assess the state authorities' diligence in executing a violation warrant.\"); United States v. Elmore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736964\"><a href=\"/opinion/736964/united-states-v-raymond-elmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"The plain language of the Guidelines indicates that two points are to be added whenever an outstanding warrant is in existence, regardless of whether the warrant is stale pursuant to state law at the time of sentencing, and irrespective of whether state authorities have been lax in attempting to execute the warrant.\"); see also United States v. Correa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197379\"><a href=\"/opinion/197379/united-states-v-rosalio-correa/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 317 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[J]udicial inquiry into a defendant's criminal past for sentencing purposes, properly conceived, requires only a snapshot of the surface, not an archeological dig. Thus, when a federal court is obliged to tabulate a defendant's criminal history score for sentencing purposes, limiting the requisite inquiry to the formal record . . . strikes the right balance.\"). Based on these authorities, we hold that in determining whether to add criminal history points under USSG &#167;4A1.1(d), a sentencing court ordinarily is not required to look beyond the face of the state-court record, but, rather, may give weight to an outstanding warrant without inquiring into the validity of that warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. It is clear from the records presented to the district court that, at the time of sentencing, a warrant was outstanding in regard to the appellant's failure to satisfy the terms of his state-court probation. The district court was free to accept the state-court docket as it stood, and the district court's determination was not undermined by the state court's later issuance of a nunc pro tunc order vitiating the warrant. Under these circumstances, it hardly can be said that the district court erred either in adding points to the appellant's criminal history score under USSG &#167;4A1.1(d) or in declaring him ineligible to reap the benefits of the safety valve provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We have explained before how the safety valve operates.

We also have explained how the addition of criminal history points can affect the duration of a defendant's sentence. E.g., United States v. Correa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197379\"><a href=\"/opinion/197379/united-states-v-rosalio-correa/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 316 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.
