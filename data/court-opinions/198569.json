Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n             and Pollak, Senior District Judge.\r\n\n   David P. Angueira with whom Edward M. Swartz, Alan L. Cantor,\r\nand Lisa V. Kaprielian were on brief for appellants.\r\n   Howard B. Myers with whom Bryan K. Gould was on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nJuly 22, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  In February 1991, David\r\nand Elizabeth Trull, and their two sons, Nathaniel and Benjamin,\r\nwere traveling to Maine after a day of cross-country skiing in New\r\nHampshire when their Volkswagen Vanagon slid on black ice and\r\ncollided with an oncoming car.  Benjamin, age 9, died in the\r\naccident, and Nathaniel, age 13, and Elizabeth suffered severe\r\nbrain injuries.  In this diversity products liability action, the\r\nTrulls seek damages from Volkswagen on the ground that defects in\r\nthe design of the Vanagon made their injuries more severe than they\r\notherwise would have been.  The district court granted summary\r\njudgment for Volkswagen on the Trulls' breach of warranty claims,\r\nand a jury found for the automobile manufacturer on the remaining\r\nliability claims.\r\nThe Trulls contend that the district court made a number\r\nof evidentiary errors that tainted the jury's deliberations and\r\nalso improperly imposed on plaintiffs the burden of proving the\r\nnature and extent of the enhanced injuries attributable to the\r\nVanagon's design.  We find no reversible error in the district\r\ncourt's evidentiary rulings.  The remaining matter of who, under\r\nNew Hampshire law, should bear the burden in a so-called\r\n\"crashworthiness\" case, poses sophisticated questions of burden\r\nallocation involving not only a choice of appropriate precedent but\r\nalso an important policy choice.  It is a question of fairly recent\r\norigin that has divided courts across the country.  Although we do\r\nnot criticize the district court for abuse of discretion in its\r\ndecision declining to certify, we choose to exercise our own\r\ndiscretion and think it preferable to allow the state's highest\r\ncourt to choose its own path.  We therefore grant the Trulls'\r\nmotion to certify the burden of proof question to the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n                        I. Background\r\nAlthough certain particulars of the Trulls' 1991 accident\r\nare germane to issues raised on appeal, we think it more helpful to\r\nrelate them in the context of our discussions of those claims.  At\r\nthis juncture, therefore, we provide only a brief procedural\r\nhistory of the case.\r\nThe Trulls filed their lawsuit in early 1994, alleging\r\nclaims of negligence, breach of warranty and strict liability on\r\nbehalf of all four family members.  Plaintiffs had two primary\r\ntheories of recovery: (1) the Vanagon was defective because it was\r\na forward control vehicle constructed in such a way that it lacked\r\nsufficient protection against a frontal impact, and (2) the Vanagon\r\nwas defective because the rear bench seats, on which Nathaniel and\r\nBenjamin were seated, did not have shoulder safety belts as well as\r\nlap belts.\r\nIn May 1997, defendants filed an in limine motion seeking\r\nto exclude from trial certain evidence relating to the post-\r\naccident condition of the Vanagon because the vehicle had been\r\ndisposed of (\"spoliated,\" in the relevant jargon) by the Trulls'\r\ninsurance company and therefore was unavailable to be inspected by\r\nVolkswagen's experts.  In particular, David Trull, who had gone\r\nwith a friend shortly after the accident to retrieve personal items\r\nfrom the vehicle, was prepared to testify that Elizabeth's seat\r\nbelt was broken.  Other evidence indicated that Benjamin had been\r\nwearing a seat belt before the accident but was not wearing it when\r\nhe was found in the wreckage after the crash.  Volkswagen claimed\r\nthat it would be unduly prejudicial to allow testimony about the\r\npost-accident condition of the seat belts when the defendant had\r\nhad no opportunity to inspect them itself.  The district court\r\ngranted the motion to the extent that plaintiffs were barred from\r\nusing lay testimony or expert opinion about the seat belts' post-\r\naccident condition.\r\nIn December 1997, the district court granted summary\r\njudgment for the defendants on the breach of warranty claims, a\r\ndisposition that is not challenged on appeal.  In April 1998, just\r\nbefore opening statements in the trial, Elizabeth Trull withdrew\r\nher remaining claims, assertedly because of the court's exclusion\r\nof the seat-belt evidence and its determination that plaintiffs\r\nbore the burden of proving the nature of any enhanced injuries\r\ncaused by a defect in the vehicle.  Because Elizabeth was ejected\r\nfrom the Vanagon, she maintained that evidence about her broken\r\nseat belt was crucial for her to show a link between a defect and\r\nher injuries.  The defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the\r\nclaims of both Elizabeth and David Trull with prejudice, and the\r\ndistrict court granted the motion on May 4.  The trial proceeded\r\nwith Nathaniel's and Benjamin's claims.\r\nThe jury returned verdicts for the defendants on all\r\nremaining claims, and the district court denied plaintiffs' motion\r\nfor a new trial.  This appeal followed.\r\n                        II. Discussion\r\nFive of the plaintiffs' six assertions of error concern\r\nthe admission or exclusion of evidence, and the district court's\r\ndecisions in each instance are reversible only for an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. See Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of Puerto Rico, 156\r\nF.3d 49, 56-57 (lst Cir. 1998).  The last issue, the legal\r\ndetermination of the appropriate burden of proof in New Hampshire\r\nin a crashworthiness case, is a question of law entitled to de novo\r\nscrutiny.  We discuss first why we find no reversible error in the\r\ncourt's evidentiary decisions, addressing each in turn, before\r\nexplaining why we choose to consult the New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\non the burden of proof issue.\r\nOne procedural matter needs attention before we reach\r\nthese claims of error, however, and we therefore begin with that\r\nissue, namely, whether Elizabeth has preserved her claims for\r\nappellate review.    A. Elizabeth's Appeal.\r\nAppellees contend that Elizabeth is not properly a party\r\non appeal because the district court dismissed her claims with\r\nprejudice, and there has been no appeal of that dismissal. \r\nAppellants counter that their explicit statements withdrawing\r\nElizabeth's claims based on the court's pretrial rulings on the\r\nburden of proof and the exclusion of the broken seat-belt\r\ntestimony, together with their offer of proof on those matters,\r\nsufficed to preserve her right to appeal.\r\nBecause the spoliation issue also is raised on behalf of\r\nBenjamin's estate, and because we uphold the district court's\r\nexclusion of the seat-belt evidence, Elizabeth's status is\r\nirrelevant with respect to that claim.  The court's ruling on the\r\nburden of proof, however, which we hold in abeyance in order to\r\ncertify the issue to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, see infra at\r\n22-31, is a different matter.  If the state court disagrees with\r\nthe district court's resolution of that issue, Elizabeth would be\r\nentitled to bring her claims in a new trial only if she has\r\npreserved her appellate rights.\r\nAfter careful consideration of the record and relevant\r\nlegal principles, we conclude that she has not.  As noted above,\r\nElizabeth withdrew her claims on the morning of the first day of\r\ntrial, April 7, 1998.  Three weeks later, on April 30, as the\r\neighteen-day trial was near completion, defendants moved for\r\ndismissal of Elizabeth and David's claims with prejudice.  In an\r\neight-page memorandum in support of their motion, defendants argued\r\nthat dismissal with prejudice of Elizabeth and David's claims was\r\njustified \r\n  given the procedural irregularity and timing\r\nof Mrs. Trull's \"withdrawal,\" failure of David\r\nTrull to submit either claims or evidence, the\r\nextensive preparation that was undertaken by\r\ndefendants to try Elizabeth and David Trull's\r\nclaims, the amount of time the court has\r\ninvested in ruling on evidentiary and other\r\nmatters, the substantial rights defendants\r\nhave developed under the rulings already made\r\nby the court, and the extreme cost to\r\ndefendants and the court in holding a second\r\ntrial in this matter.\r\n\nAlthough the motion informed the court that plaintiffs objected, no\r\nopposition was filed.  The docket reports that on May 4, the court\r\norally granted defendants' motion.  On May 6, in a document\r\nentitled \"JUDGMENT,\" the district court included its May 4 grant of\r\nthe dismissal motion in a list of five dispositions, which also\r\nincluded the jury verdicts rendered on May 4.  The same list was\r\nrepeated in a June 11 document entitled \"POST-JUDGMENT JUDGMENT,\"\r\nwhich contained one additional item, the court's June 10 order\r\ndenying plaintiffs' motion for new trial.  That motion did not seek\r\nreversal of the dismissal.\r\nPlaintiffs' subsequent notice of appeal requested review\r\nof six separate orders, but it, too, made no reference to the May\r\n4 dismissal order.  So far as we can tell, therefore, the record\r\ncontains neither an objection to the dismissal filed by the\r\nplaintiffs nor a request that the court substitute a less final\r\ndisposition.  Although counsel stated when he announced withdrawal\r\nof Elizabeth's claims that he was making an offer of proof \"for\r\npurposes of appellate practice,\" we think this was not enough to\r\npreserve her claims in the face of defendants' subsequent motion to\r\ndismiss with prejudice.  That motion explicitly alerted plaintiffs\r\nto defendants' view that Elizabeth was not entitled to pursue an\r\nappeal precisely because of the way in which she had withdrawn from\r\nthe trial.\r\nFor whatever reason, plaintiffs  repeatedly sidestepped\r\nthe dismissal issue.  It was not raised in their renewed motion for\r\ncertification of the burden of proof question, their motion for new\r\ntrial, or their brief on appeal.  Although ambiguous, each document\r\nseems to presume that, if the court were to agree with plaintiffs'\r\narguments, Elizabeth's claims would be resurrected.  See, e.g.,\r\nPlaintiffs' Brief on Appeal at 16 (In argument challenging\r\nexclusion of seat-belt evidence, plaintiffs asserted that \"[t]he\r\nCourt committed reversible error when it prohibited Elizabeth Trull\r\nfrom pursuing her claims.\").  Not until their reply brief, in\r\nresponse to defendants' arguments that Elizabeth had waived her\r\nappellate rights, did plaintiffs address the dismissal order, and\r\nthen referred to it only in passing.  Their position apparently is\r\nthat, notwithstanding the dismissal, their offer of proof was\r\nsufficient in the context of this case to preserve Elizabeth's\r\nissues.\r\nWe, however, can see no basis upon which to relax the\r\nrule requiring parties to specifically designate the orders from\r\nwhich they wish to take an appeal.  See United States v. Velez\r\nCarrero, 140 F.3d 327, 330 (lst Cir. 1998); Fed. R. App. Pro. 3(c). \r\nPlaintiffs could not have been oblivious to the district court's\r\ndismissal of Elizabeth's claims   the court documented its order\r\ntwice, once before and once after the new trial motion.  The\r\nrequest for dismissal, three weeks after the offer of proof, and\r\nthe court's subsequent grant of that motion, represented a new\r\nstage in the proceedings on Elizabeth's claims.  If plaintiffs\r\nwished to preserve Elizabeth's claims without putting on what they\r\nbelieved would be a meritless case in light of the court's rulings\r\non spoliation and burden of proof, they could have stipulated to\r\ndismissal pending appeal or asked the court to change the dismissal\r\nto one without prejudice.  Instead, plaintiffs chose to sit idly\r\nby as the district court disposed of her claims with finality. \r\nPlaintiffs' failure to appeal the decision taking Elizabeth out of\r\nthe case   indeed, their failure to offer any substantive response\r\nto defendants' request for dismissal   is a procedural default that\r\nbars further litigation of her claims.\r\nB. Exclusion of seat-belt evidence based on the\r\ndestruction of the Vanagon (spoliation).\r\nAppellants contend that the district court erred in\r\nexcluding evidence about the post-accident condition of Elizabeth's\r\nand Benjamin's seat belts because appellants bore no responsibility\r\nfor the destruction of the Vanagon.  They argue that such a serious\r\nevidentiary sanction is reserved for instances of misconduct, in\r\nwhich evidence is knowingly destroyed in the face of contemplated\r\nlitigation, and there is serious prejudice to the other party.  The\r\nshort answer to this assertion is that our case law does not\r\nrequire bad faith or comparable bad motive.\r\n  [B]ad faith is not essential.  If such\r\nevidence is mishandled through carelessness,\r\nand the other side is prejudiced, we think\r\nthat the district court is entitled to\r\nconsider imposing sanctions, including\r\nexclusion of the evidence. . . . Although\r\ndeterrence may play a role, the primary aim is\r\nremedial, at least absent willful destruction.\r\n\nSacramona v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 106 F.3d 444, 447, 446\r\n(lst Cir. 1997).  Fairness to the opposing party therefore plays a\r\nsubstantial role in determining the proper response to a spoliation\r\nmotion, and punishment for egregious conduct is not the sole\r\nrationale for the most severe sanction of exclusion. \r\nIn its nineteen-page ruling on spoliation, the district\r\ncourt  thoughtfully examined various factors, including prejudice\r\nand motive, in deciding whether and how to sanction plaintiffs for\r\nthe disposal of the Vanagon.  Its analysis, which we do not recount\r\nin detail, by no means reflects an abuse of discretion. The\r\ndistrict court found no suggestion of bad faith, but did opine that\r\n\"there are clear indications that the plaintiffs acted negligently\r\nin allowing the destruction of the Vanagon.\"  Order at 12. \r\nPresumably, the court was referring to the fact that David Trull\r\nfailed to prevent disposal of the car or to preserve evidence of\r\nthe seat-belt condition after he had examined the Vanagon while it\r\nwas in the insurance company's possession.  Trull had inspected the\r\nvehicle in an effort \"to figure out what had happened,\" and the\r\nthought \"cross[ed] his mind\" at the time that Volkswagen might be\r\nat fault for something.  Although Trull and his friend later\r\ndiscussed returning to photograph the seat belts, they never did.\r\nIn assessing prejudice, the court rejected the\r\nplaintiffs' arguments that defendants were not unfairly\r\ndisadvantaged because plaintiffs' experts, too, were unable to\r\nexamine the car and because the defendants were able to mount a\r\nsophisticated defense to the claims using other evidence.  The\r\nclaim that the parties were equally disadvantaged by loss of the\r\nvehicle ignores the very evidence that plaintiffs sought to\r\ninclude.  Had the district court allowed David Trull's lay\r\ntestimony concerning the condition of the seat belts, Volkswagen\r\nwould have had no basis for challenging his recollection or any\r\nexpert opinion derived from his testimony.  And while Volkswagen\r\nwas able to vigorously defend without an expert evaluation of the\r\nVanagon, the court recognized that defendants would be\r\n  forced to resort to a \"battle of the experts\"\r\narmed with a small amount of information of\r\nquestionable reliability.\r\n\nOrder at 14.   In this situation, the district court's judgment is\r\nunassailable.\r\n\nC. Exclusion of evidence of the Eurovan\r\nThe Trulls contend that the district court erred in\r\nexcluding evidence concerning the Eurovan, a Volkswagen vehicle\r\nmanufactured for sale in Europe before the time of the accident. \r\nThe Trulls sought to show that the Eurovan had been designed to\r\nsolve the problems inherent in the Vanagon, thereby demonstrating\r\nthat Volkswagen was aware that the Vanagon was unreasonably\r\ndangerous and that a feasible, affordable alternative was\r\navailable.  The district court rejected the proffered evidence as\r\nof doubtful relevance and because of \"a danger of unfair\r\nprejudice.\"\r\nThe Eurovan's significance relates to the body design of\r\nthe two vehicles.  The 1986 Vanagon owned by the Trulls was a so-\r\ncalled \"forward control vehicle,\" which had the engine in the rear\r\nand consequently did not have the usual extended front end.  The\r\nlack of a front \"crumple zone\" to protect occupants from a front-\r\nend collision was among the design defects that the Trulls alleged\r\ncontributed to their injuries.  Volkswagen, however, countered that\r\nthe Vanagon's front structure was specially designed to absorb\r\ncollision forces and protect occupants.\r\nThe Eurovan, which was introduced in the late 1980s, is\r\na front-engine vehicle and has a more traditional, longer front\r\nend.  In offering the Eurovan evidence, the plaintiffs sought to\r\nshow that it was, in essence, a \"subsequent remedial measure\" taken\r\nby Volkswagen to fix the Vanagon's defective design.  Although\r\nevidence concerning subsequent remedial measures generally is not\r\nadmissible at trial, see Fed. R. Evid. 407, measures that take\r\nplace before the accident at issue do not fall within the\r\nprohibition.  See Bogosian v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, 104\r\nF.3d 472, 481 (lst Cir. 1997); Raymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d\r\n1518, 1523 (lst Cir. 1991).  The district court does have its usual\r\ndiscretion, however, to exclude the evidence under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n403 if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice.  See Bogosian, 104 F.3d at 481;\r\nRaymond, 938 F.2d at 1523-24.\r\nThe district court ultimately rejected the Eurovan\r\nevidence as unduly prejudicial in light of its doubtful probative\r\nvalue, and we again cannot fault its reasoning.  There was no\r\nquestion that an alternative design was feasible, as it was\r\nundisputed that Volkswagen knew that a more conventional, extended\r\nfront-end design was an available option at the time of the Trulls'\r\naccident.   Indeed, the jury heard ample evidence that other\r\nmanufacturers' vans had the front-end, or \"snub-nose\" design, and\r\nplaintiffs elicited testimony from their expert indicating that\r\nsuch vehicles were safer.  Moreover, plaintiffs proffered no\r\nevidence that Volkswagen specifically designed the Eurovan's front\r\nend to remedy known safety problems in the Vanagon.  In addition,\r\nthe proffered Eurovan evidence appears irrelevant to the remaining\r\nclaims in the case; the claims of the front-seat passengers, David\r\nand Elizabeth, had been withdrawn, and the boys' claims centered on\r\nthe lack of shoulder belts, not on the lack of a front crumple\r\nzone.\r\nIn these circumstances, we doubt that admission of the\r\nevidence would have been proper.  Without question, it was not an\r\nabuse of discretion to exclude it.\r\nD. Expert opinion based on Fatal Accident Reporting\r\nSystem (FARS) data\r\nPlaintiffs claim the district court erred in allowing\r\ndefendants' experts to testify about an article entitled \"Usage and\r\nEffectiveness of Rear-Seat Belt Restraints in Severe Frontal\r\nCrashes\" because the article contained unreliable and irrelevant\r\ndata and constituted hearsay. We note, initially, that the court\r\ndid not allow the article itself into evidence, but simply\r\npermitted defendants' experts   two of the article's authors   to\r\ntestify about its contents and the basis for their conclusion that\r\nlap/shoulder belts are no more effective than lap belts alone in\r\npreventing deaths.    The study described in the article was based\r\non data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety\r\nAdministration (NHTSA) through the Fatal Accident Reporting System\r\n(FARS), and the statistics cover every fatal frontal collision\r\nreported for the period 1975 to 1995.  The FARS system was\r\nimplemented by the federal government to collect data on fatal\r\naccidents in the United States, and the information it contains is\r\ndrawn from police reports, motor vehicle registration files, vital \r\nstatistics, and state highway department records.  See Fatal\r\nAccident Reporting System 1978 Annual Report Foreward (1978).\r\nWe see no abuse of discretion in the district court's\r\ndecision to allow the experts' testimony.  Under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n803(8), data compilations of public agencies setting forth \"matters\r\nobserved pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there\r\nwas a duty to report\" are not considered hearsay.  Volkswagen\r\nreports in its brief, and appellants do not contest, that the FARS\r\ndata on which the article was based are collected and reported\r\npursuant to a legislative mandate by the NHTSA, a public agency. \r\nSee 49 U.S.C.  30168(a)(1)(A).  Additionally, the evidence appears\r\nto satisfy Fed. R. Evid. 703, which allows admission of expert\r\ntestimony based on  \"facts or data . . . of a type reasonably\r\nrelied upon by experts in the particular field.\"  See International\r\nAdhesive Coating Co. v. Bolton Emerson Int'l, 851 F.2d 540, 544-45\r\n(lst Cir. 1988); see generally Seese v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 648\r\nF.2d 833, 845-46 (3d Cir. 1981).   Indeed, appellants' expert, John\r\nStilson, acknowledged that the FARS data are among the appropriate\r\nsources to consult when evaluating the crashworthiness of a\r\nvehicle.  Consequently, the testimony was not excludible as\r\nhearsay.\r\nAppellants' complaint that the study was irrelevant\r\nbecause it included data gathered after the date of their accident\r\nsimilarly misfires.  A threshold question for the jury was whether\r\nthe Vanagon was defective because its rear seats were equipped only\r\nwith lap belts.  Regardless of the state of knowledge at the time\r\nVolkswagen designed and manufactured the Trulls' vehicle, the\r\ncompany could be neither negligent nor strictly liable if more\r\ncomprehensive, up-to-date information demonstrated that a seat belt\r\nsystem using only lap belts was reasonably safe.  Although\r\nstatistics focusing solely on rear lap belts in forward control\r\nvehicles would allow a more precise comparison, the unavailability\r\nof such evidence does not render improper the evidence that was\r\navailable.  The dissimilarities went to the weight of the evidence\r\nand were a proper subject for cross-examination. See International\r\nAdhesive Coating Co., 851 F.2d at 544.  In sum, we find no\r\nreversible error in the admission of this expert testimony.\r\nE. Evidence from prior lawsuit\r\nPlaintiffs contend that the district court erred in\r\nallowing into evidence a diagram depicting the paths of the Vanagon\r\nand the other car involved in the crash, an AMC Concord.  The\r\nTrulls had relied on the diagram, which showed the vehicles\r\ncolliding at a 90-degree angle, in an earlier state court lawsuit\r\nthey filed against the State of New Hampshire for failure to remedy\r\nthe icy road conditions.  The Trulls had introduced the diagram as\r\nan exhibit through the testimony of Sgt. Leon Shackley, the officer\r\nin charge of the accident investigation for the Conway Police\r\nDepartment.\r\nIn the present lawsuit, the Trulls maintained that their\r\naccident involved a nearly straight, head-on collision, while\r\nVolkswagen attempted to show that the accident was a side impact,\r\nwith the front end of the Concord contacting the passenger side of\r\nthe Vanagon at an angle of about 55 degrees.  The angle of impact\r\nwas significant in the Volkswagen case because the Trulls' claims\r\nfocused on the Vanagon's lack of a \"front crumple zone\" and the\r\nabsence of shoulder belts to prevent the boys from surging forward\r\nin the back seat of the car.\r\nWhen Shackley was called as a witness by the Trulls in\r\nthis case, Volkswagen sought on cross-examination to show that the\r\nTrulls had changed their position about the angle of the collision\r\nand that -- the point of significance -- their original view\r\nmatched Volkswagen's. The Trulls objected on various grounds to\r\nadmission of the diagram, including that the document did not\r\nqualify as a prior inconsistent statement and that its admission\r\nwould improperly bring evidence of another lawsuit into the case. \r\nThe district court permitted Volkswagen to introduce the diagram\r\nduring cross-examination of Shackley, but barred Volkswagen from\r\nidentifying the defendant or referring to the claims at issue.  The\r\nexchange was brief, and went as follows:\r\n  Q. Sergeant, in another lawsuit brought by the\r\nTrulls, you were called as a witness in the\r\ntrial of that case; right?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\n  Q. Do you recall that in that case the Trulls,\r\nthrough their lawyer, introduced this diagram \r\n. . . as a description of the paths of the\r\nvehicles in the accident?\r\n\n  A. I don't specifically recall it.  It was\r\nover a year ago or almost a year ago when that\r\none went.\r\n\nVolkswagen's attorney then showed Shackley the transcript from the\r\nearlier proceeding.\r\n  Q. Do you see the question from the Trulls'\r\ncounsel to you?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\n  Q. And the question   the sense of the\r\nquestion was whether that diagram was an\r\naccurate portrayal of how the vehicles\r\ntraveled in this accident; correct?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\n  Q. And then the Trulls lawyer asked that that \r\nbe admitted as evidence; correct?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\nAt that point, the district court gave the following limiting\r\ninstruction:\r\n  Members of the jury, I'm going to instruct you\r\nat this time that the mere fact that another\r\nlawsuit may have been brought by the Trulls is\r\nnot a matter which you should in any way\r\nconsider in deciding this case.  The mere fact\r\nof that lawsuit is not material and relevant\r\nto the decisions that you have to make in this\r\ncase.  However, to the extent that you find in\r\nany evidence presented to you any positions\r\ntaken consistent or inconsistent with claims\r\nmade in this case, then you may weigh and\r\nconsider that evidence along with all the\r\nother evidence in this case.  But the mere\r\nfact of that lawsuit is something that you\r\nshould disregard in your deliberations.\r\n\nSubsequent to this testimony, Volkswagen sought to re-\r\ncall David Trull for questioning about the diagram and about a\r\nrelated statement made by the Trulls' attorney in the earlier\r\ntrial.  The statement was made during a bench conference, as that\r\nattorney, Randall Cooper, advocated admission of a photograph of\r\nthe accident scene.  He stated that the photograph \"certainly\r\ndemonstrates that the reconstruction by the Police Department is\r\naccurate in showing how the vehicle slid, and there was a side-to-\r\nfront impact.\"  Before finally deciding whether to allow Trull to\r\nbe re-called, the district court conducted voir dire questioning of\r\nTrull and Cooper.  They both emphasized that the angle of the\r\naccident was not at issue in the earlier trial and that the diagram\r\nand statement by Cooper consequently were of little weight and\r\nshould not be deemed an inconsistent position.\r\nThe district court declined to allow the questioning of\r\nTrull.  On appeal, plaintiffs repeat their objections to the\r\nintroduction of the diagram and assert that its admission\r\nconstituted prejudicial, reversible error.\r\nThis issue strikes us as a classic example of the value\r\nof leaving matters of evidence to the discretion of the district\r\ncourt.  Unquestionably, the Trulls in the earlier trial put forward\r\nas accurate the diagram from which they now wish to distance\r\nthemselves, and it is a matter of record that their attorney\r\ndescribed the accident as a \"side-to-front impact.\"   With only\r\nthat much before us, we have simply a prior factual claim\r\ncontradictory to a factual position taken in this case by the same\r\nparty, and thus a presumptively admissible statement against\r\ninterest.  See Kassel v. Gannett Co., 875 F.2d 935, 952-53 (lst\r\nCir. 1989); Estate of Spinosa v. International Harvester Co., 621\r\nF.2d 1154, 1157 (lst Cir. 1980).  With the limited scope of\r\nquestioning permitted by the court and the curative instruction, we\r\ncannot say the district judge abused his discretion in admitting\r\nthe diagram during the Shackley cross-examination.  Through their\r\nown questioning, the Trulls had the opportunity to diminish the\r\nforce of the diagram by eliciting that it was not drawn with\r\ntechnical precision and that Shackley no longer considered it to be\r\naccurate.\r\nIn addition, the court limited the impact of the diagram\r\nby rejecting Volkswagen's request to question David Trull about it.\r\nThe court's decisions reflect the give-and-take of a trial, and the\r\ncareful consideration that a judge is obliged to give to the\r\nparties' competing positions.   Although the voir dire questioning\r\nof Trull and his attorney, which occurred after admission of the\r\ndiagram, suggested that the inconsistency may have resulted more\r\nfrom inattentiveness than deliberate strategy, this softer view of\r\nthe contradiction did not retroactively make erroneous or\r\nprejudicial the diagram's admission.  The district court\r\nconsistently dealt with this issue thoughtfully and with respect\r\nfor each party's position.  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nF. Exclusion of correspondence.  Plaintiffs sought\r\nadmission into evidence of more than a dozen letters written\r\nbetween Volkswagen and two government agencies, the National\r\nTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the NHTSA.  The\r\ncorrespondence related primarily to Volkswagen's knowledge of the\r\nadded protective benefits provided to rear seat occupants by \r\nshoulder belts.  We decline to dwell on this issue.  The district\r\ncourt allowed plaintiffs to introduce a sampling of the letters,\r\nconcluding that the remainder were cumulative and that their\r\nadmission and the resulting testimony would be unduly confusing for\r\nthe jury.  Plaintiffs' brief fails to identify crucial, non-\r\ncumulative information that was omitted as a result of the court's\r\nselective admissions.  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nG. Certification of Burden of Proof\r\nThe crashworthiness/enhanced injury theory of liability \r\nunder which the Trulls brought their claims arises in automobile\r\naccident cases when plaintiffs claim that a defect in their vehicle \r\ncaused them to suffer greater injuries than would have occurred had\r\nthe vehicle been properly designed.  See Larsen v. General Motors\r\nCorp., 391 F.2d 495, 503 (8th Cir. 1968).  In such cases, the\r\nplaintiffs seek to recover damages from the car manufacturer for at\r\nleast a portion of their injuries.\r\nWhether the plaintiff or the defendant bears the burden\r\nof segregating the injuries attributable to the vehicle's defect is\r\na question that has divided the courts that have considered it.  \r\nSee Polston v. Boomershine Pontiac-GMC Truck, Inc., 952 F.2d 1304,\r\n1310 (llth Cir. 1992) (citing cases); McLeod v. American Motors\r\nCorp., 723 F.2d 830, 833-34 (llth Cir. 1984) (same); Czarnecki v.\r\nVolkswagen of America,  837 P.2d 1143, 1147-48 (Ariz. 1991) (same); \r\nsee also Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability  16, at\r\n243-53 (1998); H. Vickles &amp; E. Oldham, \"Enhanced Injury Should Not\r\nEqual Enhanced Liability,\" 36 S. Tex. L. Rev. 417, 426-38, 440\r\n(1995); G. Tietz, M. Bushman &amp; J. Podraza, Jr., \"Crashworthiness\r\nand Erie: Determining State Law Regarding the Burden of Proving and\r\nApportioning Damages,\" 62 Temp. L. Rev. 587, 595-611 (1989).  Both\r\npositions appear to have ample justification, and a given state's\r\nstance is not easily predicted.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\nhas not yet faced the issue, and the Trulls therefore moved for\r\ncertification in the district court.  That court declined to\r\ncertify, finding that New Hampshire law was adequately revealing\r\nand that it required the burden to be placed on the plaintiffs. \r\nThe Trulls have renewed their request for certification on appeal.\r\nWe are not persuaded that New Hampshire's approach to\r\nthis issue can be discerned from review of the state's existing\r\ntort law cases.  Because of the sharp division in the courts that\r\nhave addressed the issue, and the policy concerns that underlay the\r\ndecision, we have chosen to consult the New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\nthrough certification.  See Kansallis Finance Ltd v. Fern, 40 F.3d\r\n476, 481 (lst Cir. 1994) (absent controlling state law precedent,\r\nfederal appeals court sitting in diversity has discretion to\r\ncertify state law questions to highest state court); Polston, 952\r\nF.2d at 1310 (certifying the same question to the Georgia Supreme\r\nCourt).  Before framing our query, we summarize the competing\r\nperspectives.\r\nThe minority view, which is the one endorsed by\r\nVolkswagen and used by the district court in this case, places the\r\nburden on the plaintiff to prove the nature and extent of his\r\nenhanced injuries.  This so-called Huddell/Caiazzo approach,\r\nderived from Huddell v. Levin, 537 F.2d 726, 737-38 (3d Cir. 1976)\r\n(New Jersey law), and Caiazzo v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 647 F.2d\r\n241, 250 (2d Cir. 1981) (New York law), requires a plaintiff to\r\nprove three things: (1) that an alternative, safer design would\r\nhave been practicable under the circumstances; (2) the injuries, if\r\nany, that would have resulted if the alternative design had been\r\nused; (3) the extent of enhanced injuries attributable to the\r\ndefective design.  See, e.g., Huddell, 537 F.2d at 737-38.  The\r\nlatter two elements are, of course, corollaries, both in essence\r\nrequiring the plaintiff to sort out which injuries would not have\r\noccurred, and which injuries (including additional ones) would have\r\noccurred, had there been no defect.\r\nVolkswagen argues that this approach is conceptually\r\nclear and consistent with basic tort principles.  It asserts in its\r\nbrief that, \"because in a crashworthiness case plaintiff's\r\nessential claim is that the design defect caused the plaintiff to\r\nsuffer injuries he would not have received but for a defect in the\r\nvehicle's design, the existence and extent of these more severe or\r\n`enhanced' injuries are an essential element of the plaintiff's own\r\ntheory of recovery for which the plaintiff bears the burden of\r\nproof.\"  See Caiazzo, 647 F.2d at 251.\r\nThe company further argues that this approach reflects\r\nNew Hampshire's approach to tort law, which is premised on \"the\r\nfundamental tenet . . . that the plaintiff retains the ultimate\r\nburden of persuasion in negligence actions,\" Pillsbury-Flood v.\r\nPortsmouth Hospital, 512 A.2d 1126, 1129 (N.H. 1986), and which, in\r\nthe context of a suit for aggravation of pre-existing injuries,\r\nplaces the burden of proving the extent of aggravation on the\r\nplaintiff, see Valliere v. Filfalt, 266 A.2d 843, 845 (N.H. 1970).\r\nThe more widely used Fox-Mitchell approach, derived from\r\nFox v. Ford Motor Co., 575 F.2d 774, 787-88 (10th Cir. 1978)\r\n(Wyoming law), and  Mitchell v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 669 F.2d\r\n1199, 1206-1208 (8th Cir. 1982) (Minnesota law), requires a\r\nplaintiff to prove only that the design defect was a \"substantial\r\nfactor in producing damages over and above those which were\r\nprobably caused as a result of the original impact or collision,\"\r\nsee Mitchell, 669 F.2d at 1206.  Once the plaintiff makes that\r\nshowing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show which injuries\r\nwere attributable to the initial collision and which to the defect. \r\nUnder this line of cases, a manufacturer who fails to make such an\r\nallocation is held liable for all of the plaintiff's injury.  Thus,\r\nin cases where the injury is \"indivisible\"   such as, for example,\r\ncertain instances of paraplegia or death   manufacturers are\r\ntreated as joint tortfeasors for all injuries.  See id.\r\nThe Mitchell and Fox courts also claim a traditional tort\r\nlaw heritage for their approach.  In explicitly rejecting the\r\nHuddell-Caiazzo allocation of the burden, the court in Fox noted\r\n\"the orthodox doctrines of joint liability of concurrent tort-\r\nfeasors for injuries which flow from their concurring in one\r\nimpact,\" 575 F.2d at 787.  Under this doctrine, the Mitchell court\r\npointed out, wrongdoers who each play a substantial role in\r\ncreating an indivisible harm are treated as joint and several\r\ntortfeasors.  See 669 F.2d at 1207.  According to the Mitchell\r\ncourt, use of the Huddell-Caiazzo model in enhanced injury cases\r\ninvolving an indivisible injury departs from this well established\r\napproach and \"will generally result in complete exoneration of the\r\nnegligent manufacturer.\"  Id. at 1207-08.  The court observed:\r\n    By placing the burden of proof on a\r\nplaintiff to prove that the designer was the\r\nsole cause of not only an enhanced indivisible\r\ninjury, but, in addition, that he would not\r\notherwise have received injuries absent a\r\ndefect, the injured victim is relegated to an \r\nalmost hopeless state of never being able to\r\nsucceed against a defective designer.  The\r\npublic interest is little served. . . . A rule\r\nof law which requires a plaintiff to prove\r\nwhat portion of indivisible harm was caused by\r\neach party and what might have happened in\r\nlieu of what did happen requires obvious\r\nspeculation and proof of the impossible.  This\r\napproach converts the common law rules\r\ngoverning principles of legal causation into a\r\nmorass of confusion and uncertainty.\r\n\nId. at 1204-05.\r\n\nThe Fox-Mitchell construct thus was designed to ensure\r\nthat plaintiffs whose injuries were in part traceable to a design\r\ndefect would be able to recover from the manufacturer, even when\r\nthey could not prove precisely how the defect made their injuries \r\nmore severe.  Using the joint tortfeasor setting as a model, this\r\napproach \"is a result of a choice made as to where a loss due to\r\nfailure of proof shall fall   on an innocent plaintiff or on\r\ndefendants who are clearly proved to have been at fault,\" see\r\nMitchell, 669 F.2d at 1208 (quoting Mathews v. Mills, 178 N.W.2d\r\n841, 845 (Minn. 1970)).\r\nAlthough Volkswagen emphasizes that the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court explicitly has rejected burden-shifting for the\r\npurpose of assisting plaintiffs, the primary case it cites\r\naddresses a plaintiff's argument that the burden of negating\r\ncausation should have been shifted to the defendants.  See\r\nPillsbury-Flood, 512 A.2d at 1128.  The Fox-Mitchell approach does\r\nnot relieve a plaintiff of the threshold obligation of proving\r\ncausation, and thus liability; it is only after a plaintiff has\r\ndemonstrated that the design defect was a \"substantial factor\" in\r\nproducing damages over and above those that otherwise would have\r\noccurred that the burden shifts to the defendant to apportion\r\ndamages.  Indeed, in rejecting the burden-shifting proposed by the\r\nplaintiff in Pillsbury-Flood, the New Hampshire court noted that\r\nits rule \r\n  ensures that defendants will not have to\r\ndefend against improbable claims, and that\r\ndefendants will not have to disprove the\r\nelement of causation.  Proving a negative\r\nposes practical and theoretical problems that\r\nshould not be placed on defendants.\r\n\n512 A.2d at 1129-30.  A very similar rationale motivated the\r\nMitchell court, which concluded that plaintiffs who have proven\r\ncausation should not be faced with the \"impossible burden of\r\nproving a negative fact,\" 669 F.2d at 1204-05.  In our view, the\r\ndifference between shifting the initial burden of causation and\r\nshifting the burden of allocating damages is sufficiently\r\nsignificant that the result in Pillsbury-Flood does not necessarily\r\nlead to the Huddell-Caiazzo approach.\r\nIn sum, we think that the burden of proof that the New\r\nHampshire Supreme Court would choose for a crashworthiness case is\r\nnot readily apparent from existing case law and is quintessentially\r\na policy judgment appropriately made for the state by its own\r\ncourts.  The applicable burden of proof unquestionably may have\r\nbeen determinative of the jury's verdict.  The court instructed the\r\njury that, to establish Volkswagen's liability, the plaintiffs had\r\nto prove, along with causation, \"the nature and extent of the\r\ninjuries that were enhanced.\"  If the Fox-Mitchell approach were\r\nthe appropriate standard, the plaintiffs would have met their\r\nburden to establish liability simply by showing that a defect in\r\nthe vehicle was a \"substantial factor\" in producing damages over\r\nand above those that otherwise would have occurred.  The burden of\r\napportioning damages would have fallen on Volkswagen.  We therefore\r\ncertify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, pursuant to its Rule\r\n34, the question set forth in the attached certificate.\r\n                       III. Conclusion\r\nFor these reasons, we affirm the various evidentiary\r\nrulings by the district court and certify the question of the\r\nappropriate burden of proof to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  We\r\nretain jurisdiction pending that court's determination.\r\n\n                        CERTIFICATION\r\nFor the reasons discussed in our opinion, the following\r\nquestion is respectfully certified to the Supreme Court of New\r\nHampshire, pursuant to its Rule 34:\r\n  Under New Hampshire law, in a crashworthiness\r\nor enhanced injury case, does the plaintiff\r\nbear the burden of demonstrating the specific\r\nnature and extent of the injuries attributable\r\nto the manufacturer, or does the burden of\r\napportionment fall on the defendant once the\r\nplaintiff has proved causation?\r\n\nIn asking only this question, we do not intend to limit the scope\r\nof the court's response. We welcome discussion of any relevant New\r\nHampshire law that the Supreme Court deems appropriate.\r\nThe clerk of this court will transmit our certification,\r\nalong with copies of the briefs and the record appendix in this\r\ncase, to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  We shall await its reply\r\nwith interest and appreciation.\r\nIt is so ordered.  \n",

Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n             and Pollak, Senior District Judge.\r\n\n   David P. Angueira with whom Edward M. Swartz, Alan L. Cantor,\r\nand Lisa V. Kaprielian were on brief for appellants.\r\n   Howard B. Myers with whom Bryan K. Gould was on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nJuly 22, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  In February 1991, David\r\nand Elizabeth Trull, and their two sons, Nathaniel and Benjamin,\r\nwere traveling to Maine after a day of cross-country skiing in New\r\nHampshire when their Volkswagen Vanagon slid on black ice and\r\ncollided with an oncoming car.  Benjamin, age 9, died in the\r\naccident, and Nathaniel, age 13, and Elizabeth suffered severe\r\nbrain injuries.  In this diversity products liability action, the\r\nTrulls seek damages from Volkswagen on the ground that defects in\r\nthe design of the Vanagon made their injuries more severe than they\r\notherwise would have been.  The district court granted summary\r\njudgment for Volkswagen on the Trulls' breach of warranty claims,\r\nand a jury found for the automobile manufacturer on the remaining\r\nliability claims.\r\nThe Trulls contend that the district court made a number\r\nof evidentiary errors that tainted the jury's deliberations and\r\nalso improperly imposed on plaintiffs the burden of proving the\r\nnature and extent of the enhanced injuries attributable to the\r\nVanagon's design.  We find no reversible error in the district\r\ncourt's evidentiary rulings.  The remaining matter of who, under\r\nNew Hampshire law, should bear the burden in a so-called\r\n\"crashworthiness\" case, poses sophisticated questions of burden\r\nallocation involving not only a choice of appropriate precedent but\r\nalso an important policy choice.  It is a question of fairly recent\r\norigin that has divided courts across the country.  Although we do\r\nnot criticize the district court for abuse of discretion in its\r\ndecision declining to certify, we choose to exercise our own\r\ndiscretion and think it preferable to allow the state's highest\r\ncourt to choose its own path.  We therefore grant the Trulls'\r\nmotion to certify the burden of proof question to the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n                        I. Background\r\nAlthough certain particulars of the Trulls' 1991 accident\r\nare germane to issues raised on appeal, we think it more helpful to\r\nrelate them in the context of our discussions of those claims.  At\r\nthis juncture, therefore, we provide only a brief procedural\r\nhistory of the case.\r\nThe Trulls filed their lawsuit in early 1994, alleging\r\nclaims of negligence, breach of warranty and strict liability on\r\nbehalf of all four family members.  Plaintiffs had two primary\r\ntheories of recovery: (1) the Vanagon was defective because it was\r\na forward control vehicle constructed in such a way that it lacked\r\nsufficient protection against a frontal impact, and (2) the Vanagon\r\nwas defective because the rear bench seats, on which Nathaniel and\r\nBenjamin were seated, did not have shoulder safety belts as well as\r\nlap belts.\r\nIn May 1997, defendants filed an in limine motion seeking\r\nto exclude from trial certain evidence relating to the post-\r\naccident condition of the Vanagon because the vehicle had been\r\ndisposed of (\"spoliated,\" in the relevant jargon) by the Trulls'\r\ninsurance company and therefore was unavailable to be inspected by\r\nVolkswagen's experts.  In particular, David Trull, who had gone\r\nwith a friend shortly after the accident to retrieve personal items\r\nfrom the vehicle, was prepared to testify that Elizabeth's seat\r\nbelt was broken.  Other evidence indicated that Benjamin had been\r\nwearing a seat belt before the accident but was not wearing it when\r\nhe was found in the wreckage after the crash.  Volkswagen claimed\r\nthat it would be unduly prejudicial to allow testimony about the\r\npost-accident condition of the seat belts when the defendant had\r\nhad no opportunity to inspect them itself.  The district court\r\ngranted the motion to the extent that plaintiffs were barred from\r\nusing lay testimony or expert opinion about the seat belts' post-\r\naccident condition.\r\nIn December 1997, the district court granted summary\r\njudgment for the defendants on the breach of warranty claims, a\r\ndisposition that is not challenged on appeal.  In April 1998, just\r\nbefore opening statements in the trial, Elizabeth Trull withdrew\r\nher remaining claims, assertedly because of the court's exclusion\r\nof the seat-belt evidence and its determination that plaintiffs\r\nbore the burden of proving the nature of any enhanced injuries\r\ncaused by a defect in the vehicle.  Because Elizabeth was ejected\r\nfrom the Vanagon, she maintained that evidence about her broken\r\nseat belt was crucial for her to show a link between a defect and\r\nher injuries.  The defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the\r\nclaims of both Elizabeth and David Trull with prejudice, and the\r\ndistrict court granted the motion on May 4.  The trial proceeded\r\nwith Nathaniel's and Benjamin's claims.\r\nThe jury returned verdicts for the defendants on all\r\nremaining claims, and the district court denied plaintiffs' motion\r\nfor a new trial.  This appeal followed.\r\n                        II. Discussion\r\nFive of the plaintiffs' six assertions of error concern\r\nthe admission or exclusion of evidence, and the district court's\r\ndecisions in each instance are reversible only for an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. See Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198100\"><a href=\"/opinion/198100/acosta-mestre-v-hilton-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56-57 (lst Cir. 1998).  The last issue, the legal\r\ndetermination of the appropriate burden of proof in New Hampshire\r\nin a crashworthiness case, is a question of law entitled to de novo\r\nscrutiny.  We discuss first why we find no reversible error in the\r\ncourt's evidentiary decisions, addressing each in turn, before\r\nexplaining why we choose to consult the New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\non the burden of proof issue.\r\nOne procedural matter needs attention before we reach\r\nthese claims of error, however, and we therefore begin with that\r\nissue, namely, whether Elizabeth has preserved her claims for\r\nappellate review.    A. Elizabeth's Appeal.\r\nAppellees contend that Elizabeth is not properly a party\r\non appeal because the district court dismissed her claims with\r\nprejudice, and there has been no appeal of that dismissal. \r\nAppellants counter that their explicit statements withdrawing\r\nElizabeth's claims based on the court's pretrial rulings on the\r\nburden of proof and the exclusion of the broken seat-belt\r\ntestimony, together with their offer of proof on those matters,\r\nsufficed to preserve her right to appeal.\r\nBecause the spoliation issue also is raised on behalf of\r\nBenjamin's estate, and because we uphold the district court's\r\nexclusion of the seat-belt evidence, Elizabeth's status is\r\nirrelevant with respect to that claim.  The court's ruling on the\r\nburden of proof, however, which we hold in abeyance in order to\r\ncertify the issue to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, see infra at\r\n22-31, is a different matter.  If the state court disagrees with\r\nthe district court's resolution of that issue, Elizabeth would be\r\nentitled to bring her claims in a new trial only if she has\r\npreserved her appellate rights.\r\nAfter careful consideration of the record and relevant\r\nlegal principles, we conclude that she has not.  As noted above,\r\nElizabeth withdrew her claims on the morning of the first day of\r\ntrial, April 7, 1998.  Three weeks later, on April 30, as the\r\neighteen-day trial was near completion, defendants moved for\r\ndismissal of Elizabeth and David's claims with prejudice.  In an\r\neight-page memorandum in support of their motion, defendants argued\r\nthat dismissal with prejudice of Elizabeth and David's claims was\r\njustified \r\n  given the procedural irregularity and timing\r\nof Mrs. Trull's \"withdrawal,\" failure of David\r\nTrull to submit either claims or evidence, the\r\nextensive preparation that was undertaken by\r\ndefendants to try Elizabeth and David Trull's\r\nclaims, the amount of time the court has\r\ninvested in ruling on evidentiary and other\r\nmatters, the substantial rights defendants\r\nhave developed under the rulings already made\r\nby the court, and the extreme cost to\r\ndefendants and the court in holding a second\r\ntrial in this matter.\r\n\nAlthough the motion informed the court that plaintiffs objected, no\r\nopposition was filed.  The docket reports that on May 4, the court\r\norally granted defendants' motion.  On May 6, in a document\r\nentitled \"JUDGMENT,\" the district court included its May 4 grant of\r\nthe dismissal motion in a list of five dispositions, which also\r\nincluded the jury verdicts rendered on May 4.  The same list was\r\nrepeated in a June 11 document entitled \"POST-JUDGMENT JUDGMENT,\"\r\nwhich contained one additional item, the court's June 10 order\r\ndenying plaintiffs' motion for new trial.  That motion did not seek\r\nreversal of the dismissal.\r\nPlaintiffs' subsequent notice of appeal requested review\r\nof six separate orders, but it, too, made no reference to the May\r\n4 dismissal order.  So far as we can tell, therefore, the record\r\ncontains neither an objection to the dismissal filed by the\r\nplaintiffs nor a request that the court substitute a less final\r\ndisposition.  Although counsel stated when he announced withdrawal\r\nof Elizabeth's claims that he was making an offer of proof \"for\r\npurposes of appellate practice,\" we think this was not enough to\r\npreserve her claims in the face of defendants' subsequent motion to\r\ndismiss with prejudice.  That motion explicitly alerted plaintiffs\r\nto defendants' view that Elizabeth was not entitled to pursue an\r\nappeal precisely because of the way in which she had withdrawn from\r\nthe trial.\r\nFor whatever reason, plaintiffs  repeatedly sidestepped\r\nthe dismissal issue.  It was not raised in their renewed motion for\r\ncertification of the burden of proof question, their motion for new\r\ntrial, or their brief on appeal.  Although ambiguous, each document\r\nseems to presume that, if the court were to agree with plaintiffs'\r\narguments, Elizabeth's claims would be resurrected.  See, e.g.,\r\nPlaintiffs' Brief on Appeal at 16 (In argument challenging\r\nexclusion of seat-belt evidence, plaintiffs asserted that \"[t]he\r\nCourt committed reversible error when it prohibited Elizabeth Trull\r\nfrom pursuing her claims.\").  Not until their reply brief, in\r\nresponse to defendants' arguments that Elizabeth had waived her\r\nappellate rights, did plaintiffs address the dismissal order, and\r\nthen referred to it only in passing.  Their position apparently is\r\nthat, notwithstanding the dismissal, their offer of proof was\r\nsufficient in the context of this case to preserve Elizabeth's\r\nissues.\r\nWe, however, can see no basis upon which to relax the\r\nrule requiring parties to specifically designate the orders from\r\nwhich they wish to take an appeal.  See United States v. Velez\r\nCarrero, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197889\"><a href=\"/opinion/197889/united-states-v-velez-carrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (lst Cir. 1998); Fed. R. App. Pro. 3(c). \r\nPlaintiffs could not have been oblivious to the district court's\r\ndismissal of Elizabeth's claims   the court documented its order\r\ntwice, once before and once after the new trial motion.  The\r\nrequest for dismissal, three weeks after the offer of proof, and\r\nthe court's subsequent grant of that motion, represented a new\r\nstage in the proceedings on Elizabeth's claims.  If plaintiffs\r\nwished to preserve Elizabeth's claims without putting on what they\r\nbelieved would be a meritless case in light of the court's rulings\r\non spoliation and burden of proof, they could have stipulated to\r\ndismissal pending appeal or asked the court to change the dismissal\r\nto one without prejudice.  Instead, plaintiffs chose to sit idly\r\nby as the district court disposed of her claims with finality. \r\nPlaintiffs' failure to appeal the decision taking Elizabeth out of\r\nthe case   indeed, their failure to offer any substantive response\r\nto defendants' request for dismissal   is a procedural default that\r\nbars further litigation of her claims.\r\nB. Exclusion of seat-belt evidence based on the\r\ndestruction of the Vanagon (spoliation).\r\nAppellants contend that the district court erred in\r\nexcluding evidence about the post-accident condition of Elizabeth's\r\nand Benjamin's seat belts because appellants bore no responsibility\r\nfor the destruction of the Vanagon.  They argue that such a serious\r\nevidentiary sanction is reserved for instances of misconduct, in\r\nwhich evidence is knowingly destroyed in the face of contemplated\r\nlitigation, and there is serious prejudice to the other party.  The\r\nshort answer to this assertion is that our case law does not\r\nrequire bad faith or comparable bad motive.\r\n  [B]ad faith is not essential.  If such\r\nevidence is mishandled through carelessness,\r\nand the other side is prejudiced, we think\r\nthat the district court is entitled to\r\nconsider imposing sanctions, including\r\nexclusion of the evidence. . . . Although\r\ndeterrence may play a role, the primary aim is\r\nremedial, at least absent willful destruction.\r\n\nSacramona v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735327\"><a href=\"/opinion/735327/46-fed-r-evid-serv-541-prodliabrep-cch-p-14872-robert-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447, 446\r\n(lst Cir. 1997).  Fairness to the opposing party therefore plays a\r\nsubstantial role in determining the proper response to a spoliation\r\nmotion, and punishment for egregious conduct is not the sole\r\nrationale for the most severe sanction of exclusion. \r\nIn its nineteen-page ruling on spoliation, the district\r\ncourt  thoughtfully examined various factors, including prejudice\r\nand motive, in deciding whether and how to sanction plaintiffs for\r\nthe disposal of the Vanagon.  Its analysis, which we do not recount\r\nin detail, by no means reflects an abuse of discretion. The\r\ndistrict court found no suggestion of bad faith, but did opine that\r\n\"there are clear indications that the plaintiffs acted negligently\r\nin allowing the destruction of the Vanagon.\"  Order at 12. \r\nPresumably, the court was referring to the fact that David Trull\r\nfailed to prevent disposal of the car or to preserve evidence of\r\nthe seat-belt condition after he had examined the Vanagon while it\r\nwas in the insurance company's possession.  Trull had inspected the\r\nvehicle in an effort \"to figure out what had happened,\" and the\r\nthought \"cross[ed] his mind\" at the time that Volkswagen might be\r\nat fault for something.  Although Trull and his friend later\r\ndiscussed returning to photograph the seat belts, they never did.\r\nIn assessing prejudice, the court rejected the\r\nplaintiffs' arguments that defendants were not unfairly\r\ndisadvantaged because plaintiffs' experts, too, were unable to\r\nexamine the car and because the defendants were able to mount a\r\nsophisticated defense to the claims using other evidence.  The\r\nclaim that the parties were equally disadvantaged by loss of the\r\nvehicle ignores the very evidence that plaintiffs sought to\r\ninclude.  Had the district court allowed David Trull's lay\r\ntestimony concerning the condition of the seat belts, Volkswagen\r\nwould have had no basis for challenging his recollection or any\r\nexpert opinion derived from his testimony.  And while Volkswagen\r\nwas able to vigorously defend without an expert evaluation of the\r\nVanagon, the court recognized that defendants would be\r\n  forced to resort to a \"battle of the experts\"\r\narmed with a small amount of information of\r\nquestionable reliability.\r\n\nOrder at 14.   In this situation, the district court's judgment is\r\nunassailable.\r\n\nC. Exclusion of evidence of the Eurovan\r\nThe Trulls contend that the district court erred in\r\nexcluding evidence concerning the Eurovan, a Volkswagen vehicle\r\nmanufactured for sale in Europe before the time of the accident. \r\nThe Trulls sought to show that the Eurovan had been designed to\r\nsolve the problems inherent in the Vanagon, thereby demonstrating\r\nthat Volkswagen was aware that the Vanagon was unreasonably\r\ndangerous and that a feasible, affordable alternative was\r\navailable.  The district court rejected the proffered evidence as\r\nof doubtful relevance and because of \"a danger of unfair\r\nprejudice.\"\r\nThe Eurovan's significance relates to the body design of\r\nthe two vehicles.  The 1986 Vanagon owned by the Trulls was a so-\r\ncalled \"forward control vehicle,\" which had the engine in the rear\r\nand consequently did not have the usual extended front end.  The\r\nlack of a front \"crumple zone\" to protect occupants from a front-\r\nend collision was among the design defects that the Trulls alleged\r\ncontributed to their injuries.  Volkswagen, however, countered that\r\nthe Vanagon's front structure was specially designed to absorb\r\ncollision forces and protect occupants.\r\nThe Eurovan, which was introduced in the late 1980s, is\r\na front-engine vehicle and has a more traditional, longer front\r\nend.  In offering the Eurovan evidence, the plaintiffs sought to\r\nshow that it was, in essence, a \"subsequent remedial measure\" taken\r\nby Volkswagen to fix the Vanagon's defective design.  Although\r\nevidence concerning subsequent remedial measures generally is not\r\nadmissible at trial, see Fed. R. Evid. 407, measures that take\r\nplace before the accident at issue do not fall within the\r\nprohibition.  See Bogosian v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733243\"><a href=\"/opinion/733243/elizabeth-v-bogosian-v-mercedes-benz-of-north-america-inc-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481 (lst Cir. 1997); Raymond v.

The district court does have its usual\r\ndiscretion, however, to exclude the evidence under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n403 if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice.  See Bogosian, 104 F.3d at 481;\r\nRaymond, 938 F.2d at 1523-24.\r\nThe district court ultimately rejected the Eurovan\r\nevidence as unduly prejudicial in light of its doubtful probative\r\nvalue, and we again cannot fault its reasoning.  There was no\r\nquestion that an alternative design was feasible, as it was\r\nundisputed that Volkswagen knew that a more conventional, extended\r\nfront-end design was an available option at the time of the Trulls'\r\naccident.   Indeed, the jury heard ample evidence that other\r\nmanufacturers' vans had the front-end, or \"snub-nose\" design, and\r\nplaintiffs elicited testimony from their expert indicating that\r\nsuch vehicles were safer.  Moreover, plaintiffs proffered no\r\nevidence that Volkswagen specifically designed the Eurovan's front\r\nend to remedy known safety problems in the Vanagon.  In addition,\r\nthe proffered Eurovan evidence appears irrelevant to the remaining\r\nclaims in the case; the claims of the front-seat passengers, David\r\nand Elizabeth, had been withdrawn, and the boys' claims centered on\r\nthe lack of shoulder belts, not on the lack of a front crumple\r\nzone.\r\nIn these circumstances, we doubt that admission of the\r\nevidence would have been proper.  Without question, it was not an\r\nabuse of discretion to exclude it.\r\nD. Expert opinion based on Fatal Accident Reporting\r\nSystem (FARS) data\r\nPlaintiffs claim the district court erred in allowing\r\ndefendants' experts to testify about an article entitled \"Usage and\r\nEffectiveness of Rear-Seat Belt Restraints in Severe Frontal\r\nCrashes\" because the article contained unreliable and irrelevant\r\ndata and constituted hearsay. We note, initially, that the court\r\ndid not allow the article itself into evidence, but simply\r\npermitted defendants' experts   two of the article's authors   to\r\ntestify about its contents and the basis for their conclusion that\r\nlap/shoulder belts are no more effective than lap belts alone in\r\npreventing deaths.    The study described in the article was based\r\non data compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety\r\nAdministration (NHTSA) through the Fatal Accident Reporting System\r\n(FARS), and the statistics cover every fatal frontal collision\r\nreported for the period 1975 to 1995.  The FARS system was\r\nimplemented by the federal government to collect data on fatal\r\naccidents in the United States, and the information it contains is\r\ndrawn from police reports, motor vehicle registration files, vital \r\nstatistics, and state highway department records.  See Fatal\r\nAccident Reporting System 1978 Annual Report Foreward (1978).\r\nWe see no abuse of discretion in the district court's\r\ndecision to allow the experts' testimony.  Under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n803(8), data compilations of public agencies setting forth \"matters\r\nobserved pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there\r\nwas a duty to report\" are not considered hearsay.  Volkswagen\r\nreports in its brief, and appellants do not contest, that the FARS\r\ndata on which the article was based are collected and reported\r\npursuant to a legislative mandate by the NHTSA, a public agency. \r\nSee 49 U.S.C.  30168(a)(1)(A).  Additionally, the evidence appears\r\nto satisfy Fed. R. Evid. 703, which allows admission of expert\r\ntestimony based on  \"facts or data . . . of a type reasonably\r\nrelied upon by experts in the particular field.\"  See International\r\nAdhesive Coating Co. v. Bolton Emerson Int'l, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 544-45\r\n(lst Cir. 1988); see generally Seese v.

Indeed, appellants' expert, John\r\nStilson, acknowledged that the FARS data are among the appropriate\r\nsources to consult when evaluating the crashworthiness of a\r\nvehicle.  Consequently, the testimony was not excludible as\r\nhearsay.\r\nAppellants' complaint that the study was irrelevant\r\nbecause it included data gathered after the date of their accident\r\nsimilarly misfires.  A threshold question for the jury was whether\r\nthe Vanagon was defective because its rear seats were equipped only\r\nwith lap belts.  Regardless of the state of knowledge at the time\r\nVolkswagen designed and manufactured the Trulls' vehicle, the\r\ncompany could be neither negligent nor strictly liable if more\r\ncomprehensive, up-to-date information demonstrated that a seat belt\r\nsystem using only lap belts was reasonably safe.  Although\r\nstatistics focusing solely on rear lap belts in forward control\r\nvehicles would allow a more precise comparison, the unavailability\r\nof such evidence does not render improper the evidence that was\r\navailable.  The dissimilarities went to the weight of the evidence\r\nand were a proper subject for cross-examination. See International\r\nAdhesive Coating Co., 851 F.2d at 544.  In sum, we find no\r\nreversible error in the admission of this expert testimony.\r\nE. Evidence from prior lawsuit\r\nPlaintiffs contend that the district court erred in\r\nallowing into evidence a diagram depicting the paths of the Vanagon\r\nand the other car involved in the crash, an AMC Concord.  The\r\nTrulls had relied on the diagram, which showed the vehicles\r\ncolliding at a 90-degree angle, in an earlier state court lawsuit\r\nthey filed against the State of New Hampshire for failure to remedy\r\nthe icy road conditions.  The Trulls had introduced the diagram as\r\nan exhibit through the testimony of Sgt. Leon Shackley, the officer\r\nin charge of the accident investigation for the Conway Police\r\nDepartment.\r\nIn the present lawsuit, the Trulls maintained that their\r\naccident involved a nearly straight, head-on collision, while\r\nVolkswagen attempted to show that the accident was a side impact,\r\nwith the front end of the Concord contacting the passenger side of\r\nthe Vanagon at an angle of about 55 degrees.  The angle of impact\r\nwas significant in the Volkswagen case because the Trulls' claims\r\nfocused on the Vanagon's lack of a \"front crumple zone\" and the\r\nabsence of shoulder belts to prevent the boys from surging forward\r\nin the back seat of the car.\r\nWhen Shackley was called as a witness by the Trulls in\r\nthis case, Volkswagen sought on cross-examination to show that the\r\nTrulls had changed their position about the angle of the collision\r\nand that -- the point of significance -- their original view\r\nmatched Volkswagen's. The Trulls objected on various grounds to\r\nadmission of the diagram, including that the document did not\r\nqualify as a prior inconsistent statement and that its admission\r\nwould improperly bring evidence of another lawsuit into the case. \r\nThe district court permitted Volkswagen to introduce the diagram\r\nduring cross-examination of Shackley, but barred Volkswagen from\r\nidentifying the defendant or referring to the claims at issue.  The\r\nexchange was brief, and went as follows:\r\n  Q. Sergeant, in another lawsuit brought by the\r\nTrulls, you were called as a witness in the\r\ntrial of that case; right?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\n  Q. Do you recall that in that case the Trulls,\r\nthrough their lawyer, introduced this diagram \r\n. . . as a description of the paths of the\r\nvehicles in the accident?\r\n\n  A. I don't specifically recall it.  It was\r\nover a year ago or almost a year ago when that\r\none went.\r\n\nVolkswagen's attorney then showed Shackley the transcript from the\r\nearlier proceeding.\r\n  Q. Do you see the question from the Trulls'\r\ncounsel to you?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\n  Q. And the question   the sense of the\r\nquestion was whether that diagram was an\r\naccurate portrayal of how the vehicles\r\ntraveled in this accident; correct?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\n  Q. And then the Trulls lawyer asked that that \r\nbe admitted as evidence; correct?\r\n\n  A. Yes.\r\n\nAt that point, the district court gave the following limiting\r\ninstruction:\r\n  Members of the jury, I'm going to instruct you\r\nat this time that the mere fact that another\r\nlawsuit may have been brought by the Trulls is\r\nnot a matter which you should in any way\r\nconsider in deciding this case.  The mere fact\r\nof that lawsuit is not material and relevant\r\nto the decisions that you have to make in this\r\ncase.  However, to the extent that you find in\r\nany evidence presented to you any positions\r\ntaken consistent or inconsistent with claims\r\nmade in this case, then you may weigh and\r\nconsider that evidence along with all the\r\nother evidence in this case.  But the mere\r\nfact of that lawsuit is something that you\r\nshould disregard in your deliberations.\r\n\nSubsequent to this testimony, Volkswagen sought to re-\r\ncall David Trull for questioning about the diagram and about a\r\nrelated statement made by the Trulls' attorney in the earlier\r\ntrial.  The statement was made during a bench conference, as that\r\nattorney, Randall Cooper, advocated admission of a photograph of\r\nthe accident scene.  He stated that the photograph \"certainly\r\ndemonstrates that the reconstruction by the Police Department is\r\naccurate in showing how the vehicle slid, and there was a side-to-\r\nfront impact.\"  Before finally deciding whether to allow Trull to\r\nbe re-called, the district court conducted voir dire questioning of\r\nTrull and Cooper.  They both emphasized that the angle of the\r\naccident was not at issue in the earlier trial and that the diagram\r\nand statement by Cooper consequently were of little weight and\r\nshould not be deemed an inconsistent position.\r\nThe district court declined to allow the questioning of\r\nTrull.  On appeal, plaintiffs repeat their objections to the\r\nintroduction of the diagram and assert that its admission\r\nconstituted prejudicial, reversible error.\r\nThis issue strikes us as a classic example of the value\r\nof leaving matters of evidence to the discretion of the district\r\ncourt.  Unquestionably, the Trulls in the earlier trial put forward\r\nas accurate the diagram from which they now wish to distance\r\nthemselves, and it is a matter of record that their attorney\r\ndescribed the accident as a \"side-to-front impact.\"   With only\r\nthat much before us, we have simply a prior factual claim\r\ncontradictory to a factual position taken in this case by the same\r\nparty, and thus a presumptively admissible statement against\r\ninterest.

With the limited scope of\r\nquestioning permitted by the court and the curative instruction, we\r\ncannot say the district judge abused his discretion in admitting\r\nthe diagram during the Shackley cross-examination.  Through their\r\nown questioning, the Trulls had the opportunity to diminish the\r\nforce of the diagram by eliciting that it was not drawn with\r\ntechnical precision and that Shackley no longer considered it to be\r\naccurate.\r\nIn addition, the court limited the impact of the diagram\r\nby rejecting Volkswagen's request to question David Trull about it.\r\nThe court's decisions reflect the give-and-take of a trial, and the\r\ncareful consideration that a judge is obliged to give to the\r\nparties' competing positions.   Although the voir dire questioning\r\nof Trull and his attorney, which occurred after admission of the\r\ndiagram, suggested that the inconsistency may have resulted more\r\nfrom inattentiveness than deliberate strategy, this softer view of\r\nthe contradiction did not retroactively make erroneous or\r\nprejudicial the diagram's admission.  The district court\r\nconsistently dealt with this issue thoughtfully and with respect\r\nfor each party's position.  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nF. Exclusion of correspondence.  Plaintiffs sought\r\nadmission into evidence of more than a dozen letters written\r\nbetween Volkswagen and two government agencies, the National\r\nTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the NHTSA.  The\r\ncorrespondence related primarily to Volkswagen's knowledge of the\r\nadded protective benefits provided to rear seat occupants by \r\nshoulder belts.  We decline to dwell on this issue.  The district\r\ncourt allowed plaintiffs to introduce a sampling of the letters,\r\nconcluding that the remainder were cumulative and that their\r\nadmission and the resulting testimony would be unduly confusing for\r\nthe jury.  Plaintiffs' brief fails to identify crucial, non-\r\ncumulative information that was omitted as a result of the court's\r\nselective admissions.  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nG. Certification of Burden of Proof\r\nThe crashworthiness/enhanced injury theory of liability \r\nunder which the Trulls brought their claims arises in automobile\r\naccident cases when plaintiffs claim that a defect in their vehicle \r\ncaused them to suffer greater injuries than would have occurred had\r\nthe vehicle been properly designed.

In such cases, the\r\nplaintiffs seek to recover damages from the car manufacturer for at\r\nleast a portion of their injuries.\r\nWhether the plaintiff or the defendant bears the burden\r\nof segregating the injuries attributable to the vehicle's defect is\r\na question that has divided the courts that have considered it.  \r\nSee Polston v.

Both\r\npositions appear to have ample justification, and a given state's\r\nstance is not easily predicted.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\nhas not yet faced the issue, and the Trulls therefore moved for\r\ncertification in the district court.  That court declined to\r\ncertify, finding that New Hampshire law was adequately revealing\r\nand that it required the burden to be placed on the plaintiffs. \r\nThe Trulls have renewed their request for certification on appeal.\r\nWe are not persuaded that New Hampshire's approach to\r\nthis issue can be discerned from review of the state's existing\r\ntort law cases.  Because of the sharp division in the courts that\r\nhave addressed the issue, and the policy concerns that underlay the\r\ndecision, we have chosen to consult the New Hampshire Supreme Court\r\nthrough certification.

The\r\nlatter two elements are, of course, corollaries, both in essence\r\nrequiring the plaintiff to sort out which injuries would not have\r\noccurred, and which injuries (including additional ones) would have\r\noccurred, had there been no defect.\r\nVolkswagen argues that this approach is conceptually\r\nclear and consistent with basic tort principles.  It asserts in its\r\nbrief that, \"because in a crashworthiness case plaintiff's\r\nessential claim is that the design defect caused the plaintiff to\r\nsuffer injuries he would not have received but for a defect in the\r\nvehicle's design, the existence and extent of these more severe or\r\n`enhanced' injuries are an essential element of the plaintiff's own\r\ntheory of recovery for which the plaintiff bears the burden of\r\nproof.\"  See Caiazzo, 647 F.2d at 251.\r\nThe company further argues that this approach reflects\r\nNew Hampshire's approach to tort law, which is premised on \"the\r\nfundamental tenet . . . that the plaintiff retains the ultimate\r\nburden of persuasion in negligence actions,\" Pillsbury-Flood v.\r\nPortsmouth Hospital, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1129 (N.H. 1986), and which, in\r\nthe context of a suit for aggravation of pre-existing injuries,\r\nplaces the burden of proving the extent of aggravation on the\r\nplaintiff, see Valliere v.

Volkswagenwerk, A.G., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399138\"><a href=\"/opinion/399138/john-c-mitchell-and-charles-e-mitchell-v-volkswagenwerk-ag-a-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1206-1208 (8th Cir. 1982) (Minnesota law), requires a\r\nplaintiff to prove only that the design defect was a \"substantial\r\nfactor in producing damages over and above those which were\r\nprobably caused as a result of the original impact or collision,\"\r\nsee Mitchell, 669 F.2d at 1206.  Once the plaintiff makes that\r\nshowing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show which injuries\r\nwere attributable to the initial collision and which to the defect. \r\nUnder this line of cases, a manufacturer who fails to make such an\r\nallocation is held liable for all of the plaintiff's injury.  Thus,\r\nin cases where the injury is \"indivisible\"   such as, for example,\r\ncertain instances of paraplegia or death   manufacturers are\r\ntreated as joint tortfeasors for all injuries.  See id.\r\nThe Mitchell and Fox courts also claim a traditional tort\r\nlaw heritage for their approach.  In explicitly rejecting the\r\nHuddell-Caiazzo allocation of the burden, the court in Fox noted\r\n\"the orthodox doctrines of joint liability of concurrent tort-\r\nfeasors for injuries which flow from their concurring in one\r\nimpact,\" 575 F.2d at 787.  Under this doctrine, the Mitchell court\r\npointed out, wrongdoers who each play a substantial role in\r\ncreating an indivisible harm are treated as joint and several\r\ntortfeasors.  See 669 F.2d at 1207.  According to the Mitchell\r\ncourt, use of the Huddell-Caiazzo model in enhanced injury cases\r\ninvolving an indivisible injury departs from this well established\r\napproach and \"will generally result in complete exoneration of the\r\nnegligent manufacturer.\"  Id. at 1207-08.  The court observed:\r\n    By placing the burden of proof on a\r\nplaintiff to prove that the designer was the\r\nsole cause of not only an enhanced indivisible\r\ninjury, but, in addition, that he would not\r\notherwise have received injuries absent a\r\ndefect, the injured victim is relegated to an \r\nalmost hopeless state of never being able to\r\nsucceed against a defective designer.  The\r\npublic interest is little served. . . . A rule\r\nof law which requires a plaintiff to prove\r\nwhat portion of indivisible harm was caused by\r\neach party and what might have happened in\r\nlieu of what did happen requires obvious\r\nspeculation and proof of the impossible.  This\r\napproach converts the common law rules\r\ngoverning principles of legal causation into a\r\nmorass of confusion and uncertainty.\r\n\nId. at 1204-05.\r\n\nThe Fox-Mitchell construct thus was designed to ensure\r\nthat plaintiffs whose injuries were in part traceable to a design\r\ndefect would be able to recover from the manufacturer, even when\r\nthey could not prove precisely how the defect made their injuries \r\nmore severe.  Using the joint tortfeasor setting as a model, this\r\napproach \"is a result of a choice made as to where a loss due to\r\nfailure of proof shall fall   on an innocent plaintiff or on\r\ndefendants who are clearly proved to have been at fault,\" see\r\nMitchell, 669 F.2d at 1208 (quoting Mathews v. Mills, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1939771\"><a href=\"/opinion/1939771/mathews-v-mills/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845 (Minn. 1970)).\r\nAlthough Volkswagen emphasizes that the New Hampshire\r\nSupreme Court explicitly has rejected burden-shifting for the\r\npurpose of assisting plaintiffs, the primary case it cites\r\naddresses a plaintiff's argument that the burden of negating\r\ncausation should have been shifted to the defendants.  See\r\nPillsbury-Flood, 512 A.2d at 1128.  The Fox-Mitchell approach does\r\nnot relieve a plaintiff of the threshold obligation of proving\r\ncausation, and thus liability; it is only after a plaintiff has\r\ndemonstrated that the design defect was a \"substantial factor\" in\r\nproducing damages over and above those that otherwise would have\r\noccurred that the burden shifts to the defendant to apportion\r\ndamages.  Indeed, in rejecting the burden-shifting proposed by the\r\nplaintiff in Pillsbury-Flood, the New Hampshire court noted that\r\nits rule \r\n  ensures that defendants will not have to\r\ndefend against improbable claims, and that\r\ndefendants will not have to disprove the\r\nelement of causation.  Proving a negative\r\nposes practical and theoretical problems that\r\nshould not be placed on defendants.\r\n\n512 A.2d at 1129-30.  A very similar rationale motivated the\r\nMitchell court, which concluded that plaintiffs who have proven\r\ncausation should not be faced with the \"impossible burden of\r\nproving a negative fact,\" 669 F.2d at 1204-05.  In our view, the\r\ndifference between shifting the initial burden of causation and\r\nshifting the burden of allocating damages is sufficiently\r\nsignificant that the result in Pillsbury-Flood does not necessarily\r\nlead to the Huddell-Caiazzo approach.\r\nIn sum, we think that the burden of proof that the New\r\nHampshire Supreme Court would choose for a crashworthiness case is\r\nnot readily apparent from existing case law and is quintessentially\r\na policy judgment appropriately made for the state by its own\r\ncourts.  The applicable burden of proof unquestionably may have\r\nbeen determinative of the jury's verdict.  The court instructed the\r\njury that, to establish Volkswagen's liability, the plaintiffs had\r\nto prove, along with causation, \"the nature and extent of the\r\ninjuries that were enhanced.\"  If the Fox-Mitchell approach were\r\nthe appropriate standard, the plaintiffs would have met their\r\nburden to establish liability simply by showing that a defect in\r\nthe vehicle was a \"substantial factor\" in producing damages over\r\nand above those that otherwise would have occurred.  The burden of\r\napportioning damages would have fallen on Volkswagen.  We therefore\r\ncertify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, pursuant to its Rule\r\n34, the question set forth in the attached certificate.\r\n                       III. Conclusion\r\nFor these reasons, we affirm the various evidentiary\r\nrulings by the district court and certify the question of the\r\nappropriate burden of proof to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  We\r\nretain jurisdiction pending that court's determination.\r\n\n                        CERTIFICATION\r\nFor the reasons discussed in our opinion, the following\r\nquestion is respectfully certified to the Supreme Court of New\r\nHampshire, pursuant to its Rule 34:\r\n  Under New Hampshire law, in a crashworthiness\r\nor enhanced injury case, does the plaintiff\r\nbear the burden of demonstrating the specific\r\nnature and extent of the injuries attributable\r\nto the manufacturer, or does the burden of\r\napportionment fall on the defendant once the\r\nplaintiff has proved causation?\r\n\nIn asking only this question, we do not intend to limit the scope\r\nof the court's response. We welcome discussion of any relevant New\r\nHampshire law that the Supreme Court deems appropriate.\r\nThe clerk of this court will transmit our certification,\r\nalong with copies of the briefs and the record appendix in this\r\ncase, to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  We shall await its reply\r\nwith interest and appreciation.\r\nIt is so ordered.  \n</pre>",
