Civil Rights Claims\r                                       \r\n\n     For the reasons stated  by the district court, we  agree\r\n\nthat  under Wright  v.  Park,  5 F.3d  587  (1st Cir.  1993),\r                                        \r\n\nQuinonez's    civil   rights    claims   for    damages   are\r\n\nnonjusticiable.   Quinonez argues  on appeal that  Chapell v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWallace, 462 U.S.  296 (1983) and  United States v.

We specifically rejected\r\n\nan  identical  argument  in  Wright,  where  we held  that  a\r                                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nNational Guard  technician's civilian and military  roles are\r\n\n\"inextricably intertwined.\"  Wright, 5 F.3d at 589.\r                                               \r\n\n     Quinonez contends  that  even if  Wright  precludes  his\r                                                         \r\n\ndamages  claims, the district  court erred in  dismissing his\r\n\nclaims for injunctive relief.  Because Wright did not involve\r                                                         \r\n\na claim for  injunctive relief, this court has  not yet ruled\r\n\non  whether Chappell and  Stanley bar  such relief.   Several\r                                             \r\n\nother circuits  have ruled that there is no injunctive relief\r\n\nexception to Chappell, however.  See Knutson v. Wisconsin Air\r                                                                         \r\n\nNational Guard, 995 F.2d 765,  771 (7th Cir. 1993); Watson v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nArkansas National Guard, 886 F.2d 1004, 1009 (8th Cir. 1989);\r                                   \r\n\nCrawford v.

With  only\r\n\nrare   exceptions,  the  courts  have  taken  the  view  that\r\n\nassignments within the  military structure are matters  to be\r\n\ndecided by the military and not  by the courts. . . .   [T]he\r\n\nunderlying  notion is that  matters of military organization,\r\n\npersonnel  and operations  are  extremely sensitive  and that\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncourts will do more harm  than good by interfering.\"  Tirado-\r                                                                         \r\n\nAcosta v. Puerto Rico National  Guard, 118 F.3d 852, 855 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1997).   As a  result, we  decline to  entertain claims\r\n\nseeking  reinstatement as a form of injunctive relief because\r\n\nsuch a remedy  would \"intrude on a province  committed to the\r\n\nmilitary's discretion.\"  Knutson, 995 F.2d at 771.\r                                            \r\n\n     Appellants  argue  that  we  should  take  the  approach\r\n\nfollowed in Penagaricano v. Llenza, 747 F.2d 55, 59 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1984), which was overruled in part by Wright, 5 F.3d  at 591.\r                                                        \r\n\nEven  were we to  do so, the  result would be the  same.  The\r\n\ncivil  rights claims that  we dismissed as  nonjusticiable in\r\n\nPenagaricano,  including  a  claim  for  reinstatement,  were\r                        \r\n\nstrikingly  similar to  Quinonez's claims.    Mindful of  the\r\n\nconcerns  expressed  in  Chappell,  this  court  applied  the\r                                             \r\n\nanalysis set  forth in  Mindes v. Seaman,  453 F.2d  197 (5th\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1971), weighing the last two Mindes factors heavily, and\r                                                    \r\n\nconcluded   that   Penagaricano's    claims   constituted   a\r\n\nnonjusticiable military controversy.   Penagaricano, 747 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat  64.   We would  do  the same  in this  case.   Therefore,\r\n\nwhether  judged under  Wright or  Penagaricano,  the district\r                                                          \r\n\ncourt's dismissal  of Quinonez's claim for  injunctive relief\r\n\nwas correct.\r\n\n     II. Title VII Claim\r                                    \r\n\n     Quinonez appeals from the district court's  dismissal of\r\n\nhis Title VII  claims.  Title VII prohibits  an employer from\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndiscriminating  against   any  individual  because   of  that\r\n\nperson's \"race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\"  42\r\n\nU.S.C.   2000e-2(a).    Quinonez's   complaint  alleges  that\r\n\ndefendants discriminated against  him because of his  age and\r\n\npolitical  beliefs.   Therefore, Quinonez  has  not stated  a\r\n\nclaim for relief under Title VII.\r\n\n     Even  if Quinonez had relied upon the Age Discrimination\r\n\nin Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C.   621 et seq., he would\r\n\nnot be entitled to relief.  See Johnson v. State of New York,\r                                                                        \r\n\n49 F.3d 75,  78 (2d Cir. 1995)  (conduct of the  Air National\r\n\nGuard \"is beyond  the reach of the  ADEA\"); Frey v. State  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCalifornia, 982 F.2d 399, 404 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"Congress  did\r                      \r\n\nnot intend to extend the protections of Title VII or the ADEA\r\n\nto members of the state National Guard\"); Costner v. Oklahoma\r                                                                         \r\n\nArmy National Guard,  833 F.2d 905,  907-08 (10th Cir.  1987)\r                               \r\n\n(ADEA   claim  by  member  of  National  Guard  and  civilian\r\n\ntechnician  was nonreviewable under Mindes); Helm v. State of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCalifornia, 722 F.2d 507, 509  (9th Cir. 1983) (ADEA does not\r                      \r\n\napply to military reservists).  Therefore, the district court\r\n\ncorrectly ruled  that Quinonez  failed to  state a  statutory\r\n\nclaim of employment discrimination under federal law.\r\n\n     The  district court  judgment dismissing  with prejudice\r\n\nappellants'  federal   law  claims  and   dismissing  without\r\n\nprejudice the Puerto Rico law  claims, is affirmed.
