For a second time this\n\ncase comes to us on appeal.         See Ferrara & DiMercurio v. St.\n\nPaul Mercury Ins. Co., 169 F.3d 43 (1st Cir. 1999)(hereinafter\n\nFerrara I).     The facts have not changed.\n\n                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\n             On July 3, 1993, the commercial fishing vessel F/V TWO\n\nFRIENDS was destroyed by a fire.         Plaintiff-Appellant Ferrara &\n\nDiMercurio (“F&D”), owner of the vessel, sought to recover\n\ninsurance under a Hull Policy issued by defendant-appellee St.\n\nPaul Mercury Insurance Company (“St. Paul”).            St. Paul denied\n\ncoverage after its investigation ended with a determination of\n\narson, which it understood to be excluded from coverage under\n\nthe policy. Thereafter, F&D brought an action in the district\n\ncourt claiming that St. Paul’s refusal to pay was a breach of\n\nthe insurance contract and constituted “bad faith” in violation\n\nof Massachusetts General Laws ch. 93A.              After a first trial\n\nended in a hung jury, a second trial ended with the court\n\ndirecting a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n             At the time the district court directed a plaintiff’s\n\nverdict, the court accepted that St. Paul would not be liable\n\ncould   it   prove   its   affirmative    defense   that   the   fire   was\n\ndeliberately set by the insured.         But the court ruled that the\n\nevidence put forward was legally insufficient for a jury to find\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthat plaintiff had deliberately set its boat on fire.                    St. Paul\n\nhad also asserted that it would be exempt from liability were\n\nthe fire found to have been deliberately set by an unknown third\n\nparty, relying upon the language of an exclusion for “malicious\n\nacts”   found     in    the    so-called      Strikes,      Riots,     and   Civil\n\nCommotions (“SR&CC”) clause.            However, the court construed that\n\nprovision    as     excluding         from    coverage      only   those     fires\n\ndeliberately      set   by    third    parties   in   the    context    of   civil\n\nunrest, a setting absent here.\n\n            On appeal, this court disagreed with the district\n\ncourt’s rulings, reversing and remanding the case for a third\n\ntrial. We held that the SR&CC clause excluded from coverage all\n\nfires (whether or not arising in the context of civil unrest)\n\nthat were deliberately set by third parties.                See Ferrara I, 169\n\nF.3d at 53.       Notwithstanding the clause’s title -- “strikes,\n\nriots and civil commotions” -- we stated:\n\n            “Malicious acts” is set forth in the SR&CC\n            clause as a separate, unmodified exclusion\n            from coverage....[N]othing in the plain\n            language and grammar of the clause supports\n            the   district   court’s   constriction   of\n            excludable “malicious acts” to only those\n            acts perpetrated within the context of one\n            or more of the other co-listed events. Nor,\n            in our view, would an objectively reasonable\n            insured interpret the “malicious acts”\n            exclusion so narrowly.\n\n                       ....\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f                  ...Hence,   to  limit   the   phrase,\n           “malicious acts,” to just those activities\n           related to the former categories would be to\n           render   the  “malicious   acts”   provision\n           redundant, an interpretation running counter\n           to the customary assumption that all words\n           within a clause serve some purpose....\n\n                  Here, the malicious acts in question\n           are arson -- and not, as a practical matter,\n           arson by the owner or its agents, which are\n           actions separately excluded from coverage by\n           law, but the rarer acts of fire-setting by\n           vandals or other malicious individuals.\n           Such acts fall within the general category\n           of intentional third-party violence which\n           can be said to be a principal overall theme\n           of the SR&CC clause. The “malicious acts”\n           category serves the relevant purpose of\n           excluding destructive acts not public or\n           tumultuous enough to be considered a riot or\n           civil commotion. In sum, the SR&CC clause\n           unambiguously excludes from coverage losses\n           caused by “malicious acts,” including arson,\n           whether or not the malicious acts occur in\n           the context of one or more of the other\n           events listed in the SR&CC clause. Thus, on\n           remand, the jury should be permitted to\n           determine whether the fire on July 3, 1993,\n           was deliberately set by third parties.\n           Should the jury answer that question in the\n           affirmative, St. Paul would not be liable\n           under the Hull Policy.\n\nId. at 51-53 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Having reversed the district court’s holding that arson\n\nby a third party was only a defense when occurring during civil\n\nunrest, this court also reversed the district court’s other\n\nconclusion that the evidence at trial was legally insufficient\n\nto   support   the   insurer’s   arson-by-the-insured   defense.   We\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdetermined that evidence in the record of motive and opportunity\n\non the part of F&D to commit arson was such that “reasonable\n\njurors could determine that [plaintiff] deliberately set fire to\n\nthe TWO FRIENDS in order to fraudulently obtain the proceeds of\n\nthe insurance policy.”       Id. at 56.\n\n            The parties returned to district court to prepare for\n\na   third   trial,   this   time   before     yet    a   third   judge,   Judge\n\nHarrington.      Based upon their mutual understanding of this\n\ncourt’s decision in Fer r a r a I, both parties agreed that the\n\nfollowing single question would be submitted to the jury to be\n\nanswered “Yes” or “No”: “Do you find that the defendant, St.\n\nPaul   Mercury       Insurance     Company,     has      established      by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the fire was of an incendiary\n\nnature or deliberately set?”.              This question was apparently\n\nmeant to incorporate both holdings of Ferrara I, entitling St.\n\nPaul to the defense of arson by third parties as well as to the\n\ndefense of arson-by-the-insured.           The jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of defendant St. Paul, answering “Yes” to the special\n\nverdict.    F&D appeals.\n\n            Unlike in Ferrara I, when we were faced with, among\n\nother issues, the task of construing somewhat unusual language\n\nin the insurance policy, this time the issues presented are more\n\ncommonplace.      F&D   claims     reversible       error   on   the   basis   of\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcertain evidentiary rulings, any one of which, F&D argues,\n\nentitles it to a fourth trial.                     We disagree.    F&D also appeals\n\nfrom       the   district      court’s     denial     of    plaintiff’s    post-trial\n\nmotion for sanctions.               For the reasons that follow, we affirm\n\nall of the rulings below.\n\n\n\n                  II.      LEGAL ANALYSES OF EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\n\n                 Having recited the facts in our first opinion, we need\n\nnot repeat all of them here.                  For a more complete account, we\n\nrefer the reader to Ferrara I, 169 F.3d at 45-49.                          We report\n\nhere only those facts that are relevant to the three evidentiary\n\nissues raised on this appeal.                 The three evidentiary issues are\n\nas follows1: (A) the propriety of allowing the jury to hear\n\nevidence         of   the    principal     shareholders’       alleged    motive    and\n\nopportunity           to    burn   their     own    boat;   (B)   the   propriety    of\n\nadmitting into evidence against F&D the expert testimony of John\n\nMalcolm regarding the cause and origin of the fire; (C) the\n\neffectiveness of the district court’s curative instruction to\n\nthe jury to strike and disregard an answer provided on cross-\n\nexamination           by    John   Malcolm    regarding      information    that    was\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       We state and decide the remaining two issues,                               non-\nevidentiary and less fact-specific, in Part III infra.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fsubject to a protective order.          We discuss each of these issues\n\nin turn below.\n\nA. Motive and Opportunity Evidence to Burn the F/V TWO FRIENDS\n\n           Prior   to    trial,   the   district        court    engaged   in    an\n\nextended colloquy with both parties over the relevance and\n\npotential prejudice of defendant’s proffer to present evidence\n\nof F&D’s financial hardship, a proffer, defendant argued, that\n\nwould tend to prove that F&D had a motive, in addition to the\n\nopportunity, to burn their boat, the F/V TWO FRIENDS.                 Plaintiff\n\nobjected to this evidence on the ground that it was irrelevant.\n\nAll parties having agreed that the sole question put to the jury\n\nwould be “Do you find that the defendant, St. Paul Mercury\n\nInsurance Company, has established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence   that    the     fire   was   of    an      incendiary     nature      or\n\ndeliberately      set?”,    plaintiff        sought      to     persuade   Judge\n\nHarrington that evidence of either motive or opportunity to\n\ncommit arson would be irrelevant to a determination of the\n\nultimate issue.     Then, as now, plaintiff argued that evidence of\n\nmotive and opportunity to start a fire aboard the F/V TWO\n\nFRIENDS was irrelevant to the only explicit question to be\n\nanswered by the fact-finders: whether or not the fire aboard the\n\nF/V TWO FRIENDS was intentional.             As an alternative, plaintiff\n\nargued   that   the     prejudicial     effect     of    evidence     that      F&D\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fshareholders had a motive and opportunity to burn their boat\n\nsubstantially outweighed its probative value.\n\n            At various times during the pre-trial conference, Judge\n\nHarrington    pressed           plaintiff’s       counsel      for     a   persuasive\n\nexplanation     of why evidence of motive and opportunity was\n\nirrelevant to the ultimate issue of incendiarism.                          Like Judge\n\nHarrington,     we        are     puzzled        by     plaintiff’s        constricted\n\ninterpretation       of    relevance       as    defined      by    Federal    Rule   of\n\nEvidence 401.    Consider the evidence that ultimately came out at\n\nthe trial:\n\n            The F/V TWO FRIENDS was locked at the time the fire\n\nstarted.    No sign of forced entry into the vessel was found.                         As\n\nboth parties’ experts agreed that the fire began inside the\n\nvessel, St. Paul was faced with the obstacle of explaining, in\n\norder to establish that the fire was deliberately set, how an\n\narsonist (be it the insured or a third party) gained access to\n\nthe vessel.     This goes to opportunity.\n\n            As it turned out, there were four keys to the F/V TWO\n\nFRIENDS,    three    in    the     hands    of    the    insured-owners        and    one\n\nhanging in a warehouse adjacent to where the boat was moored.\n\nThe undisputed testimony was that all four keys were in their\n\nexpected places shortly after the fire.                            The owner of the\n\nwarehouse    testified          that   access     to    the   key    hanging    in    the\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fwarehouse was not closely guarded, however, and that it was\n\npossible that before July 3, 1993, somebody could have illicitly\n\ntaken the key from the warehouse and made a copy of it.         No\n\nevidence was put before the jury of anyone being seen near the\n\nboat between the hours of 4:30 p.m on July 2, 1993, when Leo\n\nFerrara locked the boat after a fishing trip, and 2:30 a.m. the\n\nfollowing morning, when the Gloucester Fire Department responded\n\nto the fire.2   After a lengthy investigation that led St. Paul’s\n\ninvestigators to the conclusion that, due to the burn patterns\n\ninside the vessel, the fire had been deliberately set, St. Paul\n\nset out to investigate why someone who   might have access to the\n\nTWO FRIENDS would wish to destroy it.    This goes to motive.\n\n          Evidence was presented that the plaintiff company F&D,\n\nalong with its principle shareholders    (various members of the\n\nFerrara-DiMercurio family), was in dire financial trouble.      The\n\n\n     2 Although not placed before the jury, through initial\ndiscovery both parties learned that a Gloucester police officer\nhad information based on an anonymous source that someone was\nseen fleeing the scene of the fire and that the fire had been\ndeliberately set.    When the police officer refused to reveal\nhis source, the district judge who presided over the first trial\n(Judge Tauro) ordered that no evidence of this anonymous tip was\nto be admitted in the trial. No jury ever heard anything about\nthis anonymous informant.     The jury in the third trial did\nlearn, however, through an answer of one of St. Paul’s experts\nunder cross-examination, that a protective order was in place as\nto certain subjects relevant to the initial investigation of the\ncause of the fire.     Whether what the jury heard as to the\nprotective order poisoned the trial for the plaintiff is the\nsubject of Part II.C. infra.\n\n                               -10-\n\fcompany, organized as a commercial fishing venture in 1987, was\n\nlosing money and was unable to meet its mortgage payments on the\n\nvessel to Gloucester Bank & Trust Company.              In fact, F&D had\n\noperated at a loss since its inception.           As the company fell\n\nfurther behind in its payments, the bank threatened to foreclose\n\nnot only on the boat mortgage, but on the collateral that was\n\npledged on the loan for the F/V TWO FRIENDS, such as the\n\npersonal homes of the individual shareholders.\n\n            Despite   successfully      negotiating   various   repayment\n\nplans, F&D continued to have difficulties making timely payments\n\nto the bank.     So, in April 1993, in an effort to quell those\n\nfinancial troubles, F&D and Gloucester Bank & Trust Company\n\nagreed that F&D would attempt to sell the TWO FRIENDS for\n\n$225,000, a sum that was $150,000 less than the price F&D paid\n\nfor   the   vessel    in   1987   and   significantly    less   than   the\n\noutstanding balance of the debts owing, which totaled more than\n\n$425,000.    The jury heard testimony that the boat was insured\n\nfor $350,000 under a Hull Policy issued to F&D in 1992 by St.\n\nPaul, a sum which if collected by F&D might have protected the\n\nhomes of the Ferraras and DiMercurios from foreclosure.\n\n            The standard for admissibility under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 401 is a liberal one.          Evidence is relevant if it has\n\n“any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or\n\nless probable than it would be without that evidence.”                              We think\n\nthe    existence           of   a   motive     and    an   opportunity       to     burn    an\n\nundisputedly locked boat from the inside-out tends to make the\n\ndisputed issue -- whether the fire aboard the F/V TWO FRIENDS\n\nwas an act of arson -- more probable, especially in light of the\n\nconflicting expert testimony as to incendiarism.                            See Part II.B\n\ninfra.       Given especially the nisi prius court’s superior vantage\n\npoint for discerning relevance and the broad discretion accorded\n\nto it in doing so, see, e.g., United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d\n\n382,       387   (1st      Cir.     1985),   we      can   find    no    error    in   Judge\n\nHarrington’s determination of relevance.\n\n                 Unpersuaded, as are we, by plaintiff’s argument under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 401, Judge Harrington pushed plaintiff to move\n\nforward,         on   to    the     balancing     required        by    Federal     Rule    of\n\nEvidence 403.3              “As with Rule 401, the district courts have\n\nconsiderable discretion in calibrating the Rule 403 scales.”\n\nUnited States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 101 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nThis       is     primarily          because      “Rule      403        balancing      is    a\n\n\n\n       3\n       Federal Rule of Evidence 403 directs district courts to\nexclude evidence “if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\ndelay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\nevidence.”\n\n                                             -12-\n\fquintessentially fact-sensitive enterprise and the trial judge\n\nis in the best position to make such factbound assessments.”\n\nUdemba v. Nicoli, ___ F.3d ___,___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 00-1246,\n\nslip.   op.    at     12].     “Only    rarely   –   and    in   extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances – will we, from the vista of a cold\n\nappellate      record,       reverse    a    district      court’s   on-the-spot\n\njudgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and\n\nunfair effect.”         Id. (citing Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865\n\nF.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n              After a lengthy discussion, Judge Harrington took the\n\nmatter of Rule 403 balancing under advisement.                   Two weeks later,\n\non the first day of trial but before jury empaneling began,\n\nJudge Harrington informed counsel that he would allow defendant\n\nto proffer evidence of motive and opportunity as he determined\n\nthat “such evidence’s probative value outweighs any prejudice to\n\nthe plaintiff.”\n\n              Plaintiff’s arguments to the contrary, it is not the\n\ncase that Judge Harrington’s decision was arbitrary or unfounded\n\nor that he failed to provide a reasoned decision for admitting\n\nthe evidence despite its prejudicial effect.                  See Brief for the\n\nAppellants at 29.            The pre-trial colloquy during which the\n\ndistrict      court    explained       its   difficulties     with   plaintiff’s\n\nposition provides ample support for the district court’s ruling\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fallowing     defendant      to    put     before     the     jury           evidence       of\n\nplaintiff’s motive and opportunity to burn its own boat.                                  The\n\nmatter of the admissibility of this evidence and its prejudicial\n\neffect was debated at length, with due consideration to the\n\nrulings we made in Ferrara I and the nature of the evidence as\n\na whole.\n\n           Judge Harrington correctly isolated the issue as one\n\nof balancing prejudice against the demonstrably probative value\n\nof the motive and opportunity proffer.                   As we have said in the\n\npast,\n\n           The fact that a piece of evidence hurts a\n           party’s chances does not mean it should\n           automatically be excluded.     If that were\n           true, there would be precious little left in\n           the way of probative evidence in any case.\n           The question is one of “unfair” prejudice -\n           - not of prejudice alone.\n\nOnujiogu     v.    United    States,         817     F.2d     3,        6    (1st        Cir.\n\n1987)(quotation      marks       omitted).         See   also      Dollar          v.    Long\n\nManufacturing, N.C., Inc., 561 F.2d 613, 618 (5th Cir. 1977)\n\n(“Virtually all evidence is prejudicial or it isn't material.\n\nThe prejudice must be 'unfair'.\"), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 996,\n\n98 S. Ct. 1648, 56 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1978).                     Although evidence of\n\nmotive and opportunity would plainly further defendant’s case at\n\nthe   plaintiff’s     expense,       plaintiff       failed        to       show    unfair\n\nprejudice.        Given   this,     and   the      obvious      relevance           of    the\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fevidence to the defendant’s affirmative defense, the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion when it denied F&D’s motion\n\nto exclude.\n\nB.   John Malcolm’s Expert Testimony as to Cause and Origin\n\n          Much of the two-week trial before Judge Harrington was\n\na battle between the experts concerning whether the fire was\n\naccidental or of incendiary origin.      Defendant’s expert, John\n\nMalcolm, concluded that the fire on the TWO FRIENDS had three\n\npoints of origin and was deliberately set.      Plaintiff’s expert,\n\nPaul Sullivan, testified that an accidental electrical fire\n\nstarted in the lower electrical panel and exploded in a so-\n\ncalled   flash-over   igniting   everything   in   the   super-heated\n\ncompartments of the vessel.\n\n          Beyond the conflicting expert opinions, the battle also\n\nraged over whether John Malcolm should be allowed to testify as\n\nSt. Paul’s cause-and-origin expert.      It is on this issue that\n\nF&D appeals.   F&D contends that John Malcolm should not have\n\nbeen permitted to render an expert opinion as to cause and\n\norigin because (1) his opinion was based on unreliable data,\n\nviz, data not collected by him personally and (2) St. Paul\n\nfailed to supplement its expert disclosures to include Malcolm’s\n\ntestimony regarding cause and origin.         Before going into the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fmerits of these arguments, we recount the history of Malcolm’s\n\ninvolvement in this case.\n\n          As soon as four days after the fire, St. Paul had hired\n\nFred O’Donnell as its expert to investigate the origin and cause\n\nof the fire.         Fred O’Donnell then hired John Malcolm as an\n\nelectrical systems expert to assist him in that investigation.\n\nOn July 8, 1993, the two men began their investigation on site\n\nin Gloucester where the boat remained moored.\n\n          O’Donnell and Malcolm worked closely with each other.\n\nMalcolm testified that together, sometimes with Malcolm holding\n\nthe measuring tape for O’Donnell, the two took measurements of\n\nthe vessel in preparation for producing scale drawings to assist\n\nin the investigation and their report.              Although Malcolm’s job\n\nfor which O’Donnell had retained him was to pay close attention\n\nto the boat’s electrical system, the two men worked in tandem,\n\noften double-checking each other’s observations and analyses by\n\ncalling each other over to various burn sites on the vessel to\n\ncoordinate their data collection and inquiries.\n\n          During the first two trials, O’Donnell and Malcolm both\n\ntestified as experts, O’Donnell as to the fire’s cause and\n\norigin   and   Malcolm       as    to   related   but   narrower     questions\n\nconcerning     the    fire        and   the    boat’s   electrical     system.\n\nUnfortunately, however, between the first appeal and the third\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\ftrial, O’Donnell died.      For the third trial, then, instead of\n\nreplacing O’Donnell with an outside cause-and-origin expert,\n\ndefendant decided that Malcolm would testify as St. Paul’s only\n\nfire expert, providing opinions on both cause and origin and the\n\nvessel’s electrical system.        This decision is the source of\n\nF&D’s   objection     regarding   the    admissibility    of    Malcolm’s\n\ntestimony.    F&D argued to the district court, as it does to us\n\nnow, that Malcolm was not competent to testify as to cause and\n\norigin as his testimony was principally based not on his own\n\nobservations but on those made by O’Donnell.            F&D also argues\n\nthat designating Malcolm as a cause-and-origin expert so close\n\nto trial unduly prejudiced their case against St. Paul.                 At\n\nleast, F&D    contends, St. Paul should have supplemented its\n\ninterrogatory answers and expert reports to include Malcolm’s\n\nanticipated expanded testimony.\n\n          To the extent, if at all, that F&D is complaining that\n\nMalcolm lacked qualifications sufficient for the court to permit\n\nhim to testify as a cause-and-origin expert, that complaint is\n\nunavailing.         After   considering     Malcolm’s    training     and\n\nexperience, the district court, acting pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 702, ruled that Malcolm was qualified.             That ruling\n\nfell within the broad purview of the trial court’s discretion.\n\nSee Diefenbach v. Sheridan Transp., 229 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f2000)     (“It   is   well-settled     that    'trial   judges   have    broad\n\ndiscretionary powers in determining the qualification, and thus,\n\nadmissibility, of expert witnesses.’”) (citing Richmond Steel\n\nInc. v. Puerto Rican Am. Ins. Co., 954 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)).     Malcolm’s qualifications as a fire analyst are, in\n\nfact, considerable.            He has master and journeyman electrical\n\nlicenses from Massachusetts and New Hampshire; he has been\n\nconsulting as a fire investigator since 1963; and, in 1991, he\n\nwas     qualified     as   a    Certified     Fire   Investigator   by    the\n\nInternational Association of Arson Investigators.                Malcolm had\n\nbeen qualified twice before as an expert in this case to render\n\nan opinion regarding the electrical system’s contribution to the\n\nfire aboard the vessel.4            After hearing Malcolm’s testimony\n\n\n      4F&D argues in an aside that Malcolm’s qualifications as a\ncause-and-origin expert were rejected by two previous trial\njudges and that this is proof that Malcolm should not have been\nable to testify as a cause-and-origin expert during the third\ntrial before Judge Harrington. It is not clear to us, however,\nthat the two judges presiding in the previous trials believed\nthat Malcolm lacked qualifications as a cause-and-origin expert.\nThese judges limited Malcolm’s testimony to electrical systems\nin trials where O’Donnell was offered as the defendant’s cause-\nand-origin expert. Limiting Malcolm’s role where someone else\nwas tendered as the cause-and-origin expert expedited the trial\nby eliminating duplicative testimony. Neither district judge\ndetermined that Malcolm was not qualified as an expert on cause\nand   origin   should   O’Donnell   have   failed  to   testify.\nFurthermore, the views of prior judges about Malcolm would be\nlargely irrelevant here. A presiding judge has broad discretion\nin his or her determinations regarding expert qualifications.\nSee Poulin v. Greer, 18 F.3d 979, 984 (     1st Cir. 1994); cf.\nGeneral Elec. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S. Ct. 512,\n\n                                      -18-\n\fregarding his knowledge, skill, experience and training in fire\n\nanalysis,       Judge     Harrington       exercised      sound      discretion       in\n\nconcluding       that    Malcolm    was     qualified     to   render       an    expert\n\nopinion    on     cause    and     origin    as    well   as    on    the    vessel’s\n\nelectrical system.          See Richmond Steel, 954 F.2d at 20.\n\n            1.          Rule 703 Objection\n\n            F&D’s next objection, although not crafted as such, is\n\nessentially a Rule 703 objection.                  F&D claims that Malcolm’s\n\nopinion as to cause and origin was based on unreliable data,\n\nviz, data provided by the late Fred O’Donnell and not that which\n\nwas collected through Malcolm’s own personal observation.\n\n            A major problem with this argument is that Malcolm\n\nhimself had visited the fire scene and examined the evidence\n\nthere side by side with O’Donnell.                   Besides looking at burn\n\npatterns     and        studying     the     electrical        system,       he    took\n\nmeasurements and photographs and wrote his own report.                           He also\n\ninterviewed the vessel’s engineer.                Many photographs of evidence\n\nat the scene were entered into evidence by stipulation.                           Hence,\n\n\n\n\n517, 139 L.     Ed.2d 508 (1997) (holding that appeals courts review\ntrial court     decisions to admit or exclude expert testimony under\nDaubert on       an abuse of discretion standard). Circumstances\nchange from      trial to trial, and admissibility rulings may also\nchange from     judge to judge and trial to trial.\n\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fit   is   simply   not    the    case   that   Malcolm’s   cause-and-origin\n\nopinion rested mainly upon O’Donnell’s investigations.\n\n            To     be    sure,     Malcolm’s    opinion      coincided    with\n\nO’Donnell’s and he testified that he read O’Donnell’s report in\n\npreparation for his expert testimony, along with the report of\n\nthe local fire department.          But the opinion he rendered was his\n\nown, and, as said, he had first-hand knowledge of the fire scene\n\nand the observable facts there upon which to base that opinion.\n\nFederal    Rule    of   Evidence    703   allows   Malcolm    to   have   taken\n\nO’Donnell’s report and opinion into account when forming his own\n\nexpert opinion.         So long as the basis of Malcolm’s opinion did\n\nnot extend beyond facts or data “of a type reasonably relied\n\nupon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or\n\ninferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be\n\nadmissible in evidence.”           Fed. R. Evid. 703.      We think a cause-\n\nand-origin expert like Malcolm could be expected to examine the\n\nreport of another expert like O’Donnell as well as the fire\n\ndepartment’s report in the course of forming his own opinion\n\nderived from a variety of sources, including his own first-hand\n\nknowledge of the primary evidence at the fire scene.                        See\n\nAlmonte v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 787 F.2d 763, 770 (1st\n\nCir. 1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f             This court has said that when an expert relies on the\n\nopinion of another, such reliance goes to the weight, not to the\n\nadmissibility        of   the    expert’s        opinion.      See      Forrestal     v.\n\nMagendantz, 848 F.2d 303, 306 (1st Cir. 1988).                      See also Newell\n\nPuerto Rico, Ltd. v. Rubbermaid Inc., 20 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)(“When the factual underpinning of an expert opinion is\n\nweak, it is a matter affecting the weight and credibility of the\n\ntestimony -- a question to be resolved by the jury.”).                          In the\n\npresent case, the jury understood that Malcolm’s observations\n\ncoincided with those of the deceased expert hired by defendant\n\nand that, until recently, Malcolm’s only job was to advise and\n\nsupplement O’Donnell’s conclusions as to the cause and origin of\n\nthe   fire    with    his      own   opinion     concerning       the   role   of    the\n\nvessel’s electrical system in the fire.                     Thus, in weighing and\n\nevaluating Malcolm’s opinion, the jury was able to determine\n\nwhether      it   was     in     some    way     weakened     by     reliance       upon\n\nO’Donnell’s.\n\n             We find no error in the district court’s ruling that\n\nMalcolm’s opinion as to cause and origin was properly admitted.\n\n             2.         No Prejudice in Last-Minute Expert Designation\n\n             F&D’s next objection to Malcolm’s testimony is that F&D\n\nwas prejudiced by Malcolm’s tardy designation as the cause-and-\n\norigin    expert.         On    June    21,    1999,   at   the    first   pre-trial\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fconference before Judge Harrington following the mandate from\n\nthis court, St. Paul informed both F&D and the district court of\n\nits decision to proceed without a replacement for O’Donnell and\n\nwith   Malcolm    as    both    its   cause-and-origin      expert    and     its\n\nelectrical systems expert.            The trial was set for October 4,\n\n1999, more than three months later.                 F&D contends that three\n\nmonths before the trial was too late to be designating a new\n\nexpert.     Furthermore, F&D contends that had St. Paul wished to\n\navoid the prejudice of such a tardy expert designation, St. Paul\n\nshould have supplemented its answers to interrogatories naming\n\nMalcolm as the substitute expert for the late O’Donnell and\n\ndisclosing the content of his expanded testimony.\n\n            At a final pre-trial conference on October 1, 1999,\n\nJudge Harrington heard arguments and informed both parties that\n\nas long as defendant could qualify Malcolm as an expert on cause\n\nand origin, his testimony as to cause and origin would be\n\nadmitted.     Also at that pre-trial conference, Judge Harrington\n\nallowed plaintiff to add an expert to its witness list (Paul\n\nSullivan)    under     the   condition     that   defendant    be    given   the\n\nopportunity to depose the additional expert before the trial.\n\nPlaintiff did not request additional time to depose Malcolm,\n\nhowever, presumably because Malcolm had testified previously as\n\nan   electrical   expert       at   both   trials    and   because    St.    Paul\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\frepresented that Malcolm’s testimony as to cause and origin\n\nwould be substantially similar to the late O’Donnell’s testimony\n\non cause and origin.\n\n              We find no merit in F&D’s argument that June 21, 1999\n\nwas too late to designate a new expert.                  F&D itself designated\n\na replacement expert less than two weeks before trial.                      However,\n\nF&D rightly objects to St. Paul’s failure to supplement its\n\ninterrogatory answers or its expert reports naming Malcolm as\n\nthe   substitute          expert   for   the    late    O’Donnell     and    adding\n\nMalcolm’s expanded testimony pursuant to Rule 26 of the Federal\n\nRules    of   Civil       Procedure.      See    Fed.    R.    Civ.   P.    26(e)(1)\n\n(requiring a party to supplement its answers to interrogatories\n\nin order to inform another party of a material change in or\n\naddition      to   information      contained    in     an    expert’s     pre-trial\n\nreport).      As we have stated, “[t]his supplementation requirement\n\nincreases the quality and fairness of the trial by narrowing\n\n[the] issues and eliminat[ing] surprise.”                Licciardi v. TIG Ins.\n\nGroup,    140      F.3d    357,    363   (1st   Cir.     1998)(alterations        in\n\noriginal)(quotation marks and citations omitted).                     The question\n\nhere is whether St. Paul’s failure to adhere strictly to the\n\nrequirements of Rule 26(e)(1) – failing to substitute Malcolm\n\nfor O’Donnell as its cause-and-origin expert in their expert\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fdisclosures – thwarted the reason for the rule and materially\n\nprejudiced F&D in its efforts to present its case.\n\n         A careful review of the record convinces us that F&D\n\nsuffered no actual prejudice.    First, F&D in fact had notice of\n\nMalcolm’s designation as the cause-and-origin expert as early as\n\nJune 1999, more than three months before the trial date.         See\n\nNewell Puerto Rico, 20 F.3d at 20.            F&D moved neither to\n\nredepose Malcolm (as St. Paul did of F&D’s newly designated\n\nexpert Paul Sullivan) nor for a continuance of the trial.\n\n         Second, there was no meaningful change in the testimony\n\npresented by St. Paul regarding cause and origin from the first\n\ntrial to the third.   The only consequential change to which F&D\n\nobjects was that O’Donnell’s cause-and-origin testimony was\n\nreplaced by similar testimony from Malcolm.        Yet not only was\n\nMalcolm’s testimony similar to O’Donnell’s, Malcolm himself was\n\nnot an unknown quantity to F&D.        He had testified as an expert\n\nwitness in the two previous trials and had made clear as early\n\nas in 1995, during deposition testimony and trial testimony,\n\nthat he thought the fire was deliberately set with three points\n\nof origin.   For this reason, F&D’s contention that the content\n\nof Malcolm’s expert opinion came as a surprise is unpersuasive.\n\nThis is not a case in which the expert’s testimony departed from\n\nthe general scheme of his opinion or any other expert opinion\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fsubmitted to F&D on behalf of St. Paul’s case.       Nor is it a case\n\nin which a party was hindered in its ability to formulate a\n\nresponse or adequately cross-examine the new expert as to the\n\nfoundations for his opinion.   See Johnson v. H.K. Webster, Inc.,\n\n775 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1985) (stating that among the factors to\n\nconsider when assessing a claim of error under Rule 26 is “the\n\nability of the [opposing party] to formulate a response”).       When\n\nasked during oral argument of this appeal whether Malcolm’s\n\ntestimony was contrary to or in a material way different from\n\nhis opinion as contained in the reports submitted to F&D, F&D’s\n\ncounsel conceded that Malcolm did not change his opinion, but\n\nrather he only expanded its scope to include that which was\n\npreviously encompassed by O’Donnell’s testimony and reports.       As\n\nwe can see no material prejudice, we affirm the trial court’s\n\nadmission of Malcolm’s testimony.     In so doing, we of course do\n\nnot condone St. Paul’s failure to adhere to its Rule 26(e)(1)\n\nobligations, a mistake which has needlessly burdened the parties\n\nand this court with an appellate issue.\n\nC.   Malcolm’s Reference Under Cross-Examination to Protective\n\nOrder\n\n          Plaintiff’s third claim of trial error concerns a\n\npurported violation of a protective order into which the parties\n\nentered   in   1995.   Plaintiff   contends   that   John   Malcolm’s\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fresponse to a question on cross-examination was a deliberate\n\ndisclosure of information subject to that protective order and\n\nso prejudiced the case against F&D that Judge Harrington abused\n\nhis discretion when he failed to grant plaintiff’s motion for a\n\nmistrial.    In context of the whole colloquy between plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel and Malcolm, Judge Harrington’s instructions to the jury\n\nand Malcolm’s answer to plaintiff’s follow-up question, we find\n\nno prejudice and no trial error.               Before we explain, some\n\nbackground history is necessary.\n\n            In 1995, during a pre-trial conference preceding the\n\nfirst trial, another district judge issued a protective order\n\nthat was to follow the parties throughout the case before him\n\nand through any subsequent proceedings.               That order prevented\n\nany   mention     during   trial   of   an    alleged    anonymous    police\n\ninformant who, among other things, reported witnessing a man\n\nrunning away from the F/V TWO FRIENDS just moments before the\n\nfire began.     (The order resulted from the refusal of the police\n\nofficer to name the informant.)         Although the testifying experts\n\nin the case, including John Malcolm, knew of the anonymous\n\ninformant   and    of   the   protective     order,   the   specter   of   the\n\nanonymous informant remained out of the jury’s view until, at\n\nleast, the incident in question.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f            During the third trial, in an apparent attempt to draw\n\nthe   jury’s     attention    to   the   alleged     fact   that   Malcolm    had\n\nlimited personal knowledge of the fire scene, plaintiff began\n\ngrilling Malcolm on cross-examination as to the source and depth\n\nof his knowledge.        Plaintiff asked:\n\n            Question:        “You didn’t discover in your\n                             investigation of this fire any\n                             witnesses to the fire, did you?”\n            Malcolm:         “Myself, no, because again –“\n            Question:        “Okay, you found no witnesses to\n                             the   fire.     In   fact,   the\n                             information you have is that\n                             nobody was on that vessel for a\n                             full ten hours prior to the\n                             Gloucester    Fire    Department\n                             responding to that fire; isn’t\n                             that   right?  Isn’t   that  the\n                             information that you have?”\n\nAware that there were allegations of such an eyewitness, but\n\nthat he was not allowed to say so, Malcolm responded:                  “Well, I\n\nhave some other information that I don’t believe we’re supposed\n\nto talk about.”\n\n            An    immediate       side-bar   ensued     during     which    Judge\n\nHarrington,      who   had   no    knowledge    of    the   protective     order,\n\nlearned of its purpose and parameters.                 Plaintiff moved for a\n\nmistrial.        Judge   Harrington      denied      plaintiff’s    motion    and\n\nsolicited suggestions from both counsel about how to correct the\n\nerroneous      disclosure.         Counsel     discussed    various    ways    of\n\nrephrasing the question so that Malcolm would deny any personal\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fknowledge of witnesses to the fire.                   When the side-bar ended,\n\nJudge Harrington instructed the jury that the last question and\n\nthe last answer were stricken and were not to be considered\n\nevidence    in    the      case.     Plaintiff’s       counsel        then    asked    the\n\nfollowing    question        --     “Mr.    Malcolm,      you    have    no     personal\n\nknowledge that anyone was on that vessel for ten hours before\n\nthe Gloucester Fire Department responded to that fire; is that\n\ncorrect?”    --       to    which    Malcolm      replied,      “That’s        correct.”\n\nPlaintiff’s counsel continued with the cross-examination and the\n\nmatter was left to rest, never to be mentioned again until the\n\npost-trial motion for sanctions.\n\n            Our decision to uphold the district court’s ruling\n\nrequires only a brief explanation.                    First, Malcolm’s initial\n\nresponse to plaintiff’s question did not reveal the existence of\n\nan anonymous informant with information tending to show that the\n\nfire aboard the F/V TWO FRIENDS was an act of arson, an answer\n\nprohibited       by   the    protective      order.       To    the     contrary,      all\n\nMalcolm’s     answer        suggested       was    that    he     had        some    other\n\ninformation about the circumstances surrounding the fire that he\n\nwas not permitted to reveal.                Whether the information that he\n\nhad and that he was required to keep confidential would further\n\nplaintiff’s       case      or    defendant’s      case    was    not        clear    from\n\nMalcolm’s statement.               Furthermore, had Malcolm affirmed, as\n\n\n                                           -28-\n\fplaintiff desired, that the information he had was that nobody\n\nwas on the vessel for a full ten hours prior to the Gloucester\n\nFire Department responding to that fire,                Malcolm would have\n\nbeen stating a literal untruth.          A better phrased question, such\n\nas the one that followed the side-bar, would have side-stepped\n\nany trouble, enabling Malcolm to testify truthfully yet adhere\n\nto the terms of the protective order.5\n\n            Second,    any    remote    prejudice    that   plaintiff   could\n\narguably claim is alleviated by Malcolm’s answer to plaintiff’s\n\nfollow-up      question      and   by     Judge     Harrington’s   curative\n\ninstructions, striking the first question and answer.                   Judge\n\nHarrington immediately instructed the jury to strike the first\n\nquestion and answer, that they were not to consider it as\n\nevidence in the case. See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161,   1184    (1st   Cir.    1993)    (stating     that   “[s]wiftness   in\n\n\n    5   Compare the first question,\n\n    “Okay, you found no witnesses to the fire. In fact,\n    the information you have is that nobody was on that\n    vessel for a full ten hours prior to the Gloucester\n    Fire Department responding to that fire; isn’t that\n    right? Isn’t that the information that you have?”\n\nwith the second, follow-up question,\n\n    “Mr. Malcolm, you have no personal knowledge that\n    anyone was on that vessel for ten hours before the\n    Gloucester Fire Department responded to that fire; is\n    that correct?”.\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fjudicial    response     is   an     important        element    in     alleviating\n\nprejudice    once    the      jury      has    been     exposed       to    improper\n\ntestimony”).     It is presumed that the jury will follow such\n\ninstructions unless “it appears probable that ... responsible\n\njurors will not be able to ... and, moreover, that the testimony\n\nwill likely be seriously prejudicial to the aggrieved party.”\n\nId. at 1185.   Plaintiff cannot show a likelihood of prejudice as\n\nMalcolm’s    response    to   F&D’s      follow-up      question,       a   slightly\n\ndifferent (but better) version of the first question, see note\n\n7 supra, placed before the jury the favorable testimony that F&D\n\nhad sought from the original question. The jury heard Malcolm’s\n\nunqualified denial that he had any personal knowledge that\n\nsomeone had been aboard the F/V TWO FRIENDS between the hours of\n\n4:30 p.m. on July 2nd and 2:30 a.m. on July 3rd of 1993.\n\n            In sum, Judge Harrington’s rapid curative instruction\n\nin addition to the follow-up question and answer eliminated any\n\nremote possibility of prejudice.              Judge Harrington did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial.\n\nSee   Sepulveda,    15   F.3d      at   1184    (standard       under      which   the\n\nappellate court reviews the district court’s granting or denial\n\nof a motion for a mistrial is abuse of discretion).\n\n\n\n                         III.      REMAINING ISSUES\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f            Plaintiff raises two other issues on appeal, both of\n\nwhich lack merit.        We discuss them briefly below.\n\nA.     Plaintiff’s Post-Trial Motion for Sanctions\n\n            After the jury returned a verdict for the defendant,\n\nF&D    filed a host of post-trial motions, among them a motion for\n\nsanctions based on what it alleges was a “knowing violation of\n\nthe [protective order]. It is the plaintiff’s position that this\n\nviolation was intentional, and that the statement was made with\n\nthe explicit purpose of prejudicing the jury.”               When considered\n\nalong side of other purported discovery abuses, plaintiff claims\n\nthat the district court’s denial of sanctions was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            As we have already determined, Malcolm’s answer was not\n\nunwarranted in response to the question asked.               His interrogator\n\nwas at least as much at fault as Malcolm in eliciting an answer\n\nthat     skirted   the    outer    limits    of    the    protective    order.\n\nMoreover,    F&D   suffered       little    if    any    prejudice   from   the\n\nexchange.     In the circumstances, and taking into account the\n\nfact that the district judge, who had lived with the case, was\n\nunpersuaded that plaintiff had cleared the high hurdle required\n\nto support a claim of fraud on the court or a motion for\n\nsanctions,    we   can   only     affirm    the   district    court’s   ruling\n\ndenying plaintiff’s motion for sanctions. See Spiller v. U.S.V.\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fLaboratories, Inc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating\n\nthat a party complaining to an appellate tribunal with respect\n\nto trial-level sanctions \"bears a heavy burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the trial judge was clearly not justified in entering [the]\n\norder\").       See also Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388,\n\n393 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating that the hard-to-meet standard of\n\nabuse of discretion is a “rule ... anchored in common sense” and\n\nquoting Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1082\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) with its explanation that because \"[d]istrict\n\njudges live in the trenches....[they] are, by and large, in a\n\nfar better position than appellate tribunals to determine the\n\npresence of misconduct and to prescribe concinnous remedies\").\n\nWe see no abuse of discretion.\n\nB.     Plaintiff’s Challenge to Ferrara I\n\n               Plaintiff’s remaining challenge to the judgment below\n\nis an assertion that the district court “erred in following the\n\nreasoning of the United States Court of Appeals in the case of\n\n[Ferrara I], in concluding that the defendant need only prove\n\nthat     the    fire   in   question     was     incendiary    in    nature    or\n\ndeliberately set.”          Appellant’s Brief at 10.           Citing      United\n\nStates    v.     Rivera-Martinez,      931     F.2d   148   (1st    Cir.   1991),\n\nplaintiff argues that the district court should have reevaluated\n\n\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fthis court’s reasoning and deviated from the holding of Ferrara\n\nI in order to avoid manifest injustice.\n\n             Putting aside the impropriety of asking a district\n\ncourt to overturn a determination made by this court, we observe\n\nthat plaintiff never asked Judge Harrington to deviate from the\n\nholding of     Ferrara I.        On the contrary, during a pre-trial\n\ncolloquy, the parties discussed with the district court the way\n\nto    best   formulate       jury   questions         and     decide   issues    of\n\nadmissibility of evidence in light of the holding of Ferrara I.\n\nThe wording of the question put to the jury, “Do you find that\n\nthe defendant ... has established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence     that    the    fire    was    of    an     incendiary     nature     or\n\ndeliberately set?”, was stipulated to by both parties, obviating\n\nany   possible      claim   at   this     time   that       the   question   itself\n\noversimplified Ferrara I’s holding.                   It is axiomatic that an\n\nissue not presented to the trial court cannot be raised for the\n\nfirst time on appeal absent plain error.                    See Hammond v. T.J.\n\nLitle & Co., Inc., 82 F.3d 1166, 1172 (1st Cir. 1996).                       Nor are\n\nthere reasons apparent from the record for abandoning the law of\n\nthe case doctrine.         See Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 151 (citing\n\nthe “litany of exceptional circumstances sufficient to sidetrack\n\nthe law of the case” -- such as “the evidence on a subsequent\n\ntrial was substantially different, controlling authority has\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fsince made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such\n\nissues, or the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a\n\nmanifest injustice”).\n\n         For all of these reasons, we find no error in the\n\ndistrict court’s rulings.   The judgment below is affirmed.\n\n         So ordered. Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                              -34-\n\f-35-\n\f",

The facts have not changed.\n\n                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\n             On July 3, 1993, the commercial fishing vessel F/V TWO\n\nFRIENDS was destroyed by a fire.         Plaintiff-Appellant Ferrara &\n\nDiMercurio (“F&D”), owner of the vessel, sought to recover\n\ninsurance under a Hull Policy issued by defendant-appellee St.\n\nPaul Mercury Insurance Company (“St. Paul”).            St. Paul denied\n\ncoverage after its investigation ended with a determination of\n\narson, which it understood to be excluded from coverage under\n\nthe policy. Thereafter, F&D brought an action in the district\n\ncourt claiming that St. Paul’s refusal to pay was a breach of\n\nthe insurance contract and constituted “bad faith” in violation\n\nof Massachusetts General Laws ch. 93A.              After a first trial\n\nended in a hung jury, a second trial ended with the court\n\ndirecting a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n             At the time the district court directed a plaintiff’s\n\nverdict, the court accepted that St. Paul would not be liable\n\ncould   it   prove   its   affirmative    defense   that   the   fire   was\n\ndeliberately set by the insured.         But the court ruled that the\n\nevidence put forward was legally insufficient for a jury to find\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthat plaintiff had deliberately set its boat on fire.                    St. Paul\n\nhad also asserted that it would be exempt from liability were\n\nthe fire found to have been deliberately set by an unknown third\n\nparty, relying upon the language of an exclusion for “malicious\n\nacts”   found     in    the    so-called      Strikes,      Riots,     and   Civil\n\nCommotions (“SR&CC”) clause.            However, the court construed that\n\nprovision    as     excluding         from    coverage      only   those     fires\n\ndeliberately      set   by    third    parties   in   the    context    of   civil\n\nunrest, a setting absent here.\n\n            On appeal, this court disagreed with the district\n\ncourt’s rulings, reversing and remanding the case for a third\n\ntrial. We held that the SR&CC clause excluded from coverage all\n\nfires (whether or not arising in the context of civil unrest)\n\nthat were deliberately set by third parties.                See Ferrara I, 169\n\nF.3d at 53.       Notwithstanding the clause’s title -- “strikes,\n\nriots and civil commotions” -- we stated:\n\n            “Malicious acts” is set forth in the SR&CC\n            clause as a separate, unmodified exclusion\n            from coverage....[N]othing in the plain\n            language and grammar of the clause supports\n            the   district   court’s   constriction   of\n            excludable “malicious acts” to only those\n            acts perpetrated within the context of one\n            or more of the other co-listed events. Nor,\n            in our view, would an objectively reasonable\n            insured interpret the “malicious acts”\n            exclusion so narrowly.\n\n                       ....\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f                  ...Hence,   to  limit   the   phrase,\n           “malicious acts,” to just those activities\n           related to the former categories would be to\n           render   the  “malicious   acts”   provision\n           redundant, an interpretation running counter\n           to the customary assumption that all words\n           within a clause serve some purpose....\n\n                  Here, the malicious acts in question\n           are arson -- and not, as a practical matter,\n           arson by the owner or its agents, which are\n           actions separately excluded from coverage by\n           law, but the rarer acts of fire-setting by\n           vandals or other malicious individuals.\n           Such acts fall within the general category\n           of intentional third-party violence which\n           can be said to be a principal overall theme\n           of the SR&CC clause. The “malicious acts”\n           category serves the relevant purpose of\n           excluding destructive acts not public or\n           tumultuous enough to be considered a riot or\n           civil commotion. In sum, the SR&CC clause\n           unambiguously excludes from coverage losses\n           caused by “malicious acts,” including arson,\n           whether or not the malicious acts occur in\n           the context of one or more of the other\n           events listed in the SR&CC clause. Thus, on\n           remand, the jury should be permitted to\n           determine whether the fire on July 3, 1993,\n           was deliberately set by third parties.\n           Should the jury answer that question in the\n           affirmative, St. Paul would not be liable\n           under the Hull Policy.\n\nId. at 51-53 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Having reversed the district court’s holding that arson\n\nby a third party was only a defense when occurring during civil\n\nunrest, this court also reversed the district court’s other\n\nconclusion that the evidence at trial was legally insufficient\n\nto   support   the   insurer’s   arson-by-the-insured   defense.   We\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdetermined that evidence in the record of motive and opportunity\n\non the part of F&D to commit arson was such that “reasonable\n\njurors could determine that [plaintiff] deliberately set fire to\n\nthe TWO FRIENDS in order to fraudulently obtain the proceeds of\n\nthe insurance policy.”       Id. at 56.\n\n            The parties returned to district court to prepare for\n\na   third   trial,   this   time   before     yet    a   third   judge,   Judge\n\nHarrington.      Based upon their mutual understanding of this\n\ncourt’s decision in Fer r a r a I, both parties agreed that the\n\nfollowing single question would be submitted to the jury to be\n\nanswered “Yes” or “No”: “Do you find that the defendant, St.\n\nPaul   Mercury       Insurance     Company,     has      established      by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that the fire was of an incendiary\n\nnature or deliberately set?”.              This question was apparently\n\nmeant to incorporate both holdings of Ferrara I, entitling St.\n\nPaul to the defense of arson by third parties as well as to the\n\ndefense of arson-by-the-insured.           The jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of defendant St. Paul, answering “Yes” to the special\n\nverdict.    F&D appeals.\n\n            Unlike in Ferrara I, when we were faced with, among\n\nother issues, the task of construing somewhat unusual language\n\nin the insurance policy, this time the issues presented are more\n\ncommonplace.      F&D   claims     reversible       error   on   the   basis   of\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcertain evidentiary rulings, any one of which, F&D argues,\n\nentitles it to a fourth trial.                     We disagree.    F&D also appeals\n\nfrom       the   district      court’s     denial     of    plaintiff’s    post-trial\n\nmotion for sanctions.               For the reasons that follow, we affirm\n\nall of the rulings below.\n\n\n\n                  II.      LEGAL ANALYSES OF EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\n\n                 Having recited the facts in our first opinion, we need\n\nnot repeat all of them here.                  For a more complete account, we\n\nrefer the reader to Ferrara I, 169 F.3d at 45-49.                          We report\n\nhere only those facts that are relevant to the three evidentiary\n\nissues raised on this appeal.                 The three evidentiary issues are\n\nas follows1: (A) the propriety of allowing the jury to hear\n\nevidence         of   the    principal     shareholders’       alleged    motive    and\n\nopportunity           to    burn   their     own    boat;   (B)   the   propriety    of\n\nadmitting into evidence against F&D the expert testimony of John\n\nMalcolm regarding the cause and origin of the fire; (C) the\n\neffectiveness of the district court’s curative instruction to\n\nthe jury to strike and disregard an answer provided on cross-\n\nexamination           by    John   Malcolm    regarding      information    that    was\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       We state and decide the remaining two issues,                               non-\nevidentiary and less fact-specific, in Part III infra.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fsubject to a protective order.          We discuss each of these issues\n\nin turn below.\n\nA. Motive and Opportunity Evidence to Burn the F/V TWO FRIENDS\n\n           Prior   to    trial,   the   district        court    engaged   in    an\n\nextended colloquy with both parties over the relevance and\n\npotential prejudice of defendant’s proffer to present evidence\n\nof F&D’s financial hardship, a proffer, defendant argued, that\n\nwould tend to prove that F&D had a motive, in addition to the\n\nopportunity, to burn their boat, the F/V TWO FRIENDS.                 Plaintiff\n\nobjected to this evidence on the ground that it was irrelevant.\n\nAll parties having agreed that the sole question put to the jury\n\nwould be “Do you find that the defendant, St. Paul Mercury\n\nInsurance Company, has established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence   that    the     fire   was   of    an      incendiary     nature      or\n\ndeliberately      set?”,    plaintiff        sought      to     persuade   Judge\n\nHarrington that evidence of either motive or opportunity to\n\ncommit arson would be irrelevant to a determination of the\n\nultimate issue.     Then, as now, plaintiff argued that evidence of\n\nmotive and opportunity to start a fire aboard the F/V TWO\n\nFRIENDS was irrelevant to the only explicit question to be\n\nanswered by the fact-finders: whether or not the fire aboard the\n\nF/V TWO FRIENDS was intentional.             As an alternative, plaintiff\n\nargued   that   the     prejudicial     effect     of    evidence     that      F&D\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fshareholders had a motive and opportunity to burn their boat\n\nsubstantially outweighed its probative value.\n\n            At various times during the pre-trial conference, Judge\n\nHarrington    pressed           plaintiff’s       counsel      for     a   persuasive\n\nexplanation     of why evidence of motive and opportunity was\n\nirrelevant to the ultimate issue of incendiarism.                          Like Judge\n\nHarrington,     we        are     puzzled        by     plaintiff’s        constricted\n\ninterpretation       of    relevance       as    defined      by    Federal    Rule   of\n\nEvidence 401.    Consider the evidence that ultimately came out at\n\nthe trial:\n\n            The F/V TWO FRIENDS was locked at the time the fire\n\nstarted.    No sign of forced entry into the vessel was found.                         As\n\nboth parties’ experts agreed that the fire began inside the\n\nvessel, St. Paul was faced with the obstacle of explaining, in\n\norder to establish that the fire was deliberately set, how an\n\narsonist (be it the insured or a third party) gained access to\n\nthe vessel.     This goes to opportunity.\n\n            As it turned out, there were four keys to the F/V TWO\n\nFRIENDS,    three    in    the     hands    of    the    insured-owners        and    one\n\nhanging in a warehouse adjacent to where the boat was moored.\n\nThe undisputed testimony was that all four keys were in their\n\nexpected places shortly after the fire.                            The owner of the\n\nwarehouse    testified          that   access     to    the   key    hanging    in    the\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fwarehouse was not closely guarded, however, and that it was\n\npossible that before July 3, 1993, somebody could have illicitly\n\ntaken the key from the warehouse and made a copy of it.         No\n\nevidence was put before the jury of anyone being seen near the\n\nboat between the hours of 4:30 p.m on July 2, 1993, when Leo\n\nFerrara locked the boat after a fishing trip, and 2:30 a.m. the\n\nfollowing morning, when the Gloucester Fire Department responded\n\nto the fire.2   After a lengthy investigation that led St. Paul’s\n\ninvestigators to the conclusion that, due to the burn patterns\n\ninside the vessel, the fire had been deliberately set, St. Paul\n\nset out to investigate why someone who   might have access to the\n\nTWO FRIENDS would wish to destroy it.    This goes to motive.\n\n          Evidence was presented that the plaintiff company F&D,\n\nalong with its principle shareholders    (various members of the\n\nFerrara-DiMercurio family), was in dire financial trouble.      The\n\n\n     2 Although not placed before the jury, through initial\ndiscovery both parties learned that a Gloucester police officer\nhad information based on an anonymous source that someone was\nseen fleeing the scene of the fire and that the fire had been\ndeliberately set.    When the police officer refused to reveal\nhis source, the district judge who presided over the first trial\n(Judge Tauro) ordered that no evidence of this anonymous tip was\nto be admitted in the trial. No jury ever heard anything about\nthis anonymous informant.     The jury in the third trial did\nlearn, however, through an answer of one of St. Paul’s experts\nunder cross-examination, that a protective order was in place as\nto certain subjects relevant to the initial investigation of the\ncause of the fire.     Whether what the jury heard as to the\nprotective order poisoned the trial for the plaintiff is the\nsubject of Part II.C. infra.\n\n                               -10-\n\fcompany, organized as a commercial fishing venture in 1987, was\n\nlosing money and was unable to meet its mortgage payments on the\n\nvessel to Gloucester Bank & Trust Company.              In fact, F&D had\n\noperated at a loss since its inception.           As the company fell\n\nfurther behind in its payments, the bank threatened to foreclose\n\nnot only on the boat mortgage, but on the collateral that was\n\npledged on the loan for the F/V TWO FRIENDS, such as the\n\npersonal homes of the individual shareholders.\n\n            Despite   successfully      negotiating   various   repayment\n\nplans, F&D continued to have difficulties making timely payments\n\nto the bank.     So, in April 1993, in an effort to quell those\n\nfinancial troubles, F&D and Gloucester Bank & Trust Company\n\nagreed that F&D would attempt to sell the TWO FRIENDS for\n\n$225,000, a sum that was $150,000 less than the price F&D paid\n\nfor   the   vessel    in   1987   and   significantly    less   than   the\n\noutstanding balance of the debts owing, which totaled more than\n\n$425,000.    The jury heard testimony that the boat was insured\n\nfor $350,000 under a Hull Policy issued to F&D in 1992 by St.\n\nPaul, a sum which if collected by F&D might have protected the\n\nhomes of the Ferraras and DiMercurios from foreclosure.\n\n            The standard for admissibility under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 401 is a liberal one.          Evidence is relevant if it has\n\n“any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or\n\nless probable than it would be without that evidence.”                              We think\n\nthe    existence           of   a   motive     and    an   opportunity       to     burn    an\n\nundisputedly locked boat from the inside-out tends to make the\n\ndisputed issue -- whether the fire aboard the F/V TWO FRIENDS\n\nwas an act of arson -- more probable, especially in light of the\n\nconflicting expert testimony as to incendiarism.                            See Part II.B\n\ninfra.

Two weeks later,\n\non the first day of trial but before jury empaneling began,\n\nJudge Harrington informed counsel that he would allow defendant\n\nto proffer evidence of motive and opportunity as he determined\n\nthat “such evidence’s probative value outweighs any prejudice to\n\nthe plaintiff.”\n\n              Plaintiff’s arguments to the contrary, it is not the\n\ncase that Judge Harrington’s decision was arbitrary or unfounded\n\nor that he failed to provide a reasoned decision for admitting\n\nthe evidence despite its prejudicial effect.                  See Brief for the\n\nAppellants at 29.            The pre-trial colloquy during which the\n\ndistrict      court    explained       its   difficulties     with   plaintiff’s\n\nposition provides ample support for the district court’s ruling\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fallowing     defendant      to    put     before     the     jury           evidence       of\n\nplaintiff’s motive and opportunity to burn its own boat.                                  The\n\nmatter of the admissibility of this evidence and its prejudicial\n\neffect was debated at length, with due consideration to the\n\nrulings we made in Ferrara I and the nature of the evidence as\n\na whole.\n\n           Judge Harrington correctly isolated the issue as one\n\nof balancing prejudice against the demonstrably probative value\n\nof the motive and opportunity proffer.                   As we have said in the\n\npast,\n\n           The fact that a piece of evidence hurts a\n           party’s chances does not mean it should\n           automatically be excluded.     If that were\n           true, there would be precious little left in\n           the way of probative evidence in any case.\n           The question is one of “unfair” prejudice -\n           - not of prejudice alone.\n\nOnujiogu     v.

Although evidence of\n\nmotive and opportunity would plainly further defendant’s case at\n\nthe   plaintiff’s     expense,       plaintiff       failed        to       show    unfair\n\nprejudice.

John Malcolm’s Expert Testimony as to Cause and Origin\n\n          Much of the two-week trial before Judge Harrington was\n\na battle between the experts concerning whether the fire was\n\naccidental or of incendiary origin.      Defendant’s expert, John\n\nMalcolm, concluded that the fire on the TWO FRIENDS had three\n\npoints of origin and was deliberately set.      Plaintiff’s expert,\n\nPaul Sullivan, testified that an accidental electrical fire\n\nstarted in the lower electrical panel and exploded in a so-\n\ncalled   flash-over   igniting   everything   in   the   super-heated\n\ncompartments of the vessel.\n\n          Beyond the conflicting expert opinions, the battle also\n\nraged over whether John Malcolm should be allowed to testify as\n\nSt. Paul’s cause-and-origin expert.      It is on this issue that\n\nF&D appeals.   F&D contends that John Malcolm should not have\n\nbeen permitted to render an expert opinion as to cause and\n\norigin because (1) his opinion was based on unreliable data,\n\nviz, data not collected by him personally and (2) St. Paul\n\nfailed to supplement its expert disclosures to include Malcolm’s\n\ntestimony regarding cause and origin.         Before going into the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fmerits of these arguments, we recount the history of Malcolm’s\n\ninvolvement in this case.\n\n          As soon as four days after the fire, St. Paul had hired\n\nFred O’Donnell as its expert to investigate the origin and cause\n\nof the fire.         Fred O’Donnell then hired John Malcolm as an\n\nelectrical systems expert to assist him in that investigation.\n\nOn July 8, 1993, the two men began their investigation on site\n\nin Gloucester where the boat remained moored.\n\n          O’Donnell and Malcolm worked closely with each other.\n\nMalcolm testified that together, sometimes with Malcolm holding\n\nthe measuring tape for O’Donnell, the two took measurements of\n\nthe vessel in preparation for producing scale drawings to assist\n\nin the investigation and their report.              Although Malcolm’s job\n\nfor which O’Donnell had retained him was to pay close attention\n\nto the boat’s electrical system, the two men worked in tandem,\n\noften double-checking each other’s observations and analyses by\n\ncalling each other over to various burn sites on the vessel to\n\ncoordinate their data collection and inquiries.\n\n          During the first two trials, O’Donnell and Malcolm both\n\ntestified as experts, O’Donnell as to the fire’s cause and\n\norigin   and   Malcolm       as    to   related   but   narrower     questions\n\nconcerning     the    fire        and   the    boat’s   electrical     system.\n\nUnfortunately, however, between the first appeal and the third\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\ftrial, O’Donnell died.      For the third trial, then, instead of\n\nreplacing O’Donnell with an outside cause-and-origin expert,\n\ndefendant decided that Malcolm would testify as St. Paul’s only\n\nfire expert, providing opinions on both cause and origin and the\n\nvessel’s electrical system.        This decision is the source of\n\nF&D’s   objection     regarding   the    admissibility    of    Malcolm’s\n\ntestimony.    F&D argued to the district court, as it does to us\n\nnow, that Malcolm was not competent to testify as to cause and\n\norigin as his testimony was principally based not on his own\n\nobservations but on those made by O’Donnell.            F&D also argues\n\nthat designating Malcolm as a cause-and-origin expert so close\n\nto trial unduly prejudiced their case against St. Paul.                 At\n\nleast, F&D    contends, St. Paul should have supplemented its\n\ninterrogatory answers and expert reports to include Malcolm’s\n\nanticipated expanded testimony.\n\n          To the extent, if at all, that F&D is complaining that\n\nMalcolm lacked qualifications sufficient for the court to permit\n\nhim to testify as a cause-and-origin expert, that complaint is\n\nunavailing.         After   considering     Malcolm’s    training     and\n\nexperience, the district court, acting pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 702, ruled that Malcolm was qualified.             That ruling\n\nfell within the broad purview of the trial court’s discretion.\n\nSee Diefenbach v.

Malcolm’s qualifications as a fire analyst are, in\n\nfact, considerable.            He has master and journeyman electrical\n\nlicenses from Massachusetts and New Hampshire; he has been\n\nconsulting as a fire investigator since 1963; and, in 1991, he\n\nwas     qualified     as   a    Certified     Fire   Investigator   by    the\n\nInternational Association of Arson Investigators.                Malcolm had\n\nbeen qualified twice before as an expert in this case to render\n\nan opinion regarding the electrical system’s contribution to the\n\nfire aboard the vessel.4            After hearing Malcolm’s testimony\n\n\n      4F&D argues in an aside that Malcolm’s qualifications as a\ncause-and-origin expert were rejected by two previous trial\njudges and that this is proof that Malcolm should not have been\nable to testify as a cause-and-origin expert during the third\ntrial before Judge Harrington. It is not clear to us, however,\nthat the two judges presiding in the previous trials believed\nthat Malcolm lacked qualifications as a cause-and-origin expert.\nThese judges limited Malcolm’s testimony to electrical systems\nin trials where O’Donnell was offered as the defendant’s cause-\nand-origin expert. Limiting Malcolm’s role where someone else\nwas tendered as the cause-and-origin expert expedited the trial\nby eliminating duplicative testimony. Neither district judge\ndetermined that Malcolm was not qualified as an expert on cause\nand   origin   should   O’Donnell   have   failed  to   testify.\nFurthermore, the views of prior judges about Malcolm would be\nlargely irrelevant here. A presiding judge has broad discretion\nin his or her determinations regarding expert qualifications.\nSee Poulin v.

See Richmond Steel, 954 F.2d at 20.\n\n            1.          Rule 703 Objection\n\n            F&D’s next objection, although not crafted as such, is\n\nessentially a Rule 703 objection.                  F&D claims that Malcolm’s\n\nopinion as to cause and origin was based on unreliable data,\n\nviz, data provided by the late Fred O’Donnell and not that which\n\nwas collected through Malcolm’s own personal observation.\n\n            A major problem with this argument is that Malcolm\n\nhimself had visited the fire scene and examined the evidence\n\nthere side by side with O’Donnell.                   Besides looking at burn\n\npatterns     and        studying     the     electrical        system,       he    took\n\nmeasurements and photographs and wrote his own report.                           He also\n\ninterviewed the vessel’s engineer.                Many photographs of evidence\n\nat the scene were entered into evidence by stipulation.                           Hence,\n\n\n\n\n517, 139 L.

But the opinion he rendered was his\n\nown, and, as said, he had first-hand knowledge of the fire scene\n\nand the observable facts there upon which to base that opinion.\n\nFederal    Rule    of   Evidence    703   allows   Malcolm    to   have   taken\n\nO’Donnell’s report and opinion into account when forming his own\n\nexpert opinion.         So long as the basis of Malcolm’s opinion did\n\nnot extend beyond facts or data “of a type reasonably relied\n\nupon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or\n\ninferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be\n\nadmissible in evidence.”           Fed.

In the\n\npresent case, the jury understood that Malcolm’s observations\n\ncoincided with those of the deceased expert hired by defendant\n\nand that, until recently, Malcolm’s only job was to advise and\n\nsupplement O’Donnell’s conclusions as to the cause and origin of\n\nthe   fire    with    his      own   opinion     concerning       the   role   of    the\n\nvessel’s electrical system in the fire.                     Thus, in weighing and\n\nevaluating Malcolm’s opinion, the jury was able to determine\n\nwhether      it   was     in     some    way     weakened     by     reliance       upon\n\nO’Donnell’s.\n\n             We find no error in the district court’s ruling that\n\nMalcolm’s opinion as to cause and origin was properly admitted.\n\n             2.         No Prejudice in Last-Minute Expert Designation\n\n             F&D’s next objection to Malcolm’s testimony is that F&D\n\nwas prejudiced by Malcolm’s tardy designation as the cause-and-\n\norigin    expert.         On    June    21,    1999,   at   the    first   pre-trial\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fconference before Judge Harrington following the mandate from\n\nthis court, St. Paul informed both F&D and the district court of\n\nits decision to proceed without a replacement for O’Donnell and\n\nwith   Malcolm    as    both    its   cause-and-origin      expert    and     its\n\nelectrical systems expert.            The trial was set for October 4,\n\n1999, more than three months later.                 F&D contends that three\n\nmonths before the trial was too late to be designating a new\n\nexpert.     Furthermore, F&D contends that had St. Paul wished to\n\navoid the prejudice of such a tardy expert designation, St. Paul\n\nshould have supplemented its answers to interrogatories naming\n\nMalcolm as the substitute expert for the late O’Donnell and\n\ndisclosing the content of his expanded testimony.\n\n            At a final pre-trial conference on October 1, 1999,\n\nJudge Harrington heard arguments and informed both parties that\n\nas long as defendant could qualify Malcolm as an expert on cause\n\nand origin, his testimony as to cause and origin would be\n\nadmitted.     Also at that pre-trial conference, Judge Harrington\n\nallowed plaintiff to add an expert to its witness list (Paul\n\nSullivan)    under     the   condition     that   defendant    be    given   the\n\nopportunity to depose the additional expert before the trial.\n\nPlaintiff did not request additional time to depose Malcolm,\n\nhowever, presumably because Malcolm had testified previously as\n\nan   electrical   expert       at   both   trials    and   because    St.    Paul\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\frepresented that Malcolm’s testimony as to cause and origin\n\nwould be substantially similar to the late O’Donnell’s testimony\n\non cause and origin.\n\n              We find no merit in F&D’s argument that June 21, 1999\n\nwas too late to designate a new expert.                  F&D itself designated\n\na replacement expert less than two weeks before trial.                      However,\n\nF&D rightly objects to St. Paul’s failure to supplement its\n\ninterrogatory answers or its expert reports naming Malcolm as\n\nthe   substitute          expert   for   the    late    O’Donnell     and    adding\n\nMalcolm’s expanded testimony pursuant to Rule 26 of the Federal\n\nRules    of   Civil       Procedure.

The question\n\nhere is whether St. Paul’s failure to adhere strictly to the\n\nrequirements of Rule 26(e)(1) – failing to substitute Malcolm\n\nfor O’Donnell as its cause-and-origin expert in their expert\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fdisclosures – thwarted the reason for the rule and materially\n\nprejudiced F&D in its efforts to present its case.\n\n         A careful review of the record convinces us that F&D\n\nsuffered no actual prejudice.    First, F&D in fact had notice of\n\nMalcolm’s designation as the cause-and-origin expert as early as\n\nJune 1999, more than three months before the trial date.         See\n\nNewell Puerto Rico, 20 F.3d at 20.            F&D moved neither to\n\nredepose Malcolm (as St. Paul did of F&D’s newly designated\n\nexpert Paul Sullivan) nor for a continuance of the trial.\n\n         Second, there was no meaningful change in the testimony\n\npresented by St. Paul regarding cause and origin from the first\n\ntrial to the third.   The only consequential change to which F&D\n\nobjects was that O’Donnell’s cause-and-origin testimony was\n\nreplaced by similar testimony from Malcolm.        Yet not only was\n\nMalcolm’s testimony similar to O’Donnell’s, Malcolm himself was\n\nnot an unknown quantity to F&D.        He had testified as an expert\n\nwitness in the two previous trials and had made clear as early\n\nas in 1995, during deposition testimony and trial testimony,\n\nthat he thought the fire was deliberately set with three points\n\nof origin.   For this reason, F&D’s contention that the content\n\nof Malcolm’s expert opinion came as a surprise is unpersuasive.\n\nThis is not a case in which the expert’s testimony departed from\n\nthe general scheme of his opinion or any other expert opinion\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fsubmitted to F&D on behalf of St. Paul’s case.       Nor is it a case\n\nin which a party was hindered in its ability to formulate a\n\nresponse or adequately cross-examine the new expert as to the\n\nfoundations for his opinion.   See Johnson v. H.K. Webster, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459885\"><a href=\"/opinion/459885/raymond-johnson-v-hk-webster-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1985) (stating that among the factors to\n\nconsider when assessing a claim of error under Rule 26 is “the\n\nability of the [opposing party] to formulate a response”).       When\n\nasked during oral argument of this appeal whether Malcolm’s\n\ntestimony was contrary to or in a material way different from\n\nhis opinion as contained in the reports submitted to F&D, F&D’s\n\ncounsel conceded that Malcolm did not change his opinion, but\n\nrather he only expanded its scope to include that which was\n\npreviously encompassed by O’Donnell’s testimony and reports.       As\n\nwe can see no material prejudice, we affirm the trial court’s\n\nadmission of Malcolm’s testimony.     In so doing, we of course do\n\nnot condone St. Paul’s failure to adhere to its Rule 26(e)(1)\n\nobligations, a mistake which has needlessly burdened the parties\n\nand this court with an appellate issue.\n\nC.   Malcolm’s Reference Under Cross-Examination to Protective\n\nOrder\n\n          Plaintiff’s third claim of trial error concerns a\n\npurported violation of a protective order into which the parties\n\nentered   in   1995.   Plaintiff   contends   that   John   Malcolm’s\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fresponse to a question on cross-examination was a deliberate\n\ndisclosure of information subject to that protective order and\n\nso prejudiced the case against F&D that Judge Harrington abused\n\nhis discretion when he failed to grant plaintiff’s motion for a\n\nmistrial.    In context of the whole colloquy between plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel and Malcolm, Judge Harrington’s instructions to the jury\n\nand Malcolm’s answer to plaintiff’s follow-up question, we find\n\nno prejudice and no trial error.               Before we explain, some\n\nbackground history is necessary.\n\n            In 1995, during a pre-trial conference preceding the\n\nfirst trial, another district judge issued a protective order\n\nthat was to follow the parties throughout the case before him\n\nand through any subsequent proceedings.               That order prevented\n\nany   mention     during   trial   of   an    alleged    anonymous    police\n\ninformant who, among other things, reported witnessing a man\n\nrunning away from the F/V TWO FRIENDS just moments before the\n\nfire began.     (The order resulted from the refusal of the police\n\nofficer to name the informant.)         Although the testifying experts\n\nin the case, including John Malcolm, knew of the anonymous\n\ninformant   and    of   the   protective     order,   the   specter   of   the\n\nanonymous informant remained out of the jury’s view until, at\n\nleast, the incident in question.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f            During the third trial, in an apparent attempt to draw\n\nthe   jury’s     attention    to   the   alleged     fact   that   Malcolm    had\n\nlimited personal knowledge of the fire scene, plaintiff began\n\ngrilling Malcolm on cross-examination as to the source and depth\n\nof his knowledge.        Plaintiff asked:\n\n            Question:        “You didn’t discover in your\n                             investigation of this fire any\n                             witnesses to the fire, did you?”\n            Malcolm:         “Myself, no, because again –“\n            Question:        “Okay, you found no witnesses to\n                             the   fire.     In   fact,   the\n                             information you have is that\n                             nobody was on that vessel for a\n                             full ten hours prior to the\n                             Gloucester    Fire    Department\n                             responding to that fire; isn’t\n                             that   right?  Isn’t   that  the\n                             information that you have?”\n\nAware that there were allegations of such an eyewitness, but\n\nthat he was not allowed to say so, Malcolm responded:                  “Well, I\n\nhave some other information that I don’t believe we’re supposed\n\nto talk about.”\n\n            An    immediate       side-bar   ensued     during     which    Judge\n\nHarrington,      who   had   no    knowledge    of    the   protective     order,\n\nlearned of its purpose and parameters.                 Plaintiff moved for a\n\nmistrial.        Judge   Harrington      denied      plaintiff’s    motion    and\n\nsolicited suggestions from both counsel about how to correct the\n\nerroneous      disclosure.         Counsel     discussed    various    ways    of\n\nrephrasing the question so that Malcolm would deny any personal\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fknowledge of witnesses to the fire.                   When the side-bar ended,\n\nJudge Harrington instructed the jury that the last question and\n\nthe last answer were stricken and were not to be considered\n\nevidence    in    the      case.     Plaintiff’s       counsel        then    asked    the\n\nfollowing    question        --     “Mr.    Malcolm,      you    have    no     personal\n\nknowledge that anyone was on that vessel for ten hours before\n\nthe Gloucester Fire Department responded to that fire; is that\n\ncorrect?”    --       to    which    Malcolm      replied,      “That’s        correct.”\n\nPlaintiff’s counsel continued with the cross-examination and the\n\nmatter was left to rest, never to be mentioned again until the\n\npost-trial motion for sanctions.\n\n            Our decision to uphold the district court’s ruling\n\nrequires only a brief explanation.                    First, Malcolm’s initial\n\nresponse to plaintiff’s question did not reveal the existence of\n\nan anonymous informant with information tending to show that the\n\nfire aboard the F/V TWO FRIENDS was an act of arson, an answer\n\nprohibited       by   the    protective      order.       To    the     contrary,      all\n\nMalcolm’s     answer        suggested       was    that    he     had        some    other\n\ninformation about the circumstances surrounding the fire that he\n\nwas not permitted to reveal.                Whether the information that he\n\nhad and that he was required to keep confidential would further\n\nplaintiff’s       case      or    defendant’s      case    was    not        clear    from\n\nMalcolm’s statement.               Furthermore, had Malcolm affirmed, as\n\n\n                                           -28-\n\fplaintiff desired, that the information he had was that nobody\n\nwas on the vessel for a full ten hours prior to the Gloucester\n\nFire Department responding to that fire,                Malcolm would have\n\nbeen stating a literal untruth.          A better phrased question, such\n\nas the one that followed the side-bar, would have side-stepped\n\nany trouble, enabling Malcolm to testify truthfully yet adhere\n\nto the terms of the protective order.5\n\n            Second,    any    remote    prejudice    that   plaintiff   could\n\narguably claim is alleviated by Malcolm’s answer to plaintiff’s\n\nfollow-up      question      and   by     Judge     Harrington’s   curative\n\ninstructions, striking the first question and answer.                   Judge\n\nHarrington immediately instructed the jury to strike the first\n\nquestion and answer, that they were not to consider it as\n\nevidence in the case. See United States v.

In fact,\n    the information you have is that nobody was on that\n    vessel for a full ten hours prior to the Gloucester\n    Fire Department responding to that fire; isn’t that\n    right? Isn’t that the information that you have?”\n\nwith the second, follow-up question,\n\n    “Mr. Malcolm, you have no personal knowledge that\n    anyone was on that vessel for ten hours before the\n    Gloucester Fire Department responded to that fire; is\n    that correct?”.\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fjudicial    response     is   an     important        element    in     alleviating\n\nprejudice    once    the      jury      has    been     exposed       to    improper\n\ntestimony”).     It is presumed that the jury will follow such\n\ninstructions unless “it appears probable that ... responsible\n\njurors will not be able to ... and, moreover, that the testimony\n\nwill likely be seriously prejudicial to the aggrieved party.”\n\nId. at 1185.   Plaintiff cannot show a likelihood of prejudice as\n\nMalcolm’s    response    to   F&D’s      follow-up      question,       a   slightly\n\ndifferent (but better) version of the first question, see note\n\n7 supra, placed before the jury the favorable testimony that F&D\n\nhad sought from the original question. The jury heard Malcolm’s\n\nunqualified denial that he had any personal knowledge that\n\nsomeone had been aboard the F/V TWO FRIENDS between the hours of\n\n4:30 p.m. on July 2nd and 2:30 a.m. on July 3rd of 1993.\n\n            In sum, Judge Harrington’s rapid curative instruction\n\nin addition to the follow-up question and answer eliminated any\n\nremote possibility of prejudice.              Judge Harrington did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial.\n\nSee   Sepulveda,    15   F.3d      at   1184    (standard       under      which   the\n\nappellate court reviews the district court’s granting or denial\n\nof a motion for a mistrial is abuse of discretion).\n\n\n\n                         III.      REMAINING ISSUES\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f            Plaintiff raises two other issues on appeal, both of\n\nwhich lack merit.        We discuss them briefly below.\n\nA.     Plaintiff’s Post-Trial Motion for Sanctions\n\n            After the jury returned a verdict for the defendant,\n\nF&D    filed a host of post-trial motions, among them a motion for\n\nsanctions based on what it alleges was a “knowing violation of\n\nthe [protective order]. It is the plaintiff’s position that this\n\nviolation was intentional, and that the statement was made with\n\nthe explicit purpose of prejudicing the jury.”               When considered\n\nalong side of other purported discovery abuses, plaintiff claims\n\nthat the district court’s denial of sanctions was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            As we have already determined, Malcolm’s answer was not\n\nunwarranted in response to the question asked.               His interrogator\n\nwas at least as much at fault as Malcolm in eliciting an answer\n\nthat     skirted   the    outer    limits    of    the    protective    order.\n\nMoreover,    F&D   suffered       little    if    any    prejudice   from   the\n\nexchange.     In the circumstances, and taking into account the\n\nfact that the district judge, who had lived with the case, was\n\nunpersuaded that plaintiff had cleared the high hurdle required\n\nto support a claim of fraud on the court or a motion for\n\nsanctions,    we   can   only     affirm    the   district    court’s   ruling\n\ndenying plaintiff’s motion for sanctions. See Spiller v. U.S.V.\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fLaboratories, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503429\"><a href=\"/opinion/503429/michael-e-spiller-v-us-v-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating\n\nthat a party complaining to an appellate tribunal with respect\n\nto trial-level sanctions \"bears a heavy burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the trial judge was clearly not justified in entering [the]\n\norder\").

Plaintiff’s Challenge to Ferrara I\n\n               Plaintiff’s remaining challenge to the judgment below\n\nis an assertion that the district court “erred in following the\n\nreasoning of the United States Court of Appeals in the case of\n\n[Ferrara I], in concluding that the defendant need only prove\n\nthat     the    fire   in   question     was     incendiary    in    nature    or\n\ndeliberately set.”          Appellant’s Brief at 10.           Citing      United\n\nStates    v.     Rivera-Martinez,      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559873\"><a href=\"/opinion/559873/united-states-v-hector-rivera-martinez-aka-el-men/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st    Cir.   1991),\n\nplaintiff argues that the district court should have reevaluated\n\n\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\fthis court’s reasoning and deviated from the holding of Ferrara\n\nI in order to avoid manifest injustice.\n\n             Putting aside the impropriety of asking a district\n\ncourt to overturn a determination made by this court, we observe\n\nthat plaintiff never asked Judge Harrington to deviate from the\n\nholding of     Ferrara I.        On the contrary, during a pre-trial\n\ncolloquy, the parties discussed with the district court the way\n\nto    best   formulate       jury   questions         and     decide   issues    of\n\nadmissibility of evidence in light of the holding of Ferrara I.\n\nThe wording of the question put to the jury, “Do you find that\n\nthe defendant ... has established by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence     that    the    fire    was    of    an     incendiary     nature     or\n\ndeliberately set?”, was stipulated to by both parties, obviating\n\nany   possible      claim   at   this     time   that       the   question   itself\n\noversimplified Ferrara I’s holding.                   It is axiomatic that an\n\nissue not presented to the trial court cannot be raised for the\n\nfirst time on appeal absent plain error.                    See Hammond v. T.J.\n\nLitle & Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717545\"><a href=\"/opinion/717545/scott-p-hammond-v-tj-litle-company-inc-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172 (1st Cir. 1996).                       Nor are\n\nthere reasons apparent from the record for abandoning the law of\n\nthe case doctrine.         See Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d at 151 (citing\n\nthe “litany of exceptional circumstances sufficient to sidetrack\n\nthe law of the case” -- such as “the evidence on a subsequent\n\ntrial was substantially different, controlling authority has\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fsince made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such\n\nissues, or the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a\n\nmanifest injustice”).\n\n         For all of these reasons, we find no error in the\n\ndistrict court’s rulings.   The judgment below is affirmed.\n\n         So ordered. Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                              -34-\n\f-35-\n\f</pre>",
