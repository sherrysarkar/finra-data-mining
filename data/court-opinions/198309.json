Israel Santiago-Lugo (\"Santiago-\r\nLugo\") was the lead defendant in a fifty-count indictment returned\r\non June 7, 1995, in the District of Puerto Rico.  Count 1 of the\r\nindictment charged Santiago-Lugo and thirty co-defendants with\r\nconspiracy to possess cocaine base, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana\r\nwith intent to distribute from 1988 through the date of the\r\nindictment, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  846.  Count 2 charged\r\nSantiago-Lugo and several co-defendants with engaging in a\r\ncontinuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2 and\r\n21 U.S.C.  848, and further alleged that Santiago-Lugo was the\r\nprincipal administrator, organizer, and leader of the enterprise. \r\nCounts 4 through 45 charged Santiago-Lugo and various co-defendants\r\nwith engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived\r\nproperty, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2 and 1957.  The jury\r\nreturned guilty verdicts on all counts.  The district court imposed\r\nconcurrent sentences of life imprisonment as to Count 2 and\r\nimprisonment for 10 years as to each of counts 4 through 45, to be\r\nfollowed by concurrent five and three year terms of supervised\r\nrelease.  On appeal, Santiago-Lugo challenges procedural rulings\r\nmade by the trial court.  For the following reasons, we affirm.\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nSantiago-Lugo was the kingpin of a vast drug conspiracy. \r\nHis actions, and those of his associates, are fully documented in\r\nthis Court's opinions in United States v. Eulalio Candelaria-Silva,\r\nNo. 96-1711, slip op. (1st Cir. Jan. 22, 1999), United States v.\r\nLuis Candelaria-Silva, No. 97-1659, slip op. (1st Cir. Dec. 10,\r\n1998), and United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, No. 96-2187, slip op.\r\n(1st Cir. Nov. 17, 1998).\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Anonymous Jury\r\nThe need for the district court to empanel an anonymous\r\njury for Santiago-Lugo and his co-conspirators was enunciated by\r\nthis Court in Marrero-Ortiz, slip op. at 13-14.  We see no need to\r\nrethink our decision.\r\nII.  Jury Selection\r\nOur discussion of whether the district court violated\r\nSantiago's constitutional or statutory rights by excusing fourteen\r\njurors prior to voir dire is set forth in Eulalio Candelaria-Silva,\r\nslip op. at 12-25.  Suffice to say, we held that the district\r\ncourt's actions did not constitute reversible error.\r\nIII.  Unfair Trial\r\nSantiago-Lugo contends that the placement of a marshal\r\nnear the defense table during the testimony of Noem Garca-Otero,\r\nin conjunction with the anonymous jury, resulted in erosion of the\r\npresumption of innocence and, therefore, an unfair trial.  His\r\nclaim is without merit.\r\nFirst, Santiago-Lugo did not even object to the marshal's\r\nlocation at trial.  In fact, none of the attorneys who inquired\r\nabout the marshal's presence expressed any concern that his\r\npresence would unfairly convey the message that the defendants were\r\ndangerous to the jury.  Thus, the record offers no indication that\r\nthe marshal's presence and location was \"so inherently prejudicial\" \r\nas to deny the defendants a fair trial.  See Holbrook v. Flynn, 475\r\nU.S. 560, 570 (1986).  Where there is cause for security measures,\r\na \"slight degree of prejudice\" is tolerated.  See id. at 571.\r\nSecond, with respect to decisions about security at\r\ntrial, the trial judge \"must be accorded broad discretion.\"  United\r\nStates v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507, 1533 (8th Cir. 1995).  In this\r\ncase, the district court indicated that the U.S. Marshals Service\r\nhad requested the specific placement of the marshal.  The judge's\r\ndialogue with co-defendants' counsel appeared to reflect more\r\nconcern about the marshal overhearing what occurred at the defense\r\ntable than about the marshal's presence imparting to the jury a\r\npresumption of dangerousness.  Therefore, the court properly\r\nexercised its discretion in this matter and certainly did not\r\ncommit plain error.\r\nIV.  Conflict of Interest \r\nThe presumption in favor of a defendant's counsel of\r\nchoice \"may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual\r\nconflict, but by a showing of serious potential for conflict.\" \r\nWheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 164 (1989).  In each case,\r\nhowever, \"[t]he evaluation of the facts and circumstances . . .\r\nunder this standard must be left primarily to the informed judgment\r\nof the trial court.\"  Id.  Furthermore, although a district court\r\nmust inquire when advised of a potential conflict of interest, the\r\ncourt may rely on counsel's representations that no such conflict\r\nexists.  See United States v. Kliti, 156 F.3d 150, 153 (2d Cir.\r\n1998).  It is within the district court's discretion to override a\r\ndefendant's waiver of protection from a conflict of interest.  SeeWheat, 486 U.S. at 164.  Here, the district court properly\r\nexercised its discretion in accepting Santiago-Lugo's waiver of the\r\npotential conflict of interest identified by the government, and no\r\nactual conflict developed with respect to the evidence presented at\r\ntrial.\r\nThe government's conflict of interest pleadings reflected\r\nthat, prior to Santiago-Lugo's investment in the Magdalena S.E.\r\npartnership, his attorney, Humberto Ramrez-Ferrer (\"Ramrez\"), had\r\nbeen a partner.  Although correspondence from a bank was addressed\r\nto Ramrez as a partner in Magdalena for the period March-July\r\n1992, all other documentation and information reflected that\r\nRamrez's interest in the partnership terminated prior to Santiago-\r\nLugo's acquisition of a one-half interest in the partnership from\r\nJos Gmez-Cruz.  Thus, the only information linking Ramrez to\r\nSantiago-Lugo's financial transactions was the evidence--from which\r\nRamrez's name was redacted--that Ramrez provided and was paid for\r\nlegal services in conjunction with Santiago-Lugo's purchase of two\r\ngas stations.\r\nIn arguing that the district court should have\r\ndisqualified Ramrez as his attorney, Santiago-Lugo highlights\r\ntheir participation in the Magdalena partnership and legal services\r\nthat Ramrez subsequently provided to Santiago-Lugo--some in\r\nrelation to Santiago-Lugo's interest in the partnership. \r\nWhile it is true that an actual conflict exists where\r\ncounsel's representation of a defendant precludes the admission of\r\nfavorable or exculpatory evidence, see Kliti, 156 F.3d at 157, this\r\ncase does not present such a circumstance.  First, Ramrez's\r\ninvolvement in Magdalena, including the partnership's purchase of\r\nreal estate in 1989, was completely unrelated to the transactions\r\nrelevant to this case.  Second, Ramrez withdrew from the\r\npartnership prior to Santiago-Lugo's purchase of a one-half\r\ninterest from Gmez-Cruz for $250,000 in 1992.  \r\nThere is no information in the record supporting the\r\nallegation that Ramrez possessed knowledge bearing on the sources\r\nof the illicit funds attributed to Santiago-Lugo.  Santiago-Lugo's\r\nclaim that the district court should have disqualified his attorney \r\nis without merit.\r\nV.  Inadequate Representation\r\nSantiago-Lugo alleges that Ramrez failed to adequately\r\ncross-examine the expert accountant, Pablo Montes.  He also alleges\r\nthat another of his attorneys, Erick Morales: (1) failed to bring\r\nforth witnesses who could have identified his brother, Ral\r\nSantiago-Lugo, as the leader of the conspiracy; (2) elicited\r\ndamaging information from a government agent and a cooperating\r\nwitness; and (3) hurt his cause by arguing with the district court\r\nover evidentiary and procedural matters.\r\nHowever, the appellate record does not indicate that any\r\nof these claims was properly raised before and/or addressed by the\r\ndistrict court.  Moreover, our review of the record persuades us\r\nthat the record is not sufficiently developed for us to address the\r\nmerits of Santiago-Lugo's Sixth Amendment claim at this time. \r\nAccordingly, we do not reach it.  See, e.g., United States v. Gray,\r\n958 F.2d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Time and again we have held that\r\na claim of inadequate representation will not be resolved on direct\r\nappeal when the claim has not been raised in the district court,\r\nunless the critical facts are not in dispute and a sufficiently\r\ndeveloped record exists.\"); see also United States v. Hoyos-Medina,\r\n878 F.2d 21, 22 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"Fairness to the parties and\r\njudicial economy both warrant that, absent extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, an appellate court will not consider an ineffective\r\nassistance claim where no endeavor was first made to determine the\r\nclaim at the district court level.\").\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the above reasons, we AFFIRM.\r\n",
