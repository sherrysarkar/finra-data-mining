Lussier for appellant.\n   Carol N. Glick, with whom John G. Hines and Hines and Patz,\nInc., were on brief, for appellees.\n\nMay 20, 1999\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  In this diversity action,\nplaintiff-appellant Robert Drohan appeals the entry of judgment\nagainst him in his negligence suit against defendants-appellees\nNorman Vaughn, Jr. and Constance Norton.  We affirm.  \n                       I. Background\nOn June 28, 1994, Drohan, a detective with the Special\nInvestigations Bureau of the Providence Police Department, assisted\nin the execution of a search warrant at 10 Marcello Street, a\nthree-story apartment building owned by Norton and maintained by\nher husband Vaughn.  The warrant authorized a search of the first\nfloor apartment, as well as of the persons of Louis E. Luciano and\nJoAnna Caraballo, two suspected drug dealers who rented the\napartment.\nAccording to Drohan, he was approximately the fourth\nofficer to enter the premises through a side door, which led into\na narrow hallway.  The first floor apartment door was located off\nthe hallway, and to the immediate left, about five feet away, was\nanother door leading to the basement of the building.  Drohan\ntestified that the door to the basement was open, though he did not\nknow how or when it had been opened.  \nThe officers did a sweep of the first floor apartment,\nbut did not find the suspects.  Drohan testified that he heard a\nnoise coming from the direction of the basement and that he\nfollowed two other detectives through the basement door and down\nthe steps in the belief that the suspects might have been hiding\ndown there.  The steps, which were unlighted and without a\nhandrail, had cracked treads.  Drohan stated that, as he was\ndescending the stairway, one of the steps \"let go\" and \"lurched\nforward.\"  Drohan fell and injured his leg.  There was no one found\nin the basement.\nVaughn testified that the basement was off limits to\ntenants.  There was no testimony indicating that Vaughn had\ndifficulties keeping tenants out of the basement after he installed\nthe lock on the basement door, which he did shortly after he bought\nthe property.  Although he always kept the basement door locked, he\nstated that he could not swear that the door was locked on that\nday.  Upon inspection after the raid, the lock to the basement door\nwas found broken, with the catch on the floor.  There was no other\ndamage to the door.\nAfter a four-day trial, the court instructed the jury\nconcerning, inter alia, what circumstances would constitute lawful\nauthorization for Drohan to be in the basement.  The court stated\nthat if Drohan were not lawfully authorized to enter the basement,\nthe jury must return a verdict for defendants, because a\nlandowner's only duty to a trespasser is to refrain from causing\nhim wanton or willful injury, and that there was no evidence that\nthis injury was wanton or willful.  In response to a special\ninterrogatory, the jury found that Drohan was a trespasser, and\nreturned a verdict for defendants.\nOn appeal, Drohan challenges, on several different\ngrounds, the court's jury instructions, special interrogatory form,\nand refusal to admit certain evidence.\n                        II. Analysis\nA. Jury Instructions\nDrohan first objects to the jury instructions regarding\nhis authorization to be in the basement stairway.  The court gave,\nin relevant part, the following instructions regarding Drohan's\nauthorization:\n    [T]he warrant did not authorize the\nPlaintiff to enter or search any other part of\nthe building [other than the first floor\napartment], nor did it authorize the Plaintiff\nto enter any other part of the building for\nthe purpose of finding the two individuals\nnamed in the warrant in order to search them. \nIf in the course of searching the first-floor\napartment, the individuals had been\ndiscovered, then the warrant would have\npermitted the police officers to search those\nindividuals, but it did not authorize the\npolice to go throughout the entire building in\norder to find those persons in order to search\nthem.\n    However, . . . notwithstanding the fact\nthat the warrant didn't specifically authorize\nit, the Plaintiff would have been lawfully\nauthorized to enter the basement stairway, if\nhe had good reason to believe that there were\nindividuals hiding in the basement, whose\npresence created a risk of harm to him or to\nothers, and that entering the basement was\nnecessary in order to protect against that\nrisk of harm.\n    In order to establish that, the\nPlaintiff must point to specific facts\njustifying such a belief.  It isn't enough for\ncounsel to simply argue in the abstract that\nthis kind of thing is commonly done or should\nbe done . . . .      \nDrohan argues that these instructions were erroneous in\nthe following respects: (1) the warrant authorized Drohan to search\nfor the suspects anywhere on the premises; (2) regardless of the\nscope of the warrant, Drohan had an absolute right to sweep the\nbasement without reasonable suspicion; (3) even if a sweep of the\nbasement required reasonable suspicion, the court's charge that\nDrohan had to have a \"good reason\" set a higher standard than\nreasonable suspicion; and (4) the court did not use or define the\nterm \"protective sweep\" in giving this charge.  \nThe first three objections were not raised after the jury\nwas charged and before it retired to deliberate.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n51 states that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or\nfailure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto\nbefore the jury retires to consider its verdict . . . .\"  See also\nPutnam Resources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir. 1992)\n(stating that silence after jury instructions \"typically\nconstitutes a waiver of any objections\" for purposes of appeal). \nBecause Drohan did not object to the instructions, we review only\nfor plain error.  See Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.\n1995).  Thus, we reverse only if there is a \"plain\" or \"obvious\"\nerror that \"affect[s] substantial rights\" and which has resulted in\na \"miscarriage of justice or has undermined the integrity of the\njudicial process.\"  Wilson v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1,\n6-7 (1st Cir. 1998).  \"The plain error standard, high in any\nevent, is near its zenith in the Rule 51 milieu.\"  Toscano v.\nChandris, 934 F.2d 383, 385 (1st Cir. 1991) (citations omitted). \nAs there has been no showing of a miscarriage of justice or an\neffect upon the integrity of the judicial process, we conclude that\nthere was no plain error.\nDrohan did, however, preserve his objection to the\ncourt's failure to use or define the term \"protective sweep.\"  \nEven if we assume arguendo that the instructions were erroneous in\nthis respect, we review the alleged error under the \"harmless\nerror\" rule: an error is not harmless if it \"affect[s] the\nsubstantial rights of the parties\" and is \"inconsistent with\nsubstantial justice.\"  Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys. Inc., 54 F.3d 931,\n939 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 61).  This circuit has\nheld that when executing a search warrant, officers can perform a\n\"protective sweep\" of an area if there is a reasonable suspicion of\nrisk to the safety of the officers.  See United States v. Daoust,\n916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir. 1990) (analogizing the situation to\nprotective sweeps done in conjunction with arrest warrants).  In\nso holding, we reiterated that in order to conduct a protective\nsweep, an officer must possess \"a reasonable belief based on\nspecific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an\nindividual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\"  Id.\n(quoting Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 337 (1990)).  \nWhile the district court in this case did not use the\nterm \"protective sweep,\" its jury instructions closely tracked the\nlanguage used in Daoust to describe a protective sweep.  We see no\nreason why the failure to use the actual term \"protective sweep\"\nwould in any way prejudice Drohan or affect the jury's decision \nmaking process.  Therefore, the alleged error, if any, would be\nharmless.\nB. The Trespasser and Scope of the Warrant Defenses \nClaiming that defendants based their trespasser and scope\nof the warrant defenses upon faulty legal theories, Drohan argues\nthat the court should have precluded defendants from presenting\nthese defenses.  Because Drohan did not move for judgment as a\nmatter of law, his arguments amount to a challenge of the court's\ndecision to instruct the jury: Drohan contends that the court\nshould never have presented these issues to the jury in its\ninstructions and special interrogatory form.  Drohan did not,\nhowever, object to the court's instructions or interrogatory form\non these bases.  Therefore, again, we review for plain error. \nDrohan has not met his burden of showing that the alleged errors\nresulted in a miscarriage of justice.  Indeed, Drohan has not even\ndemonstrated that there were any clear or obvious errors. \nAccordingly, we find no plain error in the presentation of these\ndefenses to the jury.\nC. Special Interrogatory Form\nDrohan contends that the special interrogatory form\nimproperly asked the jury to reach a legal conclusion as to\nDrohan's authorization to enter the basement.  Drohan argues that\nthe court should instead have asked the jury to determine the\nexistence of \"duty triggering facts\" (such as whether the basement\ndoor was open), and then decided as a matter of law the ultimate\nissue of whether Drohan was a trespasser.\nThe form read, in pertinent part:\n  Question 1.  When the plaintiff entered the\nstairway leading to the basement was he:\n                A lawful entrant who was authorized to\n       enter the stairway or\n                A trespasser who was not authorized to\n       enter the stairway?\n    If your answer is that he was a\ntrespasser, do not answer any further\nquestions and return a verdict in favor of the\ndefendants.\n\nWhen asked if he had any objections to this form,\nDrohan's counsel stated: \"Yes.  The only question we had was the\nseparation of the status as to whether or not the Officer was a\ntrespasser being separated from the other issues in the\ncase . . . . We would object to the separation of question number\none from other general issues in the case.\"  Because Drohan did not\nobject to the status question being decided by the jury or to the\nwording of the question, we review the special interrogatory for\nplain error only.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 769\n(1st Cir. 1990) (Rule 51 applies to special interrogatories as well\nas to verbal instructions).  As there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport the jury's decision, any error in having the jury, rather\nthan the court, decide the trespasser issue is hardly a\n\"miscarriage of justice\" or a violation of \"the integrity of the\njudicial process.\"  Wilson, 150 F.3d at 6-7.  We therefore decline\nto find plain error. \nD. Testimony Regarding the Protective Sweep\nDrohan complains that he was not permitted, on direct\nexamination, to testify as to his subjective understanding of the\npurpose of a protective sweep.  We review the exclusion of evidence\nfor abuse of discretion.  See Bates v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc.,\n42 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir. 1994).  We are not convinced that Drohan's\ntestimony would have been relevant to the jury's deliberation. \nDrohan's subjective understanding of his authority to search the\ncellar has little correlation to his actual authority.  Therefore,\nwe find no abuse of discretion in excluding this testimony.\nE. Housing Codes Evidence\nDrohan argues that, even given a finding that he was a\ntrespasser, he still could have been the subject of wanton or\nwillful injury, and therefore entitled to relief.  He contends that\nthe court improperly excluded the evidence that would have shown\nthat defendants' behavior was wanton or willful.  We review the\nexclusion of this evidence for abuse of discretion.  See id.\nTo bolster his contention that the injury was wanton or\nwillful, Drohan sought to introduce information about three housing\ncodes -- the Rhode Island State Building Code (the \"State Building\nCode\"), the Rhode Island Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code\n(the \"Occupancy Code\"), and the Providence Minimum Standards\nHousing Ordinance (the \"Providence Housing Ordinance\") -- into\nevidence.  More importantly, he sought on direct examination to\nquestion Vaughn about his knowledge of these codes and whether he\nknowingly violated them.  Drohan claims that if he could have shown\nthat Vaughn knowingly violated the codes, Vaughn's behavior could\nhave been construed as wanton or willful. \nEven if Drohan could have shown a violation of the codes,\nwe doubt that such a violation, standing alone, would be enough to\nshow wanton or willful injury.  But, at any rate, the district\ncourt's determination that the codes were inapplicable to the\nbasement of the 10 Marcello Street building is amply supported by\nthe evidence.\nThe State Building Code is only applicable to structures\nbuilt after 1977, see R.I. Gen. Laws  23-27.3-105.1, or to\nbuildings which have been significantly altered since 1977, see id.\nat  23-27.3-106.1 - 106.4.  Drohan claims that the post-1977\nconversion of the building from a two-apartment to a three-\napartment building qualified the building under this statute.  He\nsuggests that any \"change in use\" to a property makes the building\nsubject to the code, citing section 23-27.3-105.2.  He misreads\nsection 23-27.3-105.2, which only states that if a change in use\nmakes the building subject to the code, certain procedures must be\nfollowed.  See id. at  23-27.3-105.2 (\"It shall be unlawful to\nmake any change in the use or occupancy of any structure or part\nthereof which would subject it to provision of this code without\nthe approval of the building officials . . . .\") (emphasis added). \nSections 23-27.3-106.1 - 106.4 dictate when a change makes a\nbuilding subject to the code, and those sections distinctly state\nthat an alteration must cost a certain percentage of the building's\nvalue in order to trigger the code's requirements for new\nstructures.  See, e.g., id. at  23-27.3-106.1 (applying the code's\nrequirements to any building in which alterations in excess of\nfifty percent of the physical value of the building have been\nmade).  Drohan provided no evidence that the alterations to the\nMarcello Street building cost a significant enough percentage of\nthe building's value to trigger the State Building Code's\nrequirements.\nAlthough the Occupancy Code does apply to buildings\nerected before 1977, its provisions only relate to the portions of\na building used or intended to be used for the purposes of a\ndwelling.  See id. at  45-24.3-4 (\"Applicability. -- (a) Every\nportion of a building or its premises used or intended to be used\nfor the purpose of dwelling, living, eating, sleeping, or cooking\ntherein, or occupancy, shall comply with the provisions of this\nchapter . . . .\").  The Occupancy Code defines \"dwelling\" as \"any\nenclosed space which is wholly or partly used or intended to be\nused for living or sleeping by human occupants . . . .\"  Id. at\n45-24.3-5.  Because the basement, which was off limits to\ntenants, does not fit the definition of a dwelling space, the\nOccupancy Code is inapplicable.\nFinally, the Providence Housing Ordinance applies to all\nbuildings, irrespective of when they were built.  Drohan claims\nthat defendants violated section 13-155 of this code.  See\nProvidence, R.I., Code of Municipal Ordinances, ch. 13,  155\n(requiring proper lighting for common stairways).  Section 13-155,\nhowever, only applies to \"common stairways.\"  See id.  The Rhode\nIsland Supreme Court has defined a common area, in another context,\nas a portion of the premises which is controlled by the landlord\nand used in common by the tenants.  See Gormley v. Vartian, 403\nA.2d 256, 261 (R.I. 1979) (discussing a landlord's duty to maintain\ncommon areas).  In this case, the basement stairway was not used in\ncommon by the tenants, and therefore is not governed by section 13-\n155.  Similarly, Drohan's claim that section 13-185 of the\nProvidence Housing Ordinance applies to the basement stairway is\nalso incorrect.  See Providence, R.I., Code of Municipal\nOrdinances, ch. 13,  185 (stating that every stairway shall be\nkept in good repair).  Section 13-185 is a section of Article IX,\nwhich applies only to dwellings or dwelling units.  See id. at ch.\n13,  182 (\"Compliance with article required.  No person shall\noccupy as owner-occupant or permit to be occupied by another, any\ndwelling or dwelling unit which does not comply with the following\nrequirements of this article.\").  The Providence Housing Ordinance\ndefines \"dwelling\" as \"any building or part thereof which is wholly\nor partly used or intended to be used for living and sleeping by\none or more occupants\" and \"dwelling unit\" as \"any room or group of\nrooms within a dwelling and forming a single and separate habitable\nunit.\"  Id. at ch. 13,  1.  Thus, section 13-185 appears to be\ninapplicable to a non-dwelling space such as the basement in\nquestion.\nBecause none of the building codes applies to the\nbasement of the Marcello Street property, the court did not abuse\nits discretion in excluding evidence related to the codes. \n                      III. Conclusion\nWe have considered and rejected Drohan's remaining\narguments, which we find to be entirely unpersuasive.\nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment\nof the district court.\nAffirmed.

Cabletron Sys. Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 939 (1st Cir.1995) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 61).  This circuit has held that when executing a search warrant, officers can perform a \"protective sweep\" of an area if there is a reasonable suspicion of risk to the safety of the officers.  See United States v. Daoust, 916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir.1990) (analogizing the situation to protective sweeps done in conjunction with arrest warrants).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In so holding, we reiterated that in order to conduct a protective sweep, an officer must possess \"a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\"  Id. (quoting Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 337, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court in this case did not use the term \"protective sweep,\" its jury instructions closely tracked the language used in Daoust to describe a protective sweep.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We see no reason why the failure to use the actual term \"protective sweep\" would in any way prejudice Drohan or affect the jury's decision making process.  Therefore, the alleged error, if any, would be harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. The Trespasser and Scope of the Warrant Defenses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claiming that defendants based their trespasser and scope of the warrant defenses upon faulty legal theories, Drohan argues that the court should have precluded defendants from presenting these defenses.  Because Drohan did not move for judgment as a matter of law, his arguments amount to a challenge of the court's decision to instruct the jury:  Drohan contends that the court should never have presented these issues to the jury in its instructions and special interrogatory form.  Drohan did not, however, object to the court's instructions or interrogatory form on these bases.  Therefore, again, we review for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Drohan has not met his burden of showing that the alleged errors resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  Indeed, Drohan has not even demonstrated that there were any clear or obvious errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Accordingly, we find no plain error in the presentation of these defenses to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Special Interrogatory Form</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan contends that the special interrogatory form improperly asked the jury to reach a legal conclusion as to Drohan's authorization to enter the basement.  Drohan argues that the court should instead have asked the jury to determine the existence of \"duty triggering facts\" (such as whether the basement door was open), and then decided as a matter of law the ultimate issue of whether Drohan was a trespasser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The form read, in pertinent part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Question 1. When the plaintiff entered the stairway leading to the basement was he:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">_____ A lawful entrant who was authorized to enter the stairway or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">_____ A trespasser who was not authorized to enter the stairway?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If your answer is that he was a trespasser, do not answer any further questions and return a verdict in favor of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if he had any objections to this form, Drohan's counsel stated:  \"Yes.  The only question we had was the separation of the status as to whether or not the Officer was a trespasser being separated from the other issues in the case....  We would object to the separation of question number one from other general issues in the case.\"   Because Drohan did not object to the status question being decided by the jury or to the wording of the question, we review the special interrogatory for plain error only.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 769 (1st Cir.1990) (Rule 51 applies to special interrogatories as well as to verbal instructions).  As there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's decision, any error in having the jury, rather than the court, decide the trespasser issue is hardly a \"miscarriage of justice\" or a violation of \"the integrity of the judicial process.\"  Wilson, 150 F.3d at 6-7.   We therefore decline to find plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Testimony Regarding the Protective Sweep</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan complains that he was not permitted, on direct examination, to testify as to his subjective understanding of the purpose of a protective sweep.  We review the exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.  See Bates v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 42 F.3d 79, 83 (1st Cir.1994).  We are not convinced that Drohan's testimony would have been relevant to the jury's deliberation.  Drohan's subjective understanding of his authority to search the cellar has little correlation to his actual authority.  Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in excluding this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Housing Codes Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan argues that, even given a finding that he was a trespasser, he still could have been the subject of wanton or willful injury, and therefore entitled to relief.  He contends that the court improperly excluded the evidence that would have shown that defendants' behavior was wanton or willful.  We review the exclusion of this evidence for abuse of discretion.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bolster his contention that the injury was wanton or willful, Drohan sought to introduce information about three housing codes--the Rhode Island State Building Code (the \"State Building Code\"), the Rhode Island Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code (the \"Occupancy Code\"), and the Providence Minimum Standards Housing Ordinance (the \"Providence Housing Ordinance\")--into evidence.  More importantly, he sought on direct examination to question Vaughn about his knowledge of these codes and whether he knowingly violated them.  Drohan claims that if he could have shown that Vaughn knowingly violated the codes, Vaughn's behavior could have been construed as wanton or willful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Drohan could have shown a violation of the codes, we doubt that such a violation, standing alone, would be enough to show wanton or willful injury.  But, at any rate, the district court's determination that the codes were inapplicable to the basement of the 10 Marcello Street building is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State Building Code is only applicable to structures built after 1977, see R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 23-27.3-105.1, or to buildings which have been significantly altered since 1977, see id. at &#167; 23-27.3-106.1--106.4.  Drohan claims that the post-1977 conversion of the building from a two-apartment to a three-apartment building qualified the building under this statute.  He suggests that any \"change in use\" to a property makes the building subject to the code, citing section 23-27.3-105.2.  He misreads section 23-27.3-105.2, which only states that if a change in use makes the building subject to the code, certain procedures must be followed.  See id. at &#167; 23-27.3-105.2 (\"It shall be unlawful to make any change in the use or occupancy of any structure or part thereof which would subject it to provision of this code without the approval of the building officials ....\") (emphasis added).  Sections 23-27.3-106.1--106.4 dictate when a change makes a building subject to the code, and those sections distinctly state that an alteration must cost a certain percentage of the building's value in order to trigger the code's requirements for new structures.  See, e.g., id. at &#167; 23-27.3-106.1 (applying the code's requirements to any building in which alterations in excess of fifty percent of the physical value of the building have been made).  Drohan provided no evidence that the alterations to the Marcello Street building cost a significant enough percentage of the building's value to trigger the State Building Code's requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Occupancy Code does apply to buildings erected before 1977, its provisions only relate to the portions of a building used or intended to be used for the purposes of a dwelling.  See id. at &#167; 45-24.3-4 (\"Applicability.--(a) Every portion of a building or its premises used or intended to be used for the purpose of dwelling, living, eating, sleeping, or cooking therein, or occupancy, shall comply with the provisions of this chapter....\").  The Occupancy Code defines \"dwelling\" as \"any enclosed space which is wholly or partly used or intended to be used for living or sleeping by human occupants....\"  Id. at &#167; 45-24.3-5.  Because the basement, which was off limits to tenants, does not fit the definition of a dwelling space, the Occupancy Code is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Providence Housing Ordinance applies to all buildings, irrespective of when they were built.  Drohan claims that defendants violated section 13-155 of this code.  See Providence, R.I., Code of Municipal Ordinances, ch. 13, &#167; 155 (requiring proper lighting for common stairways).  Section 13-155, however, only applies to \"common stairways.\"   See id.   The Rhode Island Supreme Court has defined a common area, in another context, as a portion of the premises which is controlled by the landlord and used in common by the tenants.  See Gormley v. Vartian, 121 R.I. 770, 403 A.2d 256, 261 (1979) (discussing a landlord's duty to maintain common areas).  In this case, the basement stairway was not used in common by the tenants, and therefore is not governed by section 13-155.  Similarly, Drohan's claim that section 13-185 of the Providence Housing Ordinance applies to the basement stairway is also incorrect.  See Providence, R.I., Code of Municipal Ordinances, ch. 13, &#167; 185 (stating that every stairway shall be kept in good repair).  Section 13185 is a section of Article IX, which applies only to dwellings or dwelling units.  See id. at ch. 13, &#167; 182 (\"Compliance with article required.  No person shall occupy as owner-occupant or permit to be occupied by another, any dwelling or dwelling unit which does not comply with the following requirements of this article.\").  The Providence Housing Ordinance defines \"dwelling\" as \"any building or part thereof which is wholly or partly used or intended to be used for living and sleeping by one or more occupants\" and \"dwelling unit\" as \"any room or group of rooms within a dwelling and forming a single and separate habitable unit.\"  Id. at ch. 13, &#167; 1. Thus, section 13-185 appears to be inapplicable to a non-dwelling space such as the basement in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because none of the building codes applies to the basement of the Marcello Street property, the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence related to the codes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered and rejected Drohan's remaining arguments, which we find to be entirely unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Jennings, 461 A.2d 361 (R.I.1983) and Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990).\"   Inasmuch as the oblique reference to Jennings and Buie may have been intended as an objection to the use of a reasonable suspicion standard, we believe that the objection was not sufficiently specific to give the court notice as to potential errors in its instructions.  See Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 189 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[T]he grounds for objection must be stated 'distinctly' after the charge to give the judge an opportunity to correct his [or her] error.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Drohan has provided no cases that are directly on point for any of these three challenges.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 768 n. 16 (1st Cir.1996) (stating that plain error \"must be 'clear under current law' \") (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because this is a diversity case, substantive Rhode Island law applies.  There are no Rhode Island cases, however, that discuss protective sweeps performed in conjunction with the execution of search warrants.  Nor is there any contention that the Rhode Island Constitution affords broader protections against unreasonable searches and seizures in this context.  We thus look to federal law as instructive precedent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The only arguable difference between the court's instructions and the Daoust language is that the court used the phrase \"good reason\" instead of \"reasonable belief\" or \"reasonable suspicion.\"   While Drohan argues on appeal that this difference is dispositive, see supra at ----, he did not object to the use of this specific wording at trial.  Therefore, he failed to object properly to the \"good reason\" language.  See Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.1997) (\"Failure to object with the requisite particularity forfeits review under the 'harmless error' rule.\")  (emphasis omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Drohan did make a pre-trial \"motion in limine,\" seeking to strike the defenses on these grounds, but the motion was insufficient to preserve his objections on appeal.  Cf. Eastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., Inc., 40 F.3d 492, 497 (1st Cir.1994) (stating that after the denial of a summary judgment motion, the moving party must make a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence in order to preserve the issue for review);  Wilson, 150 F.3d at 6 (\"[I]t is an ironclad rule in this circuit that failure to renew objections after the charge constitutes waiver of any claim of error.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Once again, Drohan provides no cases that are directly on point.  He argues that a police officer acting in the course of his duties can never be a trespasser, but fails to provide any cases that extend such protection to officers who are arguably exceeding the scope of their duties.  Similarly, he argues that because defendants were not the targets of the search warrant, they have no standing to challenge a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from the execution of the warrant.  Drohan can point to no civil case, however, where a landlord is precluded from using a search warrant to show that an officer exceeded authorization and was trespassing on his property</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In discussing the interrogatory, Drohan also repeats the same objections that he made to the verbal jury instructions.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1994, Drohan, a detective with the Special Investigations Bureau of the Providence Police Department, assisted in the execution of a search warrant at 10 Marcello Street, a three-story apartment building owned by Norton and maintained by her husband Vaughn.  The warrant authorized a search of the first floor apartment, as well as of the persons of Louis E. Luciano and JoAnna Caraballo, two suspected drug dealers who rented the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Drohan, he was approximately the fourth officer to enter the premises through a side door, which led into a narrow hallway.  The first floor apartment door was located off the hallway, and to the immediate left, about five feet away, was another door leading to the basement of the building.  Drohan testified that the door to the basement was open, though he did not know how or when it had been opened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers did a sweep of the first floor apartment, but did not find the suspects.  Drohan testified that he heard a noise coming from the direction of the basement and that he followed two other detectives through the basement door and down the steps in the belief that the suspects might have been hiding down there.  The steps, which were unlighted and without a handrail, had cracked treads.  Drohan stated that, as he was descending the stairway, one of the steps \"let go\" and \"lurched forward.\"   Drohan fell and injured his leg.  There was no one found in the basement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vaughn testified that the basement was off limits to tenants.  There was no testimony indicating that Vaughn had difficulties keeping tenants out of the basement after he installed the lock on the basement door, which he did shortly after he bought the property.  Although he always kept the basement door locked, he stated that he could not swear that the door was locked on that day.  Upon inspection after the raid, the lock to the basement door was found broken, with the catch on the floor.  There was no other damage to the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a four-day trial, the court instructed the jury concerning, inter alia, what circumstances would constitute lawful authorization for Drohan to be in the basement.  The court stated that if Drohan were not lawfully authorized to enter the basement, the jury must return a verdict for defendants, because a landowner's only duty to a trespasser is to refrain from causing him wanton or willful injury, and that there was no evidence that this injury was wanton or willful.  In response to a special interrogatory, the jury found that Drohan was a trespasser, and returned a verdict for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Drohan challenges, on several different grounds, the court's jury instructions, special interrogatory form, and refusal to admit certain evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p>A. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan first objects to the jury instructions regarding his authorization to be in the basement stairway.  The court gave, in relevant part, the following instructions regarding Drohan's authorization:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he warrant did not authorize the Plaintiff to enter or search any other part of the building [other than the first floor apartment], nor did it authorize the Plaintiff to enter any other part of the building for the purpose of finding the two individuals named in the warrant in order to search them.  If in the course of searching the first-floor apartment, the individuals had been discovered, then the warrant would have permitted the police officers to search those individuals, but it did not authorize the police to go throughout the entire building in order to find those persons in order to search them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, ... notwithstanding the fact that the warrant didn't specifically authorize it, the Plaintiff would have been lawfully authorized to enter the basement stairway, if he had good reason to believe that there were individuals hiding in the basement, whose presence created a risk of harm to him or to others, and that entering the basement was necessary in order to protect against that risk of harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to establish that, the Plaintiff must point to specific facts justifying such a belief.  It isn't enough for counsel to simply argue in the abstract that this kind of thing is commonly done or should be done....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan argues that these instructions were erroneous in the following respects:  (1) the warrant authorized Drohan to search for the suspects anywhere on the premises;  (2) regardless of the scope of the warrant, Drohan had an absolute right to sweep the basement without reasonable suspicion;  (3) even if a sweep of the basement required reasonable suspicion, the court's charge that Drohan had to have a \"good reason\" set a higher standard than reasonable suspicion;  and (4) the court did not use or define the term \"protective sweep\" in giving this charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first three objections were not raised after the jury was charged and before it retired to deliberate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 states that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict....\"  See also Putnam Resources v.

Therefore, the alleged error, if any, would be harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. The Trespasser and Scope of the Warrant Defenses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claiming that defendants based their trespasser and scope of the warrant defenses upon faulty legal theories, Drohan argues that the court should have precluded defendants from presenting these defenses.  Because Drohan did not move for judgment as a matter of law, his arguments amount to a challenge of the court's decision to instruct the jury:  Drohan contends that the court should never have presented these issues to the jury in its instructions and special interrogatory form.  Drohan did not, however, object to the court's instructions or interrogatory form on these bases.  Therefore, again, we review for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Drohan has not met his burden of showing that the alleged errors resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  Indeed, Drohan has not even demonstrated that there were any clear or obvious errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Accordingly, we find no plain error in the presentation of these defenses to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Special Interrogatory Form</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan contends that the special interrogatory form improperly asked the jury to reach a legal conclusion as to Drohan's authorization to enter the basement.  Drohan argues that the court should instead have asked the jury to determine the existence of \"duty triggering facts\" (such as whether the basement door was open), and then decided as a matter of law the ultimate issue of whether Drohan was a trespasser.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The form read, in pertinent part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>Question 1. When the plaintiff entered the stairway leading to the basement was he:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">_____ A lawful entrant who was authorized to enter the stairway or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">_____ A trespasser who was not authorized to enter the stairway?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If your answer is that he was a trespasser, do not answer any further questions and return a verdict in favor of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if he had any objections to this form, Drohan's counsel stated:  \"Yes.  The only question we had was the separation of the status as to whether or not the Officer was a trespasser being separated from the other issues in the case....  We would object to the separation of question number one from other general issues in the case.\"   Because Drohan did not object to the status question being decided by the jury or to the wording of the question, we review the special interrogatory for plain error only.  See Phav v. Trueblood, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548929\"><a href=\"/opinion/548929/chat-phav-v-trueblood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir.1990) (Rule 51 applies to special interrogatories as well as to verbal instructions).  As there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's decision, any error in having the jury, rather than the court, decide the trespasser issue is hardly a \"miscarriage of justice\" or a violation of \"the integrity of the judicial process.\"  Wilson, 150 F.3d at 6-7.   We therefore decline to find plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Testimony Regarding the Protective Sweep</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan complains that he was not permitted, on direct examination, to testify as to his subjective understanding of the purpose of a protective sweep.  We review the exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.  See Bates v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195790\"><a href=\"/opinion/195790/bates-v-shearson-lehman/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.1994).  We are not convinced that Drohan's testimony would have been relevant to the jury's deliberation.  Drohan's subjective understanding of his authority to search the cellar has little correlation to his actual authority.  Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in excluding this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Housing Codes Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drohan argues that, even given a finding that he was a trespasser, he still could have been the subject of wanton or willful injury, and therefore entitled to relief.  He contends that the court improperly excluded the evidence that would have shown that defendants' behavior was wanton or willful.  We review the exclusion of this evidence for abuse of discretion.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bolster his contention that the injury was wanton or willful, Drohan sought to introduce information about three housing codes--the Rhode Island State Building Code (the \"State Building Code\"), the Rhode Island Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code (the \"Occupancy Code\"), and the Providence Minimum Standards Housing Ordinance (the \"Providence Housing Ordinance\")--into evidence.  More importantly, he sought on direct examination to question Vaughn about his knowledge of these codes and whether he knowingly violated them.  Drohan claims that if he could have shown that Vaughn knowingly violated the codes, Vaughn's behavior could have been construed as wanton or willful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Drohan could have shown a violation of the codes, we doubt that such a violation, standing alone, would be enough to show wanton or willful injury.  But, at any rate, the district court's determination that the codes were inapplicable to the basement of the 10 Marcello Street building is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State Building Code is only applicable to structures built after 1977, see R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 23-27.3-105.1, or to buildings which have been significantly altered since 1977, see id. at &#167; 23-27.3-106.1--106.4.  Drohan claims that the post-1977 conversion of the building from a two-apartment to a three-apartment building qualified the building under this statute.  He suggests that any \"change in use\" to a property makes the building subject to the code, citing section 23-27.3-105.2.  He misreads section 23-27.3-105.2, which only states that if a change in use makes the building subject to the code, certain procedures must be followed.  See id. at &#167; 23-27.3-105.2 (\"It shall be unlawful to make any change in the use or occupancy of any structure or part thereof which would subject it to provision of this code without the approval of the building officials ....\") (emphasis added).  Sections 23-27.3-106.1--106.4 dictate when a change makes a building subject to the code, and those sections distinctly state that an alteration must cost a certain percentage of the building's value in order to trigger the code's requirements for new structures.  See, e.g., id. at &#167; 23-27.3-106.1 (applying the code's requirements to any building in which alterations in excess of fifty percent of the physical value of the building have been made).  Drohan provided no evidence that the alterations to the Marcello Street building cost a significant enough percentage of the building's value to trigger the State Building Code's requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Occupancy Code does apply to buildings erected before 1977, its provisions only relate to the portions of a building used or intended to be used for the purposes of a dwelling.  See id. at &#167; 45-24.3-4 (\"Applicability.--(a) Every portion of a building or its premises used or intended to be used for the purpose of dwelling, living, eating, sleeping, or cooking therein, or occupancy, shall comply with the provisions of this chapter....\").  The Occupancy Code defines \"dwelling\" as \"any enclosed space which is wholly or partly used or intended to be used for living or sleeping by human occupants....\"  Id. at &#167; 45-24.3-5.  Because the basement, which was off limits to tenants, does not fit the definition of a dwelling space, the Occupancy Code is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Providence Housing Ordinance applies to all buildings, irrespective of when they were built.  Drohan claims that defendants violated section 13-155 of this code.  See Providence, R.I., Code of Municipal Ordinances, ch. 13, &#167; 155 (requiring proper lighting for common stairways).  Section 13-155, however, only applies to \"common stairways.\"   See id.   The Rhode Island Supreme Court has defined a common area, in another context, as a portion of the premises which is controlled by the landlord and used in common by the tenants.  See Gormley v. Vartian, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2055040\"><a href=\"/opinion/2055040/gormley-v-vartian/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 261 (1979) (discussing a landlord's duty to maintain common areas).  In this case, the basement stairway was not used in common by the tenants, and therefore is not governed by section 13-155.  Similarly, Drohan's claim that section 13-185 of the Providence Housing Ordinance applies to the basement stairway is also incorrect.  See Providence, R.I., Code of Municipal Ordinances, ch. 13, &#167; 185 (stating that every stairway shall be kept in good repair).  Section 13185 is a section of Article IX, which applies only to dwellings or dwelling units.  See id. at ch. 13, &#167; 182 (\"Compliance with article required.  No person shall occupy as owner-occupant or permit to be occupied by another, any dwelling or dwelling unit which does not comply with the following requirements of this article.\").  The Providence Housing Ordinance defines \"dwelling\" as \"any building or part thereof which is wholly or partly used or intended to be used for living and sleeping by one or more occupants\" and \"dwelling unit\" as \"any room or group of rooms within a dwelling and forming a single and separate habitable unit.\"  Id. at ch. 13, &#167; 1. Thus, section 13-185 appears to be inapplicable to a non-dwelling space such as the basement in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because none of the building codes applies to the basement of the Marcello Street property, the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence related to the codes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered and rejected Drohan's remaining arguments, which we find to be entirely unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Caribbean Petroleum Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196628\"><a href=\"/opinion/196628/coastal-fuels-of-pr-v-caribbean-petroleum/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 189 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[T]he grounds for objection must be stated 'distinctly' after the charge to give the judge an opportunity to correct his [or her] error.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Drohan has provided no cases that are directly on point for any of these three challenges.

Therefore, he failed to object properly to the \"good reason\" language.  See Play Time, Inc. v.

Similarly, he argues that because defendants were not the targets of the search warrant, they have no standing to challenge a Fourth Amendment violation resulting from the execution of the warrant.
